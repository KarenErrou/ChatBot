	schema:headline " a lovely old fashioned film";
	schema:reviewBody "First let's understand what kind of film this is. It is a movie about old fashioned values and the people who held them. You will not see much action sex or blood in this film. It is silent not of the best quality it is old and in black and white. However if none of that bothers you particularly you will find that it is a sincere film exciting in its own way and one that rings deep and true in a way that films seldom do.The acting is particularly good. One reviewer here said to watch it for the stars and that is certainly a good reason to watch it. Bobby Harron does a wonderful job of playing a sincere and naive young man who is fooled by a week and superficial woman. He has an extremely sensitive face and when you look at him you seem to be able to see into his very soul.Lillian Gish plays the shy plain and simple girl who loves him. In her scenes with Harron they had a chemistry which fills the screen. She starts out as plain girl but about half way through the film she starts to look pretty. It is a gradual transformation and she pulls it off remarkably well gradually accenting her better features and holding her body more gracefully. She also seems to grow as a person in the film. She starts out as an awkward child living in a fantasy world where she imagines that she is loved more than she actually is. As the film progresses she learns to face reality to learn how to look pretty and act gracefully without changing who she is. None of this is accomplished in any great dramatic way. It is accomplished the way these things are often done in real life quietly by small incidents which are important to the person but not that important to anyone else. But when these incidents occur you see a slight physical change on the surface but somehow she also shows you a dramatic change deep inside her whole being. How she accomplishes this is a mystery to me and one of the miracles of acting. At one time Lillian remarked that Virgins are the hardest roles to play. those dear little girls  to make them interesting takes great vitality but a fallen woman or a vamp!75 per cent of your work is already done. Lilian played all three virgins vamps and fallen women  and played them well. Here she plays perhaps her most difficult virgin. A girl who has nothing extraordinary to distinguish her except her quiet love for Robert. Well remarkably enough she makes the role interesting and sympathetic. I don't know an actress today who could do it.As good a Lilian is she nearly has the film stolen from her by Clarine Seymour who plays the the vamp in this film. Well perhaps 75 of her work is already done but she supplies the other 25 with great enthusiasm. She never makes the mistake of making her character hateful. That would make the character too one dimensional. She shows us instead a charming woman who is too week to resist temptation and too cowardly to tell the truth. Thus she ruins her own life and nearly all the lives around her. You hate her for her weakness but you love her for her charm and beauty. She walks that tightrope between charm and evil perfectly. Aside from the acting there are other things to like about this forgotten gem. The camera work by Bitzer is almost beyond belief when you consider when it was done. He could create moods with the camera that make you think he was inside the actors thoughts.Let us also remember the director. Griffith was a director that worked in concepts. In a film like this where he was using his best actors and crew he would not tell them how to play it. He would give them the concept he wanted and let them create it. If he didn't like what they did he would go over it again and they would try again. By doing this he filled the set with the atmosphere of the film and everyone was attune to it. This shows in the film and the way the tension builds between characters as their lives play out. A palpable universe is created here. If what Lillian said about virgins is true the same can be said about a film that tries to portray simple honest values. The film succeeds in doing this very well. If you enjoy this kind of film then I would seek this one out it is really remarkable.When I first wrote this comment there were no commercially available copies of this film on DVD. Since then it has been issued in an excellent version. Highly recommended for film buffs and people who appreciate real things.".

He was a handsome young fellow who definitely makes an impression in this film. Lillian Gish's character is almost too longsuffering to be believed but somehow she makes it work through little flashes of humor and tenderness. My favorite scene she takes the minister's wife into bed with her to save her from being locked out of her home on a frigid cold rainy night. As the wife sleeps Lillian in love with the husband herself clenches her hand into a fist and for a moment considers pummeling her rival but instead the pure love of her heart wins out and she reaches out for the sleeping wife and hugs her close caressing her. Watch True Heart Susie to see its stars shine. The story is simple but it will capture your attention immediately and give you a chance to see yet another classy silent film with heart.".

Well Susie the socalled plain girl played by Lillian Gish and William Robert Harron are two country teens who seem to be best pals having a small little romance as she walks home from school with him and he carves their initials on a tree  seems sweet right? But then again she pretty much trails behind him as they walk like his shadow and he pretty much pulls away as they start to kiss bashful or just not interested  it's hard to tell.

Clarine Seymour who plays Bettina is really excellent in this film  she completely brings her character to life and even manages to make what appears to be a manstealing homewrecker into a sympathetic character.

The art direction and camerawork nicely captures the rural setting and youthful faces of the stars. The Kino DVD of this film features a clear tinted print that looks great  the music is a nicely done score by the Mont Alto orchestra featuring contemporary tunes which completely suits this film.

Well Susie the socalled plain girl played by Lillian Gish and William Robert Harron are two country teens who seem to be best pals having a small little romance as she walks home from school with him and he carves their initials on a tree  seems sweet right? But then again she pretty much trails behind him as they walk like his shadow and he pretty much pulls away as they start to kiss bashful or just not interested  it's hard to tell.

	schema:reviewBody "True Heart Susie was one of my favorite silent films that I watched during my class. This cute love story follows the lives of William and Susie. By the end of the film I found myself loving Lillian Gish's character Susie. She sacrifices a lot in order to win William's heart over. I thought that Lillian Gish did a fabulous job throughout the entire movie. In the beginning of the film Susie Lillian Gish tried to kiss William Robert Harron in a number of scenes and both characters did a wonderful job at creating awkward moments. I thought they did a fabulous job at making the audience feel uncomfortable as we watched Susie repeatedly getting denied by William. Griffith did a wonderful job at capturing Susie's emotion throughout the movie. The close up shots that were taken really enhanced emotion throughout the film and I found myself feeling genuinely sorry for her. During the movie we hope and expect that Susie and William end up together but when William meets Betty our prediction of the movie changes. The movie ends rather dramatically and unexpectedly which I favored because we always assume that endings are happy. This was the only silent film that I have watched where I felt connected to one of the characters. Lillian Gish did such a good job at grabbing the audiences attention through her facial expressions that I found myself hating Betty and feeling extremely sad when her and William got married. I don't think Griffith could have chosen a better actress to play Susie. I would definitely recommend watching this movie just to see Gish's performance. Griffith did a fabulous job at making this a sweet yet unexpected love story that captured my attention fabulously. If you're going to watch a silent film I would definitely say that this is the one to watch!".

	schema:headline " Sentimental Impressions";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a gem among the smaller productions from D.W. Griffith's oeuvre. It's similar to A Romance of Happy Valley also a comingofage romance set in the countryside which Griffith made with the same costars and released earlier in 1919. Griffith often turned to rural romance and such sentimental melodramas for his films. In this one Lillian Gish is again selfsacrificing pitiful and supposedly plain in appearance while Robert Harron goes to the city to make goodthis time to college to become his hometown's preacher. Gish and Harron had these roles down pat and their translations from awkward teenagers to adulthood is especially impressive here accomplished with costume changes and a mustache for Harron but mostly just by their convincing performances. The film doesn't specifically address how much time the narrative covers but it seems to be years so there is considerable character development. In addition to Gish and Harron Clarine Seymour is good in the part of a flapper who steals Harron away from Gish.Thanks to the quality Image Entertainment  Film Preservation Associates release G.W. Bitzer's lovely photography is now more apparent. One slight criticism here that I have is the odd use of soft focus in a few places such as in a couple long shots and for one closeup of Harron which blur his image otherwise it's a fine technique which Bitzer and camera operator Karl Brown had learned from Hendrik Sartov in making Broken Blossoms another GriffithGish film made and released earlier in 1919 clearly 1919 was a great year for this team artistically. Similarly the film's pace and editing are commendable including interloping the various paths of the characters and one particularly good match cut where Gish walks from her field cut to her walking in her house. Yet some of the editing appears jumpy in places although some of that could be due to missing frames and there's a brief continuity error during the shot where Seymour is trying to get inside her house during a rainstormthe door is locked yet we briefly see her push the door open. Such slight sloppiness in filmmaking doesn't distract much though. Title cards are a bit too much here in frequency and storytelling e.g. why call the characters idiots? something that's a problem in other Griffith films too. To finish my listing on the technical aspects of True Heart Susie it also features a wellconstructed rainstorm which seems to be an early and good example of one created artificially with heavy rain lightning effects and good continuity.True Heart Susie is one of Griffith's better films it treads familiar territory but is better constructed and developed narratively and technically. Its real genius however is the acting which makes this one especially sentimentally affecting. Gish is exceptionally brilliant it seems that any film she's in will be worth watching at least just for her part.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was part of a group of Griffith's rural romances also A Romance of Happy Valley The Great Love. At this time in his career after Intolerance Griffith was trying to recoup financially his debt and bank loan entrapment had already begun so he begun filming a series of less ambitious but lyrical little films about his boyhood in Kentucky. Ever the showman he tried to add stature to these smaller films with wordy pretentious titles. True Heart Susie opens with a title that proclaims every incident in it is taken from life  Charles Dickens would be surprised as True Heart Susie is a mixture of Great Expectations and David Copperfield  and goes on to dedicate itself to All the Women of the World who wait for the Great Love that Never Comes!!Susie Gish has an unrequited love for William Harron who only half heartedly returns her friendship. She is secretly scrimping and saving to put him through college but he mistakenly thinks his benefactor is a stranger who once passed through their village and promised to help. Susie even sells her beloved cow Daisy to start William on his way.Insufferable William comes home from college sporting a moustache and none the wiser about who his benefactor was. He sternly tells Susie men flirt with painted girls but always marry plain ones  if only he practiced what he preached. Of course he is fair game for Bettina the little milliner from Chicago who believes thoroughly in paint powder and tight skirts. She was played by bewitching Clarine Seymour and steals the movie in my opinion. Clarine gave the film some much needed vivacity. She wasn't a typical Griffith idealization of southern womanhood being very Clara Bow like and who knows what type of career she would have had if she had lived. Even at this stage Griffith was heavily promoting his young protg Carol Dempster as a logical successor to Lillian Gish even though she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and would almost destroy his reputation with her inept and wooden performances. In this movie she has a definite extra part as Bettina's fun loving friend.How does William come to have this fascination over women  perhaps he is the only marriageable man in town!! It is clear he is putty in Bettina's hands and to her he is only a punk minister but as her money is gone she must marry someone. Marriage isn't the bliss that William imagined it to be. Bettina is a shrew who flies into rages and break plates slipshod continuity she picks up a plain plate but the plate that is broken on the floor is a Willow pattern  a real contrast when they have Sunday dinner at Susie's and William has his first decent meal since before his marriage. Bettina certainly finds married life a drag and when she sneaks out to a party and is caught in the rain she loses her keys and is forced to seek shelter at Susie's.I agree the strength of the film is in it's performers Lillian Gish's Susie seems so innocent and trusting that William's slighting of her gains him little audience sympathy. Robert Harron's metamorphosis when he returns from college shows what a mature and subtle actor he could be. Gone is the gawkiness and it is a tribute to his acting that in my opinion when he marries Bettina he starts to engage audience sympathy. The lovely lyricalness continues almost to the end when a closing title hopes they will be happy and asks the audience to imagine Susie and William looking back to their earlier innocent years.".

In the film Susie Lillian Gish and William Robert Harron are the best of friends but both have other feelings but he doesn't quite get it. William is too poor to go to college so Susie keeping it a secret from him sells her beloved cow Daisy so that he can go. When William returns Susie hopes that he will marry her but a city girl Clarine Seymour moves in on him. Will William see his faults and learn who sent him to college before it's too late? Griffith owed a lot of people money so he rushed this film into production so he could get it into theaters as quick as he could. The final results are a sweet and lighthearted film but certainly not one of the director's classics. The best thing to the film are the performances by the three leads with Gish stealing the show with her terrific facial gestures which can display any sort of emotion. Seymour is also very good in her role and Griffith's lover Carol Dempster is also on hand. The film is overflowing with Griffith's Southern values of working women and also his hatred of high class women which is certainly a fault in the film as the city girl is shown pretty one dimensional. With the drama also comes some nice quiet moments like the one where Susie and William want to kiss but he's too scared to go ahead with it.".

Susie loves William Robert Harron but he doesn't fully commit himself to her. Susie makes sacrifices so that William can go to college and become successful. He comes back to town as a minister and Susie expects that they will marry but Bettina a vibrant and modern city girl Clarine Seymour sets her sights on the hapless William.TRUE HEART SUSIE is a quite charming film a portrait of a different era with different values. Susie typifies domesticity constancy and self sacrifice simple country values. Bettina and her friends the paint and powder brigade represent the city life  fastpaced and artificial enticing men with suggestive clothing and heavy use of makeup to emphasize the physical and superficial. Susie becomes insecure because of her appearance and determines to entice William with the same paint and powder and flashy dress as Bettina and her aunt says that she looks like a Jezebel! So Susie changes her clothes and goes back to her normal simple look. It's pretty obvious which side will win out in the end but William and Bettina's marriage proves an unexpected roadblock for Susie. Griffith could lay it on thick with his title cards in many films driving home the moral of the story with sledgehammer force but in this film he is comparatively restrained.Lillian Gish again shows her acting prowess as Susie a simple girl who shows herself to be very resourceful and selfsacrificing. Gish was one of the great screen beauties of her time but she is quite convincing as the plain heroine. Gish is superbly expressive nuanced and naturalistic the only off moment being a bit of jumpiness that Griffith liked to induce in his leading ladies for some very strange reason. Robert Harron is also quite good as William who is oblivious at first to Susie's affections but then comes to realize his mistakes. Clarine Seymour is charismatic as the scheming Bettina full of energy and mischief. Future Griffith leading lady Carol Dempster is effective in a small but important role as Bettina's best friend.Longtime Griffith cinematographer Billy Bitzer again shows his mastery of the camera. The film has a warm tranquil feel throughout taking advantage of the beautiful country scenery and using different tints for day night and indoor and outdoor scenes. Overall TRUE HEART SUSIE is a charming film a small film in Griffith's repertoire but in its modest way one of his most artistically successful. It features fine acting a moving story and it's lovely to look at. SCORE 910".

There was once a time in society where the belief was that things had to be done strictly by the book and if you did them any other way then you were wrong. This belief system was not only for one part of life but for all. There was a strict way for church's to operate people to dress families to conduct business and also for people to interact with each other and if you did any of these differently than the norm then you were out of order. This was not the time to be different in society it was a time to conform to traditionalism. Susie was as true to the traditional ways as the needle to the pole. Susie allows her traditional ways to keep her from getting the man that she longed for from childhood. She was never willing to tell him what she truly wanted to neither through actions nor words while other girls did. Susie sat on the sideline and watched as other women robbed her of the stock she had invested so much in. Susie was so caught in tradition and being nice that it was too a fault. In the end it hurt her more than it helped. One thing I noticed was that Susie was more loyal to her mother than she was to her own desires and that loyalty cost her many years of happiness. Susie eventually married the man of her dreams but it was well into her later years of life and she could never be as happy as she could have been had she gone with her gut feeling and told the young man how she felt.

In this film it is a love story between a little boy and little girl who grow up together this love story has a little of a spin to it. Most love stories it takes a little for them to both realize they love each other and for them to end up together. Well in True Heart Susie Susie is in love with William who has no clue that she has those feelings for him although she makes it as obvious as possible for him to actually understand her feelings he still does not understand. Well William tries going to college but doesn't have the funding to be able to get into college Susie finds out this information and sales her beloved cow that was passed to her from her mother as she died this cow had great meaning to Susie but she sold it to get money for William to be able to go to college. William gets into college and moves away when he returns from college he has finally been educated but when William returns from his college life he comes back with a new women he is married to named Betty Hopkins who is only marrying him for his money and has affairs with him behind his back. Susie catches Betty but loves William so much she can't tell him and therefore keeps her mouth shut until one night Betty lies to William and leaves the house to go party. She didn't realize she lost her house key and was locked out in the rain and nasty weather for hours until she went to Susie's later on she would catch pneumonia. After Betty passes away Susie's aunt finally explains everything to William who then marries Susie. The way this movie catches you isn't only through the love story drams but how you can follow Susie's emotions like you can almost feel what she is feeling that is what makes True Heart Susie Significant silent film.".

This film starts when the two are still in school and in their adolescent years and follows their story into adulthood. Susie proves to be anything other than just the plain girl when she goes above and beyond to make William her true love reach his happiness. This movie is very entertaining combining romance and drama so that the audience is left in suspense and eager to find out if and when Susie and William will somehow end up together in the end. From the eyes of someone who has grown up with the latest technology and special effect films True Heart Susie is a film that was able to capture my attention and hold onto it until the very end of this 87 minute long film. Despite it being a silent film the cast of True Heart Susie was able to convey true emotions through their actions and facial expressions so that the audience can easily understand and interpret what the characters are thinking and filming. True Heart Susie is not a color film however because of tinting is not black and white. Tinted print is used to show the time place and mood in this film. Orange tint is used whenever the setting is indoors or to show that it is daytime. Blue tint is used to express that it is nighttime. The art direction and editing are great. The famous D.W.

Like most cases in life a girl loves a boy but that boy doesn't know or pay attention to it. This film is no different from that. As well as another girl who tries to steal the guy away sounds pretty close to our life today. But one difference the girl wont say anything about how she feels about him and the other girl succeeds for the most part on stealing him from her. But from the start of this film she believes in him such as how most women today believe in their husband or boyfriend but True Heart Susie shows why she has True Heart in her name when she sacrifices much of her own happiness to help him succeed in what he wants. This film was filmed with some scenes that are more normal back then but are outrageously funny now a day. But this film was easy to keep track of and is a great film and I enjoyed it fully. I even wondered while watching this if they could possibly remake this film with sound and more modern. This film has a lot of potential of being great but there are some minor adjustments it needs but I'm sure because the lack of technology back then that's what caused it. This film has a lot of similarities to the world we live in today other than a few things. Such as a girl falling for a boy who didn't now about how she felt and ends up falling for another. But D.W. Griffith had some key components in this film that would make it successful he knew what the audiences' wanted and he gave it to them.".

	schema:reviewBody "D.W Griffith is considered the first director to implement narrative techniques to his filmmaking and True Heart Susie is a great example of this. While I wasn't immediately impressed I found that as the movie progressed I connected with the characters more and more. Susie is a plain girl with completely honorable intentions who falls in love with William. Lillian Gish does remarkable job acting for film. Her facial expressions are not too over produced but it is easy to read her thoughts from a simple arch of her eyebrow. Griffith is definitely making a social statement on oldfashioned values. Susie is a pure character and the film really remains honest throughout. For a silent film it really kept my attention. The thing I really loved was the character Clarine Seymour played because I think her acting along with Lilian Gish's was a real testament to the time. Seymour's character is not meant to be hated and she does a lovely job pulling off the vampy personality without losing the viewer completely. Also since I was watching this for a film history class it was a nice departure to see more subtle acting. This is not similar to Birth of a Nation at all so if you are looking for a more epic film by Griffith this is not it. True Heart Susie is an intimate honest journey of a young girl whose values are tested in serious ways. No matter what statement D.W Griffith was trying to make with this film he made it enjoyable to watch.".

Susie is a plain girl with completely honorable intentions who falls in love with William. Lillian Gish does remarkable job acting for film. Her facial expressions are not too over produced but it is easy to read her thoughts from a simple arch of her eyebrow. Griffith is definitely making a social statement on oldfashioned values. Susie is a pure character and the film really remains honest throughout. For a silent film it really kept my attention. The thing I really loved was the character Clarine Seymour played because I think her acting along with Lilian Gish's was a real testament to the time. Seymour's character is not meant to be hated and she does a lovely job pulling off the vampy personality without losing the viewer completely. Also since I was watching this for a film history class it was a nice departure to see more subtle acting. This is not similar to Birth of a Nation at all so if you are looking for a more epic film by Griffith this is not it. True Heart Susie is an intimate honest journey of a young girl whose values are tested in serious ways. No matter what statement D.W Griffith was trying to make with this film he made it enjoyable to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "True Heart Susie is one of the most beautifully crafted early silent films. It does not put so much emphasis on the story but rather the formation of the characters. The story begins with Susie being obviously infatuated with a young man named William Jenkins but he is clueless to her deep feelings. She keeps her love for him discreet while she pays for his college tuition. He leaves town leaving Susie upset. When he returns William marries another woman named Betty Hopkins. Betty is high maintenance and mean and after awhile becomes very difficult for William to live with. William is a very clueless guy and is portrayed as an innocent boy whose intentions are not to hurt anybody. But Susie becomes totally heartbroken. The film focuses on Susie's upclose facial expressions. This was the first time in film that the up close shots were really utilized for film. Small nonverbals were a key to telling not just the story but rather the emotion of Susie's onesided romance. An example of this is when Susie kicks up her foot out of disappointment when she is walking with William. Also when she is overhearing people talk and she is outside the door the camera zooms in on her face and she gives a series of very descriptive quick facial movements that indicate surprise distress and disappointment. After many days of being love sick and agonizing over her lost love Susie's aunt can no longer take her pain and decided to help Susie. She tells William how Susie paid for his education and how she has loved him for a long time. William becomes so overwhelmed with emotion he then takes her in his arms and promises her forever.".

I was amazed by how much I and the audience became involved with this simple but hilarious silent movie. The plot is centered on a girl and boy who are childhood friends but the girl has a crush on the boy and falls deeply in love with him without the boy ever noticing. The boy goes to college and surprises the girl in many ways. Some of the surprises actually break her heart but she amazingly continues to keep her love for her childhood friend. I found the acting superb especially Lillian Gish the girl in love with her childhood friend. Her face was similar to looking at a porcelain doll through the entire movie and although the film was completely silent I could still form a tear as I watched her heart break. I found this film very translucent in the fact that it can easily relate to many people at one point in their life. I thought the close up of Lillian Gish was a phenomenal move by D. W. Griffith. I also felt that her acting was the best throughout the movie. The film spotlighted simplicity by the acting and by the props used. It was very easy to follow unlike some other silent movies of this time and had a great message of never give up on love. I was very happy with the ending of this film it was almost like watching a fairytale such as 'Cinderella' but in the early 1900s. This movie had more comedy than heartfelt love story action which I think many guys would prefer. Overall this movie is a great piece of work by Griffith and recommended for any audience.".

While Griffith's The Birth of A Nation or Intolerance are more well known True Heart Susie is definitely much easier to follow and much less controversial than his other films. The alternate name The story of a plain girl is an apt description. While many would argue that there are few plain facets of Lilian Gish's image her acting is revolutionary in its subtle and muted nature. Prior to Gish most actors and actresses acted on a much more grand scale in terms of expressions thus the stereotype of dramatic faces and actions in silent film as if every moment was pivotal and life changing. If given a chance this is a very stomachable silent film and will be endearing if you are a willing audience. The story is one of unrequited love as Susie is passed over by the object of her affections for a more outgoing girl. Susie is very much the good girl character even taking in the untrue woman who is married to the man she loves and caring for her when she is sick although bitterly. The plot gently reminds me of Gone With the Wind but only very gently. Susie is not as successfully independent as Scarlett O'Hara but this film is from a different time. Susie in today's terms would perhaps be the antifeminist as a hopeless romantic who's motivations are mainly rooted in the happiness of a man however in the context of the very early 1900's Susie is as much of an independent woman as Scarlett would have been. Susie can fend for herself and although the world in the movie see's her as plain the audience can see that she is full of natural beauty.".

Even though he suspected her of foul play and was starting to discover that he really loved Susie to end it with her would have been scandalous. Now days in a movie he would probably discover her in the act of cheating and divorce her. One of the most interesting things about this movie to me was the title cards. I didn't realize this until after the movie was over and we were discussing it in class the next day but an explanation for the title cards being the way they were was that they were describing the characters from their own perspectives. So when it calls Susie plain that is because that is how Susie sees herself. Another example of this was when the title describes Bettina as a little unfaithful. During the movie I was a little confused by this because the whole movie had been portraying Bettina as an evil harlot and then all of the sudden she is just a little unfaithful. The explanation that the title card is her image of herself makes a lot more sense.

	schema:reviewBody "About 2 months after obtaining this title I've not been able to find words to describe this movie other than strange and bizarre. Depending on your mood it's either a noble failure or a triumph in film making. I couldn't use the terms ground breaking to describe it but there's something important about the texture of this film.Imagine John Hughes and Sam Raimi kicking back and doing some hard drugs and deciding to make a movie together. It might look like this. It spends a good amount of time before it gets anywhere focusing on four teen girls whose names seem to support their abilities expertise or interests. At this point it plays almost like an average teen romcom. But note the campy soundtrack dancing school girls and some rather strange almost comic book like backgrounds.It starts getting interesting as the girls set forth to movie's namesake house. They flashback and do storytelling in the form of a silent movie. We get to see some slapstick characters which don't belong in a horror movie and we have a roll call of our four heroines as they head off into the woods. Enter the House alluded to in the film's title.So the horror begins. But this is Sam Raimi style horror. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if some of this inspired Evil Dead  if the film was available  who knows. There's a whole series of odd scenes. Most notable is the infamous piano scene where a piano devours someone. But that's not all. There's an evil kitty a clock the spills out blood ala Evil Dead a river of blood and some kooky camera work and odd cut aways! Ambitious might be the operative word to describe this movie. When I watch it I'm not quite sure if it all works. The effects are crude but not in the Ed Wood you can see the strings style. For me some of it is like reading a comic book. They're bigger than life not meant to scare you in the classical sense. But it is unlike anything you've seen before.I guess if I have any gripe about the film it's that it takes a good while to get really fun but when you get there it's an insane joyride. But it's not a normal movie viewing experience and a rating does not serve it well. Watch it for yourself  and it probably wouldn't hurt to have a drink or two while doing so.".

When I watch it I'm not quite sure if it all works. The effects are crude but not in the Ed Wood you can see the strings style. For me some of it is like reading a comic book. They're bigger than life not meant to scare you in the classical sense. But it is unlike anything you've seen before.I guess if I have any gripe about the film it's that it takes a good while to get really fun but when you get there it's an insane joyride. But it's not a normal movie viewing experience and a rating does not serve it well. Watch it for yourself  and it probably wouldn't hurt to have a drink or two while doing so.";

What specific kind of horror? The kind that involves a severed head appearing and biting a girl on the butt and then rubbing up against it. Stunningly the movie only escalates from there.House is fun but it's clearly insane. An affinity for the weird and zany is a must or this will be a waste of time for you. This movie has creativity coming out of the wazoo. How many times have you seen someone viciously attacked by feather pillows and mattresses? The special effects are also great especially for the seventies. This was probably the most psychedelic movie I've ever seen.Is House a frightening movie? No. But if you have the right kind of sense of humor for it you'll have a ball getting together with likeminded friends and watching this. There's a lot of comedy of both the intentional and unintentional varieties. It's all very tonguein cheek. Even the soundtrack is hilarious if you pay attention to it.House gets a hearty recommendation from me. It's an entertaining inventive spin on the haunted house formula with a lot of uniquely Japanese craziness thrown into the mix. It's worth owning in my opinion.".

There are disembodied heads evil animated cat spirits a carnivorous piano and much more besides. The cartoonish action onscreen is accompanied by a sublime music score of which the central theme is the type to get in your head and stay put.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! Noribuki Obayashi's Hausu aka. House of 1977 is easily one of the weirdest films I ever saw and I generally generally am a fan of the bizarre. A Horrorfan and avid lover of Japanese cinema especially from the 70s I had high expectations for this film and I was not disappointed even though the film was totally different than what I had expected. Having read no reviews of the film before seeing it I expected a pure Horror film but it turned out to be an incomparably bizarre and experimental Horrorparody with a delightfully macabre and grotesque humor rather than scares. The film already starts out extremely strange in an awesome manner and it gradually gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.The film starts off with a bunch of teenage highschool girls all of whom have certain distinctive characteristics that are mentioned in their nicknames who travel to the countryside to visit the aunt of one of the girls. I don't want to spoil even a tiny bit of the plot of this unique Horrorparody and therefore won't carry with a plot description but I can assure that fans of surrealism and weird cinema will be delighted. While Hausu is not a film I would recommend to everyone this is an absolute mustsee to all my fellow fans of Japanese film the Horrorgenre and bizarre arthouse cinema. Director Obayashi uses a bizarre of editing imaginable with grotesque cutting totally insane effects. Sometimes the editing equals that of a bizarre videoclip only to jump to an entirely different style. Yet all this strangeness never draws the viewer away from the story which is itself just as surreal as the film's style. Overall Hausu can be described as a unique and bizarre fairy tale with a grotesque and ingenious often macabre and always unique sense of humor. There are moments in this film at which the viewer will just stare at the screen not knowing what to think and scenes at which one is barely able to breathe in laughter and every second of the film is very strange. Very delightfully strange that is as Hausu is a bizarre gem that must not be missed by lovers of the surreal. Mainstream audiences might not know what to think of this but every fan of a more unique form of cinema should give this a try. Surreal exceptional and one of a kind!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the directing debut for the great Nobuhiko Obayashi. He has directed commercials for television before he got into directing movies. This experience helped Obayashi learn many special effects used in TV commercials. It shows in this movie as almost every scene contains some sort of special visual effects.In the mid '70s Toho studio was looking for fresh ideas for movies that would be a box office success. They've decided to use the then relative unknown Nobuhiko Obayashi to direct a movie with fresh new approach. Many of Toho's experienced staff expressed concerns over this because Obayashi never had experience of being an assistant director. Project manager for this movie then said Us experienced directors aren't coming up with hit movies so experience is not the criteria for making a successful movie. Lets allow this young director to make a movie to see if he knows more about what the audience really wants.The original plot of this movie was written by the then 13 year old daughter of Obayashi himself.The movie has a strange career as it was rediscovered by an Asian movie affectionado who had connections with Janus films which is the parent company of the Criterion Collection after being released in Japan over 30 years ago. It then made limited showings in theaters around the U.S.. Very unusual as not too many film gets a roadshow in another country 30 years after it was made.Seven girls makes a plan to go on a vacation at one of the girl's aunts house in the country side. They don't suspect that the aunt died long time ago and what inhabits the house is the apparition of the aunt that can remain young only by devouring the bodies of others.The movie is a horror comedy with bit of erotic exploitation starring many actors who were teen idols at the time. When it was first released Miki Jinbo who played the role of Kung Fu gathered the most votes by the young male audiences as she kicked her way around the house wearing skimpy tank top and shorts.This movie is very original in almost every way. Visuals are unusual as expressed earlier that Obayashi used many of the special effects he's learned while making TV commercials. Color is also very surreal as is the acting but the movie has strange charm all its own and not boring to watch. You can almost say that this is an artistic film that's also geared to entertain the audience.In the end Toho studio got just what it was hoping to achieve  a box office smash hit. This movie also established the career of Obayashi as a bankable director. Obayashi went on to direct many other successful movies including the original Girl who leaped through time.".

By the time we get to the 'Hausu' in question dear readers and viewers it is clear that we are being directed by hypomanic drug fiends so tweaked on psychoactive hallucinogens that they've lost all concept of reality rationality and reason.

Reading back what I just wrote kinda makes the movie seem not so interesting. Seems like just another haunted house flick. But if you pop in this flick almost immediately you will realize you've never seen a film like this. Filmed in a lively colorful way mixed with a fantastic soundtrack the flick exceeds on all levels of production. Combine the production values with a children's movie feel then combine that with some blood violence and nudity you get a very different hybrid genre of a flick. Hausu is a flick that all fans of unique horror or cinema for that matter should check out.".

But if you pop in this flick almost immediately you will realize you've never seen a film like this. Filmed in a lively colorful way mixed with a fantastic soundtrack the flick exceeds on all levels of production. Combine the production values with a children's movie feel then combine that with some blood violence and nudity you get a very different hybrid genre of a flick. Hausu is a flick that all fans of unique horror or cinema for that matter should check out.";

If Dario Argento Richard Lester Vera Chytilova Seijun Suzuki and Takashi Miike conspired secretly made to remake StarWars and privately screened it for you while you were hung upside down over a tank of piranha's it would be about half as remarkable as this movie.7 Japanese school girls and stock teen movie characters who have names like Prof for the smart one Gorgeus for the prettiest one Mac for the overweight one Fantasy for the stylish one and my personal favorite KungFu...cus she knows KungFu. They are all in some sort of group together a team of some kind though I'm not sure what exactly and they need a place to train for the summer as they do every year. Gorgeous' father is getting remarried to a woman who only appears with a breeze blowing in super slow mo to the accompaniment of etheric string music and as you can imagine that slomo st all the time can get kind of irritating and she wants to get away from it all. She writes a letter to an estranged Aunt of hers that she has never met asking if her and her friends can spend the summer doing whatever it is they do. The aunt agrees and they are off.The bus trip is like a dayglo version of Willy Wonka's psychedelic boat ride only through an artificial rainbow streaked countryside.

Girls are devoured by mattresses and pillows turned to glass eaten by piano'sone of the funniest and truly most disturbing things I've ever watched attacked by severed floating heads plagued by horrible visions of banana's etc. While the phrase I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for this becomes an all purpose punchline.Hausu is horrorcomedycoming of age tale par excellence. Every scene has some kind of cinematic interjection and manipulation from the shifting color filters to deranged collage and montage of events and images to wildly eclectic animations mattes propsthe wall paper in the rooms of the house match the print on some of the girls dresses minimovies stylized as beautiful and heart felt silent films and WW2 era romances and of course whirlwind obligatory action scenes save us KungFu!. Not to mention music Gorgeous' dad is a composer he is mentioned to have auditioned for Segio Leone who said he was better than Ennio Marriconne and the spaghetti western's emphasis on music is heavy here. It's wall to wall full of eerie horror themes cartoonish comedy sections pop songs strings and sounds which are just generally unclassifiable possibly because two songs might be played at the same time or against a scene that is completely inappropriate.It occurred to me a day after I watched this movie that I had seen a film by Nobuhiko Obayashi before the campy kaleidoscopic Sadaa true story about a woman who castrated her lover and became an overnight celebrity in WW2 and though that is a mere hint of the full on onslaught of this movie it makes me want to see more. Obayashi was apparently most famous for directing Japanese game shows and it only adds to the kitchen sink showman dynamic that he brings to the table here.What is least important is plot there is so much happening in literally every scene the only other film as unrelenting in terms of visual excess is maybe Jorodowsky's The Holy Mountain maybe... that's it's easy to forget what the girls are doing at all until a cat's eyes start glowing or dolls walk around by themselves again. I've never laughed so much at a film that was so dazzling to watch. It's skyrocketed into my favorites instantly. It's like were trapped in a bmovie. An out of date of one too...

That being said however House falters in the area of story delivering an almost unbearably slow and deliberately paced haunted house fairy tale.

Or a chest of drawers that opens and closes to dance hall music? Is it fantastical? Yes definitely. Especially if your idea of fantasy is hallucinatory akin to an acid trip.I can say one good thing about this film. The production values were goodmost of the time.It's the story of seven young girls who decide to spend a vacation at the mansion of one girl's aunt. They know next to nothing about the aunt or the mansion or the surrounding environs. Consider it one big slumber party.The girls like the seven dwarfs are caricatures of personality traits. There's Prof and Mac the fat girl and Gorgeous among others. They are a giggly bunch who chatter nonstop likes girls of that age. Do we really care that much what happens to them? No because the story is presented in such a way that we take nothing seriously.There is no cohesive unity in this film. How can there be when it changes styles every second? Resembling a cross between a Monkees episode and the worst music video ever the action is accompanied by every special effect imaginable. Seriously it looks like the director was checking off a list of incamera and extracamera effects from the Hitchcock effect to green screen effects to changes in film speed. The music likewise is chimericalchanging without reason or purpose from classical to disco to nursery rhyme styles.And the director employs every editorial cut he could think of too. It is very distracting.The difference between this film and one of Tim Burton's is cohesion. Burton lives in the whimsical and populates his films with quirky characters and imaginative happenings but his productions are unified by style and music.Is there any underlying story in the film? Some opinions about that are posted on this site. I tried to find meaning in the film by considering it to be an allegory about the damage done to Japan during WWII by its military and political missions. But I see no other opinions along those lines and besides I don't think that theme works throughout the film.Watching this film I think most viewers will feel confused or bored. Afterwards I think they will wonder what the point was.".

Anyone involved with the technical aspects of making a motion picture is perhaps already there. Aside from the comical and crude yet eerily effective visuals we get a mad tale that is clever original AND airtight. This is easily now my favorite haunted house story next to The Haunting 1963. You will be creeped out to the point of shivers and laugh to the point of tears all within the space of five minutes! Sooo many great scenes... It did get a bit wonky for a few seconds in the final climax but it's all in good fun as it emphasizes the chaos and utter mayhem. LOL... mattresses... Just brilliant...! Possibly my first Criterion DVD purchase! Soundtrack please...".

	schema:headline " Experimental Is An Understatement But The Subtle Incorporation Of Bigger Themes Was Fantastic.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hausu House is a mess both a glorious and devastating one. Maybe I was left a little underwhelmed after hearing so much about it. But to actually sit down be enthralled and then be pulled out of the movie so many times is sad. Because ultimately the level of quality the movie successfully builds drops considerably. But when this movie shines it really does.Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi. A schoolgirl travels with her six classmates to her ailing aunt's country home for the summertime vacation. When they arrive the atmosphere is strangely off putting yet they are all welcomed with open arms. Upon the first night however they come face to face with supernatural events as the girls are one by one devoured by the home. Will they be able to solve the mystery of the house and hopefully leave with their lives?The first feature length movie for Obayashi who was well known for directing many commercials with surreal visual styles at the time. Film company Toho wanted him to create a movie similar to Jaws 1975 as he then began writing the script based on the ideas his preteen daughter Chigumi Obayashi gave him. The script was greenlit but put on hold for two years until Toho eventually yet Obayashi himself direct it. No one at Toho had faith in the production as they felt it would destroy their careers and at the time they were tired of losing money. It was a box office success in Japan yet received negative criticism and has only recently seen wide released in 2009. The film now enjoys a much more cult status and is part of the prestigious Criterion Collection.Before I state what I truly love about this movie I feel it best to explain the obvious shortcomings. The first 45 minutes are awful and the actors do not convince Only two of them had little to no acting experience. There's a lot of fun and energy to each of the girls who are cleverly nicknamed after their unique quirks such as Melody and KungFu etc. But the dialogue remains something to be desired and definitely wasn't the aim of the production. What I do love about this movie is how largely experimental it remains through Chigumi's ideas such as being eaten by a piano and crush by many futons. The special effect work is great and was kept rustic enough to preserve the idea that a child made them. Extensive use of stop motion blue screen chroma effect superimposing painted skies and backgrounds all work to the films advantage and surprisingly great soundtrack.Finally the reason Hausu gets my seal of approval is the subtle incorporation of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. For a Japanese filmmaker to even attempt such a feat would have been career suicide. Obayashi lost many of his childhood friends to the bomb and wanted to create something for the next generation to reflect the chaos and macabre of it all. We see this new generation and a girl discuss how her aunt lost her fianc to the War as the image of the bomb appears on screen for 2 seconds Described as cotton candy. A family picture is taken and the flash of a camera leads to destruction becoming a reoccurring motif throughout the movie when light flashes from the eyes of a fluffy white cat Snowflake The codename for the bomb was Littleboy. You can see images of the bombs presence throughout the picture but it's subtle inclusion is rather ingenious.Final Verdict Hausu is a difficult film to love. I didn't want to compare it to the later and greater haunted house movies such as The Evil Dead 1981 and a lot is definitely left to be desired. I do respect how well Nobuhiko Obayashi did so well when the odds where against him but unfortunately the only reason to keep coming back is to see how frenetic the 2nd half of the movie is and nothing more. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw House 1977 I had seen it without subtitles. Despite not understanding any of the dialogue I enjoyed it thoroughly. When House 1977 was finally given a release outside of Japan in 2010 I was able to watch it with the dialogue and appreciate it even more.Nobuhiko bayashi is a director that made his mark in Japan for making odd but captivating advertisements with unique special effects that grabbed the audience's attention. He also had released numerous short films that were very unique and wacky.House 1977 is a movie like no other it is an experience. It would be best compared to a dreamlike state with many of the scenes filmed with a softfocus and the events and dialogue being quite surreal.Japanese culture often gets dismissed as odd at times. However this film is genuinely odd and does not feel like the director purposefully sought to create an odd film but is merely expressing himself.Furthermore the original screenplay is written by Chigumi bayashi Nobuhiko's daughter and is indicative of what she feared while visiting her grandparent's home. The movie retains this childlike wonder and fear throughout the film.The plot of House 1977 is straightforward and involves a girl that invites her friends to accompany her to her aunt's home for summer vacation. However unbeknownst to them the house is either haunted or an entity that wishes to consume them. It's like a wacky version of the Overlook hotel in The Shining 1980.Nobuhiko bayashi utilizes many special effects in this film some of which look really dated  but nevertheless manage to be interesting to this day as I have not seen many of these effects replicated since. For instance there is a couple scenes where it looks like they drew upon the film with markers or crayons.It is worth noting that the musical score in House 1977 is excellent. The band Godaigo was utilized by Nobuhiko to create the soundtrack for House 1977. The music is quirky and playful suiting the films mood. The soundtrack was released in Japan prior to the movie and was partly responsible for much of the initial interest in the movie.The acting of the girls that star in the film is not the best acting as they were amateurs that Nobuhiko bayashi had picked. However their genuine naivety translates on the screen well for this particular film and you can tell that the entire cast had a blast making this film.This movie cannot be replicated or remade in anyway and is a one of a kind experience. I highly recommend giving it a watch and enjoying the ride. It's not a cerebral film that is not the intended product. This film is meant to entertain and it does exactly as advertised.".

The next scene has the severed head vomiting blood with no build up no suspense or reason why or how the girls head got cut off in the first place all while a sappy children's melody plays constantly over and over in the background. I wanted to shoot my TV. Though reading back what I just wrote does make this movie sound interesting doesn't it? Like Flaming Globes of Sigmund.You're left asking yourself WTF IS THIS CRAP?! But for some reason I couldn't turn away and watched the entire movie on TCM mainly because I was intrigued by what the Japanese culture considered scary back in 1977. Or was this a comedy or children's movie? It certainly looked like a child made it.I can tell you this with certainty.

The same theme runs through the movie again and again.

This film is like the 70s supernatural horror equivalent of Tokyo Gore Police with a lot less gore and more laughs and cheese if there is one cheesy film I could suggest to almost anyone this would have to be it. I have nothing negative to say other than the music gets a bit annoying but maybe that is just me. The camera work and lighting is well done the film has a very fast surreal and cartoonish visual style that works perfectly with the effects and the nature of the film also the music is pretty good other than the two or three times it gets annoying.on the gore meter from one to ten one being something like The Corpse Grinders and ten being something like Braindead this film is a 310 its just so cheesy that I can't see it being extremely violent.House is an phantasmagoria of cheesy blood laughs and surrealism. A good trip of a horror film that must be seen to be believed even for the Japanese this is really weird and that is saying something.

It sets a surreal absurdest tone which pervades every scene.In fact each scene is extremely bizarre in its own right  especially as the girls are individually besieged by evil forces. A laughing decapitated head floats through the air and attacks one of the girls  biting her on the ass another girl freaks out at dinner as the host secretly watches her with three eyes  the third peering out of her mouth a gravity defying karate match ensues between the most athletic girl and a demon possessed lamp shade and in one of the stranger scenes in cinema a girl playing a piano is literally eaten by the instrument. As her consumed body parts reside within the casing her floating disencumbered fingers begin playing a tune on the keyboard  complete with flashing colored lights! At its core this is a Carmellalike vampire flick with the old Aunt getting younger each time one of the girls disappears. What sets it apart from similar movies is its whimsical air nonsensical imagery and unending gimmickry. While some people admire the film's experimental nature I think more will be turned off rather quickly. I was already annoyed after ten minutes and had a hard time sitting through the whole thing.".

HOUSE is such a zany and really warped haunted house tale unlike your typical of the genre this one has such surreal sequences as a girl being eaten by piano..her decapitated fingers actually playing the musical instrument afterward! a girl's removed lower torso actually karate kicking a painting of a cat causing the evil cannibalistic spirit to overflow with blood a disembodied head biting a girl on the buttocks mattresses attacking a girl giant lips attempting to eat the remaining girls not yet swallowed and our lead girl's face shattering like glass her body becoming a human inferno. This has to be seen to be believed. The premise is bonkers. A young teenage student Gorgeous rebels against her widower father after he informs her of his future plans to wed a new love in his life. Along with her fellow school chums including Fantasy..who's in love with a teacher named Mr. Togo decide to spend their summer vacation at Gorgeous' mysterious Auntie's creepy mansion resting on a hill overlooking a uninhabited town..featuring only a very suspicious watermelon salesman!. Over the night the girls discover that wheelchair bound Auntie is actually a ghost awaiting her lover to return home after heading off to war. Auntie eats unmarried women which provides her with a life force to continue living as an undead spirit with supernatural powers witnessed over the length of the movie. Auntie and her white cat Blanche are ever present images as the girls futilely attempt to escape succumbing to her unwillingly. Director Nobuhiko Obayashi never allows the film to look realistic and the music is often melodic featuring a bubblegum score to match the energetic naive teens who walk right into a truly difficult and unusual situation to say the least. Obayashi tries every cinematic technique in the book and while his special effects are indeed dated they provide the audience with a jawdropping bombardment of weird images and setpieces. There's nothing quite like this film anywhere. It's one of a kind and continues getting stranger every minute from scene to scene as Auntie's power grows and the terror towards the girls heightens with each character falling one by one in very creative ways. While the film is by and large a film whose reputation is built on it's wacky nature there are some genuine scenes of beauty often even melancholy but even the most romantic moment is offset by a truly eyepopping followup. The characters are bubbly enthusiastic giggly sorts one is accustomed to in regards to teenage girls. What happens to them over the course of the film is what gives HOUSE it's growing cult following. I can promise you that HOUSE definitely lives up to the hype regarding sheer insanity and crazed visuals.".

Although no one liked the sequel I'm sure Jonathon Lynn is proud that The Whole Nine Yards got a sequel somehow. And that seems like the case with Cube 2 Hypercube a sequel to the cult hit Cube. But then one wonders how there can be a sequel to a movie that was basically all filmed in one 14x14x14 set? Well Cube 2 is the answerbut not really the best one. It shows what Cube would have been if it had had a bigger budget but it also showed what it didn't want to become.Strangers are thrown together into a series of interconnecting cubes yet again but this time they're more hightech. They're not different colors and there's no booby traps. Instead some rooms have a cube that attacks you don't ask some have gravity reversed and time means nothing. There seems to be no pattern like in the first one so how are these people supposed to get out?This is all one big rehash of the first. There's the wandering around talking about the past and speculation of why they're in the cube. I guess that's for people who see sequels before the originals. The characters are all more broadly drawn the dialogue is cheesier and it looks faker. In the first you barely knew anything about the giant cube they were in. Here it seems like everyone was involved somehow. The ending which was vague in the first explained some more which I was angry yet happy about. It's hard to explain. But then they left it in the air yet again. Maybe it's for the prequel Cube Zero due out sometime this year to describe.But one positive difference between the two is that this one seemed to be overall scarier. It's not claustrophobia but the idea of anything happening in a hypercube. Because they don't exist everything goes wild here allowing for some things to happen. It's all quite creepy. And although the random crazy psycho killer is more random here than the first I liked him more and he was great as he was going through the hypercube. Cube was an original interesting and disorienting movie. Cube 2 is the exact same thing except not as good.My rating 610Rated R for language some violence and brief nudity.".

Suppose you haven't seen that movie yet and consider watching this more recent version which would probably be cooler because it has a larger budget and CGI... don't! Watch the original instead. If you like it watch Cube Zero afterwards. Don't watch this one unless you really ache for more Cube stuff.There are many things about Hypercube that don't work. Overall it feels like a bad remake of an old classic. This is not surprising because that's exactly what it is except for the fact that the original isn't really 'old' yet it only predates this movie by 5 years. 'Cube 2' is populated by almost exactly the same characters as the first movie. The premise is also the same even though they added an extra 'dimension' literally.Of course it also differs from the original Cube in some ways. First the complexity of the way in which the original 'cube' could be solved is replaced by a simple concept which is made to look complex by means of coolsounding terminology and random mathematical formulas. In the original movie someone familiar with mathematics could follow the lines of thought of the characters and people unfamiliar with maths could still feel that there was something substantial to it. In Cube 2 nobody understands what's happening and this seems to include the makers of the movie themselves. Next the original movie featured some gruesome yet inventive ways in which many of the characters died involving traps with wires fire acid and so on. In 'Cube 2' characters are killed by computer graphics  literally. If you expect more of the visceral gore like in Cube you'll be heavily disappointed. Moreover the effects looks cheap and dated. They're so obviously synthetic that it's distracting. Finally there's a whole set of fresh actors. Unfortunately the acting is rather bad. Unlike in the original 'Cube' I didn't care about any of the characters. Some even irritated me to such a degree that I wanted them to die quickly.'Cube 2 Hypercube' feels as if somebody thought the original 'Cube' could be improved by throwing a bigger budget to it and a crew which is skilled and has good tools but has no clue of what made the original so good. It's a bit as if they just learned about the concept of a hypercube and found it so cool that they thought a movie mostly based on this concept would be equally cool.".

That it wasn't some misjudged attempt at a catchy title. It is just telling it how it is. The first one was called Cube and was set in a Cube this one is called Hypercube and is set in a Hypercube. How wrong I was. Everything  absolutely everything  in this movie is designed to be Bigger Better Faster! And that is why it fails miserably.I loved the original Cube because of it's simplicity. It was what one might call a pseudo Science Fiction movie. It was a psychological thriller trying on the Science Fiction coat and it worked to perfection. You thought this is crazy BUT it could bloody well happen. It was apparently set in the here and now and everything in it was eerily possible. It would have cost an awful amount of money but it was possible it was after all just a big mechanical Cube. Even the boobytraps were deceptively simple. The real beauty for me was that you never knew or got to know the why where or who in the first movie. The goal was simply to get out in one piece and each person had their individual skill to help achieve that goal.Cube2 enters the full realm of Science Fiction and immediately trips and falls flat on it's face. None of the simplicity is left. The captors' in this new cube must deal with time shifting gravity shifting alternate realities some weird killer time thingy that moves through the rooms and one of the crew who turns a bit psycho... just like the policeman character from the first movie except you guessed it he's even a BIGGER psycho. On top of that the story tries to put a face on who is behind these experiments The Izon Military Corp. or something along those lines. This movie therefore is what 2010 was to 2001 albeit on a more modest level. And in the same way it just doesn't workAlso character development is practically nonexistent. For example one pair of characters disappear and are never seen again. Just like that gone for no real reason except maybe to show the vastness of the Hypercube although another character seems adept at meeting the multiple instances of two other characters in particular. In the end you absolutely do not care for any of them or whether they can escape or not. The story gives you no reason to care for them. The idea of the Hypercube itself is too vast to make you care. As one character points out the amount of possible rooms in a Hypercube is infinite. Therefore there is no real goal. The characters don't need each other to escape. There is no exit door in a Hypercube! So why bother at all?And as for the oneliners. The pain oh the pain.The worst bit however is reserved for the end. The berMilitary guy's comments on the phone make it sound like they are really contemplating a Cube3. Spare us please!".

It doesn't have any atmosphere  getting rid of the dark metal and coloured lighting makes it look more like a trendy wine bar than a twisted death machine! Plus why are the characters so unafraid? Kate the psychotherapist constantly smiles and acts like they're on some kind of office teambuilding event. It almost seems like waking up in a cube is not a new or frightening experience for them oh right we're in a cube again how boring.Another major problem with the film lies in the main 'psycho' of the group Simon. He is basically a replica of Quentin the cop from the first Cube but without any of the character development or motive. In the first film it does seem a little extreme when Quentin starts murdering people but at least he's had a few arguments with them first. Simon just starts killing people for fun  you can't kill an old woman because her Alzheimer's annoys you!! The film disappointed from the start. In the original there was a gruesome death scene within 2 minutes of the start. In 'Hypercube' the intro sequence is a boring overhead shot of people lying in hospital beds and then you have to wait an hour for the first death. Overall the film feels like a bigger budget lower impact remakeripoff of the original with no excitement enthusiasm or interest.".

Draws you straight into the action even if the first actor is bad at falling... up. From that point on the characters take a seat and move along with a poor attempt at additional plot. We don't ever get any insight into character motive as we did in the first movie. This person goes insane... wait explain that one again? In addition to no character motive the characters are completely static. Unless you had seen the first movie and were actually expecting focus on character archs you would find yourself thinking how terribly predictable the characters are. Even more the Cube's logical image has been destroyed replaced by this machine gone horribly wrong in the fourth dimension.The best part of the film is how it continually keeps you on your feet long after you've seen it. What gave me hope for Lion's Gate was the frightening beginning and the fantastic ending.

The Cubes in this one are basically very bright white and it is sometimes very intrusive to the eyes. I also would have liked less characters in this one. One thing that worked so well in Cube 1 were the interesting characters and the fact that there were not many in the film at all. This doesn't always work in most films but it worked perfectly in Cube 1.If there was one thing which i really did not like in Hypercube it would have to be the ending. It was very cheesy and way over the top. It seemed like an episode of The X Files which works just fine for a Scifi TV series but it just didn't work here.So is Hypercube worth viewing?

	schema:headline " Weak entry could've been better";
	schema:reviewBody "Cube 2 Hypercube is a weak and confusing entry after such a great original.SPOILERSWaking up alone Kate Filmore Kari Matchett Simon Grady Geraint Wynn Davies Sasha Grace Lynn Kung Max Reisler Matthew Ferguson Jerry Whitehall Neil Crone Tom McGuire Bruce Gray and Mrs. Paley Barbara Gordon each find themselves trapped in a large structure together. Trying to determine a way out of the structure they find it is a series rooms with weird numbers scratched all over the walls. Discovering that they are in a hypercube which has four dimensions across it and can fold back in on itself which forces them to believe that an alternate reality is inside as well as their self. Forced to take action they try to solve the riddle of the cube and escape before they're killed off.The Good News There isn't a whole lot here to really like. The hyperdimensionality allows for a lot of fascinating ideas to play around with. Gravity operates at a different angle in some rooms time operates at a different pace in other rooms so that at time they see other people alternately sped up or slowed down and of course doors open up into alternate realities and points in time which allows them to constantly meet different versions of themselves. In one simply fascinating scene one of the characters opens a door and sees themself staring back. Reaching out to grasp the hand another character appears from behind kills the parallel version before being wiped out by a wall of crystalline shapes. It's a compulsively fascinating moment that works quite effectively for it's creativity. Another scene shows on of them stabbing a character in the eye only to then turn around and encounter them on the other side of the room a moment later having aged several years and seeking revenge. Outside of these great ideas the film is pretty hollow.The Bad News There's a lot here that doesn't work. As a whole this is a mess of a movie. It differs so much from the original that it's almost in a different series with only the main premise and the cube structure remaining. Gone are the numerous and quite cool traps from the original replaced here with a trap that will spring only if too much time is spent in a room rather than being the structure of the room itself and in their place is a much too talky confused and poorly written movie. Not once does it fall together so that a simply answer can be arrived at that will explain everything and instead it just chooses to get more and more incoherent ending up being way too complicated for its own good. Even the traps that do spring up aren't that great being simply a multiplying square that morphs into a spinning shape not at all that creative or impressive. The laserwall isn't that bad but otherwise the traps in here are barely worth mentioning not being that great at all and nowhere near the inventiveness or cruelty of the originals. The extreme amount of downtime in here is also a problem since it takes nearly forever for the film to get going. After introducing themselves it takes nearly forty minutes before the first trap is sprung and that's far too long to be standing around arguing with each other. That's the main gist of the middle of the film long sequences of everyone arguing about what each clue supposedly means or where each person came from. This is a downer and makes the middle seem like it takes forever and coupled with the weak confusing story and lack of inventive traps really brings this down.The Final Verdict With a couple of decent scenes and ideas thrown in this is a really hard movie to recommend to anyone. Fans of the original might like it but it only has to be the most forgiving fans to do so. If you want to really watch it watch it before seeing the original or not backtoback the differences will be quite startling.Rated R Graphic Language Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity".

Gravity operates at a different angle in some rooms time operates at a different pace in other rooms so that at time they see other people alternately sped up or slowed down and of course doors open up into alternate realities and points in time which allows them to constantly meet different versions of themselves. In one simply fascinating scene one of the characters opens a door and sees themself staring back. Reaching out to grasp the hand another character appears from behind kills the parallel version before being wiped out by a wall of crystalline shapes. It's a compulsively fascinating moment that works quite effectively for it's creativity. Another scene shows on of them stabbing a character in the eye only to then turn around and encounter them on the other side of the room a moment later having aged several years and seeking revenge. Outside of these great ideas the film is pretty hollow.The Bad News There's a lot here that doesn't work. As a whole this is a mess of a movie. It differs so much from the original that it's almost in a different series with only the main premise and the cube structure remaining. Gone are the numerous and quite cool traps from the original replaced here with a trap that will spring only if too much time is spent in a room rather than being the structure of the room itself and in their place is a much too talky confused and poorly written movie. Not once does it fall together so that a simply answer can be arrived at that will explain everything and instead it just chooses to get more and more incoherent ending up being way too complicated for its own good. Even the traps that do spring up aren't that great being simply a multiplying square that morphs into a spinning shape not at all that creative or impressive. The laserwall isn't that bad but otherwise the traps in here are barely worth mentioning not being that great at all and nowhere near the inventiveness or cruelty of the originals. The extreme amount of downtime in here is also a problem since it takes nearly forever for the film to get going. After introducing themselves it takes nearly forty minutes before the first trap is sprung and that's far too long to be standing around arguing with each other. That's the main gist of the middle of the film long sequences of everyone arguing about what each clue supposedly means or where each person came from. This is a downer and makes the middle seem like it takes forever and coupled with the weak confusing story and lack of inventive traps really brings this down.The Final Verdict With a couple of decent scenes and ideas thrown in this is a really hard movie to recommend to anyone. Fans of the original might like it but it only has to be the most forgiving fans to do so. If you want to really watch it watch it before seeing the original or not backtoback the differences will be quite startling.Rated R Graphic Language Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity";

	schema:reviewBody "My name is Moritz Eggert no need for a pseudonym here and I live in Munich Germany home of the original Fantasy Film Fest. Just a few minutes ago I and some 200 fellow geeks were the very first people seeing an official copy of Hypercube the sequel to Cube one of my most loved films the date of today's premiere was 731030 a.m.. At least that was what we were told by the organizers  apparently the copy was flewn over from Toronto fresh from the printers and there were 2 failed attempts to do so  it seems the film was not ready the first time the second time they sent the wrong film  this is why the originally announced premiere 4 days ago didn't happen. The copy we saw just now seemed to be the final version  sound picture and editing were pristine  but doubts remain for example the program book of the festival shows a picture of a character clearly taken from the film....and he doesn't appear in it! Hm not the first time they cut somebody out AFTER releasing the pictures.... About the film...well I try to be short it is really late right now but I wanted to be first.... Like Blair Witch the original Cube is in itself a pretty perfect film which doesn't really scream for a sequel. And like Blair Witch 2 Hypercube really tries to be different...and fails to impress in the end. Like Blair Witch 2 Hypercube is not really bad  in fact there are many good ideas in it there is excitement the timing is good....it is just not as good as Cube which is for a sequel simply not good enough. It says a lot that the original director of Cube was not involved in this project  instead we have Andrzej Sekula apparently also a newcomer.I will try to describe the film without giving away too much.... Hypercube starts out very differently from the first film. First of all we see the bodies of the people later to be trapped in the cube  they are on stretchers and wrapped up in plastic bags. There is also some hightech computer generated graphics mumbo jumbo and some effective and haunting music phased and echoed  which makes sense after seeing the film. The sound design is really fantastic by the way!. We also see some kind of flashback a young woman working at a computer then turning around....blackness... Sekula tries here and also later in the film  to make hypercube different by showing snippets of the life before the cube which is at first fascinating but takes away the allegorical dimension of the first film. We now actually see the people in the moments before they are abducted. The first scene is actually a variation of the first film a girl wakes up the girl from the flashback scene wanders around a little she opens a hatch and wham...she's gone. Not spectacularly diced and killed like the poor guy in cube but simply...gone. Ok ok she appears again later...in a really shocking twist scene... The film then follows the different characters waking up in different rooms. The stereotypes are there again there is  like in the first film an agressive bully type  a caring sympathetic blonde a young carefreetype an older sureofhimselftype a mentally challenged here confused type etc. A new twist comes in the person of a sexy lawyer in red party dress! and a blind girl. The design of the cube is like a less interesting version of the first film the rooms are white and pretty bland. The hatches on all 6 sides work similarly to the first film but automatically by touch. There are also at least at the beginning no traps. Instead our heroes very soon find out that this cube is really a hypercube  it is like a tesseract a 4dimensional object. This is discovered in a succession of very neat and clever scenes  particularly in one very shocking one which I won't give away and is actually pretty mindboggling. There are timeparadoxes parallel universes gravity shifts...all in all a worthy successor to the first cube I'd say.The story itself unfolds pretty much like in the first film but with some surprising twists  not all is like it seems! Of course everybody has a reason why she is in the cube but this time it is pretty straightforward. Whereas it came as a real shock in the first film to find out that one of the prisoners was actually the architect this time around pretty much everybody of the bunch was involved in the construction of the cube one way or another... There is some digital SFX  not outstanding but ok. The acting seems competent but not really convincing especially in the case of Larry ..the laffer? who is simply very very annoying. It all comes to a conclusion which actually take us outside the cube and shows us ...other people! But don't worry  the ending does try it's best to confuse the hell out of everybody. Whereas the first film's ending was simply poetic open and beautiful this one seems like the final season of the XFiles  posing more questions than answering them... As you can tell my feelings are very mixed about this one. It is not a stinker  you can tell that a lot of creative effort went into this one and a surprising amount of ambition for a sequel as well. But basically it is  after all  a sequel to Cube  a film which should definitely not have a sequel. Cube was a SFTwilight Zone inspired variant of huit clos by Sartre and like huit clos it cannot really have a sequel as there are only two options continueexplain the story of the first film bad! or repeat the situation of the first film with some new twists also bad!. Hypercube sort of tries both at the same time and ends in a kind of limbo it won't bore you but it want excite you as much as the first film actually the ending might p some people off badly.... Simply put Cube was weird but deeply logical and philosophical like a paradox that is solved in the end for the solution's sake only. Hypercube is simply....weird. That's all. But the strange thing is I would like to see it again even though it was unsatisfactory. At least to have a clue who the hell Darcy is you will know what I mean after seeing it.... Best regards from Moritz".

The cube is a death trap but we don't care if the characters die off because we never really get to know these people. The acting in this film was poor but I think the fault lies mainly with the nonsensical script. The original Cube was better but even so we never learn why the characters are in the cube and how they got there in the first place. The characters are just so much fodder for the cube's booby traps. Some people may find this mystery compelling storytelling but I find it a serious flaw. And to have the sole survivor get her head blown off at the end of the film was cruel and pointless and perfectly suited to the overall mood of this convoluted mess of a movie.".

Not!The overriding impression of this film is a ripoff sequel designed to get fans of the original back in the seats. There's no originality and precious little entertainment value.

Yes OK the joke was that all you had to do was wait in the first room that you were safe in a reference to the first film in fact any room would do but ... arg! sorry its just not ENOUGH. There needed to be something that they had to solve some deeper structure that had to be unravelled. There had to be some outside chance that they could compromise the thing or fight back that ever present glimmer of hope that is one of the most disturbing things about the first film. The hypercube pseudomaths. Yes OK they explained a hypercubetesseract. Big deal it had pretty much NOTHING to do with the structure of the Cube. The repeating room in different time lines idea was very nice but it had nothing to do with hypercubes unfortunately. This really disappointed me when your realize that a film that seems to be hard headed is actually full of techno waffle it pretty much destroys it. The total lack of character development.

A series of warped biographies on composers Mahler Tchaikovsky Listincensed more than entertained audiences and critics. Laced with dark humor vibrant costuming and Russell's sardonic use of the composers works in conjunction with his colorful and outlandish compositions the films were visual feasts that bordered on character assassination. In Valentino Russell comes to America to offer his take on silent Hollywood and its biggest star of the era Rudolph Valentino. Russell is relentless in his depiction of the exploitative and greedy nature of producers who in the opening scene stand over Valentino's body lamenting financial loss. Russell also works over newspaper reporters actresses Valentino's exwives and a comedian known as Fatty Arbuckle?. Dancer Rudolph Nureyev is no actor but as Valentino his poorly pronounced flatly emoted English fits and contributes to his sympathetic character. As in all Russell films there are scenes that are lush and grandly staged ably assisted by exwife Shirley Russell's original and over the top costuming such as Leslie Caron's entrance at the funeral home the fight sequence where ball room dancing takes place in between rounds the producer with the pet gorilla in his living room and a cult fan gathering outside Valentino's mansion. This film quickly sank from sight when it was released and thirty years later consensus remains the same. I personally believe however that Valentino is a sharply drawn dark humored satire that spits cynicism at two institutions Hollywood and the media that it depended heavily on for its success. Valentino succeeds on every level and that was probably its problem.".

Opening at Valentino's infamously raucous funeral the film is told in flashbacks by various people who knew him. That's where any similarity to CITIZEN KANE ends. Russell is a master of opulence and it's clear that no money was spared. The sets and costumes are spectacular but they're nearly overshadowed by Russell's casting choices. Michelle Phillips plays Valentino's wife Natasha Leslie Caron is the great Nazimova and one time Dead End kid Huntz Hall is Paramount chief Jesse Lasky. Bizarre casting to be sure but all three are surprisingly good. Caron in particular seems to be having a really good time. In hindsight the casting of Rudolf Nureyev as the world's greatest lover seems ironic but he isn't bad. It is too bad he has to speak. There are times he's incomprehensible. The direction is fairly straightforward although Caron's funeral scene entrance and Valentino's jail house encounter are vintage Russell  they're nearly operatic. Carol Kane and Seymour Cassel are in it too.".

The film has a great sense of time and place and with great female casting spectacular dance scenes and breathtaking art direction VALENTNO gives the viewer 2 hours of lavish early 20s Hollywood life. Any film with both Carol Kane and Leslie Caron with Nureyev must be seen to be believed anyway. Some cinemas of the time well mine anyway ran it as a double feature with NEW YORK NEW YORK and found the same audience enjoyed both... even if they needed a meal break and a walk around the block to get through this 5 hour musical fruit salad. In the same week we also ran THE WORLD'S GREATEST LOVER which also with Carol Kane and equally gorgeous 20s visuals missed its mark because of the insufferable antics of Gene Wilder overeating the whole production. Yes overeating. Nobody survived.".

	schema:headline " Humorous and sexy";
	schema:reviewBody "Even if you know very little about Rudolph Valentino like myself it's obvious after just a couple of minutes that this autobiography doesn't have to be taken all too seriously. The dark humor and colorful operatic way in which director Ken Russell tells his story make this film interesting to watch although some parts were just a little over the top to my taste like Leslie Caron's excessive entrance at the funeral home the cult of fans gathering outside Valentino's mansion and the scene in which Valentino and his costar practise their love scene.Although the choice of Rudolf Nureyev to play Valentino was a gamble I think he is surprisingly wellcast in the title role. In my opinion the whole essence of the movie was to make it look like a silent movie whether in grotesqueness of the scenes or in the overly dramatic dialogs. In that light Nureyev's performance should not be judged as bad acting. His exaggerated accent and equally strong body language are part of his performance which is supported by the fact that Nureyev in real life didn't had that much of an Russian accent anymore by 1977. Whether his acting style  or for that matter the style of the entire movie  appeals to you is therefore merely an issue of personal taste than of professional capability of the filmmakers.As a homosexual or more accurately bisexual Nureyev certainly would have related to the hate directed at Valentino and as a worldfamous ballet dancer he would also have been able to relate to Valentino's fame outrageous lifestyle the parasitic way in which some people surrounded him and the pressure of being an idol. He created an impression that I found believable and endearing.Someone in another IMDb user review stated that Nureyev is not handsome short and not muscular at all. Of course personal opinions about beauty may differ but REALLY... if Nureyev is not considered the embodiment of physical perfection than who is? This man has been a sex icon from the moment he became famous and was adored worldwide not only for his wonderful dancing but also for his beautiful sculpted body and astonishing charisma. He definitely shows these trademarks in this movie. All his love scenes even with Michelle Phillips who he apparently disliked ooze an erotic feeling. But above all he shows that his dancing skills exceed the classical ballet. The most captivating moments for anyone with a warm place in his heart for dance are certainly the spectacular ballroom scenes from the passionate tango with Vaslav Nijinsky one of several comical references to ballet to the stunning duets with his two onscreen wives.There are chances that you have mixed feelings after having watched this film but in my case this is mainly due to the script. The main characters stay a little flat in the narrative and the big leaps in between the events leading to Valentino's death sometimes make it hard for people not familiar with the historical background of Valentino to truly understand the implications of the story. The why behind the largerthanlife popularity of this iconic cinematic person thus stays a little obscure. However the sadness over a talented life cut off too early is a similarity between Valentino and Nureyev who died in 1993 as a result of AIDS which gives the entire film a melancholic shine.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film that purports to tell the true story of Valentino played by Rudolph Nureyev. It doesn't. It does bring up his alleged homosexuality heck it opens with him dancing with a man! and the fact that his two wives were both lesbians. But according to this Valentino was seriously wounded in a boxing match that led to his death. There never was a boxing match. That's one of many inaccuracies in the film. Still Ken Russell's films always play quick and loose with the facts so it didn't really bother me. This is one of his better filmsbut not one of his best.It starts off with Valentino's funeral and one by one we meet the women in his life and by flashback we see his life and career. The two main ones are Alla Nazimova Leslie Caron and Natasha Rambova Michelle Phillips. Nazimova's entrance into Valentino's is a REAL eyepopper even by Russell standards and really has to be seen to be believed. Unfortunately Caron is not that good in the part. She overplays way too much. She does fake a Russian accentbut it renders most of her dialogue unintelligible. Phillips is much better as Rambova. She doesn't try and fake an accent and gives a very easygoing pleasing performance.The sets are just beautifullarge colorful especially the funeral and really opulent. Ditto the costumesthey're true to the period and just look great. The picture moves quickly and I was never bored. So why do I think it's only good and not great? One wordNureyev.He's terrible. He looks nothing like ValentinoValentino was handsome Nureyev isn't. Also Valentino was 31 when he diedNureyev was 39 when he made thisand looks it. Valentino was a tall muscular man. Nureyev is short and not muscular at all. However he IS nicely toned from all that dancing and he holds his own in a surprising nude scene with a full frontal shot. Also he's Russian and he tries to imitate an Italian accentit makes most of his dialogue incomprehensible the dialogue scenes between him and Caron are bewilderingneither one can be understood!. Also Nureyev was known for his dancing not acting. He really does try and occasionally pulls out a good moment or two but ultimately he's all wrong for the role. And there are way too many sequences of Nureyev dancing. His dancing is great...but Valentino was not really known for that.I do recommend it but I really wonder what Russell was thinking when he cast Nureyev. A must for Russell fans.".

Then you see real footage of people causing a riot as they try to break into where Valentino's body is. The footage is in black and white and then it turns to color. That was very well done too. How they were able to reenact the real footage. The song they also play in the beginning was a great song.I thought the acting in this movie would be terrible especially by Rudolf Nureyev. He turned out to be a very good actor in the movie. He was also very good in the dance scenes. I never found anything in this movie to displease me. However there was one scene with Valentino and an actress from one of his movies he is working on that I thought was unnecessary. The scene comes right after one of the light technicians drops a pink powder puff on him. He has to sleep with the actress to prove he isn't a pink powder puff. Then later in the movie came a boxing scene were Rudolph Valentino wanted to prove his manhood. That was a very good scene. I think the point were I really started to like the movie was when Valentino was riding home with his dog. Who better then to do a biopic on Rudolph Valentino? This is a great movie with great acting writing and direction.See this great movie about an icon.".

	schema:headline " Clumsy look at screen legend Valentino";
	schema:reviewBody "Ken Russell has always been a director that took his films into excesses with both style and subject matter but I found this socalled biography lacking any real substance. The story is of course about the rise and death of Rudolph Valentino Rudolf Nureyev and after his sudden and tragic death we see the woman in his life reflect in flashbacks about his life. Valentino was a tango dancer and a gigolo but he still had dreams of buying his own orange grove in California. A casting director spots him in a dance hall and convinces him to come for a screen test which he agrees to. He starts working in small roles until he catches the eye of famed actress Alla Nazimova Leslie Caron and her companion Natasha Rambova Michelle Phillips. Soon Valentino becomes a screen sensation and he becomes involved romantically with Rambova but technically he is still married to his first wife. The two of them become a team and they want artistic control over his parts which is to the chagrin of the studio head Jesse Lasky Huntz Hall.Russell's films are always visually interesting and this effort is no different. There are many scenes that have brown and gray tones but suddenly a bright shade will be entered into the shot. Also this film is suppose to be in the United States but is actually shot in England. Russell did a pretty good job recreating the look of 1920's America with his sets that were built specifically for this film. But let's face it this is a very clumsy attempt at retelling the life of Valentino and while Nureyev was excellent showing us the tango he looked like a fish out of water when it came to dialogue. One of the more irritating things about this film was that Russell told this story like it was a silent movie. The scenes and dialogue are overly dramatic and Nureyev uses lots of body movement to show what he is feeling. This also wouldn't be a Russell film without the gratuitous nudity and they're are a couple of lulu's here. Nureyev himself has one or two full frontal shots. I didn't complain too much about the historical inaccuracies but with the uninspired casting Huntz Hall? and the annoying style of this film with Nureyev's awkward performance its clearly an effort that goes nowhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anybody who watches this biopic about the legendary matine idol Rudolph Valentino would think director Ken Russell had a personal vendetta against the guy. Russell is known for his grotesque often controversial films and this movie is no exception. The clownlike portrayal of Valentino is as offensive as the image of the white serpent ripping the arm off Jesus on the cross in Lair of the White Worm. This film plays like the cheapest gossip rag on the newsstand. It would have the viewer believe that R. Valentino was a flaming superfeminine homosexual. And there is no way that the real Valentino acted or behaved like this ridiculous portrayal at all. In fact it would have been impossible in the 1920's. We basically witness endless people calling Rudy a raging homosexual right to his face. We have people mocking him and throwing powder puffs at him! Ken Russell takes an old unfounded rumor about Rudolph's sexuality and builds the entire film around that one thing. It's a true character assassination of a screen legend that should offend every fan that sees it. Of course it was usually Ken Russell's ultimate goal to offend his audience. Nothing against Nureyev but i truly hated his interpretation of Valentino. I don't know if the man was just too feminine in real life to hide it or if he was simply directed to mock Rudy a man who really hated the doubts cast upon his manhood. It angered him to no end being of the macho Italian culture. If he could see this movie he would roll over in his grave he would despise it that much. Attacking the image of someone who has been dead 85 years is just cowardly and disgraceful. Watching one of Valentino's films it is clear that he was a somewhat sensitive even shy man. Not the freakshow that you see in this 1977 film. Anyway Nureyev although a very handsome guy bears no resemblance at all to Rudolph so it is unclear why he was cast at all.If it wasn't for the movie's great production values it would be a total waste of time the sets and 1920's costumes are really amazing and the film looks beautiful. In fact technically speaking this is a wellmade film. It's just a shame that the director decided to make it an hysterical farce and had everyone act like clowns. If not for those poor choices this could have been great. I wondered why this has never been commercially released on DVD now i understand.. There is happily another film on the life of Valentino from 1951 that doesn't mock the actor but takes the subject matter seriously. The actor also bears a haunting resemblance to Rudy as well. But this movie just made me angry and disgusted.".

Second he Rudolf Nureyev isn't a good enough actor to make him interesting.  Russell tries to work around these basic problems by including lots of 1920's Hollywood excess and decadence and as much sex and violence as he could fit in all in amazing period clothes but it's not enough.It's a gorgeous film to look at the screen glitters with light and color and glamour and some of the scenes are stunning enough to keep you watching.  My favorites are the dance sequences Valentino was a dancer and the slinky sexy Nureyev does several dazzling tango numbers.  I recommend this film to any serious balletomane for that reasonIt's when he has to talk that the film runs into trouble and since he's the entire film it's major trouble.  Nureyev's English was never that good and he either stumbles over his lines or spits them out at top Russian speed. His body is expressive but his face is not which is typical of dancers whose faces aren't clearly seen by the audiences and who are mainly concerned with not panting visibly.But the problem that could probably never be overcome is that the characters aren't very sympathetic or interesting.  Valentino spent his short career as a passive pawn of the studios his bitch wife Natasha Rambova snippily played by the bland Michelle Phillips and diva actordirector Alla Nazimova Leslie Caron gnawing on the scenery.  The script tries to build some regularJoewhoneverwantedtobeastar sympathy for him which somehow makes him less worthy of this kind of attention.No Valentino was an astonishing stud on screen and a wuss off the only compelling thing about him are the performances he left.

I also dislike biographies which take wild liberties with the actual facts of their subject's lives.But oh the sets! Oh the wardrobe! And most especially oh Nureyev!! Now lost to us due to AIDS international ballet star Nureyev did well in this movie overacting and underacting apparently per the director's instructions. Of course every dance scene is exquisite. I flinched at the reviewer here who burbled that golly he's a better dancer than Al Pacino! Yes dear a moment on Wikipedia would tell you why. And given who and what Nureyev was the nude scenes are exquisite too and plainly show a great deal of acting ability neither over nor under  on his part. Alas the beautiful seduction scene in the tent has talking. Ah had they only shut up! The grumpy intrusive dialog is acidic enough to stifle the eroticism of the encounter. For that scene one could wish this movie about the silentfilm era were silent itself.Trivia compare his nude photo shoot scene with the two women to the costuming by Bakst for Nijinsky in Afternoon of a Faun. Google all that to see pics. I felt terrible when I missed the revival of the Bakst costumes and Nijinsky's choreography when AoaF came to my area in the early 1990s the photo session scenes in this movie made me feel that at least I have seen the Faun. This means that the director did the work to reproduce the 1912 original wardrobe over a decade before the same exhausting work was done for the 1990's revival.The rest of the movie was essentially one long jangle and blare with artsy flashbacks and an early stab at what I guess might be magical realism or something else disjointed recursive and melodramatic. In any case it was enough to alienate me and I never did get fully into the narrative thread narrative snarl? of the film. So five stars  raves for the settings and wardrobe and Nureyev and just eh for everything else.".

Needless to say the filming production values etc. were fantastic but it was the relevance of the film that kept me glued to the screen. Ralph Fiennes captured the timeless concepts that Shakespeare expressed in his play brilliantly  so much so that I feel there will be strongvisceral audience reaction to the film's depiction of themes that reflect in today's front page stories. The theme of a military officer's political role resonated with me as a retired Navy Officer. The theme of the contrast between high society and the proletariat resonates in the Occupy XXX protests occurring today. The conflict between liberal and conservative dare I say Democrat vs. Republican ideals played very loudly in this film. Even the issues in European politics reflected themes we see in today's news. The acting by Ralph Fiennes Vanessa Redgrave  Gerard Butler propelled the story and kept it moving swiftly. Some have panned the use of Shakespeare's original language. I for one had no trouble following the language. This film ranks with Kenneth Brannagh's Henry V and Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeare's Romeo  Juliet for making a film in Shakespearean English accessible by 21st Century Man. I've always believed that some folks in the U.S. malign William Shakespeare's writings today because they were forced to read his plays in a cold classroom setting in their youth. Shakespeare didn't intend his works to be read. He meant them to be performed and watched. This film proves the power of a good telling of a Shakespeare tale.".

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't disagree more with the review that slates Shakespeare's text as 'too wordy for modern audiences'. Viewers may find it challenging but even those who haven't read his work should appreciate his superb capacity for character metaphor and sheer innovation. To reduce the play to just the plot with some poor clichd and genuinely meaningless Hollywood script is to deprive it of its value and to do a great disservice to its literary status. The responsibility for understanding the language which I staunchly believe has a timeless relevance lies with those who struggle to do so not with the text itself. I cannot disagree strongly enough with the implication that we should dumbdown Shakespeare.".

To reduce the play to just the plot with some poor clichd and genuinely meaningless Hollywood script is to deprive it of its value and to do a great disservice to its literary status. The responsibility for understanding the language which I staunchly believe has a timeless relevance lies with those who struggle to do so not with the text itself. I cannot disagree strongly enough with the implication that we should dumbdown Shakespeare.";

It might be difficult to understand exactly what the dialogue is during parts of Coriolanus but there's no difficulty following the meaning. The action the direction and some powerful performances  most notably from Ralph Fiennes and Vanessa Redgrave  carry the film and more than compensate for the language barriers. Some people walked out about halfway through but the climactic third act made it well worth the perseverance  especially Redgrave's moving monologue as the formidable matriarch Volumnia.Gerard Butler was pretty forgettable in this. Whether that's because he isn't exactly of thespian discipline or because his character isn't particularly pronounced in this play is up to you to decide. Perhaps he and Jessica Chastain are nothing more than a bit of totty to sell the film? Perhaps that's just a bit cynical.James Nesbitt added an interesting somewhat unexpected dynamic to the play with his enigmatic nuances of jest and malice. Also worth a mention was the littleknown Dragan Micanovic who played a minor character Titus but delivered a couple of pivotal lines with engrossing presence.The real star of the show is obviously Shakespeare. His poetic prose courses through your mind and adds fuel to the fires of his drama. His characters are bold and consistent truly agents of their own destinies. The subject matter resonates with political allegory and the film's release is timely and relevant. The play set in a present day context highlights the tribal social system which still dominates our affairs. The story also works to express the futility of war.Fiennes has done well to translate Coriolanus from the stage to the screen and he hasn't stretched it too far so as to alienate it from the original text. Stylistically the film is quite gritty. The focus is mostly on the actors their eyes their expressions and their delivering of lines but there are a few purely cinematic moments fight scenes in particular which justify the adaptation to the screen. There are a couple of truly violent moments in the film which blast the cobwebs off the old play and hook the modern desensitized audience into the story.Coriolanus is a tense and violent political wartime thriller which makes Shakespeare not only accessible but utterly captivating.

Ralph Fiennes' performance was fantastic. All the performances were fantastic. Well directed. Beautiful cinematography. Slick music score. Coriolanus is a solid Shakespeare adaptation.The film introduces with loud noises and explosions. These elements usually overwhelm us in movies. Never forget this is a Shakespeare film. The dialogue beats the loud noises from its greatness. Everything in this film is modern. The only thing remains here is the language. Of course it's not Shakespeare without the language.The scenes in television are probably the ones that doesn't fit to the language but somewhat it doesn't matter. It still makes a great Shakespearean scenario.These dialogues were amazingly delivered by the actors. Ralph Fiennes is fantastic. Even from the very start of the film he already made the show fascinating. He's born to play these kinds of roles. His rage is the core of his talent. Vanessa Redgrave also compels to the picture. Gives a powerful delivery to her dialogue. In other filmmaking the cinematography is beautiful but the shaky camera might messes some of the shot. The music score is simply slick with drums. Giving extra thrills to the scenes. Lastly is the action scenes these scenes doesn't quite matter if it's good or bad but it feels like The Hurt Locker.It's satisfying enough to see this by the actors and the language. Its context is more mind blowing than the explosions. The filmmaking is very decent. It's a clever modernization and great familiarization to this not so famous play of William Shakespeare. Ralph Fiennes keeps the interest and shines throughout the show. Coriolanus never disappoints. It's a truly Shakespeare picture even if everything but the language is modern.

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed partly in Serbia Coriolanus has the dingy fogshrouded feel of the mists of time. Coriolanus is a roman military hero played by Ralph Fiennes and portrayed as a violent bloodthirsty animal in battle scenes. Off the battlefield he is a ragefilled misanthrope.Bloodsmeared and courageous he charges forward against all odds when in combat taking his injuries in stride. Each of his scars all 27 represents a dead enemy Menenius played excellently by Brian Cox whispers to Coriolanus's young son. Coriolanus has anger management issues to say the least. Incapable of containing his contempt for the people he wins no friends off the battlefield when some Senators wish to elevate the soldier to political office. With seething contempt for false speech and his inability to curb a brutal tongue he is doomed as enters the arena of politics. His political enemies set a trap for him at a televised political event. When a live audience chants for Coriolanus to be banished Menenius tries to reason with the mob. He asks the mob to remember that the general devoted his life to protecting Rome from invasion by her enemies.The rejection so embitters Coriolanus that he leaves Rome and joins the enemy forces. These were the forces he fought in the beginning of the story. The rebels are led by Tullus Afidious played by Gerard Butler. Butler is perfectly cast as the rebel leader. Coriolanus and Tullus had so much hatred for each other that their men had laid down their arms to watch the two generals engage in what would have been a knife fight to the death except that an explosion interrupted the brawl.The driving relationship in this killer's life is a devout worship of his mother played by Vanessa Redgrave. She controls his opinions and fires his ambitions. This bloody general so feared by his enemies is a mama's boy. Her wrath brings him to tears and to his knees. As with so much of Shakespeare the language is timeless and these speeches resonate with relevance. One can apply these conversations to public events in the current era.Excellent acting directing and camera work.".

Off the battlefield he is a ragefilled misanthrope.Bloodsmeared and courageous he charges forward against all odds when in combat taking his injuries in stride. Each of his scars all 27 represents a dead enemy Menenius played excellently by Brian Cox whispers to Coriolanus's young son. Coriolanus has anger management issues to say the least. Incapable of containing his contempt for the people he wins no friends off the battlefield when some Senators wish to elevate the soldier to political office. With seething contempt for false speech and his inability to curb a brutal tongue he is doomed as enters the arena of politics. His political enemies set a trap for him at a televised political event. When a live audience chants for Coriolanus to be banished Menenius tries to reason with the mob. He asks the mob to remember that the general devoted his life to protecting Rome from invasion by her enemies.The rejection so embitters Coriolanus that he leaves Rome and joins the enemy forces. These were the forces he fought in the beginning of the story. The rebels are led by Tullus Afidious played by Gerard Butler. Butler is perfectly cast as the rebel leader. Coriolanus and Tullus had so much hatred for each other that their men had laid down their arms to watch the two generals engage in what would have been a knife fight to the death except that an explosion interrupted the brawl.The driving relationship in this killer's life is a devout worship of his mother played by Vanessa Redgrave. She controls his opinions and fires his ambitions. This bloody general so feared by his enemies is a mama's boy. Her wrath brings him to tears and to his knees. As with so much of Shakespeare the language is timeless and these speeches resonate with relevance. One can apply these conversations to public events in the current era.Excellent acting directing and camera work.";

	schema:reviewBody "Widespread civil unrest. Riots over food prices. Politicians banished. Who says Shakespeare isn't relevant?Set in Rome though the film was shot in Belgrade with a distinctly Eastern European look to it Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut tells the story of Caius Martius Coriolanus Ralph Fiennes Rome's most prominent general whose army is fighting fiercely in a war with neighboring state Volsces. With a passion spurred on by his burning hatred for the Volscian military leader Tullus Aufidius Gerard Butler Caius Martius is a great warrior for his country but he has nothing but disdain for the poor of Rome who are suffering through famine and hardship. Following an important military victory his ambitious mother Volumnnia Vanessa Redgrave sees an opportunity for her son to stand for Senator though in order to do so he must act a little more diplomatically towards his own people. He tries but not being a natural politician he is unable to hold his tongue and explodes into a contemptuous public rant leading to a popular uprising and his banishment from Rome. Leaving his family behind Coriolanus teams up with former rival Tullus Aufidius and returns to Rome but this time as the leader of an invading army.The decision to retain the original Shakespearean verse provides Fiennes with obstacles that would have challenged an experienced filmmaker never mind a first time director. As Baz Lurhmann's Romeo  Juliet against which all modern Shakespeare adaptations will be judged seemingly forever showed 17th century dialogue can be extremely effective in a contemporary setting. But Coriolanus is not Romeo  Juliet the story is not known by almost everyone the world over and the dialogue is nowhere near as accessible.Fiennes' film more than rises to the challenge and no doubt he has made a better film for keeping the dialogue unchanged. The cast's delivery of the script is on the whole superb Butler has never been better as the fearless Gladiatoresque Aufidius Ralph Fiennes impresses both behind the camera as well as in front as the hottempered maniacal Coriolanus a role he has played previously on the stage and both Jessica Chastain as the ever concerned wife Virgila and Brian Cox as the effusive political adviser Menenius make an impact in smaller roles. Only James Nesbitt as the manipulative and underhand Sicinius gives a slightly underwhelming performance.But there are a few moments in the script where Fiennes simply can't rely on his actors' delivery of the dialogue to clearly convey the plot 'I converse more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning' is just one of the less intelligible lines. In these instances he lets the filmmaking do the storytelling from grandiose speeches to intimate family scenes the bombastic score dramatic cinematography and bold camerawork make that the meaning and direction of every scene clear. This is a director who definitely knows his craft I was in a cinema full of critics for most of whom English is not their first language and heard absolutely no complaints about not understanding the plot.The final word however simply has to go to Vanessa Redgrave. Her portrayal of Volumnia is staggering. As a mother who risks seeing her own son bring down the city that her family has spent hundreds of years building she brings out her character's pride conflict and vulnerability with a subtlety and power that has to be seen to be believed. Truly breathtaking.Find the rest of our film and festival coverage as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com. Follow us on Twitter DohaFilm.".

Corioloanus is neither of those.The language is the original Shakespeare which most people despair of so lot's of thous and wherefores etc but it's never dull. Rather apart from one or two scenes the dialogue is fleet and sharp. Some of it puts even the best scriptwriter to absolute shame for it's cutting razor edge delivery.The setting is modernised but not glam like Luhrman's efforts. You can see the original play behind the film yet it works surprisingly well. By that I mean that you can tell that some scenes were originally set in a Romanstyle forum for instance. However it translates very well and has a dignified and serious tone.There's even a modernday battle scene with Marinelike soldiers and a desperate fight to the death between the two main characters.Ralph Fiennes is superb in the titular role. Usually Hollywood actors do Shakespeare in order to get some respect but Fiennes also as director has crafted a great film. Gerard Butler does equally as well although his role is limited due to the nature of the script and story. This is Caius Martius Coriolanus' story and he is the focus of it.What really appealed for me here was the characters. I know I know. Characters are what people speak of when describing boring films. Most kiddies these days just want giant robots and explosions but it's interesting to watch this film after seeing John Carter which I also didn't mind. Whereas the lead in John Carter had no facial expressions to speak of Fiennes and Butler positively reek of emotion and depth. Gerard Butler is really only a supporting role but he does it well.Shakespeare has survived 400 years precisely because he wrote about people well. Most of the crud Hollywood dishes out will be forgotten in the space of a year.9 our of 10 is pretty high for me but I really enjoyed this film. See Coriolanus for something different and refreshing in between the expressionless 'A' list actors of today and the mindless explosions of the next Michael Bay extravaganza.".

But good show of a rarely staged and even more rarely filmed play from Shakespeare's dark streak in the first decade of the 1600s and as in Julius Caesar Shakespeare really has it in for the common people in this number  feckless and fawning to a man. I can't put a finger on Fiennes' Coriolanus or Redgrave's Volumnia but Gerard Butler stands out as Aufidius. I've always felt that Coriolanus is really his tragedy I believe this character makes the longest journey in the play emotionally. Hard at his heels is Brian Cox's Menenius.

Vanessa Redgrave in a series of masculine outfits has aged superbly and gives a bravura performance as the protagonist's mother. Ralph Fiennes head shaved and scars on his face makes a convincingly patrician Caius Martius brave in war but unable to navigate the tricky currents of politics or win the love of the common people. He's also got that Shakespearian essential a great voice. Tall rugged Scotsman Gerard Butler is completely convincing as his formidable enemy and some time comradethe ruthless Aufidius. The supporting roles are also very competently acted with some unusual casting of a black South African as Martius' military superior and a woman as First Citizen the voice of the plebeian class in the early Roman Republic.But the highest tribute must go to Fiennes' astonishing competence as director. Battle scenes interior scenes crowd scenes all are handled with the skill of a veteran cineaste such that the movie never drags never slackens in pace from the opening food riot by the plebs which seems ripped from the headlines to the tragic and inevitable end.".

Vanessa Redgrave in a series of masculine outfits has aged superbly and gives a bravura performance as the protagonist's mother. Ralph Fiennes head shaved and scars on his face makes a convincingly patrician Caius Martius brave in war but unable to navigate the tricky currents of politics or win the love of the common people. He's also got that Shakespearian essential a great voice. Tall rugged Scotsman Gerard Butler is completely convincing as his formidable enemy and some time comradethe ruthless Aufidius. The supporting roles are also very competently acted with some unusual casting of a black South African as Martius' military superior and a woman as First Citizen the voice of the plebeian class in the early Roman Republic.But the highest tribute must go to Fiennes' astonishing competence as director. Battle scenes interior scenes crowd scenes all are handled with the skill of a veteran cineaste such that the movie never drags never slackens in pace from the opening food riot by the plebs which seems ripped from the headlines to the tragic and inevitable end.";

Ralph Fienne's contemporary version is based on the original text but preserves the complex character of its eponymous hero. Though I feared a Coriolanus with machine guns and television this updating liberates Fiennes to present Caius Martius in a much more nuanced manner than traditional portrayals would allow. Are there aspects with which I disagree? Of courseevery Shakespeare lover has an ideal version in his or her mind. But this is more than a worthy one. It is a revelation. Add Vanessa Redgrave as Volumnia and Jessica Chastain as Virgilia and you have a sharp and welldrawn contrast between the public man of war and his private realm where he is well loved by his wife and driven on by his mother.

Cecil Roberts.Shakespeare's tragedy Coriolanus directed by Ralph Fiennes has been successfully translated to the screen just as Richard III 1995 was by Richard Loncraine. Both productions shift the scene to modern times and despite my prejudice about tinkering with the Bard I liked both in part because Fiennes is a fine Coriolanus and Ian McKellen a better than fine Richard.It's modern Rome besieged by angry citizens whose leader is Gerard Butler's Aufidius longtime enemy of Coriolanus. When the haughty anticommoner Coriolanus is banished from Rome he joins up with his old enemy to turn on Rome.It seems like a perfect alliance until Coriolanus's formidable mother Volumnia played by Vanessa Redgrave and his wife VIrgilia played by Jessica Chastain confront him. To see the four leads on the screen along with the reliable Brian Cox as Menenius is to witness the best of cinema acting although Redgrave dominates as she pleads cajoles and finesses her son to speak gently to the commoners and to compromise the siege.There is something static about the filming perhaps because Fiennes sees it in its Shakespearean form and himself as a theatrical performer. Static even though Fiennes relies on MTVlike quick cuts to enhance the action and perhaps mitigate the elegant prose for regular film goers.The contemporary thematic parallels with the play are obvious the puzzle that still is the Balkans or Iraq and Iran for that matter with families pitted against each other the citizenry versus the military and power another deal away.But the play's the thing and no matter how much gifted director and adapter play with the original Shakespeare is always there with stunning dialogue deep characterization and humanity still crazy after all these years.".

I wasn't that familiar with the Coriolanus plot so it was interesting to see the story develop about a very good general who becomes a very bad politician.The film uses Shakespeare's dialogue but it is set in modern times. However it still resonated for me as we see the influence of populist politics and politicians in the affairs of state.The plot is about a general who wins a great victory and is selected to be the next consul of Rome. However he regards the ordinary people with little more than contempt and his obvious discomfort in even pretending to compromise in this belief results in his banishment. There is a great scene set in a TV studio where Coriolans confronts those opposed to him in something not far removed from the Jerry Springer show. He then unites with a former enemy of Rome in order to gain his revenge.I'm not Fiennes' biggest fan and I thought he over egged the pudding in a few of his speeches. Too much spittle and not enough subtlety perhaps though the character of Coriolanus is not a very subtle man either as a soldier or as a politician.I loved Vanessa Redgrave as his powerful and influential mother. Brian Cox is also excellent as the decent Senator. Gerard Butler is also good as Coriolanus' sworn enemy turned ally Aufidius.The movie uses the familiar setting from TV news of modern war zones to demonstrate Coriolanus' best characteristics as a fearless soldier.An excellent version of one of Shakepeare's lesser known plays".

It touches the emotions and the feeling of not belonging that exists within many of us and that longing for love and brotherhood that is not available without some dire costs. The characters were so clearly human powerful and conflicted one was drawn to care for everything that happened to them and cheer at their triumphs and sit in horror at their losses.I have recommended that everyone see this film during SXSW. My wife and I were expecting an audience award for the film which it easily won however the Jury Award was also won and we were give true appreciation for the jury system at SXSW.Beautiful photographed with outstanding music this production hits all the marks out of the ballpark and should be studied for how powerful film today could be.

There's no avoiding the clich's as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.Similar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.Fortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes The Chavs as we call them now where loyalty respect revenge dignity and pride are what they live for not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.Casting Elijah Wood is a bold move he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger aggression and compassion which holds the film together.This won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans.".

It seems that many people mostly Brits hated the movie because they didn't think it was realistic enough there were too many clichs and because Charlie Hunnam's impression of a cockney accent wasn't very good.I don't get it. First off this is a fictional movie not a documentary. I thought the plot of this movie was very compelling. Yes you do have to suspend your disbelief a bit but you have to do that for almost every movie made. Some folks simply could not accept Elijah Wood as a tough guy. I agree that it's difficult to picture Frodo as a tough guy but I thought he did a very good job. I also thought Charlie Hunnam was OUTSTANDING. He has an incredible screen presence and I look forward to seeing him in future movies. Mark Warren was also great. In fact the entire supporting cast was great in this film. Claire Forlani was great Leo Gregory was fantastic all of the guys that played Pete's friends were great even the guy that played Tommy Hatcher was perfect. GREAT performances all around!!!This is a great film. I've already ordered a copy for my DVD collection. I've seen it three times and I will watch it again when my copy arrives. It's that good! I give it an 8 out of 10.".

And if anyone believed that all Elijah Wood movies would forever be tainted with the image of Frodo Baggins think again. Within about 10 seconds of screen time any lingering thoughts of LOTR are gone.Yet whilst the direction actors and the stunts will attract all the plaudits for me the main reason why this film works so well is the very clever story and the amazing script. Yes in many respects the subject has been 'Americanised' but it has been done in a way which is very subtle. I suspect that much of the credit for this goes to the writer Dougie Brimson because it is obvious very early on that there was a strong English influence on both the plot and the dialogue.Given the level of violence not to mention the subject matter I'm not that sure mainstream America will respond that well to it but for me the big test will come when it's shown in England but I suspect like me the English audiences are going to love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Harvard's journalism student Matt Buckner Elijah Wood is expelled from the university two months before his graduation for stashing drugs in his closet in his room. However the cocaine belongs and was hidden by his roommate Jeremy Van Holden Terence Jay. But the insecure Matt does not accuse Van Holden since he is the son of a powerful politician. Matt travels to London to meet his estranged sister Shannon Dunham Claire Forlani that is married with a baby boy with the British Steve Dunham Marc Warren. Matt explains what happened to her in Harvard and when Steve comes home he asks Matt to go to the football game with his brother Pete Charlie Hunnam since he has planned to date Shannon that night. Pete refuses since he is the leader of the GSE Green Street Elite a gang of hooligan fans of the West Ham United that usually fight after the matches. However Matt befriends Pete and his friends and fights with them becoming a confident young man. But soon he has a lesson where the violence of the hooligan gangs leads them.Hooligans is a surprisingly good film about violence and friendship. Elijah Wood performs an interesting character that changes his personality through his experience with a gang of hooligans. Pete is also intriguing since he is a history and physical education teacher for kids and the leader of a gang. It is good to see the loyalty of most of the characters to each other and how they change their personal lives addicted in fights after the football matches. The tragic conclusion fits well to the behavior of the characters. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Hooligans".

Matt explains what happened to her in Harvard and when Steve comes home he asks Matt to go to the football game with his brother Pete Charlie Hunnam since he has planned to date Shannon that night. Pete refuses since he is the leader of the GSE Green Street Elite a gang of hooligan fans of the West Ham United that usually fight after the matches. However Matt befriends Pete and his friends and fights with them becoming a confident young man. But soon he has a lesson where the violence of the hooligan gangs leads them.Hooligans is a surprisingly good film about violence and friendship. Elijah Wood performs an interesting character that changes his personality through his experience with a gang of hooligans. Pete is also intriguing since he is a history and physical education teacher for kids and the leader of a gang. It is good to see the loyalty of most of the characters to each other and how they change their personal lives addicted in fights after the football matches. The tragic conclusion fits well to the behavior of the characters. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Hooligans";

I couldn't believe this film was directed by a woman. She really portrayed the lifestyle of soccer hooligans realistically. Such a different view than the press gives.

The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene.But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.Let's clear up a few things Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a runofthemill league game they don't set out to kill each other they don't ONLY wear Stone Island and others in the crowd hooligans or not do. They most certainly don't when having taken exception to a new firm member trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist.Don't get me wrongI'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.I could go on but I think I've made my point.As for the plot it's highly unimaginative and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points and more made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me I was well in front.I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.If I'm right then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed but I'm rarely impressed by slowmo action certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.There are some funny if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.If you're British avoid like the plague if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know. If you're American you may enjoy it as it's clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny the plot is flimsy predictable and ultimately over the top.".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Street as it was called in the UK or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal however he spends much of the film placid and cheery only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cockeny in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible unfortunately the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes Jack from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be as such it deem it impossible for a nonfootball fan who is not a fan of the club in question is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final and biggest problem with this film is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club West Ham why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film triesintends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent bystanders at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coinslightersglass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inaccurate clichd bathetic 'Green Street' is one of the most royally diabolical films I have ever seen. This dreadful exposition of poor writing acting and direction pins ragged colours to a splintered mast within minutes when wideeyed Boston excollege boy Matt Elijah Wood visits London and his sister Shannon Claire Forlani after being fittedup by a cokesnorting richkid fellow student with influential relatives to embarrass. As Matt arrives we learn that Shannon's wideboymadegood husband Steve a casttotype Marc Warren has quietly planned a romantic evening with the missus evidenced by a pair of hardtocomeby show tickets. Hubby grabs the opportunity to palm off his unexpected guest on brother Pete Charlie Hunnam a cocky jackthelad who as we've already discovered from the opening sequence is also an extremely mouthy football yob.Although Steve's discomfort over Pete's pottymouthed demeanour in front of both wife and houseguest is evident such is the attraction of 'Chicago' a gangland tale chosen for reasons which soon become gratingly obvious that he's quite happy to entrust the naive Matt to the care of his errant bro' an even rougher diamond than he whom he knows is certain to lead the young American astray.Matt despite his preppy disposition and the small voice of calm that would surely be bidding him run from a situation that looks iffy from the start is strangely happy to spend quality time with this boorish and potentially dangerous character his jetlag apparently having rendered him a sponge for every splenetic old antiAmerican clich in the book yes even the ones about friendly fire and being late for both wars. Soon the pair is all but arminarm and joshing happily together in the pub the initially suspicious crew of local hardboys for Pete is the Main Man quickly coming around to the thought that the Yank's a good'un after all understands the concept of loyalty and will support his new mates no matter what sort of how'syerfather's going down.Apart from generally getting things very wrong about London the film's foundation conceit the premise upon which Matt becomes involved with West Ham's Green Street Elite in the first place is fatally flawed from the beginning and heads rapidly south from there. We are drawn towards the GSE's loathsome characters only because the real 'bad guys' of the piece  wouldn't you know it it's the MILLWALL firm  are so operatically unhinged that anyone else can only look like a choirboy no matter how handy he might be with the coarser rhythms of East End slang a taunting terrace chant and a set of brass knuckles. Ultimately the film overcooks to evaporation every hoary notion of the noble savage and his Cosa Nostrastyle commitment to tribal loyalty and the closure of ranks. The allegiances are unlikely from the word go the narrative has been seen before in any number of dramatic contexts but done better and with greater complexity for a footballspecific example see 'ID' and the gang violence is graphically gleefully choreographed to the point of voyeuristic pornography.Every possible riff on London life is plundered short of shipping in a couple of pearly kings to do the Lambeth Walk with yer old mum outside the rubadub. As might have been mentioned elsewhere Hunnam delivers his lines in the most woeful cockernee accent this side of  yes him again  Dick Van Dyke and it came as a considerable surprise to learn that the actor is a Geordie and not an IrishAmerican excop from Queens. Marc Warren goes through his barrowboy chops and does what we've come to expect of him whilst Wood is tolerable in a wretched role the single observation that enthusiasts for this film have made with which I agree  that Matt needed from the start to have an air of the innocent abroad about him only latterly discovering a steelier determination when forced to face life fullon  is fair enough and few ought to be able to do this better than good old Frodo Baggins himself.But this isn't nearly enough on which to hang the story. Steve a hooligan reformed would never have exposed Matt to what he knows the GSE is capable of in the first place neither would a character like Matt have allowed himself to take up with such dubious companions out of choice. From the beginning the incomer's not exactly falling on anybody's mercy for survival in cold London town. Matt's not short of cash at the start of the film he takes a bullet for his feckless college roommate and receives a handsome sweetener for his trouble. And his father's Fleet Street connections could easily land him a plum job in journalism Matt's major at Harvard and the calling whose discovery by the respective Upton Park and Coldharbour Lane crews eventually leads to the film's ultimate big setpiece a ludicrous final gang skirmish on a bleak postindustrial lot complete with the inevitable slo'mo evocation of our virtuous warriorprinces doing honourable battle for a higher calling like something out of 'Excalibur' with pylons.Shannon pitches up to spoil the fun and Matt returns to Boston an older wiser man. Cut to a posh downtown restaurant and here's our hero's Harvard nemesis enjoying a quiet toot in the mens' room having left the cubicle door helpfully unlocked as you do. And just as Matt prepares to punch the hapless cokehead's lights out wouldn't you know? His hand is stayed. For all the murderous mayhem of his experiences over the sea and far away with the proud footballing Knights of Saint George he's learned something precious and invaluable. Yes like any Plaistow lad blooded in the school of hard knocks that is Upton Park he's emerged a better person. Which is not a feeling I can share having seen this grubby film.".

I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.a People just don't talk like that in London in real life the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b The actor who plays Pete Dunham Charlie Hunnam unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him  how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself hehe. c Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly as a Brit it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is. Please my American and foreign friends don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff Wales or something and expect us all not to notice.".

I always thought of Hooliganism as a bunch of young drunken idiots who like to pick fights etc. Boy was I wrong.However the one underlying thing that troubled me was.. Elijah Wood's character just didn't fit in. VERY MINOR SOILER ALERT  A kid who was afraid of his weasel roommate at preppy Harvard ... is all of the sudden mixing it up with hard core British Hooligans huh? I felt like if the storyline was accurate Matt would have split the money with Pete right off the bat.. and would have been at the nearest Starbucks six minutes later. End of movie. I kept going back to that in my mind.Overall though it certainly was a good movie.. worth seeing.".

If it was even a patch on fight club the violence blood gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly this film is no football factory  which is so much more real and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment. Fair enough the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed  with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film  i disagree  either a simple casting error or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through  it was obvious from scene one some AmericanGeordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong good looking guy who looks great with a skin head  but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was  the 'fake steward' situation. Also when the GSE are going to play United up north they go on the train expecting only 3 of them  doesn't make any sense  this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy  did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George".

The filming is exquisite and very Guy Ritchieesquire. I can't say enough good things about this film. Extravagant. Charlie Hunnam is definitely the best part of this film  he plays the thug well but not in a stupid stereotypically way  there's a human side to him as well. Watch the rest of the West Ham firm closely  there are TONS of hilarious lines and expressions in this film that are good BECAUSE they're so subtle.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a West Ham fan from East London and had to see the film because it was based on my football club in my area and about West Ham's hooligan element. Of course I knew it was a fictional adaptation of the Intercity Firm ICF under the moniker of Green Street Elite but can't see why.SPOILER From start of the film and hearing Charlie Hunnan's Cockney accent I knew this film was going to be a massive disappointment. The first fight scene would have been more at home in a kungfu film then a movie about football hooliganism. I'm all for watching Tottenham get smashed all over the gaff in any light but not when it looks like it's been glazed over by the Hollywood treatment.Looking at the innercity area where the pub was did actually remind me of the Boleyn Pub which is on the corner of Green Street next to the ground as is home support only even the authentic chants inside made me smile a little. The banter between the boys when the Yank got there isn't too far from how English boys are either but that's where it all ends for me. No more smiles after that just disappointment over and over. When they got to the game and made their way inside the game we're led to believe that West Ham are at home to Birmingham City when it's clear as day that West Ham were playing Gillingham. Now that might seem insignificant to people who either don't follow football or have no idea about the English leaguesteams but when you are in the know and someone who attends regular it comes across as all wrong and made predominantly for an American audience. Even the Birmingham fans were all wrong. The black fellas sounded like they were from Jamaica and the white fella who was with them is clearly a Scouser. Liverpudlian Now yet again to an American audience that's insignificant but to a BritishEnglish audience it's noticeable and annoying.The trip to Manchester made me laugh because of how bad the scene was. First off if you're about to have an off with Man United's firm you're not gonna take 6 blokes and a 5ft nothing Yank who's never had a row. Second was the fact that about 30 Manc's are hanging outside the station waiting for the 'GSE' to come out. Now anyone who has the most minute idea about football violence would tell you that the Police would be bang on them and an escort waiting for the West Ham mob attending Old Trafford. In this day and age you don't get the freedom to stand about outside stations waiting for a row. You're on film Police are everywhere especially for a fixture like Man United v West Ham and any mob that's worth it's grain would never in this day and age come out of the main station. It's like going to south Bermondsey on an away trip to Millwall you just don't do it because Old Bill Police will be there to wrap you up and take you straight to the game.Other things that made the film tacky were the fact that you never see contact made between firms prior to a meet. You also never see firms actively looking for each other but instead standing around making themselves stand out like a sore thumb and that aggravating because you know that's not something that happens at football in this day and age.The Millwall firm looked far more convincing then West Ham. They looked half decent where as the West Ham lot looked liked a bunch of kids. The whole film ended up getting up my nose and made me cringe watching it with my mates who ain't West Ham. They could see how ridiculous it was and how apparent that it'd been Americanized. The film feels like it was thrown together to shock Americans and show the 'ugly side' of football in England. It might have done that but for people living on this side of the Atlantic it was diabolical.One thing that got to me personally was the little research that went into the film and the location. If it wasn't for the West Ham fans in the 'Abby' there would be no way of foreigners knowing that West Ham are based in East London and Millwall football club is in south London not Tower Hamlets which is a borough in East London. Millwall is in East London but that's the place not the football club and it's not in the borough of Tower Hamlets either.I could in all honesty pick this film apart all day because I feel it was that bad. I've nit picked on certain things but when I watch a film especially based on a subject that I have a lot of knowledge on I want it to seem authentic as possible which it didn't at any point.You can call this more of a rant then a review.".

Akkineni Nageswar Rao the living legend lived up to his stature as Valmiki Maharishi and proved his mettle as an actor. Srikanth as Lakshman is good but can do better.

Rest of the characters all performed to their requirement.Technical DepartmentsBapu  Ramana what can we say about this combo. They are proud offspring of Telugu culture and heritage. One would wonder at the dedication and application this duo even in eighties. Even though Ramana is not amidst us today no body can take the credit from him. He scripted one of the finest movie for the current and forthcoming generations to protect our epics. Take a bow!Bapu is an outstanding example for current generation. He took care in every minute details of the movie right from make up. He drew best performance from each and every artist including the kids. His hard work can be seen in every frame on the screen.Ilayaraja  Music is the important detail for a mythological movie to get people connected to it. Even though the music released few months ago the songs are still chart busters. And coming to the Back ground music I wonder what magic did he spell on the screen. The story of Lava Kusa require subtle and soothing back ground score as the movie portrays the emotions of characters in the movie. He did perfect justice and set perfect mood for the movie. Jonnavithula's lyrics are crystal clear with out difficult language and will enthrall all the audience irrespective of classesThe production values in the movie are awesome an enriched quality product  The sets by Magadheera fame Ravinder Visual effects by Top VFX companies including Kamal Kannan Magadheera fame.Final verdict Most awaited Mythological Magnum opus 'SreeRama Rajyam' finally deserves It's a masterpiece from BapuIlayaraja n Balakrishna..Fanatabulous n award winning performance by NBK...Maestro Ilayaraja at his best..Its a visual feast to all movie lovers...Gonna be a feather in TFI's cap..Enriching qualitative product ..Takes place among one of Great Classics n a must watch movie..".

	schema:reviewBody "NT Rama Rao as Ram Anjali Devi as Sita Nagayya as Valmiki. Written by Samudrala Raghavacharya and music composed by Ghantasaala Venkateswara Rao. The 1963 film  Luva Kusha was a moving dramatic and poetic rendition of the aftermath of Rama Pattabhishekam. It was a celebration of the spirit of the Ramayana and a depiction of the life and times of one of our most loved and cherished Kings  Lord Ram. An unforgettable musical that will live in our hearts for generations to come.Now  Sri Rama Rajyam 2011 does have some heavyweights in its credits  the BapuRamana duo and Ilayaraaja. There ends the comparison. Balakrishna is no match for NTR and Nayanthara does not carry the poise and subtlety of Anjali Devi. But I will concede that both of them have put in a great deal of hardwork and have acted much better than in any of their previous films. Although Balayya is fat and old am sorry but its the truth his emotions are true and his majesty is commendable. Bapu has made Nayanthara act for once and that in itself is a great feat. Apart from the 'Jagadananda Kaaraka' song Raaja's music does not deserve special mention. I am a huge fan of Raaja but Sir even your prowess cannot recreate what Ghantasaala did for us back in 1963. I agree that it is unfair to compare the two movies but for the fan who has watched the original multiple times it is inevitable. Even if I were to go with an open mind I still find a halfdozen flaws and inadequacies. The children who play Luv and Kush in Sri Rama Rajyam completely lack the capability to emote. Yes they are kids but we have seen in many movies that talent defies age. Also in many instances the language that is spoken shifts to a much more contemporary style and does not represent the actual spoken dialect of the time. One must remember that Ramayana was in the Treta Yuga and hence represents a period in time that is at least a few hundred thousand years prior to the present day. The battle scenes of the older Luva Kushalacking in mordern technology and graphics of coursewere so detailoriented and captivating that with the kind of imagery we have today it is disappointing that Bapu could not do a better job with it and appallingly has cut the movie abruptly short at the end. Bottomline It is a good effort from a oncegreat artist and director but it a'int a 'classic' or a fitting 'homage''remake'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read some rave reviews of this movie I started watching with high expectations. That was probably what undid it for me.I only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie and I am very disappointed. The movie does not have a single authentic frame so far. The introduction song that should have captured the joyous and celebratory mood of the people is reduced to a dull background song featuring some uninspired choreography. The song is nice thanks to Illayaraja but it is not in the right place.Nayantara is horribly miscast as Sita. She has no grace so far and her body language is that of a super model than Maha Sadhvi Sita. It is sad that there seems to be no other actress who could have been a better fit. The graphics are unrealistic and substandard. I am not sure why they tried to create everything in CGI instead of using some good sets. Has that become so costly nowadays? It seems like just being old was the only requirement to cast Balaiah as Maharshi Vasishta. He cannot even pronounce his words correctly and this guy is supposed to be a Maharshi! Well that did it for me. I am sure I will try to continue this movie sometime later and since I will be watching with much lower expectations this time I hope that I won't find it so offputting. Or maybe the movie does get better...No no I should not get my hopes up.Just finished the movie. I don't want to waste anymore words on this wasted effort. Skip this movie and watch a good quality version of the original httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0206877combined".

That was probably what undid it for me.I only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie and I am very disappointed. The movie does not have a single authentic frame so far. The introduction song that should have captured the joyous and celebratory mood of the people is reduced to a dull background song featuring some uninspired choreography. The song is nice thanks to Illayaraja but it is not in the right place.Nayantara is horribly miscast as Sita. She has no grace so far and her body language is that of a super model than Maha Sadhvi Sita. It is sad that there seems to be no other actress who could have been a better fit. The graphics are unrealistic and substandard. I am not sure why they tried to create everything in CGI instead of using some good sets. Has that become so costly nowadays? It seems like just being old was the only requirement to cast Balaiah as Maharshi Vasishta. He cannot even pronounce his words correctly and this guy is supposed to be a Maharshi! Well that did it for me. I am sure I will try to continue this movie sometime later and since I will be watching with much lower expectations this time I hope that I won't find it so offputting. Or maybe the movie does get better...No no I should not get my hopes up.Just finished the movie. I don't want to waste anymore words on this wasted effort. Skip this movie and watch a good quality version of the original httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0206877combined";

Bapu specifically seems to have omitted 'Padyamulu  poems keeping in view of the modern generation in view. However I find this movie enthralling and captivating especially some emotional scenes like Rama seeing Seetha for the last time the night before sending her away to forest. The way he touches the saree and tries not to disturb her sleep shows the emotional quotient of the movie excellent shown by Bapu. Similarly the sitting posture of Seetha during vanavasam when lava and kusha were singing Ramayana is a straight scene from Bapu's bommala raamayanam. The title song jagadananda kaarak is very divine. I feel we can not compare this movie with original NTR's LavaKusha however it is a modern classic for modern generation.".

I think it's safe to say that HPD is not a remake of DTB but is is also safe to say that it at least served as the inspiration for Clint's 1972 film IMHO.I had high expectations for Django The Bastard and I was definitely NOT let down. It's an at times crude and low budget affair but it has enough action tension and chills to make it a terrific little film that just may be one of the trendsetters in the Euro Gothic Western subgenre. The atmosphere is thick in this creepy movie and Director Sergio Garrone goes all out showing us some unique camera angles which run the full spectrum from overhead shots to closeups to fadein's to handheld. Very effective as is the score which at certain times is eerie enough to raise a goosebump or two. Some remarkable scenes as mentioned in other reviews including a creepy opening that is almost completely silent except for the howling wind and the memorable scene in the graveyard.Really wonderful stuff from the little SW that could. The performances are fine and I think that anyone who is a fan of Eastwood's High Plains Drifter owes it to himself or herself to check this one out. It's available on DVD from VCI under it's U.S. title of The Strangers Gundown. Easily one of my favorite Westerns.".

During the civil war Army officers sold their entire regiment to the enemy who brutally massacred them. One survived or did he? and his name is Django. 13 years later he comes back to get revenge on the Officers and kill ANYONE who gets in his way. Some people think Django is supernatural is he? See the movie to find out. When Django plants the first cross in the ground at the start it really freaked me out. He places a cross in the ground with the name of the officer he wants dead while they're still alive. When ever Django appears it scares me because he looks like a cold killer who doesnt care if anyone lives or dies. He kills the officers with a gun most of the time or he beats them to death in some gory fashion. In one scene he's kneeling by a campfire talking to gangsters. When he walks away an explosion occurs killing the gangsters...really scared me because I didn't expect it. This whole movie really gives me the creeps call me crazy but it does it really scares me! and the horror classic HALLOWEEN didnt give me a fright at all. This film is more Horror than spaghetti western so don't knock becuase it takes place 100 years ago. Definatley on my top 10 Horror List. I give it an 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that got me into spaghetti westerns. I have been a huge fan of horror movies ever since I can remember and I especially love the Eurohorror of the 60's and 70's. I also love horrorwesterns like Curse of the Undead and the infamous bad movie Billy the Kid vs. Dracula. There are only 2 or 3 other films that I would consider true horrorwesterns and I like those as well. Naturally when I found out about this movie I knew I had to have it.I don't really think of this movie as a horrorwestern since we never really know whether the stranger is supernatural or not but it is a spaghetti western with a strong Gothic Eurohorror feel to it. This is the closest thing there is to a Eurohorror spaghetti western. It's a shame there was never a fullblown Eurowestern horror film with an obvious ghost vampire zombies or the like. It could have have been incredible. Especially if Barbara Steele was in it. Anyway I digress.I don't consider this movie to be a sequel to the original Django film either. The stranger here is a man named Django but we know he is not the same Django as the one in Sergio Corbucci's film because this Django is a former confederate soldier. Corbucci's Django fought for the Union Army. This Django is like the grim reaper a tall emotionless shadowy figure in black who calls himself a demon from hell and he is here to take the three officers who betrayed his regiment back down with him. He doesn't just kill he does it with a macabre sense of style which we first see in the opening scene of the film where there is some great camera work as Django strolls into the middle of town sticks a grave marker cross with the date and his first victim's name on it into the dirt in front of the saloon and waits for the doomed man to come out and see it. It's an incredible scene and that's just the beginning of Django's ghastly revenge. There are many more cool scenes after that one but I won't spoil them.The music is very creepy and atmospheric. It's an excellent score that could fit right into a Eurohorror movie yet it is totally appropriate for a spaghetti western as well. There is even a part where it sounds like they are using a theremin. The constant sound of howling wind is also a nice touch.In addition to the macabre there is also some classic spaghetti western craziness in this film. Luke Murdoch the brother of one of Django's targets is one of the highlights of the movie. He is wildly insane violent overthetop and very entertaining to watch. There is also a scene near the beginning of the film where two men are playing catch with a lit stick of dynamite and there is a crowd of people watching them betting and cheering like it's America's favorite pastime. You've just gotta love this stuff.There's some bad editing that makes me think that the original Italian version may have been longer but it's a unique and interesting film in spite of whatever minor flaws it may have.This was my first spaghetti western and now I'm hooked on the genre. Need I say more?".

It's an excellent score that could fit right into a Eurohorror movie yet it is totally appropriate for a spaghetti western as well. There is even a part where it sounds like they are using a theremin. The constant sound of howling wind is also a nice touch.In addition to the macabre there is also some classic spaghetti western craziness in this film. Luke Murdoch the brother of one of Django's targets is one of the highlights of the movie. He is wildly insane violent overthetop and very entertaining to watch. There is also a scene near the beginning of the film where two men are playing catch with a lit stick of dynamite and there is a crowd of people watching them betting and cheering like it's America's favorite pastime. You've just gotta love this stuff.There's some bad editing that makes me think that the original Italian version may have been longer but it's a unique and interesting film in spite of whatever minor flaws it may have.This was my first spaghetti western and now I'm hooked on the genre.

	schema:reviewBody "Django il bastardo directed by Sergio Garrone is a good intersting take on the mutitude of Django movies I have seen. The best are still the original with Franco Nero  the one Terence Hill did. I really feel that the biggest weakness of Django il bastardo was Antonio De Teff AKA Anthony Steffen as Django. He had a great coldness about him but it almost goes a bit too stiff at times. A rather traditional revenge plot that is always ok by me  with a bit of a supernatural tone to it.. Which is both creepy  makes for a good weird western. There are some great scenes in this movie.. The flashback scenes were well done in the sense that you as the viewer are not treated with the in case you didn't get the hints we dropped.. This is what happened that I see in other westerns from this era. I would have liked a less rigid Django but Antonio De Teff did create a different character for Django that I did enjoy. Is he a ghost? Is he real? The crosses bearing the names of the victims the soontobe victims faces reading the crosses with their names on them.. Great stuff. There are some really great scenes good acting and a twist on a character I have always enjoyed. I love the soundtrack again with the usual chants of Django which never get old to me. Worth checking out for sure.".

	schema:headline " Django drifts into a town on the high plains...";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm used to seeing cheap Italian films ripping off popular American movies but this may be the first time that I've seen it the other way around. In 1973 Clint Eastwood made a film called 'High Plains Drifter' and it's practically the same as this entry in the Django series! Well I say this entry in the Django 'series'  even though the central character is actually called Django this time the film still doesn't follow on from Sergio Corbucci's original and is more of a cashin on the name. Even so it's still a worthy Spaghetti western and one that is more than likely to delight said style of filmmaking's fans. Like Eastwood's later film Django the Bastard has a streak of horror running through it which stretches from small things such as the crosses Django leaves to his victims all the way down to the major plot points. The film follows a mysterious stranger who turns up in a small town. A man who is surprised to see him is promptly shot and killed and soon we learn that this stranger may not be among the living...Anthony Steffen takes the lead role as Django and delivers a performance that I don't like very much. The character is obviously meant to be enigmatic and brooding but Sheffen is really flat and it's hard to believe that this is a man who would even bother to take revenge. After having seen the likes of Franco Nero and Thomas Milian in the lead role Steffen's performance becomes even less enjoyable. However the story he finds himself embroiled in more than makes up for the actor's lack of emotion. The small town setting makes for a great claustrophobic atmosphere as Django seeks out and shoots his enemies. The gun battles are impressive and make for great entertainment. The dialogues can be a little clumsy at times but you can't go into a film like this expecting great writing. This film may have been a big influence on High Plains Drifter but in fairness Django the Bastard does take its own fair share from Eastwood's partnership with Sergio Leone. Several shots of Django are extremely derivative of Eastwood's Man with No Name and it was Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood that were responsible for immortalising the lone drifter character in the first place. Still this western is well worth seeing for fans of Italian cinema.".

	schema:headline " Django Meets The Man With No Name in a Supernatural Oater";
	schema:reviewBody "Prolific Spaghetti western leading man Anthony Steffan who imitates Clint Eastwood right down to slinging his serape over his shoulder before he whips out his sixshooter stars as a mysterious gunslinger who rides into Desert City looking to kill three of the town's most prominent citizens. Thirteen years ago it seems during the American Civil War a trio of Confederate officers sold out their men and let the Union Army overrun their camp and massacre them. One of those dead men reappears to settle the score with these wicked villains. In director Sergio Garrone's atmospheric but often crudely helmed oater Django coscripter Steffan shows up in town and draws attention to himself when he sticks a graveyard cross in the dirt with his victim's name on it. Indeed this is a rather distinctive way to garner attention and it works for the most part. The chief heavy Rod Murdok Paolo Gozlino of Son of Cleopatra has his gunmen run everybody out of town and then makes these triggerhappy gunmen hunt down the elusive Django. These hombres don't have much luck and most of them wind up biting the dust in this 107minute western. Ironically Murdok's younger brother sicklylooking Jack Luciano Rossi of A Man Called Sledge manages to disarm Django by using a woman and money to lure him into a church.Throughout Stranger's Gundown a.k.a. Django the Bastard the idea is that our protagonist is an apparition who returns to exact revenge on the elder Murdok and his two conspirators Howard Ross Jean Louis of The Treasure of San Gennaro and Williams Teodoro Corr of Roy Colt and Winchester Jack for their treacherous act of betrayal. Jack proclaims that Django isn't a ghost because he makes him bleed. Mind you we see our tortured hero bleed and nearly strangle from being hanged by Jack in a church. Nevertheless throughout this oater Django has a way of showing up with a minimum of fanfare and behaves like a specter. Occasionally the dialogue refers to him as 'a devil out of hell' but he relies on his longbarreled Colt's revolver to lay his adversaries to rest. Stranger's Gundown is pretty predictable as revenge westerns go. The villains are a slimy bunch and they earn their comeuppance. Near the end Django casts such a spooky spell on matters that some of Rod's hired gunmen turn against him and they blast it out between each other on main street. Inevitably after our hero kills Jack in the church he faces off with Rod in main street with unsurprising results.Although he acts like Clint Eastwood Anthony Steffan makes a memorable hero and it is his uncanny ability to imitate Clint that lends so much power and authority to his character. He dispatches the villains much as Clint might fanning his sixgun and sending them spinning. Stranger's Gundown boasts enough shootouts to assuage the appetite of any Spaghetti western aficionado. One of the more unusual scenes occurs early in the plot. Two men toss a sizzling stick of dynamite between each other while the spectators make wagers about who will win. This is probably of the more interesting scenes that has nothing to do with the revenge plot. The scenery isn't as stunning as in most Spaghettis but the hardware looks authentic. Everybody sports either a Colt's revolver or a Winchester repeating rifle. One character brandishes a Derringer. The Civil War scenes are okay with the soldiers toting Springfield muskets with bayonets. Garrone isn't the most polished of directors but Blood at Sundown lenser Gino Santini and he create some evocative shoots. The most memorable occurs at night as horsemen plunge out of nowhere with light behind them. Early in the action as Django saunters through a town Santini places his camera inside a barrel and uses the curvature of the barrel to frame a shot of our hero's moving boots. During a shootout in a house Santini and Garrone do a good job of thrusting us into the midst of the action particularly when a gunfighter impales himself on a machete protruding through a door. Rada Rassimov appears as a money hungry woman who wants to hit the trail with our hero at fade out. When she tries to join him Django vanishes into thin air.Stranger's Gundown is neither the first supernatural western nor the best but there is considerable reason to believe that it may have inspired the highly superior High Plains Drifter. No Stranger's Gundown doesn't surpass High Plains Drifter. Produced on an obviously lowbudget this western isn't one of the best Spaghetti westerns. It qualifies more as an imaginative but Brated sagebrusher not of the quality of the Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci westerns. It is also obvious that the filmmakers appropriated the name of the Corbucci hero. This Django is a rebel and he doesn't drag a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Altogether Stranger's Gun looks like an exploitative hybrid of the two Sergios but it is worth a look.".

It is also obvious that the filmmakers appropriated the name of the Corbucci hero. This Django is a rebel and he doesn't drag a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Altogether Stranger's Gun looks like an exploitative hybrid of the two Sergios but it is worth a look.";

	schema:headline " Horror Western is not the horror that some would have you believe...";
	schema:reviewBody "A most unusual item for an Italian western  or for a western from any source. There were probably twodozen films featuring the Django character first made famous by Franco Nero in Sergio Corbucci's DJANGO in 1966  and that's just counting the ones with Django in the title.  That film spawned as many imitators as the Sergio Leone film FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and while not all featured the name Django in the title there was a character with that name doing all of the shooting. From what I've seen of a sample of them they all appear to have the commonality of a hero clad entirely in black. This one stars Anthony Steffen Antonio De Teff who was previously in A FEW DOLLARS FOR DJANGO  thus proving the inspirational sources or at least the desire to repeat their respective successes. Whatever Steffen lacks in the terms of Eastwood's or even Nero's charisma he makes up for in his having coauthored the very original screenplay with director Sergio Garrone.Coincidentally what this may lack in terms of originality of being yet another Django outing it is actually more of an inspirational venture than an imitation. A gunman apparently returns from the dead to seek vengeance on those who betrayed him. Sound familiar? Does HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER come to mind? Other characters have flashbacks of him in his final moments  in the Eastwood film it is his character who has the flashbacks. Both films feature the gunman spinning around in a chair to shoot a few enemies but actually that was more an homage on the part of Eastwood and this film's director Sergio Garrone to a similar scene in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. The final shot of both THE STRANGER'S GUNDOWN and HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is most similar in theme if not in actual execution  in here Django walks rather than rides away.This Django appears in rooms and locales out of nowhere adding to the horror content  along with a music score similar to the both the Eastwood film and especially to some Hammer horror outings. One of his calling cards is to announce his arrival with a cross designed as a tombstone  the next victim's name and his date of death is marked on it. Unlike most vengeance seekers Django is clearly here to avenge his own death. In another scene he sends three dispatched villains back to town propped on horses with crosslike supports behind them in order that no one realizes until they are close that these men have gone to that great roundup in the sky.The performances are what one would expect  and after all hard to gauge via the often flat English dubbing. While Paolo Gozlino makes little impression as the head bad guy Rod Murdoch the character's nutty brother Luke does here Luciano Rossi provides the film's best performance with a character reminiscent of Klaus Kinski's hunchback in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE  minus the physical affliction. Luke is considered to be so stupid that his brother Rod had to pay a woman to marry him. But Luke isn't so dumb as he's able to capture Django twice  if only momentarily but that's more than any other character manages to accomplish. Luke is clearly more crazy than dumb but so are the guys in the Murdoch gang who play a game of catch with a stick of lighted dynamite.Much of the daylight cinematography is poorly lit yet Gino Santini does an admirable job in the night scenes of which there are plenty. It has its slow spots and the Civil War scenes appear to be done on the cheap but overall the few dollars appear to have been spent wisely. Not that the VCI transfer helps any  there are lines and scratches and some color distortion but at 10 bucks for the DVD I was happy enough just getting a widescreen transfer.".

I like it !!According to the press release from VCI this originally had an X rating for violence which might explain why it has a 1974 date on it even though the film was made in '69.  Not sure why that took place since there's nothing in this film to warrant that.  It certainly isn't any more violent than a lot of the other films of this genre.It has some decent gunplay as Django wreaks revenge on those three Confederate officers who betrayed them to the yankees but there isn't a whole lot of blood compared to say Fulci's FOUR GUNMAN FOR THE APOCALYPSE 1975.  Even the Eastwood trilogy has more blood in it than this one.The flashback to the Civil War scene also looked sloppy and stagy so don't expect a repeat of the Civil War scenes from THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Throw up a few tents and have a few extras fall unconvincingly.  It had to be filmed quickly I guess.Also Anthony Steffan is kinda bland compared to say Franco Nero or John Phillip Law which puts him in the REALLY bland category.  He doesn't look particularly like an antihero instead he looks like one of the bad guys. I guess that since he is a grimreaper type of character in this film you wouldn't want him to look the leading man.Thomas Weisser author of Spaghetti Westerns rates this one pretty high although I'm not as enthused about it as he is.  I'll still give it a 7 out of 10 more for what I consider the exceptional score than for the film itself.".

	schema:headline " Django The Ghostly Bastard";
	schema:reviewBody "Sergio Garrone's Django Il Bastardo aka. Django The Bastard of 1969 is referred to by many as a great creepy and particularly original Spaghetti Western. I am a Spaghetti Western enthusiast and although Django The Bastard is certainly not a bad film it is in my opinion overrated by many of my fellow fans of the Italian Western. Furthermore it is neither the only nor the first nor the best Spaghetti Western with Horror elements. This film also has the reputation of being the inspiration to Clint Eastwood's great High Plain's Drifter of 1973 and it might be true that parts of this movie inspired Eastwood but Django the Bastard does in no way reach the quality and style of Eastwood's film.First of all  Django The Bastard such as most of the other unofficial 'sequels' has nothing at all to do with Sergio Corbucci's 1966 masterpiece Django with Franco Nero in the lead. While the original Django is a former Union soldier the central character of the same name in this movie which plays in 1882 has formerly served in the confederate army. Django The Bastard is a movie that has its highs an lows. There are some excellent stylish and creepy moments one of my favorite scenes in the film is right in the beginning when Django sticks a cross with a name on it in the muddy ground of a Western town. However the movie sometimes just gets too boring in the middle. Most of the dialogue is not too refreshing either. There is one character i loved that is the character of Luke Murdoch played by Luciano Rossi the hideous and utterly insane younger brother of the local crime boss and rich landowner Rod Murdoch Paolo Gozlino. Luke who is desperately in love and obsessed with a woman named Alethea Rada Rassimov and often has a fit of extreme rage and insanity can only be calmed down by Alethea which is the reason why his brother keeps her locked in his mansion.Anthony Steffen Antonio De Teffe fits pretty well in his leading role of the creepy silent stranger although his performance is a little too stiff. As I mentioned above Luciano Rossi also does a great job as the crazy villain. Rada Rassimov whom you might recognize for her small role in The Good The Bad And The Ugly also plays her role pretty well.Django The Bastard is certainly an entertaining little Spaghetti Western but nonetheless I think it is overpraised by some of my fellow Spaghetti Western fans. Fans of the genre will certainly have a good time watching Django The Bastard but in my opinion it is not a mustsee. If you want to watch a truly great Spaghetti Western with horror elements and topics like resurrection in it I recommend Giulio Questi's surreal and excellent Se Sei Vivo Spara aka. Django Kill... If You Live Shoot! of 1967 with Tomas Milian in the lead before watching this. Still Django The Bastard is certainly not a bad film. It does have some very stylish and some pretty creepy moments and it is certainly worth the time. Recommended to enthusiastic Spaghetti Western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "All in all this is a pretty good example of the spaghetti western genre. Aside from a few brief instances in my youth I haven't really seen that many spaghetti westerns yet apart from the more popular Clint Eastwood ones so this was a good introductory experience for me. DJANGO THE BASTARD has the right look and feel about it with crisp photography capturing the barren desert land and the isolated town just right. The director Sergio Garrone was an old hand at these type of films and his solid direction proves this providing plenty of interesting camera angles most notably in the excellent opening scene showing a stranger walking into town via P.O.V. shots and good editing. An excellent music score also helps utilising the classic guitar string music associated with the genre and changing mood when needed to make things more exciting whenever the situation calls for it.For me the cast is totally full of unknowns yet all cast members are fine in their respective roles. The baddies are typically repulsive although Paolo Gozlino lends just the right touch of class as the boss. Lu Kanante on the other hand is a snivelling psychopath who shoots up a street full of men and women while laughing manically. His sudden death is well deserved and a welcome end for this repulsive weirdo. The woman playing his wife didn't get her name is also very good and thankfully her character is a wellrounded one a woman out for her own benefits. Anthony Steffen takes the role of Django and while he doesn't have the same screen presence as Clint Eastwood  or indeed Franco Nero  he's more than adequate at carrying the film when needed and invests his role with a likability towards the end which really gets us rooting for him.There are plenty of shootouts to enjoy although a few are poorly edited and therefore lack the necessary thrills. One gun battle between gangs of men is particularly well choreographed. The final twenty minutes are basically a protracted cat and mouse game between Django and the hired hands out to kill him and is pretty tense. While the film isn't very violent there's hardly a drop of blood on show there's a neat trick involving an unfortunate victim getting impaled on a cleaver sticking through a door  you'd have to see it to understand. I also welcomed the addition of a few macabre horror elements into the brew such as Django placing crosses in front of his victims before killing them or a few scenes set in cemeteries. There's also an ambiguity surrounding the character of Django who may or may not be a ghost. This makes things even better in my opinion. DJANGO THE BASTARD may not be a particularly original film taking too much from what has come before it and relying on a strict revenge theme rather than branching out in new directions but the execution is fine making this an easy and enjoyable film to watch.".

While the film isn't very violent there's hardly a drop of blood on show there's a neat trick involving an unfortunate victim getting impaled on a cleaver sticking through a door  you'd have to see it to understand. I also welcomed the addition of a few macabre horror elements into the brew such as Django placing crosses in front of his victims before killing them or a few scenes set in cemeteries. There's also an ambiguity surrounding the character of Django who may or may not be a ghost. This makes things even better in my opinion. DJANGO THE BASTARD may not be a particularly original film taking too much from what has come before it and relying on a strict revenge theme rather than branching out in new directions but the execution is fine making this an easy and enjoyable film to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "Antony Steffen plays yet another unofficial Django type character. A man in black face hidden by wide brimmed hat whom has the burden to place a cross bearing the name of the people that wrong him in the past into the ground. He haunts his victims like the Grim Reaper arrive to collect their soul. I like to think of it as WWE Undertaker the movie with his Gothic themes. Anthony Steffen might not have the same dark premise as Franco Nero but I have to give mad props to the man for trying. As you see at the time a lot of Spaghetti Westerns try to hook audience in by trying to connect their movies with other Spaghetti Westerns movie that has popular characters. You can see a lot of them sporting that their character is the same as the Man with No Name Sartana and in this case Django. According to the IMDb there were well over fifty of these Django imitations made. Unlike other movies that do this and have no similar themes. The film tries hard on the concept and really look like it could belong to a Django film. Still in the long run the film has really no connection to 1966's Sergio Corbucci's film Django but seem more influence by the Man of No Name character from the Sergio Leone 'Dollar' trilogy. Anthony Steffen is very stoic and subdued. People would say wooden but he under acts appropriately and does what he has to do. He knows how to be cool. The only problem is Anthony Steffen isn't that menacing. The more you got to see him the less he become cool as the movie went on. Honestly they shouldn't reveal way too much of his personality in the flashbacks. That was the fault of 1966's Django A Bullet for You. That character had nothing to do with Django. It made the cool ghost into an average man by the end. Django the Bastard also known as The Stranger's Gundown is a very interesting Spaghetti Western movie directed by Sergio Garrone. This movie was a key inspiration behind Clint Eastwood's 1973's High Plains Drifter and deserves credit for that reason alone. The execution however doesn't match the idea nor does it mine its full potential. The movie concept was better used in 1968's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. The plot is a traditional revenge film with a man who everybody think is dead seeking revenge on his killers. At less the movie made it believe that he was a ghost and that only epileptics and gypsies could speak with him. Obtaining an X rating on its initial Italian release due to its violence. It's now look upon as silly oneshot kills. Still it had a pretty memorable intense action like the two men playing hot potato with a live dynamite. I love how the whole town people were exile just for the villains to find this mysterious man hiding among them with his many men. It gave a near impossible fighting against the odd feel to the hero. The acting is alright for the most part but the actual villains the Murdock Gang are not that memorable. If anything they killed off Luke Murdock Luciano Rossi way too earlier. He is totally over the top insane and brutal. Rada Rassimov's character Alethea is a bit annoying with her money hungry greedy ego. Every scene with her and Django made me want to see her met her end. Sadly it never came. The English dubbing is a bit off with the mouthing. I really can't say that it's better with other languages. It was very flat dialogue. I did like the devil out of hell talk scene. The music score is very creepy and atmospheric. It set up the Gothic horror feel but in a fast paced. The real pacing in the movie is pretty slow. It get really boring at times at less in the beginning. The original version of this film has a precredits explanatory scene. The version released in the UK  the US places this scene the entire reasoning behind Django's motives in the film in a flashback later in the film roughly half way through the film rather than before the credits which is how it is presented in the Italian version. It kinda work and kinda didn't. It made the movie really confusing at first as he don't know if Django is supposed to be the villain or the hero. The camera work is great for the most part. Garrone uses innovative camera work to good effect. He cracked the camera glass when filming so he can give the three villains together with distort images. He uses a kaleidoscope affect in one scene. Also he filmed night scenes for almost half the movie. It was great not seeing day for night or the night scenes being way too dark. These are filmed in a skillful style that never obscures the view and keeps the film interesting. Very good direction for the most part. Some really awful shots had to be the odd church roping scene a scene where somebody walking by hit the camera on accident and the awful Civil War flashbacks in slow motion. Much of the daylight cinematography is poorly lit. There's some bad editing that makes me think that the original Italian version may have been longer but in my surprise the film wasn't cut up much as the normal running time is supposed to 107 minutes. Surprising for a Spaghetti Western. The picture quality is great. It kinda depends on where you get the DVD. There are some lines and scratches and some color distortion in some DVDs. In my opinion MCP  Studio Canal often get restored copies. Overall to combine the Horror genre with the Western with a somewhat mixed if interesting result. It's a unique and interesting film in spite of whatever minor flaws it may have.".

There is some very good photography from Gino Santini and while Steffen is his usual impassive self which actually works quite well here both Lu Kamante and Rada Rassimov are firstclass.

The same year's And God Said to Cain with Klaus Kinski shares many of its same features but manages to surpass Django the Bastard with ease.

But evidently my impression wasn't positive. It's promise of combining the two genres was overblown. Django The Bastard tried to create a seemingly supernatural atmosphere while at the same time keeping as close to reality as possible. And it failed.Anthony Steffen stars as Django a loyal honest soldier who is betrayed by his officers in the Confederate army and seemingly killed along with his whole detachment. Now he apparently has risen from the grave to exact his revenge. In the opening scene we see Django carrying a cross through town. He stops in front of a building and pins it in the ground. The men inside suspiciously examine Django while finally discovering that the cross bears the name of them. Further more on it is written the day of his death today. What follows is a traditional shootout that leads to the obvious conclusion Django now triumphant proceeds to punish all those responsible for the death of his comrades and his in a similar fashion.This movie has often been compared to Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter claiming that it's more or less been the inspiration. Honestly the only similarity found in both these movies is that they are presented as quasisupernatural westerns. On the threshold between supernatural and natural both posses characters that could or could not be spirits of vengeance. Such story is not anything new though and tales of such content have long existed in the western mythology. But Django The Bastard suffers from the inability to exploit it's features. The plot is shaky at best often contradicting itself. At one point we have the titular character displaying unexplainable supernatural abilities such as appearing from nowhere disappearing and even becoming transparent. While at another sequence Django gets beaten practically tortured forced to run and hide from bad guy's henchmen. These plot elements did a great job at leaving me confused but did little in creating that mystical atmosphere which was the supposed goal of the entire film. Django didn't feel supernatural because he was being beaten and didn't feel real because at one moment he became transparent. On other points of interest namely the acting. Anthony Steffen does have the intimidating look but his performance was lackluster and quite frankly it was flat. Nothing different can be said about the supporting cast. There was not a single character that made an impression in fact to be honest I forgot most of them shortly after I saw the movie.Cinematography was a mixed bag. There were some really nicely directed tracking shots and overall stable camera work. But the shootouts were unimpressive. Gorrene could have at least tried to put some more work in creating memorable action scenes to compensate for the secondhand plot. Ultimately what we get is a series of boring uncreative unsynchronized shootouts. What's even worse is that the gunneddown people tend fall in a slow irritating manner it's as if they are being careful not to get hurt. Hello ? They are a supposed to be dead. Finally the last thing worth commenting namely the score. It is as forgettable as everything else in Django The Bastard I was neither able to remember who composed or any specific tune.Django The Bastard might have a cool sounding name but it doesn't have much else to offer. It's a forgettable experience failing to tap on it's quasisupernatural plot with just a few minor sequences sticking out from the otherwise bellowaverage presentation.".

In a rare case...a USUK edit of an original Italian Western actually improves the film.I'm not suggesting that Strangers Gundown will find a place among the top non Leone SW...or jump to the top of anybody's list...but this little low budget affair is a pretty good one to take in...interesting entertaining... a little different.Recommended.".

I prefer the US edit.... the prehistory of 'Djangos' revenge campaign spells it all out for you.. .detracts from the air of mystery  who is this guy? that supports  sustains the movie's mood. In a rare case...a USUK edit of an original Italian Western actually improves the film.I'm not suggesting that Strangers Gundown will find a place among the top non Leone SW...or jump to the top of anybody's list...but this little low budget affair is a pretty good one to take in...interesting entertaining... a little different.Recommended.";

He walks through the empty streets and stops outside a saloon. He nails in the ground a cross bearing a name and that day's date. He's Django the devil from hell.Django the Bastard AKA The Stranger's Gundown is yet another in a long string of unofficial Django clone but sadly not among the top tier ones even by Django clone standards. Spaghettis were dime a dozen in the late 60's most of them shot on shoestring budgets over two weeks from identical scripts and sets with not much else going for them than a barebones script and the promise of European audiences flocking to the nearest cinema to sate their hunger of greasy Mexican villains and laconic nameless strangers.Antonio Steffen plays another unofficial Django. The novelty this time around is that his Django exists somewhere in the elusive field between lone ranger angel of death and vengeful ghost. If that sounds all too familiar yes this is the movie that was the key inspiration behind Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter and deserves credit for that reason alone. The execution however doesn't match the idea nor does it mine its full potential.The opening shot is cool but can't mask the movie's lowbudget. This is lowlowbudget and everything reflects that. The story is fairly simple but the narrative stretched thin with the pace suffering as a result. Some setpieces have a charm to them but can't take on their full impact due to a lack of budget. Steffen is very good on his role as the laconic Django that is influenced more by Eastwood's Man with no Name than Franco Nero's Django from Sergio Corbucci's original. He appears out of nowhere shoots people then disappears into the dark again making him an elusive force of revenge. There's a dark and brooding atmosphere running throughout the movie although it's not as successful in that aspect as Frank Krammer's original Sartana from the same year.So what we have here is a missed opportunity but not without its charm. As it is Eastwood's High Plains Drifter is a superior interpretation of the same idea but spaghetti western fans owe it to themselves to watch this forgotten little flick even out of genre curiosity.".

All the characters are either so deluded crazy rich girl Mia Farrow desperate middleaged hooker Liz Taylor or demonic scummy pedophile Robert Mitchum that watching it is like spending two hours in a psych ward with no attendants on duty. Also gripping is the atmosphere created by director Joseph Losey who was considered as a genius in the 60s and is pretty much forgotten today. With wideangle shots and a minimum of noise Losey reinforces his characters' isolation and solipsism by making London one of the most crowded cities in the Western world seem as empty and quiet as a tomb.The plot is a psychological inversion of the classic haunted house story  Liz and Mia take shelter from an outside world that threatens their relationship. And that relationship is to put it mildly weird. Mia lures Liz into her huge empty home because she resembles her late mother. Liz indulges Mia's fantasy because as a homeless prostitute she's in need of shelter plus she lost a daughter who looked a lot like Mia. This arrangement could be sweet to the point of treacly if these two grown women didn't enjoy doing things like bathing together and discussing exlovers. And Mia has a particularly repulsive exlover in Mitchum her former stepfather who started molesting the girl in her early teens. Though the experience clearly ripped Mia to shreds the creep still has some power over her and the film becomes a battle of wills between Taylor and Mitchum. Along the way there's a fake pregnancy a nightmarish seaside holiday and a visit to Mia's two horrid oldmaid aunts. The movie isn't particularly pleasant or coherent but it does pull off the impressive feat of telling its story the way its characters are experiencing it and that's pretty damn disturbing when you're dealing with a bunch of warped people. See it then watch a romantic comedy or something so you're able to sleep that night.".

	schema:headline " This IS entertaining more amusing than You'd think";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was to me surprisingly good. I have read the Ralph Benner review and many other user comments which have been very negative. Given that Maltin has given very positive reviews I realise that this film is an acquired taste of a movie. You have to be a certain type of person to really like it. As a Liz Taylor fan I do it by default however I was not prepared for how good Mia Farrow was here neither for how effective Mithcum was and how wonderfully the all interact with other. In all its dark tragic topic it has a certain absurd humor that completely took me. Some scenes are comically genius Monty Python couldn't have topped the absurdity of the restaurant scene where Mia Farrow's Cenci enters in an unexpected state with Liz's Leonora swiftly adjusting to Cencis madness.The DVDcopy of the film I recently purchased has excellent colour and image quality which gave justice to Loseys very detailed work with the environment and sceneries. The claustrophobic but yet shielding Victorian house is a secret hideaway for the women who have been deeply hit by tragic events. In their recluse they can revive and live out the relationship they have been deprived of in reality. I don't find their relationship necessarily lesbian although it is hinted that there are tendencies of sexual role playing of the two escepically when the man arrives in the form of a poignantly seedy and sexually beastly Mitchum. Mia Farrows Cenci is a seductive tease in spite of her absurd black long hair and pale white face.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was to me surprisingly good. I have read the Ralph Benner review and many other user comments which have been very negative. Given that Maltin has given very positive reviews I realise that this film is an acquired taste of a movie. You have to be a certain type of person to really like it. As a Liz Taylor fan I do it by default however I was not prepared for how good Mia Farrow was here neither for how effective Mithcum was and how wonderfully the all interact with other. In all its dark tragic topic it has a certain absurd humor that completely took me. Some scenes are comically genius Monty Python couldn't have topped the absurdity of the restaurant scene where Mia Farrow's Cenci enters in an unexpected state with Liz's Leonora swiftly adjusting to Cencis madness.The DVDcopy of the film I recently purchased has excellent colour and image quality which gave justice to Loseys very detailed work with the environment and sceneries. The claustrophobic but yet shielding Victorian house is a secret hideaway for the women who have been deeply hit by tragic events. In their recluse they can revive and live out the relationship they have been deprived of in reality. I don't find their relationship necessarily lesbian although it is hinted that there are tendencies of sexual role playing of the two escepically when the man arrives in the form of a poignantly seedy and sexually beastly Mitchum. Mia Farrows Cenci is a seductive tease in spite of her absurd black long hair and pale white face. Liz Taylors Leonora is a washedup prostitute and I agree with some reviewers that it is a shock to see Liz so plump and bloated she is actually fatter than in Who's Afraid of Virgina Wolf.

If that doesn't wet your appetite you have no taste buds. This story has stayed with me these many many years. My favorite line of Ms. Taylor is when she is imitating Robert Mitchum saying you could have killed yourself honey. Mitchum is the perfect male to fear and despise. The delivery is unforgettably a Taylor original! If you appreciate a movie that accentuates a couple of great actors in an unusual intense story this hits it like no other film.

Not quite in the same league as Losey's THE SERVANT 1963 or ACCIDENT 1967 similarly compulsive  and vague  examinations of relationships though some may disagree given that Leonard Maltin rates it 12 while the www.cultmovies.info website even goes all the way and awards it ! but it's certainly a film which should have received greater exposure over time I only know of one latenight broadcast on Italian TV some years back which I had missed.Needless to say this is a dialoguedriven film though the audio on Universal's nofrills R2 DVD comes off muffled on occasion and George Tabori's adult script provides many a juicy line for the actors particularly Robert Mitchum to sink their teeth in. Not surprisingly the film features quite a bit of mirror imagery  which is in keeping with the prevalent doppelganger theme. There is however an unusual emphasis on religion Taylor is a devout churchgoer despite being ostensibly a streetwalker! and often takes recourse in praying.Elizabeth Taylor was at her artistic peak during this time resulting in one of her most controlled and less annoying performances  though her reallife obsession with fashionable clothes and elaborate hairstyles proves a distraction alongside the psychological analysis on the lines of Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA 1966 the director is striving for! Mia Farrow as Taylor's surrogate childlike daughter is no less impressive here than her astonishing turn in ROSEMARY'S BABY 1968. Mitchum's role  which has a dash of CAPE FEAR 1962 in it  is arguably the most unusual he's ever played even more so than his unforgettable mad preacher in THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER 1955 in my opinion! and while I'd be interested to know what he really thought about the whole thing his leering and abusive verbally to Taylor and physically to Farrow interloper certainly lends the film an added charge of tension  not to mention another possible mode of interpretation! Pamela Brown and Peggy Aschroft are Farrow's elderly eccentric aunts  unacknowledged by the family being related to Taylor's deceased first husband whom they idolize they have resorted to kleptomania on their rare visits to the mansion! A couple of confrontation scenes  between Taylor and the greedy relatives and later between Mitchum and Taylor at the holiday resort  are very wellhandled and emerge as highpoints of the film. Ditto for the sequence in which Farrow goes bonkers when left alone in the house bringing to mind the Catherine Deneuve of REPULSION 1965 her death scene then  calling inaudibly for help after the departing Taylor  is equally harrowing. In this respect Gerry Fisher's velvety cinematography Richard Rodney Bennett's delicate yet playful score and Richard MacDonald's artful production design though thankfully Reginald Beck's editing is more or less straightforward  as it could easily have gone the way of the fragmented style of filmmaking championed by the likes of Richard Lester and Nicolas Roeg then coming into fashion! are the perfect partners in the consummation of Losey's distinctive vision on the screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "An aging prostitute who's lost a daughter and a rich waiflike young woman who's lost a mother meet and bond. This is the premise for Secret Ceremony. For my money a film had better have a pretty decent story to back up such an obvious conceit. As the cashchallenged Elizabeth Taylor character enters her surrogate daughter's gloomy mansion and spies the golden goose  and a particular fur coat  I wanted to scream Get out you bonehead! Can't you see that no good can come of this? But without boneheads poking around in places they don't belong there'd be no psychothrillers would there? The problem with Secret Ceremony is that there's only a little bit of this and a little bit of that. There's not enough suspense to conjure up a decent thriller and in fact precious little meat on the bone for a feature film even one as morose and dreary as this. In one scene Mia Farrow writhes in solo sexual heat against the kitchen table but that was merely embarrassing to watch. It's a clunker of a scene because  at least for me  the story just simply isn't engaging enough to support such indelicate goingson. Late in the film Robert Mitchum sleepwalks his way onto the set. The British turned out a lot of these moody psychodramas as I call them in the 60's and I'll mention a few really good ones Jack Clayton's Our Mother's House and The Innocents Bryan Forbes' Seance on a Wet Afternoon Losey's own The Servant a masterpiece with a disturbing ring of truth. Oh and a little Hammer Bmovie gem Die! Die! My Darling! which is a delightful breath of foul air. There's nothing to say that a film can't offer a little insight and be entertaining at the same time.".

	schema:reviewBody "One has to be in the right mood to accept this unusual moody psychological drama. Taylor plays a lowrent prostitute who still mourns the death of her young daughter. Farrow plays a disturbed flaky young lady who is having trouble reconciling the recent death of her own mother. Farrow bears a passing resemblance to Taylor's deceased daughter while Taylor is a dead ringer for Farrow's mom. One day these two meet on a bus and then again at a grave site and strike up a sort of unwritten even unspoken agreement that Taylor will assume the identity of Farrow's mother. Taylor can hardly believe her good fortune as the woman was wealthy lived in a spacious house full of antiques and enjoyed a closet full of designer clothes and luxurious furs. The fun doesn't last too long however when Farrow's two meddling aunts Ashcroft and Brown stop by to loot the place followed by the arrival of Farrow's lascivious stepdad Mitchum who is always on the go evading the fallout from his many instances of molestation and statutory rape. Things become more and more complicated until death and violence ensues. Taylor in one of her floundering periods as an actress and looking thick and matronly through much of the picture gives an uneven and incohesive performance. She's always been interesting to watch even when bad but this character lacks focus and motivation. This is not helped by the fractured means of storytelling and the spotty screenplay. She is at times unintentionally hilarious as she flops around and brays over various things frequently in cheaplooking tacky costumes none so bad as a loud purple patterned dress with white gogo boots. She does have one highglam scene near the end in which she's decked out in pink chiffon with embroidered flowers and a massive Alexandre of Paris hairdo. Watch her woof down a huge longshoreman's breakfast in the blink of an eye! Farrow while not particularly likable or accessible at least gives a very strong performance in a challenging part. Her dementia and manipulativeness is excellently presented. Mitchum is all wrong for his role. His accent or lack there of wavers hideously and he never seems like someone who would have been wife to Taylor and stepfather to Farrow. Most of his acting in the film is atrocious though he begins to rise to the occasion in a heated beach scene with Taylor. Very welcome and solid support is given by Ashcroft and Brown as the vaguely dykish sisters with sticky fingers and selfish hearts. The film has some sordid aspects to it though it stays reasonably smutfree. Farrow refused to film her big love scene with Mitchum so it was cut and note how a convenient and gargantuan sponge is always floating in front of Taylor in her bathtub scene. It has definite curiosity value and features interesting settings and situations but it's also challenging to get through and unclear at times. Perhaps multiple viewings will help. The hackedup TV version should be avoided entirely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Secret Ceremony has an excellent central cast in Elizabeth Taylor Mia Farrow and Robert Mitchum but unfortunately it really misses out in the most important area that being the story as while the film features a handful of interesting themes and ideas it never really seems to know what it wants to be and this results in a film that just feels completely pointless and thus will leave most viewers feeling cold. The film is based on a short story by Marco Denevi and primarily focuses on the idea of how people handle great loss. We focus on a young girl named Cenci who prowls the streets since the death of her mother. She's looking for a woman to call her mother and finds that in lookalike Leonora a prostitute who coincidently just happens to have lost her daughter also. Cenci takes Leonora back to her house and while it soon becomes apparent that Cenci is a few cards short of a full deck the pair soon form a strange and playful mother and daughter bond. Things are going quite well for the pair until Cenci's stepfather Albert turns up...The source material is a short story and at over a hundred minutes I wouldn't call Secret Ceremony a short film which largely seems to be one of the problems. Director Joseph Losey who previously made the underrated Hammer Horror classic The Damned gives the story too much time and since there isn't actually a lot of ideas the film does soon start to drone on. The only real saving grace is the performances. Elizabeth Taylor gives a strong leading performance as always and manages to keep things at least slightly interesting. Mia Farrow is also good although not as good as she was for Roman Polanski in the same year in the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby. It's a different and challenging role however and it gives the actress a chance to show her range. The real standout is Robert Mitchum as the detestable stepfather  he plays up to the role brilliantly. It becomes obvious very early on in the film that there's not going to be a point made at the end and unfortunately the film delivers on that promise. Overall there really isn't many reasons to bother with this film and I don't recommend anyone goes out of their way to find it.".

	schema:reviewBody "...this film is dirty.  I would think someone would have pointed that out by now but no.  The movie goes along with its tag bearing the words psychological thriller.  I wasn't thrilled but I was appalled at certain things.  I haven't seen anything this kooky since Psychotic and that put me off also.I watched this film very recently and I have yet to figure out what was happening.  I think Elizabeth Taylor was crazy and I'm sure Mia Farrow was crazy and Robert Mitchum was just a jerk.  I'm sure that there's more to it than that but I just missed it I guess.  The gist of this movie is there are two lonely women one is more of a child really that fate slams together.  They're forced to endure each other and at times they seem to care for one another but how could they?  This movie features the worst bunch of people.  Mia Farrow is an incestuous lunatic who pretends to be a little girl because her stepfather likes it apparently Elizabeth Taylor is a lonely prostitute a point which was never made clear who is racked with guilt and then Robert Mitchum comes in first in this hatefest as a statutory rapist.  Maybe this is one of those art films I've heard so much about.  They can be absolute crap but since they're art it's okay.  I have yet to understand all that nonsense.Basically to sum up if you want to see Mia Farrow try to make love to Elizabeth Taylor then this is your movie.  If that's something you find unappealing then skip this one.".

But he came up short with Secret Ceremony of which I still am trying to figure out just what was happening.Elizabeth Taylor plays an aging prostitute for whom Mia Farrow gets fixated on thinking Liz is her mother. Since Liz lost a child herself that works out well because the two at first fill a symbiotic need for family. And as Mia is one wealthy heiress Liz is thinking she's hit the jackpot.There are some dissenters however. Two of whom are aunts Peggy Ashcroft and Pamela Brown. To them Taylor says she's the American cousin of Mia's mom. Then there is the sinister Robert Mitchum who replete with beard that makes him look like a leprechaun on weed who is her estranged stepdad. He knows there ain't no American cousin. And Mitchum is a big part of the cause of Mia's psychosis. According to Lee Server's fine book on Robert Mitchum old rumple eyes got the part on the recommendation of Roddy McDowell to his friend Liz Taylor. It only involved a few scenes for Mitchum who sauntered through the part rather indifferently. Part of the reason he got it was Mitchum's uncanny ear for dialect and he goes in and out of an English accent which was proof positive of his indifference to the film. What he did enjoy was the company of Liz Taylor and her roistering husband Richard Burton. Those were two legendary drinkers Mitchum and Burton and they really enjoyed night after night seeing who could drink who under.Secret Ceremony will never rate on the top of any of the three main players film resume. Nor will director Joseph Losey be acclaimed for this one in the future.".

Watching all the people in this film try to figure out how to be detectives based on stuff they've seen in movies and read in books is hilarious not to mention smart.

The plot was fresh and having such humor with suspense is just too good. Another quality I enjoy in this movie is how Allen avoids an overpolished look. For instance the scene where a neighbor in the hallway asks Paul about a rent increase. The actor appears to stumble for the right word but Allen let the scene go that way giving it a very natural look. The restaurant scenes also portray realism with multiple conversations at one time a quality I love in all of his movies. This makes reviewing the movies interesting you pick up something new each time you watch it! Woody Allen's style is definitely an intelligent humor.".

They have just met their neighbors Paul Jerry Adler and Lillian House Lynn Cohen when Lillian dies. Because Paul is not that sad and is too ready to move on Carol becomes suspicious. When she is realizing certain strange events that has occurred her suspicion grows. Larry thinks it is pretty stupid but when a friend named Ted Alan Alda does believe her and helps her with the investigation he gets jealous and offers to help after all.Whether a real murder has committed is not the point I guess. Allen gives us standard movie situations ridicules them a little and betters them then. There is a scene where Allen and Keaton go from an elevator into a basement when the lights fall out. It is completely dark something we have seen more in thrillers and for some reason Allen is able to make this clich thriller scene suspenseful. There are more of these moments. Since this is an Allen film there are a lot of links to other famous movies the script itself is a little like Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' and famous scenes the ending in particular does a terrific job in reliving one of the most memorable scenes out there. It has to with mirrors I guess you know what movie I am talking about. This light Allen comedy is a terrific mystery story with brilliant touches that will be liked not only by Allenfans but by everyone who loves either comedy or mystery suspense.".

Woody is at his best when he has Diane Keaton by his side and this proves it.  A lot of his more recent movies haven't been good because he is pairing himself with much younger actresses who aren't as good at this type of comedy or who aren't good at all in the case of Helen Hunt.  This movie is hilarious even if you are my age 20.  I think it's refreshing to go the video store and rent a comedy that isn't either a stupid spoof or a teen comedy that plays like a rated R sitcom. This is a comedy that actually has a story and Woody has the best lines.

For some Allen will always be irritating no matter how brilliant the movie. Without a shred of pretension and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary slightly bookish not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder.It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling the doubts the revelations the sneaking around the giggling. It helps a lot that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. Huston is from California a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda nicely enough is a New Yorker for real.Don't expect anything deep hilarious or clever three of the many intentions in Allen's movies. But it's really well made superbly written acted with utter believability paced with snap and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period set designer photographer editor etc. almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first placea Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein.I loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leave it to Woody Allen to create interesting characters and funny dialogue. He plays Larry Lipton a New York City book editor whose wife Carol Diane Keaton becomes convinced that one of their apartment neighbors is a murderer. Half the enjoyment of this film is watching and listening to neurotic Larry as he reacts to his wife's excellent sleuthing adventure. She and Larry's friend Ted Alan Alda plot strategy on how to catch the presumed murderer much to the chagrin of Larry.Some of the dialogue is amusing like when Carol insists that Larry accompany her to the suspects' apartment for some serious nosing around. Says Larry I can't relax I'm in a strange man's apartment in my Tshirt and pajamas.My impression is that at least some of the dialogue is semiimprovised. Whatever the dialogue method the result is back and forth banter that sounds highly natural and convincing. When you combine this naturalistic style of talk with terrific performances by Allen Keaton Alda and several other actors the time flies by and you're sorry when the film ends.The murder mystery element isn't really believable. But that's okay since it's strictly ancillary to the characterizations and the humorous talk. Even so there is indeed a puzzle that will be solved by the film's end.Editing and cinematography are fine. Background music features 1930's and 40's pop songs. With all the NYC street scenes I even learned what New Yorkers mean when they refer to a crosstown bus.Normally I don't care for talky films. But the dialogue here is so clever that the cinematic experience is pleasant despite a talk heavy script. Manhattan Murder Mystery provides a lot of enjoyment at the expense of a neurotic character whose life is turned into a fun house of comically scary and startling events.".

The reunion of Keaton and Allen as a married couple Larry and Carol Lipton trying to figure out if their new next door neighbor has committed murder of his wife is their last film together and IMO the funniest. Angelica Houston and Alan Alda provide additional comic relief as friends helping the couple solve the mystery. For me Manhattan Murder Mystery 1993 is the most delightful and enjoyable of all Allen's films and I never laugh as much and hard as when I rewatch this comedywhodunit. I have been Allen's fan for many years and I've seen every movie he's made. Manhattan Murder Mystery may not be considered his masterpiece but it is very high on my list of all time favorite films and one of the most beloved comedies ever. It is so clever and funny that I would take it with me to any deserted island and if I felt lonely and down I'd watch the scene in the hotel's lift and the Allen's face when he delivers one of his funniest lines ever Claustrophobia and a dead body  this is a neurotic's jackpot! I believe Manhattan Murder Mystery has more witty and hilarious dialogs and oneliners than any of Allen's films and I enjoy every one of them. Allen claims to have indulged himself with this movie in which he referred openly to such classics of cinema as Double Indemnity Rear Window and The Lady from Shanghai. The third time collaboration of Allen and Marshall Brickman in writing the script Annie Hall Manhattan proved to be brilliant. The result is uniquely Allenesque  breezy joyous and absolutely fabulous.".

It was fun seeing him play the strongest partner in a relationship. The dialogue is hilariousone good line after another and the murder mystery itself is very intricate and interesting. Also there are a number of great old songs playing in the background that perfectly complement the movieespecially The Big Noise from Winnetka for when they drive across the bridge at night. And I loved that homage to Orson Welles Lady from Shanghai at the end.The acting is almost all great. Allen and Keaton are just wonderfulright on target and acting and speaking like an old married couple. Alan Alda pops up as Keaton's best friend. I never really liked him but he's OK here. Anjelica Huston looking incredible also pops up and gives a very strong and very funny supporting role. Also look for Zack Braff from the TV series Srubs in his very first role as Keaton and Allen's son !!!My only complaintthe jerky hand held camerawork.

The fun derives from the fact that these uppermiddle class New Yorkers make their life more interesting by trying to solve a murder. The story seems so warm and approachable  like Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days.The story of murder is mixed with wry humour and a little light violence. We go from a scene of a body being melted to a hilarious phone scene. It is this juxtaposition of genres that creates the films success. The actors are all immersed in their characters but sometimes they are off guard  and thank god too. We actually get genuine laughs from the actors. We see it here the ending and also in Annie Hall 1977 when Alvy Singer and Annie Hall are in the kitchen with lobsters.Furthermore the story is genuinely a good mystery albeit a light one. The film references are all their too  The Lady from Shanghai 1948for example. To some extent Allen expects knowledge from the viewer  the film references this film has them Face to Face in Annie Hall the reused but never stale jokes sock filled with horse manure gag...Annie Hall and Radio Days and various key figures of our times Freud spoke of a latency period...Wagner music...lots more.Visually the film is good too. The first few shots of New York were surprising for me. They were not as romanticised as previous films  at least not to me. It seemed more like a Michael Mann film with the city lights.So overall I am glad Woody lightened up. This film is accessible yet has many shades.

They portray the Liptons a regular N.Y.C. couple who suspect foul play from the elderly man in their building whose wife has suddenly died. Smooth smartly assembled nuttiness with sensational support from Alan Alda as a playwright with a crush on Keaton and Anjelica Huston putting off terrific comedic heat as a novelist.

Smooth smartly assembled nuttiness with sensational support from Alan Alda as a playwright with a crush on Keaton and Anjelica Huston putting off terrific comedic heat as a novelist. Wrapped up wonderfully with an homage to Orson Welles' The Lady From Shanghai. Great fun!  from ";

One of my favorite moments is when Larry compares the need to Carol returning to her shrink with a GM's recall. Another very funny moment is when the clumsy Larry plays the wrong tape during the phone conversation with Paul. If the reader wants to spend 104 minutes laughing watch Manhattan Murder Mystery since this film is funny even for those that are not fans of Woody Allen.

	schema:headline " A strong viable comedy by Allen that doesn't feel like an ode to the slapstick genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works.Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple named Larry and Carol Lipton respectively who are invited to coffee by Paul House Jerry Adler and Lilian Lynn Cohen who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television.The next day after returning home they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drewlike frenzy sneaking into the House's apartment invading their privacy and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish intrusive behavior but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted Alan Alda becomes entangled with the mystery at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention.This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion or lack thereof than it does the inherent murder andor mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband but almost as a way to cope with a dying less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world.Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling silly ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times.Allen and Keaton once more put on a fabulous show giving us believable characters to enjoy watching and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick.Starring Woody Allen Diane Keaton Alan Alda Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen.

	schema:headline " Diane Keaton is back ...";
	schema:reviewBody "After 20 years of marriage and with one son in college Larry Woody Allen and Carol Lipton Diane Keaton try to accommodate with each other's interests and from the very first hilarious exchanges we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialogdriven sequence we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extratime for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of Manhattan which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted Alan Alda encourages her. We get it Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous Husbands and Wives as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life.Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twincemetery raising Carol's suspicion. She had a heart condition he says Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point we know what she's about she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis.Indeed the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot if you do. The greatest delight of Manhattan Murder Mystery relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation her growing complicity with Ted and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox played by a scenestealing Angelica Huston a dark and sensual authoress and professional pokerplayer so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime solving process and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality like Ted for Larry Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After Husbands and Wives a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow Manhattan Murder Mystery feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar while it deserved some accolades it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen.

	onyx:emotionText "After 20 years of marriage and with one son in college Larry Woody Allen and Carol Lipton Diane Keaton try to accommodate with each other's interests and from the very first hilarious exchanges we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialogdriven sequence we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extratime for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of Manhattan which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted Alan Alda encourages her. We get it Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous Husbands and Wives as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life.Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twincemetery raising Carol's suspicion. She had a heart condition he says Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point we know what she's about she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis.Indeed the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot if you do. The greatest delight of Manhattan Murder Mystery relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation her growing complicity with Ted and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox played by a scenestealing Angelica Huston a dark and sensual authoress and professional pokerplayer so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime solving process and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality like Ted for Larry Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After Husbands and Wives a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow Manhattan Murder Mystery feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar while it deserved some accolades it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed I have much admiration to Mia Farrow and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in Husbands and Wives where not only her character but the actress herself looked both unhappy embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives.

	schema:headline " Delightful Murder Mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is based about a happily married couple Larry Woody Allen and Carol Lipton Diane Keaton in their midages settled in Manhattan. One of the neighbors dies of heart attack. Carol is depicted as a friendly and a nosy neighbor and is convinced that the death was a murder as she felt Lillian dead neighbor was too healthy to die of a heart attack and suspects that the husband was responsible for it. Carol takes it on her to solve the mystery of this murder otherwise the murderer will get away with a murder thus the name of the movie Manhattan Murder Mystery.Larry is shown as a simple man an editor in a publishing house who believes neighbor should mind their own business and wants to respect that. He is not a big fan of adventure of solving a murder mystery unlike his wife. Carol is driven by the urge to solve the murder mystery and teams up with the couples' friend Ted Alan Alda as she feels he is more enthused about nabbing the murderer.The movie is such a delight to watch. Even though there is a murder in the plot and suspense building up Woody makes sure that you as the audience don't miss out on your belly full of laughter. Woody has done an amazing job as a writer director and actor to make this gruesome murder mystery a complete comic experience. The onscreen chemistry that Diane and Woody share is just amazing and makes you believe they are truly made for each other. It reminds me of the couple in Annie Hall. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when Larry and friends calls Mr. House for ransom with a series of coordinated recorded voices. Woody is just hysterical with his clumsy way.The best part about this movie and most of Woody Allen's movies is the fact that it is very natural. The movie banks heavily on the witty script and the natural flow of conversations which makes you feel a part of the conversation rather than just an audience. Woody capitalizes on the imperfections and spoofs in the movie giving it a more realistic feel to the movie. I feel this movie is an all time classic evergreen and can be enjoyed over and over again. It's a complete family entertainment. I give this movie a 4er. If you have not seen this movie yet rent it or buy the movie and watch it as I am sure you will fall in love with the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen may be one of the most naturalistic simplistic and selfeffacingly unambitious filmmakers still working but he can fool you. Or at least he fooled me. The plot itself is very clever the murder plot being loaded with wit and old film noir and pulp novel knowledgability and the subplots and characters being typical Woody Allen tools accompany it with a successfully funny irony. It just seems so quick so fleeting so light.Really though there is a lot of nuance that goes into this little film. In some sense like a Billy Wilder film perhaps the reason for the film's early Double Indemnity reference Woody will use cinematic techniques very heavily but absolutely none of it is called to attention. There are minute details everywhere from an elusive black cat crossing during a seemingly inconsequential expository scene and the intent to keep decorative flowers in the foreground throughout shots of Woody and Keaton bickering about the possibility of foul play on the part of their neighbor. When Alan Alda is talking on the phone with Keaton at a questionable hour of the night he puts his beer on his coffee table and the camera stays on it evoking volumes about his character in relation to Keaton his loneliness his emptiness. This is all done so well indeed that the effortlessness can almost be mistaken for no effort. The cinematography is characterized by an almost entirely handheld quality simple pointing and shooting panning and zooming following the most elementary employments. But in the apparent deficiency of technique there is enormously effective technique. He relaxes our attention to aesthetics and so we feel that we're watching a light breezy little geriatric romantic comedy.Indeed a central theme of the movie seems to be indifference which tends to come with age when people seem to unfussily accept that there are many things they've never gotten to do and probably never will and in effect some like Woody's character seem to see life's reality as a place where nothing exciting happens so there's no reason to feel dejected because there's no point of comparison to make between yesterday and today. It gives the murder plot a refreshing sense of adventure for Keaton and Woody must awaken from his humble grind to save his marriage from her newfound sense of excitement.Sometimes its the unadorned format that gives the film stylistic release. There is one moment where Keaton glances out of a restaurant window at a passing city bus. This is the kind of shot that could've looked differently in the hands of nearly every other director. It's a murder mystery after all and one would take for granted the manipulation of light a sleeker film stock but no. It is as if we are looking not at a screen depiction but looking in real life at a passing bus on the street.The two have not lost any of their flare as a comic duo. Roughly thirty years after Sleeper Love and Death and Annie Hall they have a chemistry to which Woody's teamings with his other female leads cannot compare. They both have so much character even while playing the ageold staples of their acting careers Woody plays virtually the only role of his entire acting career. There's just a wise humility to their onscreen antics that keeps them ripe.".

I like the whole idea of a romantic comedy being set behind the scenes of the whole wedding game and some of the most telling scenes involve Robbie guiding Julia through the preparations with an insider's eye.Probably the funniest parts of the movie to me are those that play to Robbie's broken heart it's probably the best depiction of the depression of the newlydumped I've ever seen in particular I love the Kill Me Please song.

	schema:reviewBody "A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies. Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema but they're good fun and therefore get a thumbs up from me. The Wedding Singer however gets not one thumb up but both thumbs firmly up. So why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre? Is it the jokes? The beautiful female lead? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs? No it's that this movie has a lot of heart that's what makes it a winner.Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential 'loser'. He's a wedding singer and not a very good one either. He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs. It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding. His life gets worse one day his wedding day to be exact when someone doesn't turn up. The bride that is. Now in a deep spiral of depression our hero doesn't see any way forward. His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him even his newfound friend the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married. And to a man who doesn't deserve her I might add. I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next but even though it's a predictable ride trust me it's a ride you want to be on. Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor and for that reason he is almost universally disliked but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie. Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him his performance is both entertaining and believable and therefore is just right for the movie. Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast. She is the perfect girl in this movie all smiles and sunshine and it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start.As mentioned The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart. From the way that the characters interact with each other particularly Sandler and Barrymore it is obvious that they are in love. The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type womanising character. The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer all that matters is the love between two people. The movie says that love is all you need and that is a worthwhile message in any movie. The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other more serious movies with a similar message.Overall The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre. It will make you laugh and you will ultimately feel for the characters. The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face. The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss it's feelgood at it's best.".

This was the first movie that taught me what romantic chemistry was.  While you're watching it you not only want the characters Robbie and Julia to get together but you want Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to get together.  The chemistry is that strong.  A reason people especially guys don't like romance movies is because often the love between the leads seem contrived and forced.  Thankfully the Wedding Singer steers clear from that and actually allows you to have an emotional stake in the characters.Sadly the movie is slightly forgettable as it merely succeeds in its goals but fails to impress.

Oh my God the gaudy wedding gowns the screen brides wore. Back then you just couldn't get enough beads or sequins on a gown. Check out the Miami Vice references. The 1980's was definitely the Me decade. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best performances in a movie. His character had some depth. He and Drew Barrymore seemed like they had some great on screen chemistry going on too. She is just cute as a button in this role. If you want lighthearted fare and lots of laughs this movie is for you. I hear it's being made into a Broadway show as well. Wish I still lived in New York to be able to go see it.".

So why do I tolerate nay enjoy his performance in this movie?I think it's because this was one of his earlier efforts and as such he didn't have as much creative control as he does over the tripe he makes now. The comedy is family friendly but actually genuinely good for the most part the romance is just about on the scale of believable and the soundtrack is upbeat and fits the tone.Part of the success of this movie for me is the fact that it's a 90s movie about the 80s which we don't see very often. The result is the innocent naivet of the 90s mixed with the elaborate flamboyant extravagance of the preceding decade and it's a winning combination. It culminates in just a general 'feelgood' vibe that thrives in the midst of safe but quality comedy and a cheesy predictable yet satisfying narrative.Billy Idol's cameo is a highlight and fairly veteran actors such as Steve Buscemi turn in surprisingly adept comic performances alongside Sandler and Drew Barrymore as the romantic leads. The shame of course is that people will form an opinion of this move when they see Sandler's face on the front and it may well turn them away from a corny yet very good comedy worth seeing. 710.".

It is a comedy classic and my only beef with it is it makes me miss the 80's so much! Basically I love this movie! Nothing more nothing less. Wedding Singer is among my top 20 favorite movies everone of the best comedies and GREAT music as well! The best of the eighties musicand I do count you spin me round as one of them! This movie pays tribute to a great time period and retains a place in my heart as both sweetsentimental and roll on the floor funny. Watch it if you haven't you will be hysterical.

Drew Barrymore is Julia the sweet girlnextdoor who wins Robbie's heart and gives him something to live for. This is the sort of role Drew is perfect for and it's a shame we don't see her like this more often.

Contemporary music and MTV with all its real world shows are not the same as in the eighties. I become very nostalgic watching this film. I remember all the songs the Madonna look of the moment the Rubix cube Freddy Kruger etc. It is hard to believe that it's almost twenty years since 1985. It was much better in 1985 for me I was still a child and there were always music videos on MTV. They weren't just concert videos neither. They told little stories. I wished that we were still in the eighties with the music and culture. Besides all the eighties stuff they never tried to outdo it in the film. It really is a beautiful sweet love story between Drew Barrymore's character Julia and the wedding singer Robby Hart. I love the flight to Vegas and I won't spoil the ending for anybody else. The scenes at reception hall were always a pleasure to watch and a great cast. I love watching fellow SNLJon Lovitz Laura Kightlinger Kevin Nealon play even small roles. I loved Ellen Law playing Rosie. She was the best supporting character in this film. The fact that Billy Idol is also in it playing himself is another reason to watch. I wish there were films about the 80s.".

She is nothing less than adorable and as an actress raises Sandler up out of his usual routine. The opening sequence with the credits is absolutely one of the best starts of a comedy ever filmed. The guest cameos are stunningly hilarious especially Steve Buscemi. The movie does drag a bit in the middle but overall it is a very good romantic comedy and for Adam Sandler a true work of art.".

She is nothing less than adorable and as an actress raises Sandler up out of his usual routine. The opening sequence with the credits is absolutely one of the best starts of a comedy ever filmed. The guest cameos are stunningly hilarious especially Steve Buscemi. The movie does drag a bit in the middle but overall it is a very good romantic comedy and for Adam Sandler a true work of art.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this after having watched it once long ago probably back in the VHS days late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today in 2011. I rarely laugh out in the movies especially alone but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help but root for them to somehow get together. Of course several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods ex. from nice or sad to angry and back again especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh because the lyrics are so grim but because of his performance you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song but does it so desperately.You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing especially that famous Boy George song. I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lipsyncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the now outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons.The Wedding Singer despite being a romantic comedy is not that predictable or conventional if you consider amongst other things how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie some of us like me will likely never ever find true love but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweetnatured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure.Rating 9 out of 10 excellent".

	schema:reviewBody "Adam Sandler had made generally secondrate comedy fillers prior to The Wedding Singer. Films like Billy Madison Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore  very straightforward runofthemill comedy films. The Wedding Singer has a lot more to it than that and is a surprisingly enjoyable and witty romantic comedy. The trick is very simple  it's a film about people. No fancy plot devices no special effects no action thrown in to spice things up  just real and funny characters caught up in a situation that anyone can identify with.In the 1980s wedding singer Robbie Hart Adam Sandler makes friends with a pleasant waitress named Julia Drew Barrymore at a wedding party. The pair of them get on incredibly well but neither notices the chemistry between them as both are already engaged to their respective lovers. In Robbie's case the attractive but incompatible Linda Angela Featherstone in Julia's case the successful and materialistic Glenn Matthew Glave. When Robbie is jilted at the altar by Linda he sinks into depression but is helped through the tough times by Julia. During this time he realises that he actually has feelings for her a fact that Julia herself also awakens to. Julia begins to have serious doubts about whether she truly wants to spend the rest of her life with Glenn but her family and friends convince her that she is merely suffering from a few prewedding jitters. However when Robbie finds out that Glenn is a love rat who sleeps around with other women he realises that the time is right to declare his love to Julia. But circumstances conspire to jeopardise his plan and Robbie has to chase Julia to Las Vegas before she unwittingly marries the wrong guyWhat makes the film better than a standard romantic comedy is the clever '80s background with clothing fashion hairstyles music tastes and phrases all perfectly captured from the era. In one great scene Robbie instructs Linda to stop wearing his Van Halen Tshirt please get out of my Van Halen Tshirt before you jinx the band and they break up! Little subtle gags like this run throughout the film and make it a pleasure to come back for repeat viewings. The dialogue is generally very good with lots of quick witted sarcasm and oneliners. But the film remembers also to set aside time for the emotional and romantic elements so that it doesn't just become a soulless gagfest. Sandler proves for perhaps the first time in his career that he is a likable and subtle actor capable of creating a character with personality rather than sticking to type. Similarly Barrymore gives her sweetest performance in years  the chemistry between them is unexpectedly warm and genuine. Indeed the entire cast create memorable and amusing characters right down to a hilarious cameo from Billy Idol. There's really not much wrong with The Wedding Singer  it's a little conventional and the outcome is wholly predictable but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise wellmade engaging and genuinely funny comedy flick.".

	schema:headline " The Genius Of Peter Sellers";
	schema:reviewBody "The inimitable Peter Sellers strikes again as Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau in this fourth installment of the classic Pink Panther' series The Pink Panther Strikes Again' directed by Blake Edwards.  Given the fact that the assessment of comedy is intrinsically subjective this film is arguably laugh for laugh and sight gag for sight gag the funniest of the five followed closely by the second of the series the hilarious farce A Shot In The Dark.  In this one former Chief Inspector Dreyfus Herbert Lom is about to be released from the mental hospital in which he has resided since being driven crazy by Clouseau when on the very afternoon of his hearing he is visited by none other than Clouseau himself who has come to speak on behalf of his former boss.  Suffice to say that by the time Clouseau is through helping' he is driven from the premises by the relapsed raving madman Dreyfus.  And it's only the beginning of the inept French Inspector's antics that before it is over will include a trip to the Ocktoberfest encounters with a dozen hitmen from around the world a beautiful Russian spy named Olga LesleyAnne Down a surprise Egyptian spy who will remain nameless and a oneman assault on a castle. As Laurel and Hardy proved so many times before for every action there is a reaction a theorem of which proof is unequivocally provided here by the relationship between Sellers and Lom.  This was the film in which Edwards and his stars not only further devised but honed to perfection their foolproof formula for laughs  After the first wave' of hilarity provided by Sellers it is followed up in just enough instances to be totally effective by Lom's reaction to 1.  Sellers directly as in the first classic scene at the mental hospital or 2.  Lom's reaction to Seller's antics as they are related to him by a third party.  It's a onetwo punch that never fails and which in effect derives twice the fun from a single gag.  And it's brilliant.  But at the end of the day it must be noted that there is one element above all else that accounts for the success of this film and that of course is the Man himself Peter Sellers. Sellers must be regarded as if not the' then at least one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  There was no end to the ways he could make you laugh from the subtlest expression an eye averted or perhaps the slight raising  of an eyebrow to the broadest slapstick it was all within his personal domain and he was the Master.  Physically practically all he had to do to get a laugh was show up consider the scene in which he arrives at the hospital to visit Dreyfus  As he saunters across the lawn of the vast grounds surrounding the buildings a croquet mallet and ball lying to one side catches his eye there is just the slightest hesitation in his step the subtlest change of expression in his eyes and the merest inclination of the head.  And there in that briefest of moments upon the screen you know beyond the shadow of a doubt what is about to transpire.  And you're right a moment later Clouseau has the mallet in his hand and his foot on the ball and even as it's happening just as you knew it would in that split second before it did he has you on the floor laughing.  That was the gift and the genius of Peter Sellers.  Was every film he made a classic?  A great film?  Of course not but you would be hard put to find a single performance of his even in a bad film Like 1970's There's A Girl In My Soup' that did not embody that unique spark that defined him.  It was certainly alive in his portrayal of Clouseau possibly the definitive Seller's character and in retrospect what a shame it seems that there were only five Panther' movies ever made.  But so it is and shall ever be. The supporting cast includes Burt Kwouk as the ever faithful and attacking manservant Cato Andre Maranne Francois Colin Blakely Alec Drummond Leonard Rossiter Inspector Quinlan Richard Vernon Dr. Fassbender Briony McRoberts Margo and Michael Robbins Jarvis.  A funny movie that showcases one of Cinema's truly unique and funny actors The Pink Panther Strikes Again' is a sidesplitting fun movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of.  The best of the series it stands as a glowing tribute to the comedic genius of Peter Sellers.  I rate this one 1010.".

And you're right a moment later Clouseau has the mallet in his hand and his foot on the ball and even as it's happening just as you knew it would in that split second before it did he has you on the floor laughing.  That was the gift and the genius of Peter Sellers.  Was every film he made a classic?  A great film?  Of course not but you would be hard put to find a single performance of his even in a bad film Like 1970's There's A Girl In My Soup' that did not embody that unique spark that defined him.  It was certainly alive in his portrayal of Clouseau possibly the definitive Seller's character and in retrospect what a shame it seems that there were only five Panther' movies ever made.  But so it is and shall ever be. The supporting cast includes Burt Kwouk as the ever faithful and attacking manservant Cato Andre Maranne Francois Colin Blakely Alec Drummond Leonard Rossiter Inspector Quinlan Richard Vernon Dr. Fassbender Briony McRoberts Margo and Michael Robbins Jarvis.  A funny movie that showcases one of Cinema's truly unique and funny actors The Pink Panther Strikes Again' is a sidesplitting fun movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of.  The best of the series it stands as a glowing tribute to the comedic genius of Peter Sellers.  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was the fourth movie in the Pink Panther franchise and despite the title the titular diamond that was the namesake of the original and The Return of has nothing to do with this entry. By now Pink Panther had come to mean not gimmick for the sake of a comedy plot but the world of the wonderfully inept Inspector Clouseau and a vibrant brand of latterday screen slapstick.One of the most consistently brilliant elements of the earlier pictures was Clouseau's relationship with the increasingly demented Dreyfuss. For The Pink Panther Strikes Again this relationship becomes the central premise of the whole movie. As such the scope is there for moreorless continuous comedy with very little else to complicate it. Apart from that is a James Bond spoof slant with Dreyfuss taking on the role of the eccentric super villain. This in turn allows for some largescale actiony gags reminiscent of the wilder escapades of silent comics Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Peter Sellers's stunt double Joe Dunne received a lot of work here.This also allows for a greater part to be taken in comic staging by director Blake Edwards. A Shot in the Dark was nearly all Sellers and that was very good in its way but for Strikes Again we really get to see Edwards's outsize and somewhat surreal comic creations at their most unbridled from the perfectlytimed three way fight between Clouseau Cato and Dreyfuss to Clouseau's bungled attempts to get into Dreyfuss's castle. But Edwards still has a way with the smaller comedy confection as usual his trademark tactic being to make almost everything invisible to the audience showing just enough to make a gag work. For example there is a very funny setup in a public toilet where we only see the feet at the bottom of the cubicles.There's a lot of verbal comedy too in the Blake EdwardsFrank Waldman screenplay which is of a middling quality and gets a little tiresome at times. But as we see for example in the scene where Sellers interrogates the professor's house staff Sellers and Edwards have brilliant timing in punctuating a talky scene with physical gags. Occasionally the humour gets just a little too silly and there are a lot of clichs  such as the that is not my dog line which I'm sure predates this movie and the steppingonarake gag which predates cinema.But perhaps this latter is a deliberate tribute to the staples of slapstick. It becomes apparent as Clouseau inadvertently survives numerous assassination attempts that he succeeds purely by virtue of the fact that he is a slapstick hero and a wake of chaos must follow him wherever he goes. It is a kind of metacomedy. And herein lies one of the slightly disappointing things about this movie. Often Clouseau is saved not directly by his incompetence but by sheer luck. When a giant pretzel stops him getting skewered by a killer disguised as a buxom wench it is funny but it is not really a Clouseau gag. It seems with Sellers's lessening interest in the franchise not to mention the heart condition which kept the aforementioned Mr Dunne employed that perhaps the character around whom the whole thing revolved was beginning to be watered down.".

Started off well but then soon outlived their welcome in my opinion  I mean a French policeman with a silly accent  just how much milage can you get out of that ? But this 1976 offering is probably the best in the series simply down to the fact the best laughs are darkly comical rather than slapstick  an early example with Clouseau asking  How ?  to be followed a couple of minutes by a laugh out loud scene featuring a couple of old ladies . There's also a very funny sub plot of the world's best assassins trying to bump off Clouseau which includes several funny scenes . I don't feel any guilty at laughing at people dying in this movie There are some weaker points like an overlong scene where Inspector Quinlan gives a shocked look which is embarrassing rather than amusing  and as some of the other people on this page has mentioned the movie does feel rather episodic at some points but I have no hesitation in saying this is Blake Edwards funniest comedy".

Started off well but then soon outlived their welcome in my opinion  I mean a French policeman with a silly accent  just how much milage can you get out of that ? But this 1976 offering is probably the best in the series simply down to the fact the best laughs are darkly comical rather than slapstick  an early example with Clouseau asking  How ?  to be followed a couple of minutes by a laugh out loud scene featuring a couple of old ladies . There's also a very funny sub plot of the world's best assassins trying to bump off Clouseau which includes several funny scenes . I don't feel any guilty at laughing at people dying in this movie There are some weaker points like an overlong scene where Inspector Quinlan gives a shocked look which is embarrassing rather than amusing  and as some of the other people on this page has mentioned the movie does feel rather episodic at some points but I have no hesitation in saying this is Blake Edwards funniest comedy";

Once again the detective is up to his clumsy ways of trying to save the world away from a man who has a machine that will make very important things disappear maybe even a city or country! My favorite scene was definitely when the detective dresses up as a dentist and comes to the villain's toothache pains. The laughing gas gets to both of them and together they just have a good time pulling out teeth that don't need to be pulled out. This is a pretty entertaining movie and I'm now kind of interested in seeing the remake. Hopefully it's a good one.710".

Often compared to Revenge of the Pink Panther from two years later this adventure had no reference to the priceless Pink Panther diamond but that didn't stop it from being simple daft humour. Sadly though with a grating period in England the story didn't have the same consistency as the previous film.In The Pink Panther Strikes Again Clouseau's former boss Charles Dreyfus an extreme but funny portrayal by Herbert Lom is on the run from a mental institution. Kidnapping a scientist Dreyfus has only one request. In exchange for not destroying the world he wants our bumbling hero dead. Unfortunately for Dreyfus even with the world's finest assassins on his case this doesn't appear possible.Evil Mastermind for the first time Herbert Lom continues to be battered and bruised but with a new sense of purpose. His extreme nature and how he reacts to events breathes an air of freshness into this film. In truth against any other comedy genius he'd probably have stolen this film. How unfortunate then that once more as Clouseau Peter Sellers is absolutely stunning. Sellers' comic timing is so spot on at times that he makes us laugh without seeming to even try. Despite this though The Pink Panther Strikes Again fails to live up to the genius of the previous film. The main reason for this is that unlike Return of the Pink Panther Blake Edwards' script is an inferior piece relying perhaps too much on relocating the bumbling Inspector around the world and putting him into sketch scenes in different countries. If Edwards had thought up a slightly more consistent plot then perhaps we could be looking at the finest of the series. Instead though all we have is a middle of the range encounter.The Pink Panther Strikes Again is a funny film. With Sellers and Lom both on form you'll be laughing for the most part. Sadly with scenes in London not pulling their weight and with an inconsistency to the plot their ability is misplaced and the film suffers as a result. It's still a Pink Panther film and as such it's still great fun to watch but compared with alternative films in the series it's far from the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes Blake Edwards keeps repeating the same gag over and over. How many times do former Chief Inspector Dreyfus and the current Chief Inspector Clouseau have to fall into the water? In Dreyfus's case it's a duck pond and in Clouseau's case it's a castle moat but I count at least eight in this movie. In the end of Return of the Pink Panther the audience saw Dreyfus in a mental institution which is where he is preparing for a hearing to be released from here every day in every way feeling better and better. It's obvious that in a world without Clouseau Dreyfus would be a completely sane man but like that one coworker nobody can stand but can't get rid of Clouseau is the Christmas Fruit Cake that keeps coming and coming every year. Clouseau makes the mistake of coming to see Dreyfus on the day of his hearing and makes the matters worse driving Dreyfus back over the cuckoo's nest and more determined than ever to kill Clouseau and destroy the world in the process if he has to!References to Lom's earlier roles as Napoleon and the Phantom of the Opera are made here as part of a loving tribute and as a result Lom pretty much ends up stealing the film reminding me of one of those delicious old movie serial villains you hiss at but somehow admire for their raw determination to reach an evil goal. There's no pink panther diamond here only the visual of the pink panther in the opening and closing credits haunting Clouseau through some very clever movie moments one having Mr. Pink in Julie Andrews' Maria Von Trapp on the hillside postulant dress. Andrews makes a brief vocal appearance having recorded Until You Love Me and seeing her voice played back at a different scene for the drag bar sequence with Michael Robbins in hideous drag lipsinking to the record as he makes his moves on Sellers. It's a rare 70's glimpse into a gay establishment filled with stereotypes yet not offensively done. The yellow face references to Cato Burt Kwouk remain and might draw some awkwardness but it's part of the period and who can deny the hysterical antics between Clouseau and his hysterically funny if violent valet? The scenes at the Oktoberfest come off very well too with a German song that sounds like Booby Bundy playing in the background as a large hitman in drag with daggers in his falsies stalks Sellers. Omar Sharif makes a brief cameo as the Egyptian hit man and is very funny although I found LesleyAnne Down's appearances as the sexy Russian spy distracting and the one element that slows down the movie to a hault. The castle sequences are hysterical especially the famous bit with aged hotel clerk Harold Berens Sellers in disguise as a dentist and Lom's attempts at torturing one of his kidnapping victims. Some audiences today might find the erasing of the United Nations building a little too close to the destruction of the World Trade Center 25 years after this was made but representations of some political figures of this time Gerald Ford Henry Kissinger are very funny. This is a goofball picture if there ever was one and one of the best comedies of the 1970's that stands out from the other weaker entries in the series. Edwards went all out with this one and even if some of the gags just seem desperate there's a charm to them that can't be denied.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here is a slice of classic comedy. The Pink Panther Strikes Again is the third film in the Pink Panther saga and it is arguably one of the strongest in the series. It picks up where the second film left off with Charles Dreyfus the villain from the second film escaping the mental institution he was admitted to. After he escapes he swears his revenge on the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau. He does so by building the ultimate Doomsday machine capable of destroying whole cities. He threatens to use this machine unless Clouseau is killed. The whole of the film delivers some of the most amusing and riotous gags from the bumbling Clouseau and unlike the first film it was a complete delight to watch from start to finish.The only other Pink Panther film I've seen is the original and I wasn't impressed. The film was simply just mildly amusing as opposed to truly funny. The Pink Panther Strikes Again accomplishes what the first film couldn't and is actually very funny. There are a lot of jokes and gags to laugh about in this movie both visual an verbal. It takes all the antics that were present in the first film and utilizes them much more effectively to make the film a hilarious experience. The jokes never go on too long but are drawn out just enough to make each silly antic worthwhile and everything from smile inducing amusing to laugh out loud hilarious. This movie is comedy done right. It's goofy but smart and there's a lot to be said about that.After the first two movies Peter Sellers was ready to perfect his role for the third film. And perfect it he did. Jacques Clouseau was a great character in the first film and arguably the best thing about it. But by the third film Sellers had mastered his portrayal of this bumbling inspector fueled by dumb luck that saves his life every time. Everything Clouseau does in this film provides a laugh. The originality of his character is uncanny and it makes him so much fun and such a riot from start to finish. He has grown a little sillier and slightly more bumbling since the first film but it still isn't overplayed or annoying in any way. His goofiness doesn't tire in any way. Peter Sellers as Jacques Clouseau is pure comedy gold.As far as the story goes in The Pink Panther Strikes Again there isn't much to it. It's fairly straight forward but its nothing worth complaining about. If you go into a pure comedy like the Pink Panther series expecting a groundbreaking mystery story then you are clueless. The storyline in this movie isn't complex and obviously lacks the kind of depth you will see in a drama but that's understandable. The best thing I can say about the story is that despite not having the kind of complexity as a heightened drama or thriller it isn't a completely brainless and idiotic comedy. It definitely has a story with plenty of fun characters and accomplishes a lot more than your typical idiot comedy does. I can really commend a comedy when it does this.I was very happy with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Overall I'll never enjoy a comedy like this as much as a drama but that is solely out of personal taste. But despite this I can't say that this film in any way a bad film and I definitely found it worth my time. It is a very funny movie and Peter Sellers is so memorable as the wacky Jacques Clouseau. As far as comedies go this is a very well made film. A film like this will never make it onto my list of favorite films but I can definitely enjoy it for what it is.".

It takes all the antics that were present in the first film and utilizes them much more effectively to make the film a hilarious experience. The jokes never go on too long but are drawn out just enough to make each silly antic worthwhile and everything from smile inducing amusing to laugh out loud hilarious. This movie is comedy done right. It's goofy but smart and there's a lot to be said about that.After the first two movies Peter Sellers was ready to perfect his role for the third film. And perfect it he did. Jacques Clouseau was a great character in the first film and arguably the best thing about it. But by the third film Sellers had mastered his portrayal of this bumbling inspector fueled by dumb luck that saves his life every time. Everything Clouseau does in this film provides a laugh. The originality of his character is uncanny and it makes him so much fun and such a riot from start to finish. He has grown a little sillier and slightly more bumbling since the first film but it still isn't overplayed or annoying in any way. His goofiness doesn't tire in any way. Peter Sellers as Jacques Clouseau is pure comedy gold.As far as the story goes in The Pink Panther Strikes Again there isn't much to it. It's fairly straight forward but its nothing worth complaining about. If you go into a pure comedy like the Pink Panther series expecting a groundbreaking mystery story then you are clueless. The storyline in this movie isn't complex and obviously lacks the kind of depth you will see in a drama but that's understandable. The best thing I can say about the story is that despite not having the kind of complexity as a heightened drama or thriller it isn't a completely brainless and idiotic comedy. It definitely has a story with plenty of fun characters and accomplishes a lot more than your typical idiot comedy does. I can really commend a comedy when it does this.I was very happy with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Overall I'll never enjoy a comedy like this as much as a drama but that is solely out of personal taste. But despite this I can't say that this film in any way a bad film and I definitely found it worth my time. It is a very funny movie and Peter Sellers is so memorable as the wacky Jacques Clouseau. As far as comedies go this is a very well made film. A film like this will never make it onto my list of favorite films but I can definitely enjoy it for what it is.";

This is like a life action road runnerWile E. Coyote movie. Along with The Great Race this is perhaps his most cartoon like comedy. The slapstick and timing of it in this movie is amazing and it of course also obviously work out due to the comical brilliance of Peter Sellers.Out of all the Pink Panther movies this is the one with the most laughs and classic comical moments in it. Great moments such as the slow motion fight between Clouseau  Cato it's the best Clouseau vs. Cato fights out of the whole series in which Dreyfus also somehow gets involved the Oktoberfest sequence the questioning of the staff Clouseau trying to enter the chteau Clouseau disguised as a dentist and I'm sure I'm forgetting many more great sequences. It are all moments that just bound to make you laugh even if you really don't want to. For the comedy and the story itself is actually quite lame and predictable. You can often see things coming from miles away but this seriously doesn't make it any less funny to watch. Perhaps its even somehow part of the reason why it works out so incredibly hilarious. It's obvious that Blade Edwards and Peter Sellers both were lovers and inspired by the slapstick comedies of the '20's and early '30's. This movie features the same type of comical approach but not in an old fashioned way. The Clouseau character is still 'modern' and the approach original even if it all has done somewhere else before.Of course most credit goes to Peter Sellers. He was a brilliant comedian who never tried to be funny but simply just was funny. The way he handles all of the comedy within this movie is just brilliant. It are not just the antics but also the accent and other small subtle things that made him great and turned Chief Insp. Jacques Clouseau into an absolute classic comedy character. Even if you've never seen a Pink Panther movie you still know who Jacques Clouseau is.But also the other actors deserve credit. Especially Herbert Lom who just as Sellers doesn't try to be funny and instead plays a mean hateful character who at the same time is of course totally hilarious. He is especially great in the scenes with Sellers the two of them had some great interaction and chemistry together.If you've never seen a Pink Panther movie and you have to see just one be sure to watch this one.

While to the casual viewer the film may seem shallow and all fluff which is how the LA metal was widely portrayed if one looks past the hair excess bravado t  a and flowing alcoholit is easy to uncover the painfully lonely opportunistic naivet' of the struggling bands and even some of those who made it. The scene with Chris Holmes guzzling vodka in his pool was simply heartbreaking...and the expressions on his mother's face were fully able to convey her harsh reality. Some of the classic performers... Aerosmith Ozzy and Lemmy were able to reflect on the business with some learned wisdom while Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons attempted to convey a fantasy life that appeared way too scripted and laughable I'm still a huge KISS fan though. One interesting element in viewing the film almost 20 years later is how some of the bands downplayed or sidestepped the issue of drug use note the expressions on their faces when substances are discussed then appear on Behind the Music years later to reveal their debilitating addictions.Having been involved peripherally in the scene for a few years I can say that Spheeris' portrayal was 100 accurate based on what I witnessed. I would've liked to have seen the inclusion of other important bands of the LA scene Motley Crue Skid Row etc and a separate documentary highlighting British metal Sabbath Iron Maiden Judas Priestwould've been fantastic.It was a fun irreverent and exciting time! I can look back at it and laugh since I emerged relatively unscathed... although I am somewhat embarrassed by the extraordinary heights of my hair and the plunging depths of my blouses in 86.".

	schema:headline " Decent but incomplete documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Obviously with a screen name like MetalGeek I was bound to get around to reviewing this movie sooner or later. THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION II THE METAL YEARS 1988 is an fascinating occasionally hilarious study of the Glam Metal scene that was raging in Los Angeles during the late 1980s. If you lived through this period like I did and loved the music then you will find much to enjoy here from the live performances by L.A. staples Lizzy Borden and young at the time hopefuls Odin and Seduce to the words of wisdom from hard rock royalty like Gene Kiss Simmons Lemmy of Motorhead and Ozzy Osbourne. The scenes of bikini contests at L.A.'s infamous Gazzari's night club will also provide necessary eye candy.  The reason I call this an incomplete documentary is that for the most part it mainly focuses on the hair metal scene and many of the participants are unknown rockers who righfully remained unknown after this movie was released. There is no exploration of the history of the genre nor is there any talk about some of the other trends in metal thrash crossover death metal that were also making noise in the scene around this same period of time. In addition many of the younger band members interviewed here come off as delusional chortling sexcrazed dorks who are sure that HUGE success is right around the corner for them. Looking at this movie nearly 20 years later you wonder how many of them wound up asking Would you like fries with that sir? when the grunge movement came along in the early '90s and wiped hair metal off of the musical map. In addition to the unintentionally hilarious interviews with the many band members and assorted hangerson the film is worth seeing for two things the absolutely harrowing scene featuring Chris Holmes of W.A.S.P. who floats in his swimming pool drunk as a skunk telling the world I drink because I'm not happy and the scenes featuring Megadeth in the studio working on the song In My Darkest Hour. In their interview scenes Megadeth seem to be the most together and lucid band in the entire film which is kind of ironic now because that shortlived Megadeth lineup eventually dissolved due to massive drug use. In short headbangers and hair metallers will love the trip down memory lane that this movie provides but those looking for a documentary about metal that looks beyond the hairspray may be disappointed. I don't believe the film has been released on DVD probably too many hassles with music publishing rights but if you can find it on VHS in an out of the way video store it's well worth your while.".

Our old pal Ozzy's juicepouring methods are something to behold and my new favorite band Odin sits in a hot tub with a bunch of metalsluts and tells us how they want to be bigger than Zepplin and the Stones.  This is intercut with their live performance where the lead singer expresses less range than Mark Slaughter and has no ass in his pants! We hear about struggling metalheads who use women for their money and their food they of course plan to pay them back with furs and cars when they get big.  And the always entertaining Poison treats us to a healthy dose of rock n' roll stupidity.  This film contains some of the stupidest people I have ever witnessed.  Why it won no Oscars is beyond me.

Interesting in that almost all the bands showcased are so bad and the musicians so horrid that you can't take your eyes off them.You get a bunch of big guns like Ozzy Alice Kiss Poison Lemmy and a few more. But mostly the movie is made of lesser metal heads and it's not a pretty sight. It's like a Saturday Night Live skit that is 90 minutes long all making fun of rock and roll trying to make rock look as silly and ridiculous as possible. Only thing is this film is dead serious.The Delusional Years would have been a decent title for this movie when it comes to the unsigned bands they speak to  ALL of them are sure they are going to be rich wealthy legendary rock and rollers. It's downright sad almost as in one incredible sequence where the narrator asks a bunch of musicians what will happen to them if they don't make it. All of them pretty much say they will make it. Now positivity is a good attitude but there were so many cookiecutter hair metal bands back then how can they all seriously think this.One band Odin is especially pathetic. Odin is one of the absolute worst bands you will ever hear or see. The singer defines unlistenable. But there they are in a hot tub with sluts all sure they will make it. One of them admits to almost killing himself at times dampening the festive chicksinhottub mood. Odin what you see in this movie is exactly what you'd see today if comics made fun of the era. They are BAD.But not to single them out so are a bunch of the others. Truthfully though you really don't get a sense of the inside of rock with this movie. It's kind of cookiecutter just like the bands  a typical documentary that really could have been about many genres of music.The saddest part of course is the Chris Holmes sequence with him drunk in a swimming pool while his mom watches. The saddest thing here really isn't Chris  it's his mom for just sitting there like a rock while her son drinks himself to death on a raft in a pool. Good going mom.If you want to laugh for 90 minutes and think to yourself that some people out there actually took this for the most part horrible music seriously this is the movie for you.".

The contrasts and their views on music drugs and sex are very interesting and illuminating. The movie makes no judgments on the performers or their music...they leave that up to the audience. The whole feeling of the film is actually uplifting and very funny. The bands come across as very upbeat and accessible. The interviews with fans of the music are just as fun. Interesting to see Ozzy Osbourne years before that reality show he did for MTV.The only depressing footage is an interview with Chris Holmes of WASP. He's drunk out of his mind and makes it quite clear that he hates life is an alcoholic had a heavily dysfunctional childhood and will be dead soon. Very scary to watch and sad.

It's interesting to find out Ozzy's juice scene was staged. That kind of sucks a little bit. I would have hoped for more authentic footage from a documentary. That in itself makes you question whether vodka was in his bottle or not. Looked convincing at the time.

Members of Aerosmith Kiss Poison Alice Cooper himself Ozzy and various noname bands are interviewed. The legends interviewed here give the same old stories which are still interesting but the great thing comes from all the interviews with those broke souls trying to make a name for themselves. Spheeris asks all the right questions from what happens if they don't make it and even asks some groupies if they're worried about AIDS. The film goes into great detail about various subjects and there's such a wide range of musicians that the film never gets boring. I'd love to see an update on the people involved here and see what their feelings are since none of them to my knowledge became famous. Also in case anyone is interesting during the Alice Cooper interview he's asked about people ripping him off and he mentions he'd like to hang one group but they bleed out the group.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit right off the bat that I didn't respond as strongly to the Decline of Western Civilization 2 the Metal Years as I did to Penelope Spheeris's first film and documentary even as I know I did like this film. The former was a kind of flyonthewall as I recall not as many direct interviews more concert footage look at this way of rock and roll life of LA punks that Spheeris knew intrinsically. In the Metal Years she here isn't as much a fly on the wall in the sense of just getting the pure feeling of these people as she is getting answers to questions by a mix of highly popular and workingthebottom bunch of Metal rockers.It of course can't cover everything in such an amount of time and one might be slightly disappointed to see Britain's metal scene is sort of overlooked in the course of the film not that it isn't represented in interviews with Ozzy and Lemmy but Maiden and Priest fans among others may wonder wtf. But if there is any single strength to this seemingly longerthan90 minute film with the interviews strung together in a interesting fashion alongside the concert footage it's that this particular scene of American metal particularly LA metal's scene is captured very well.And in this capturing of this time and place and the people all abound in it it's of course of note to mention that everything the musicians say is not 100 reliable and here and there it definitely has the feeling of bullsing with Spheeris's questions however clever and funny. But there are enough true moments to really get the sense of these people at the time that there is maybe at least some depth to the members of Poison with really one good song in my opinion or that Ozzy does have a very clear and honest view of what's gone on with him and the scene or what rock means or drugs mean or sex.If there isn't always a focus in the line of questioning or if there doesn't seem to be much of a structure to the film maybe it's part of the point. Here we have a mix of rockers either trying to make it Odin who I think made it bigger since are featured prominently as well as London or have made it Aerosmith Kiss Megadeth and Alice Cooper among a couple others and be it that a scene or two is staged or set up at a location for a desired effect there aren't many punches pulled with the answers to the fairly straightforward questions. And some of them when not all about rock and roll is my life does show the dark side quite accurately especially considering the time period. One interview with the drunk in the pool gives the most to try and shake off even as the manipulation of the filmmaker kind of kicks in with having his mother right there watching him in his overdrunk state.But it is at the end of the day an entertaining documentary if only as being a fan of the subfold of music myself. Some of the concert footage is less than great even as London and of course Megadeth give quality performances. There was like with other good documentaries enough talk coming out of people to really chew on and it shows Spheeris in a sort of different direction than in the other look at life in underground rock and roll. It's not great but for the fans of the bands or those interviewed it is near essential viewing and also with an anthropological side to it through the stories and QA's that work for those not as into the music.".

This was particularly so when it became extremely popular toward the latter part of the decade. This documentary delves into that period and only hints at the fracturing of the metal music scene.By the late eighties dinosaur metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas priest were still around but Metallica was moving doing speed metal and Venom had created black metal or death metal a few years before. It gives a great deal of attention to pop and glam metal acts like Kiss and their ilk as well as a parade of pathetic wannabes. Bands like Megadeth and the godfathers of speed metal Motorhead have moments but are not really the focus of the documentary perhaps because they rarely made it onto the charts or radio.Too bad since the viewer receives something of a limited exposure to the dark brooding violent and disaffected component to metal that appealed to a large swath of alienated working class and suburban youth. Perhaps the highlight of the movie is when the interviewer asks Dave Mustaine how aspiring metal bands should seek success Don't he snarls back. What's left is the indulgent excess of the hair bands with lipstick hairspray and spandex.In some ways this limits the movies relevance insofar as pop and glam metal imploded right around 1990 and is now relegated to nostalgia albums. Grunge took some metal influence and merged it with alternative music giving rise to bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarten. Speed and Death Metal sort of morphed or merged with the heavier side of Techno to produce bands like White Zombie and Ministry and a host of Industrial and heavier Goth style music. So while Decline barely hints at the parts of metal that survived it concentrates on the glam elements that have largely disappeared or been relegated to 100 seat venues in Ames Iowa.No movie would have been able to gather in the whole spectrum of Metal attitudes styles music history and the like and this one doesn't even try. Yet it need not have been so limited. It excludes extremely important seventies bands like Saxon and Iron Maiden who were trying to get gigs when everyone wanted to hear punk not metal. And it really never explains much in the way of the evolution of metal like Sabbath Priest Deep Purple and Blue Oyster Cult. There's a great story about music to be told about how musical rebelliousness is tamed and absorbed by American culture. Decline prefers to wallow in the girls and glam of 1988. Too bad interesting theme and subject poor executiona real missed opportunity.".

The topic is metal and right from the moment go the movie starts addressing what is metal why these people like it and what it does exactly. Lizzey Bordin opens the film quite splendidly with a roaring version of the often copied born to be wild. This is about one million times better then the original i might say. The singer laments on how full of bands the L.A. scene is and how hard it is to make it a pointcounterpoint exchange begins with bands like the moderately popular LB to the slightly more popular Faster Pussycat to well established rockers like Aerosmith and Megadeth. Im in a rock band and anyone who's in one or thinking about it should see and study this film even if your not a rocker its an amazing time capsule. The interviews are mostly done on a small stage with a table and a single hanging lightbulb. The other half of interviews comes anywhere from couches to beds strewn with scantily clad woman and yes this is a documentary so its all real as were reminded by Paul Stanley of Kiss. There's a colorful group of characters in this film from struttin stars like Faster Pussycat to the the more stripped down Megadeth the movie shows either end of the rock image of the late eighties. What should really be done is a where are they now with all the kids featured in this movie. I grew up in the nineties so grunge was more of the fashion mold and it didn't change my style to much but some of these kids are just unreal. Most interviewed don't have jobs at least thats what they say and they live off rock babes. Their dreams and passion to be involved in the game are unmatched by todays standards. I love the clip of the kid with all the makeup and hair saying my mom thinks this is just a phase wow like to see if he's still poofin up his hair and putting on lipstick before he hits the clubs. This movie is a terribly interesting depth into what being in a full time band and trying to make it was like at a time before the internet before cellphones this was a time when even video was scarce you were putting up flyer's and hustling every hoochie mama you could swindle to get by. Its real its raw its metal and if you haven't seen the original Decline you should its equally if not more mind blowin. So iron your Mohawk and bust out moms makeup its time to rock...80's style.

And don't be so naive as to think that deals are not occasionally or even frequently made in the backseats of limousines or other potentially shady and unprincipled locations. My cousin lived and played in the LA scene from '79 to '82 and I've heard details about some of what goes on playing in the clubs talking to managers promoters etc. Las Vegas doesn't have a monopoly on sleazy pitiful wretched and even vile behavior in the business world. This movie shows some real dreamers. And I don't see them as losers necessarily because that implies some guarantee that was not lived up to. Yes most of the people who make the big time scene have to really want it and strive hard. But there's a lot of people in this world who also want to make it big. This movie doesn't adequately touch the wellknown subject of who's related to who but that might not have been possible in the very SELFDEFENSIVE WORLD OF MASS ENTERTAINMENT. Money talks and those with it love to keep it as close as possible to themselves. Most of the BEST MUSICIANSARTISTS in the world will please and entertain those around them family neighborhood community city etc. Who says they need to go further than that. I'm glad the movie showed the incredible stupidity of drugs at least in a limited way. But obviously many of the lines by the striving to be and the successful musicians interviewed in this movie were pure BS. I don't do drugs. yeah right.... Some of them may not do that but most of the musicians in the movie were influenced by hummm.... This is a great documentary on a part of the mainstream metal scene from back then. Other reviewers here say that it was too limited in focus. I've worked in film production and scripting and funding. I'd like to hear these critics suggestions on what more could have been added. To put together a revealing portrayal of one particular subsection of our society is very difficult. I think that Penelope Spheeris did a good job. These daysin spite of all of the big time music world's weaknesses ROCK IS NOT DEAD! I still rock out and entertain my city. I still dream also but I've got dishes to clean.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who's read the original manga or er 'witnessed' the anime may question the wisdom of a liveaction remake what with all the slightly extravagant fisticuffs involved. But don't worry it hasn't been turned into a bloodfree pacifismfest with Kenshiro strutting around in sandals and a tweed waistcoat preaching the ways of nonviolent protest to the postholocaust plebs. Oh no. There's plenty of fights in here mate. And some of them are even quite entertaining.There have been concessions to your average action film punter who's probably never even heard of the original however. The storyline has been simplified in the sense of at least one major character being dropped and a couple of others rolled into one and a more familiar Hollywood flavour given to the future wasteland scenario so that the whole thing occasionally teeters on the brink of suddenly turning into Mad Max II. But it doesn't so that's alright. It manages to stick to the basic story thread of one bloke being the Fist of the North Star another bloke being the Master of Southern Cross and 'the teachings' apparently dictating that the two must never fight... for a while anyway then it happily bins this ridiculous idea and gets everyone in to have a good oldfashioned scrap. So it's all pretty straightforward at the end of the day.Straighttovideo martial arts ponce Gary Daniels does somehow look the part as Kenshiro and as his Aussie twang isn't called into play too frequently you don't keep expecting Home And Away's Alf Stewart to turn up with chins retracted and demand that You get out of my store young Ken. His nemesis Shin is played by some other even less famous bloke while Reservoir Dogs' Chris Penn gets to be another nutter and the unavoidable Malcolm McDowell chips in a deeply strenuous performance as a bloke who gets killed in the first five minutes. Apart from that it's a cast of nobodies. Spot the irony.But despite offering nothing spectacular or stunningly innovative to the world Fist isn't as bad as it could have been. It's definitely a bit shaky all round yes but the exploding heads and bursting arteries are fairly well done and that's all any version of the story ever had going for it really so at least you can't complain about the budget being spent in all the wrong places.".

It manages to stick to the basic story thread of one bloke being the Fist of the North Star another bloke being the Master of Southern Cross and 'the teachings' apparently dictating that the two must never fight... for a while anyway then it happily bins this ridiculous idea and gets everyone in to have a good oldfashioned scrap. So it's all pretty straightforward at the end of the day.Straighttovideo martial arts ponce Gary Daniels does somehow look the part as Kenshiro and as his Aussie twang isn't called into play too frequently you don't keep expecting Home And Away's Alf Stewart to turn up with chins retracted and demand that You get out of my store young Ken. His nemesis Shin is played by some other even less famous bloke while Reservoir Dogs' Chris Penn gets to be another nutter and the unavoidable Malcolm McDowell chips in a deeply strenuous performance as a bloke who gets killed in the first five minutes. Apart from that it's a cast of nobodies. Spot the irony.But despite offering nothing spectacular or stunningly innovative to the world Fist isn't as bad as it could have been. It's definitely a bit shaky all round yes but the exploding heads and bursting arteries are fairly well done and that's all any version of the story ever had going for it really so at least you can't complain about the budget being spent in all the wrong places.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the future the world has become a waste land after the apocalypse.  The populated territory is now under the rule of the martial arts clan of the Southern Cross led by Lord Shin.  When the Master of the North Star is murdered the baton is passed and the new master has very personal issues with Shin.  When he passes through a small terrorised village he comes to their aid and sets up a confrontation with Shin.Even though I had read bad reviews about this film I still had reasonable hopes for it using the logic that I was prepared for a dumb martial arts movie.  However some bothered me about the film was that it didn't seem to live up to the potential that the story had.  The film should have been a more majestic story about mysterious clans doing battle in the future but instead it felt very small and restricted.  The story doesn't seem to go anywhere and lots of avenues are left unexplored.The sets etc don't help as they were clearly pretty cheap and only the opening shot of Malcolm McDowell sitting in his oriental house really had style or imagination  the images of apocalypse were too cheap to be impressive.  The fight scenes are pretty average I'm sad to say.  While Honk Kong cinema was on the edge of things this film was back in the 1970's with its standard fights.  In the anime the fights are much more impressive and the film should have tried to capture much more of a sense of wonder.  The effects are a little too gory for my taste and don't fit with the story because the film lacks a sense of mysticism it feels ordinary  hence the problem when it tries to do something that is different or weird.The cast has some well known faces in small roles but the lead actors aren't up to the task of delivering good dialogue they have awesome bodies and can move quite well but they can't act!  This takes away from the film a great deal and stopped me getting into the characters.  Daniels and Mandylor are two of the guiltiest ones but it is spread through the cast of villagers including Melvin Van Peebles.  McDowell looks like he might add class but is a temporary narrator and faces like Penn and Howard are only of interest rather than stealing the show.Overall this is a pretty poor film.  It lacks the majestic epic sweep that it should have had and feels small and cheap.  The effects are OK but the fights really lack flair or imagination  witness people queuing up to come one at a time and you'll understand what I mean.  The poor acting bad dialogue and basic average delivery of every part of the film really makes this feel bad  I was in the mood for an undemanding martial arts movie to waste 90 minutes and even I was disappointed by this!".

When I saw this movie was on I almost turned the channel I didn't want to see the Anime ruined...but then I decided to just sit back and hope for the mediocre.  And that's ALMOST what I got.I have a few problems with this movie1. Why are 90 the guys with Japanese names British?2. Why do the two Masters keep using the same moves?3. Why can't Chris Penn ever play someone who ISN'T Psycho?4. Why does Malcom Macdowell Always show up in these pictures?5. I never thought I'd see a movie that had fight scenes that made American Ninja look like a Jackie Chan Flick.Now that's not to say that this picture doesn't have it's good points. There ARE actually a few things going for it.  First of all there is a High production value at work here.  Every shot seems framed well and the sets and costumes are extremely well done.  Also the score is quite complimentary if not seeming ripped off at times.  Acid rain.  No really TRULY acid rain.Sadly it's the Acid rain that says it the best.  fizzle".

It's also at war with itself tonally there's a light PG Power Rangers feel in some places but many scenes have graphic violence that pushes a hard R rating into the deep end which makes for a jarring experience. Gary Daniels stars as Kenshiro a lone warrior out to get Lord Shin Costas Mandylor under one mess of a mullet a brutal warlord who murdered his father briefly played by Malcolm McDowell. McDowell pulls a classic McDowell move showing up in the flesh for about thirty seconds before disappearing and lazily lending his iconic voice to a talking skeleton version of his character later in the movie. Don't ask me to remember more of the plot than that because it would involve a rewatch and ain't nobody got time for that. Chris Penn is fun as Jackal an angry vagabond with a giant potato head and the psychotic temper to match. Watch for Dante 'Rufio' Basco Downtown Julie Brown Clint Howard Mario Van Peebles and more in equally ridiculous getups. The sole thing I can recommend here is the production design lifted straight from some striking post apocalyptic video game it makes somewhat of an impression. The rest lands with a colossal thud and just sits there doing not much of anything.".

It is all bronzed shiny flesh and rippling muscles and plenty of 'smell the fart' acting. As I recall the plot of the original version was quite hard to follow but for this version it seems to have pretty much been given up on altogether.

	schema:headline " Pretty good fun  an underrated anime adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Harshly slammed by unforgiving critics on its release FIST OF THE NORTH STAR is actually a reasonably entertaining adaptation of the popular Japanese graphic novels and anime from the 1980s which gets by on a low budget and has plenty to offer in look sound and feel. The comicbook level of the film works through some nicelyportrayed settings which depict a postapocalyptic society. Despite such ruined burntout settings being widely familiar through such films as the MAD MAX series and dozens of others they make for an effective backdrop for the violent action which this film offers complementing a fastmoving actionbased story which never lets up from the very beginning.Our heroic lead is portrayed by Britishborn martial artist Gary Daniels here performing well in a role which may be his best ever  although judging by the rest of his filmography that's not really saying much. Daniels is excellent as the exiled Kenshiro with years of hard training having paid off to give him a sculpted imposing physique. Not too sure why a Brit was chosen to play a Japanese man but the gamble pays off and Daniels is one of the best things the film has to offer. Unfortunately his prettyboy adversary Costas Mandylor isn't much of an opponent and his evilness tends to be lacking at crucial points. Better attention is given to lowerlist scumbags like the ubiquitous Clint Howard as guntoting bike rider Stalin who disappears halfway through the film and Chris Penn who has a ball as the extremely weird and aggressive henchman Jackal.The rest of the supporting cast isn't given much of a look in aside from an annoying Japanese teenage character who is thankfully bumped off before too long but there are a surprising amount of familiar faces here  Melvin Van Peebles as an oldtimer MTV presenter Downtown Julie Brown as a fierce fighter and genre pro Malcolm McDowell making one of his cameo appearances a presence that always lifts the level of a film. The dialogue is pretty monosyllabic and hardly enlightening but thankfully the film does work on the actionorientated level at which it attempts  and with gusto.For the few who don't know the original characters of Kenshiro and Shin were blessed with supernormal abilities which allowed them to easily break apart mere mortal opponents. Such powers here take the form of bonebreaking punches and kicks and a special move that Daniels performs which makes the heads of his opponents bubble and swell before exploding in a grisly fashion. His opponent Shin instead prefers to perforate the chests of his enemies by literally sticking his fingers into them leading to much blood spray and carnage.Yes you guessed it FIST OF THE NORTH STAR is an exceptionally violent movie but like the superior STORY OF RICKY the violence is portrayed in a rubbery comicbook style so it never seems shocking or disturbing. The martial arts work is great especially from Daniels although the cameraman does use bad angles sometimes which make it clear that the kicks and punches aren't connecting. This flaw is eased by some splendidly meaty sound effects work to enhance the battles and as a whole the kung fu doesn't disappoint. Not a great movie but not a bad one either. Pretty good fun in all respects actually.".

He was only the most insane bad ass in the entire frigging manga and anime series but instead he's shot by a gun ....... By shin ...... WTF. Well next Rin was it actually blind she was mute you freaking moronic director and beyond popular belief swinging your arms around like your prancing to a Christmas jingle while making your own fast punching sound effects does not actually make it look like your fists are moving faster then they actually are you just look like someone freaking out on an acid trip. Last but not least I think in the very least the only reason for me anyways that this movie was watchable was because i personally saw Ben stiller from specifically zoo lander in the facial expressions that Gary Daniels had occupying his face the entire movie don't believe me ? Watch the scene about 20 minutes in when Kenshiro heals Rins blindness c'mon that is so Ben stiller. Only difference well Ben is trying to be funny and succeeds Gary well I'm going to go out on a limb and say he was totally serious and trying too hard. Well this was fun you know writing the review not watching the movie well accept for zoo lander oops I mean Kenshiro faces lol.".

Last but not least I think in the very least the only reason for me anyways that this movie was watchable was because i personally saw Ben stiller from specifically zoo lander in the facial expressions that Gary Daniels had occupying his face the entire movie don't believe me ? Watch the scene about 20 minutes in when Kenshiro heals Rins blindness c'mon that is so Ben stiller. Only difference well Ben is trying to be funny and succeeds Gary well I'm going to go out on a limb and say he was totally serious and trying too hard. Well this was fun you know writing the review not watching the movie well accept for zoo lander oops I mean Kenshiro faces lol.";

His Fist of the North Star stands in opposition to the Southern Cross. From here on out it's a fairly straightforward battle of good vs. evil with plenty of familiar faces along the way from Melvin Van Peebles to Lockdown's 1990 Chris DeRose among many others. Will Kenshiro beat the baddies? Fist of the North Star was originally a Japanese animation or Manga. Someone apparently thought a DirectToVideo liveaction remake was exactly what the world needed. They even used American and British stars but didn't change their original Japanese names. Hence credits like And Malcolm McDowell as Ryuken. You don't see that one every day. So Gary Daniels plays a guy named Kenshiro etc. But the real problem with this movie is that it is a mishmash of pointless plot less gobbledygook. You don't really care too much about any of the characters and largely because of the closedin sets the whole movie has a claustrophobic and stagey vibe which doesn't do anyone any favors.Top fan favorite Gary Daniels appears to be doing his absolute best but it's like he's trudging through syrup. It's a total postapocalyptic slog and without any bright spots such as Steele Frontier's 1995 Chickenboy. It's ground that's been welltrod in the past. Downtown Julie Brown can't Wubba Wubba her way out of this one. While it's trying to be just like the anime version with a bunch of wacky cartoonish effects the only time the movie really shines is in the straightup Martial Arts fights. And most of the really good ones don't come until the end of the movie. And by that time the viewer is saying in frustration Where were these before?!?? This led us to the conclusion that if Isaac Florentine directed this movie it would have been similar but a lot better.As we've discussed before on this site when it comes to moviewatching there is a definite difference between watching a movie and waiting for a movie to be over. It's an important distinction and because of the rampant LONE TIGER EFFECT and the fact that at the end of the day this is just another postapocalyptic slog we cannot recommend Fist of the North Star. We still love Gary Daniels and all but this is not one of his best projects in our opinion.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

Gary Daniels is Britain's best hope when it comes to actormartial artists and he doesn't let us down in what is his best movie yet not that the likes Fire Power or White Tiger give it much competition. Gary is impressive and the fight scenes are well executed particularly when Gary used those nasty looking kicks of his. What is even better about this film is that it has a story line and the film manages to fit a plot along with the action. I wish there were more movies like this one.

To their credit they put it at midnight and they did dissect it like a frog in a freshman biology class but it was surprising to see it there.  This movie is based on one of the goriest ickiest stickiest anime classics I've ever seen and to do it in live action is in my opinion gratuitous at best and an exercise in stagescrubbing with a power washer at worst.I think Bob  Doug Mackenzie said it best when they said It blowed up real good...but USA network didn't show any of that.  Ken's signature martialarts style was robbed of its flair by the TV censors when anime physics was denied visibility  you couldn't see the bodies swelling up and exploding.  Anyone familiar with the graphic novel or the anime knew they were doing it you just didn't SEE it because of the cuts.  I don't think that's a spoiler except maybe your lunch. But there were some interesting makeup effects with dislocated jaws and shifted ribs that didn't get cut. Unfortunately the combat in the Highlander TV series was more believable than the rest of the fight scenes in this spooky honker.  No one has a gun in this postapocalyptic world when it would actually be useful.The plot is thin.  The characters are thinner not even archetypical.  The female lead character Julia has no motivation for continuing her existence that I can see except that she motivates the men.  She could easily thwart the bad guy by killing herself and robbing him of his vision since he is in his own words doing it all for her.  But she doesn't. She just sits and sighs a lot depressed.  If she started singing the blues it wouldn't seem out of place.The bad guy Shin is an everyday megalomaniac pretty boy with way too much martialarts power and a real snappy tailor.  Jill Sobule said it best Dumb as a box of hammers but he's such a handsome guy.  I think he was molded in one piece out of polystyrene.  His hair sure was.If you like gratuitous gore without any of that mindchallenging plot stuff getting in the way by all means rent the video of Fist of the North Star. But ignore it on cable unless it's on an uncut premium channel.  On a regular channel it'll be censored to the point of silliness.  Of course some might say that it was silly even BEFORE the censorship. YMMV".

Here we have a film that takes elements such as beautiful stars beautiful locations and a bucket load of plot twists and blends it all into a highly enjoyable film experience. Of course Wild Things doesn't always come across very realistically and at times even it's downright ridiculous but it's done in such a way that it doesn't matter and because of that we have a film that can do what it wants. The film is helmed by John McNaughton who had his first success with the cult horror flick Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. It has to be said that the scene setting and way that the plot moves is somewhat hamfisted as sometimes it's painfully obvious that certain sections of the film exist only to give it another selling point the argument that starts out between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell beside a swimming pool being a case in point. However McNaughton makes good of these selling points and for every three way sex scene and absurd plot twist the film gains an extra point for trashy entertainment value.It's not immediately obvious what Wild Things is going to be about as the first twenty minutes serve only in setting the scene and from that base the film could easily turn into any teenage school flick. However it turns out that this time is well used as by nulling the audience into a false sense of security the film is able to make sure that every twist comes as a surprise. The film benefits from a great big name cast which is anchored by Matt Dillon who gives one of his best performances. Dillon clearly enjoys himself and his persona is able to suit both the sleazy and upstanding nature of his character. Kevin Bacon sleepwalks and isn't really able to show his true talent and similarly Neve Campbell looks out of place sexy with it in her role as a teenage junkie. However Denise Richards rounds the piece of nicely with a charged performance and the ensemble is nicely topped off by the likes of Bill Murray Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner. The settings that the movie takes place in look great and ensure that there's more eye candy than just the female leads. Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and on the whole if you want a couple of hours of entertainment you can do a lot lot worse than this twisty little flick.".

Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and on the whole if you want a couple of hours of entertainment you can do a lot lot worse than this twisty little flick.";

At the end of the film integrated with the end credits are previously unseen events that kept the full tale slightly hidden from the viewer. By inserting them at the end the full story was told without inhibiting the ride. If you missed the hints and clues along the way u can see what you failed to figure out.Certainly this is not a tale that fails to stretch credibility but its is a film for amusement.

The way every single line and move was so suspenseful and or clever and it just clicked all into place made my heart sink deeper into the story and never look away I really was entertained to the point where I could not take my eyes off the screen for how amazing it was. As a Neve Campbell and Denise Richards fanatic I enjoyed them and their luminous roles as well as Matt Dillon who was awesome. I thought the way each and every twist and turn in the plot was just so great that my eyes lingered on for more after it was over which is why of course I watched it a second time and the only problem I had with this movie is that it was not long enough though if it had have been longer I do not think it would have worked out for the better or anything if you understand what I am trying to say. This movie is simply great so wonderful I would watch it over and over again if I had to simply because it is so fantastic and I really got into the way there was a major turning point at the ending that blows your mind as well as the twist halfway through the film.

	schema:reviewBody "During the very limited theatrical run that Wild Things recieved here I think it was gone in about three weeks a lot of the reviews and publicity created the impression that this was a soap opera sex thriller. I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser man what an awful show that was not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct it is just trying to tell a story.The story such as it is seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School the town it is located in and its snobby highincome elite at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor Ray the corrupt policeman Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam Suzie and Kelly but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.This next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop I forget the name had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.Overall however you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't feel the need to talk down at its audience it doesn't resort to excess simplicity to make itself understood except for the aforementioned ending it just tells a story and tells it reasonably well. It is also another great example of DVD's utter superiority especially during the threesome scene. When this part of the film is shown in its proper aspect ratio you can make out every character and certain little details I'm sure that Denise Richards would appreciate not having available to horny teenage boys in a freezable and zoomable format. When was the last time you zoomed in on an actress' boobs with a VHS cassette assuming they were left in frame after some jerk with an editing console chopped it down to fit those garbage 43 screens?".

	onyx:emotionText "During the very limited theatrical run that Wild Things recieved here I think it was gone in about three weeks a lot of the reviews and publicity created the impression that this was a soap opera sex thriller. I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser man what an awful show that was not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid.

I will admit yes this is primarily what cause me to rent the film besides my interest in all three main actors Neve Campbell Denise Richards and Matt Dillon. However this was not just some dark porn as I expected but rather a fantastic and different film that was very very interesting...Basically Campbell and Richards are two high school seniors who have an interesting threesome relationship with their high school guidance counselor Matt Dillon. He appears to be quite the stud throughout the film and there is an attraction to him by nearly every female character that he seems to meet especially Richards's mom. After sexual encounters with Richards and Campbell Richards is convinced by her parents to accuse Dillon of rape as a way to extort money from him... Dillon has quite the spotlight on him from the media and other highauthority figures as a rape accusation directed towards any high school faculty these days is sure to raise some eyebrows. In the end RichardsCampbell are really not working against Dillon but rather they are working with him to in fact extort money from Richards's mother....

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain films which have become famous on account of one sexually provocative scene. From Here to Eternity is an excellent film which deserves to be remembered for many things but it lives on in the public imagination as the film where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr make love on the beach even though that scene only occupies a short part of the film's running time. Similarly The Seven Year Itch is remembered mostly for Marilyn's skirt billowing around her legs. And Wild Things of course is best known for That Kiss between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell although to be honest it has so few intrinsic merits that it deserves to be remembered for little else. Sam Lombardo a Florida high school guidance counsellor is accused of rape by a female student Kelly Van Ryan the wild daughter of a wealthy family. Things start to look bad for Lombardo when a second student Suzie Toller comes forward to say that has also raped her. Lombardo is arrested and engages a lawyer named Kenneth Bowden to represent him. Is it a coincidence that Lombardo has the same Christian name as and his lawyer the same surname as the hero of Cape Fear another thriller set in the American South and which also involved allegations of rape? When I started watching this film I had no idea of the plot except that it involved two girls kissing and at this point I was still assuming that it would be either a traditional courtroom thriller or an issue movie about sexual abuse but it turns out to be neither. There is an unexpected turn of events during the trial. Under crossexamination Suzie reveals that Lombardo did not rape her and that Kelly who has a grudge against the counsellor persuaded Suzie to join her in fabricating charges against him. Lombardo is triumphantly acquitted. Now I have long learnt to be wary of crime films which involve the sudden and unexpected acquittal of the defendant about halfway though as this is generally a sign that a major plot twist is in the offing the twist normally being that the supposedly innocent man is in reality as guilty as hell if not of the crime of which he was accused then of some other felony. There was a twist of this nature in Just Cause another nineties thriller set in southern Florida. And so it proves here. Following his acquittal Lombardo brings a lawsuit seeking compensation and is awarded 8.5 million. The twist proves to be that he Suzie and Kelly planned the entire incident in order to split the compensation money between them. That however is not the end of the story. Ray Duquette the police officer who investigated the original rape allegations becomes suspicious of Lombardo and keeps him under observation. Moreover this is not the end of the twists either. Most twist thrillers only have one main plot twist. Some like Reindeer Games have two. Wild Things has so many that I lost count. The whole of the second half of the movie amounted to little more than one twist after another. I haven't got space or the inclination to list them all here although they all involve variants on the two most popular twists namely1. That a character believed to be dead is in fact alive and 2. That a character believed to be a hero is in fact a villain. Denise Richards will never be my favourite actress her performance in The World is Not Enough means that she must go down as one of the worst Bond girls of all times. Nevertheless her looks and her combination of innocence and sensuality make her just right for the role of the wanton rich girl Kelly even if at 27 she was about a decade older than the character she was supposed to be playing. Neve Campbell was also convincing as the sluttish whitetrash Suzie but few of the other actors make much impression the likes of Kevin Bacon Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner are all capable of much better work than this. The real problem however is not with the acting but with the plot. The result of all the twists is a plot which has been twisted out of all recognition. The story at least on a first viewing is virtually incomprehensible even with the assistance of a series of flashbacks intercut with the closing credits. Eventually the viewer may realise what is supposed to have happened but this does not help much as it means that the film simply becomes incredible rather than incomprehensible. One of the characters I won't say which has devised a scheme to dispose of all the others a scheme of such baroque complexity that it bears no relation to the way in which any real human being even the most fiendish criminal would behave in real life. Films like this one serve little purpose other than to show off the supposed cleverness of the director and scriptwriters. Comparisons to the work of Alfred Hitchcock a noted student of psychology and to the best films noirs which have a much more realistic view of human nature seem to me to be very wide of the mark. Wild Things I don't think I love you. 310 210 for the story with a bonus point for That Kiss.".

	schema:headline " Wildly bad";
	schema:reviewBody "'Wild Things' is a hard film to comment on basically because it is two films or at least one film in disguise.  It commences as an issuebased melodrama except that two things seem odd the pacing is too fast how is the story going to last the movie? and the bizarre score seems more fitted to a comedy.  Sure enough this straight drama is wrapped up only to subside into a larger thriller a thriller in which twists and turns of the plot come at an ever faster rate until in the end the film's aim is clearly to make you gasp rather than care this is particularly evident when the missing holes in the plot are explained through the perfunctory insertion of extra scenes into the closing credits.  So to assess it we need to ask what's the quality of the initial setup how good is the twisty thriller and how well is the transition handled?  In fact the same answer pretty much covers all three bases badly.  The initial drama is based around a high school teacher accused of sexual abuse. A potentially interesting situation but presented in an absurd manner the teacher seems terrified from the start that the moment he is alone with a girl she'll fall out of her bra for him and it's the kind of film where a lot of falling out of bras goes on and sure enough the moment that it happens the girl in question inevitably gorgeous is accusing him of rape and her evil mother is trying to run him out of town.

	onyx:emotionText "'Wild Things' is a hard film to comment on basically because it is two films or at least one film in disguise.  It commences as an issuebased melodrama except that two things seem odd the pacing is too fast how is the story going to last the movie? and the bizarre score seems more fitted to a comedy.  Sure enough this straight drama is wrapped up only to subside into a larger thriller a thriller in which twists and turns of the plot come at an ever faster rate until in the end the film's aim is clearly to make you gasp rather than care this is particularly evident when the missing holes in the plot are explained through the perfunctory insertion of extra scenes into the closing credits.  So to assess it we need to ask what's the quality of the initial setup how good is the twisty thriller and how well is the transition handled?  In fact the same answer pretty much covers all three bases badly.  The initial drama is based around a high school teacher accused of sexual abuse. A potentially interesting situation but presented in an absurd manner the teacher seems terrified from the start that the moment he is alone with a girl she'll fall out of her bra for him and it's the kind of film where a lot of falling out of bras goes on and sure enough the moment that it happens the girl in question inevitably gorgeous is accusing him of rape and her evil mother is trying to run him out of town.  One might suggest that one is meant to smell a rat as a lead in to the film's later development but it's not just the details of the situation that ring false but the portrayal of the whole world when the girl for example first gives a statement one policewoman suspects her of lying from the start but never tells her colleagues or us why  indeed all police work seems to proceed by arbitrary pronouncement at all points.The twistier second half doesn't work either in part because the first part proved so shallow as none of the characters are likely or believable who the hell cares if they aren't what they seem?  As the twists mount the whole thing feels more like a parody of a David Mamet film one can only suppose that it's meant to be humourous but there's no humour beyond the outlines of the plot.

You got the impression he was smart...an impression which is totally changed at the end. Then again during the whole film you think that Sam is intelligent just to find out that the girl was the one with the brains. In a straight forward way the film is totally not believable.

But both are skilled directors of a bunch of great moviesFord is closer to Western movies and Hawks to other genre... Ford treats his Western characters as people behave... Hawks displays it in vivid adventure... In Red River Rio Bravo and The Big Sky Howard Hawks is far from the magnitude of Ford's The Searchers. Under Ford's instruction John Wayne is fluent and moderate refined in conduct and manners as in The Quiet Man. With Hawks Wayne's character prevails differential tendency toward passion and fury...It is soon evident that the cattle boss is tough to the point of obsession It could be argued that only men of this spirit could have handled and survived the first pioneering cattle drives One of the drovers John Ireland wants to make for Abilene but gets no change out of Wayne When the cattle stampede Wayne goes to 'gunwhip' one of the hands Clift intervenes It was then evident that Wayne was going to drive his men just as hard as he intends to drive the cattleRed River is a Western just as much concerned with human relationships and their tensions as with spectacle and actiona hallmark of Hawks' films and this element is introduced when the pair meet up with a boy leading a cow The boy confirms the wagontrain massacre and the boy and the cow from then on are included in the partnership This is not only a keypoint of the narrative but also a highly symbolic momentFor some years Garfield was the only screen rebel... But in Clift's appearance in Red River another rebel was born In Red River Clift plays the adopted son who opposes his father's domineering attitudes and behavior towards himself and also towards the cowhands who work for them on the drive to market The struggle between father and adopted son compels delighted interest... Dunson's unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us Captain Bligh in Mutiny on the Bounty. In the beginning of the film we had admiration for Wayne's persona... We concluded finding him unfriendly unconscious unacceptable and faulty... Clift wins our sympathy! Clift was the withdrawn introverted man who quietly maintains his integrity as he resists all pressures These qualities were summed up in the words of Private Prewitt in From Here to Eternity probably Clift's finest rebel role! Red River will remain a film with a unique flavor It has and will continue to have its own special niche among honored Westerns With two Academy Award Nomination for Writing splendid music score by Dmitri Tomkin and excellent acting including the supporting cast the film had all the concepts of Howard Hawks' quality vigor in action reality as opposed to emotions and a faculty of scale...".

	schema:reviewBody "In the pantheon of great performances by John Wayne Red River ranks as one of the great ones probably in the top five of his films. It's what the publicity folks mean when they talk about epic westerns. John Wayne is a driven man he's got to get that gigantic herd of cattle to market in Missouri or face ruin. He's not going to be selling them in Texas at carpetbagger prices so he's putting together the biggest longest cattle drive on record to get to the railroad terminus in Missouri. He does it with the able assistance of his stepson Montgomery Clift newly returned from the Civil War.A prologue to the main film shows what happened to Wayne years before. He left a wagon train going to California with good friend Walter Brennan and later that train is massacred with Wayne's fianc Coleen Gray along with it. On the way to Texas Wayne and Brennan pick up Mickey Kuhn who is playing a younger version of Monty Clift. They settle in Texas and Wayne puts together the biggest cattle ranch in the state which is where the main film starts.Wayne and Clift play beautifully off against each other. Father and surrogate son first working together and then having a big difference of opinion on the cattle drive. Clift started a film career in Red River playing sensitive people who you can only trod on just so long before they take action. You can see the inner workings of such later Clift roles as Robert E. Lee Prewitt and Noah Ackerman. Monty made a grand screen debut. And it was his debut Red River was filmed first but held up in release and Clift's The Search was released first to the public.John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. In his best performances top directors like John Ford Howard Hawks and Bill Wellman realized this. He has a few in this film and they tell the audience more about what's going on inside this man than ten pages of dialog. With Joanne Dru Howard Hawks tries to repeat the magic he had with Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not. Joanne is no Bacall but she's good and had a pretty good career on her own. Her scenes with both Wayne and Clift have some of the same bite that Bacall's do with Bogey.Dimitri Tiomkin's score deserves star billing right up there with the human cast. It is one of the great movie scores of all time period. let alone in the western genre. For me I've always noticed the similarity with the cattle drive beginning with the great use of Tiomkin's music and what Cecil B. DeMille did in the sound version of Ten Commandments as Charlton Heston tells the Hebrew children he's takin' 'em to Canaan with Elmer Bernstein's score in the background as DeMille's cast of thousands moves out. I've often wondered whether DeMille copied Hawks or Hawks was influenced by DeMille's silent Ten Commandments.Red River is a must for John Wayne fans for Monty Clift fans for fans of both and of great movie music like I am.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dimitri Tiomkin's thunderous score sets the tone for this rousing story of cowboy ranchers in nineteenth century Texas headed north with a thunderous herd of cattle in tow. It's the archetypal story of the American West with its strong ethical male leader Thomas Dunson John Wayne and his pursuit of a big dream set in an era when men were men times were tough hardships were inevitable guns ruled and Native Americans were the bad guys. What a saga ...What makes Red River such a grand adventure is its high quality. Its story is simple direct exciting and well told with complex characters interesting and sympathetic because they show weakness as well as strength. Dunson is a good man but he's stubborn and headstrong. His semiadopted son Matt Montgomery Clift is good with a gun but a little softhearted. Dunson's chief sidekick is Groot Walter Brennan a cantankerous old buzzard who has problems with his teeth.It's the relationship between these three men that is the heart and soul of Red River. Trouble ensues along the way you can be sure. And how that trouble unfolds and plays out presents viewers with engaging human drama and humor centered on these three main characters. The lonesome High Plains with all its inherent risks adds grandeur to the epic story.At strategic points in the film the page of a book appears on screen with text that briefly summarizes upcoming events. It's like we the viewers are reading a book about some long ago trailblazers. It's a technique that could have been intrusive. But here it is handled with such finesse that it actually helps the narrative by functioning as a transition from one sequence to the next.The acting is fine. John Wayne is more than convincing as Dunson. Walter Brennan is characteristically funny. And Montgomery Clift is terrific. Had he maintained his looks and if reallife circumstances not intervened Monty could have been one of the truly top actors through at least the 50s and 60s.If the film has a weakness it might be the cinematography. Not often but at times the actors appear to be standing in front of a canvas an effect that renders a shallow depth of field. Maybe this was the result of technical limitations of photography at the time the film was made.There are few film westerns that can compare in quality with Red River. And I don't know of any other cinematic cattle drives that are this good. So the next time you herd your cattle to market this is the film to watch. Even if you have no cattle Red River is still a wonderfully entertaining cinematic experience.".

In any case Red River was the first movie I taped and deleting commercial breaks I was ecstatic to have a Hollywood movie on hand to watch whenever the urge arose. And WHAT A MOVIE!!!  I agree with earlier comments re John Wayne...who usually just played John Wayne.  In THIS one and The Searchers however the director got one helluva performance out of the Duke.  Also the second movie performance by the tragical Montgomery Clift...so pretty in the Mohammed Ali sense that I virtually fell in love with him myself even though I was a straight teenaged boy. From the opening credits with that almost Wagnerian music by Dmitri Tiomkin this movie shot in 1946 and held 'til 1948 for release...I forget whyshould be compulsory viewing for the braindead Hollywood moguls of today.  Actually there are no moguls left...they're all bottomline money men who wouldn't know a good movie if they saw one...Let's check the demographics guys and fill those multiple screen outlets with braindead teens not really their fault as products of our so called progressive p.c. education systemand make a TON of money! My age is showing...back to the movie.  If you haven't seen it be prepared for a LONG sojourn.  This isn't brain candy...it's an allegorical treatise on the impetuousness of youth vs. the inflexible values of pioneer stock. In the end BOTH are told to cut themselves some slack by the guntotin Joanne Dru. In summary a Great Western and to get back to the Duke an amazing performance by a 39 year old made up to look like a 60 year old...and he pulled it off!  The respectfear combo of his hired trailhands is almost Shakespearian and a tribute to the screenwriters and director Howard Hawks.  If you've never seen it...do yourself a big favour and rent this little classic!".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable western";
	schema:reviewBody "Fourteen years ago Thomas Dunson entered Texas across Red River with two head of cattle his trail hand and a young boy Matt Garth who survived an Indian attack on a wagon train that killed Dunson's sweetheart.  After years of development he is now head of a ranch and is preparing to drive his head of thousands of cattle up to Missouri for sale despite the perils.  However Dunson's brutal leadership style bucks up against the more peaceful Matt leading to a rebellion and a splitting of the ways between Dunson and his adopted son.With an early scene establishing both Dunson's methods taking land by force and the source of much of his future bitterness and rage this film sets itself out to be a real good character piece and pretty much manages to do it.  The plot sweeps across 14 years but doesn't suffer for it.  The main plot device is the cattle drive which is depicted with affection here however the main story is the conflict between Dunson and Matt's methods and views on man management.  This aspect is not given quite as much time as I had hoped and tends to be over shadowed by the scale of the cattle drive itself  however this is still good.The weakest point here is the romance which feels tacked on at the end.  Not only does it feel unnecessary but it doesn't really work very well either. To make matters worse  when the conflict between Dunson and Matt manifests itself physically it is devalued by the involvement of Tess somewhat. Wayne's leading man is strong and is a good performance considering how unpopular he is as a character.  Clift gives a balanced performance and stands up well alongside the Duke.  The support cast is full of western favourites and does well to fill the story out with colour comic relief from Brennan's chuck wagon driver is great fun.Overall this is a good western that I felt didn't quite reach it's full potential as a film.  It could have gone further with the battle of wills between the characters but instead the cattle drive takes the lion's share of screen time.  Having said that there is still plenty to enjoy with both the character clashes and the perils of the cattle drive itself.".

John Wayne as always in his element astride a horse does a great job portraying the single minded cattle Baron Tom Dunson. He looked comfortable in the role with all his regulars like Harry Carey Snr. and Jnr.Hank Worden and Walter Brennan around him and along with Hawks is responsible for the Movie being as good as it is. You could almost taste the dust and sweat as Dunson bullies his way along the cattle drive ignoring advice doing what a man has to do and saying often ' I'll read over them in the mornin ' then being left in the dust himself after his men and his adopted son Matthew Garth...... played by Mongomery Clift.... decide they've had enough. We always knew they'd meet up with each other again and when they did....what a showdown! Dunson catches up with them in Abeline gets off his horse when he sees Garth and bullies his way again this time through a herd of cattle to get to him. That walk Wayne makes amongst the cows is a classic. For a big guy he's got a lot of balance never losing his stride as he forces his way through the herd turns draws and fires at Cherry Valance....played by another resident bad guy of the era John Ireland....gets hit with a bullet from Valance crosses the railway track then proceeds to beat up on the only man game enough to stand up to him and in the process gets a bit of a pasting himself. Fantastic stuff!! Both Clift and Brennan who played Dunson's old friend Groot Nadine give fine supporting roles particularly Brennan with his excellent narrative throughout the Movie. Made in 1948 Red River is a great Western and perhaps had much to do in setting standards for others to follow.".

There are some who see the relationship between Tom Dunson John Wayne and his surrogate son Matthew Garth Montgomery Clift as mirroring that of Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian and again that isn't too far off the mark either. Then there is the teasingly suggestive homoerotic byplay that exists between Clift and gunslinger John Ireland with a lot of emphasis on the affection each shares for the other's gun. But pat psychology aside the film is chiefly enjoyable for its sheer physicality. Indian attacks gunfights cattle stampedes and a great climatic confrontation between Wayne and Clift it has them all.Clift a relative newcomer when the film came out it was only his second picture is excellent. The camera loves him and he knows it. This is Clift at his most likable and laconic. But it is Wayne's tyrannical Tom Dunson who dominates every scene. It's a great piece of acting the equal of his work in The Quiet Man and The Searchers maybe better. Those who say he was the same in every picture were surely blinkered. Given a great part like Dunson or Ethan Edwards he clearly understood the psychology of the role and what made the character tick. And for once Dimitri Tiomkin's great score adds to rather than detracts from the film. Trivia time in Peter Bogdanovitch's The Last Picture Show it was Hawk's Red River that was the last picture show.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a betterthanaverage western that has several things going for it. Good acting great scenery impressive cast  including all of the cattle over 1000 for sure in some scenes! It appears no expense was spared in the creation of this one. Film in a nutshell an epic cattle drive serves as the backdrop for the story of a father and adopted son's struggle in a battle of wills that borrows heavily from Mutiny on the Bounty.As good as it sounds though it's not perfect. There are a few problems here but the main one is the endingconclusionclimax. While trying not to spoil it for anyone reading this who has not actually seen it yet the insertion of the Tess Millay character into the narrative and her subsequent actions that bring about the climax really do not work. It feels forced contrived even silly. After two hours of tension mounting slowly but surely between father Dunson John Wayne and son Garth Montgomery Clift it's all resolved in a blink by a character neither man has known for more than a week. This is just not effective storytelling. Several reviewers here mention they allow that the ending of this film is not very good possibly awful actually yet still feel compelled to rate it 1010. Even Roger Ebert stated that the ending hurt the film but still listed it on his Great Movies list. Well I can't do that. If there are acknowledged problems with a film it really should not be given a perfect score. '1010' should denote that a film was perfect you wouldn't change a thing. If you find that you would change something here or there you've got to take it down a peg or two. And with this unsatisfactory ending it can't be a 10.There are a few other issues. As mentioned it's not exactly original as it does borrow liberally from the Mutiny plot. There are also some unlikely and inexplicable situations presented here like when Dunson abruptly leaves the wagon train at the beginning of the film without so much as a discussion with his girlfriend who he leaves behind. This felt incredibly silly and unrealistic. I'll send for you he tells her as he leaves. What? How? She's going to California he's heading for Texas and he's just going to 'send for her' later? How exactly is he going to do that without telephones or an address or anything? That's....dumb. There are also some continuity errors like cows appearing and disappearing behind the wagon on the way to Texas and Dunson going from holding a whip to a gun in his right hand during the confrontation with Bunk Kenneally. Sloppy.Overall it's still a good film and worth a watch but I do not find it to be worthy of any 'top 10' lists there are just too many issues here. It's on the borderline of I might watch this again on a rainy day but that's about as high as it goes. I've certainly seen better. 710.".

	schema:headline " Mutiny on the cattle drive";
	schema:reviewBody "Red River sees actor John Wayne playing Thomas Dunson a meantempered cattle rancher who hopes to drive a large herd of cattle from Texas to Missouri with the help of a dozen men. Unfortunately due to Dunson's tyrannical leadership methods the men rebel against him. Led by Dunson's adopted son Matt played by Montgomery Cliff they usurp Dunson taking his guns and cattle and making the journey to Missouri themselves.The film was directed by Howard Hawks and so bears all his hallmarks strong masculine characters swift pacing much male camaraderie strong willed and sexy woman obsessive characters moral codes in conflict rapidfire dialogue etc etc. What's different here is cinematographer Russell Harlan's photography and Hawks' camerawork. For a Hawks film Red River is surprisingly fluid elegant spacious and visually driven. The film is a loose retelling of Norman and Nordhoff's Mutiny on the Bounty but with its attention to detail and meticulous cataloguing of little moments also comes across as a fairly realistic documentation of life on the cattle drive. And of course Wayne gives one of the best performances of his career. A performance which helped undermine his heroic image and foreshadowed murkier performances in The Searchers True Grit and The Shootist. The most interesting thing about River though is the psychosexual weirdness going on beneath the film's surface. In real life Hawks strongly resisted both femininity and emotional relationships. While many of the director's early characters oozed a kind of invulnerable masculinity Hawks himself had a deepseated aversion to maintaining strong emotional bonds with the many women lovers and children in his life. His biographer Todd McCarthy even goes so far as to say that Hawks' womanising was a means of avoiding emotional depth commitment and the responsibilities of a mature relationship. As such Hawks' films tend to avoid married couples or couples who have been together for a long time. What he's interested in is that initial romantic spark and goes to lengths to deny the feminine within himself and within his male and his female characters. This repression would give rise to his later comedies Bringing up Baby I Was A Male War Bride which tend to revolve around insecurities over the instabilities and arbitrariness of gender. And so River is all about confusion repression the discomfort with male weakness guilt and the inability to act. Here Wayne is both a mother and father figure toward Matt plucking the boy out of the desert nurturing him and then watching him grow. As Matt grows he becomes an effeminate rather liberal figure striking up odd homoerotic conversations with other gunmen and often refusing to use his gun. Meanwhile Wayne grows increasingly authoritarian murderous and stubborn until the two find themselves vying for a woman called Tess. Tess who is rescued from Native American Indians mirrors Wayne's wife who was killed by Indians at the start of the film. Tess then gives herself to Matt but the fact that Wayne wants her to carry his own child suggests that Tess is both a mother and lover to Matt. The film's ending is hated by even diehard fans. Here Matt and Wayne have a little showdown the father wishing to kill the son and by extension claim Tess as his own. Matt in contrast refuses to resort to violence. For a while it looks like Wayne will murder the kid until Tess steps in and magically heals their rift. The film then ends with a new family being formed Wayne the daddy Matt the son and Tess the son's new wife. Daddy has been neutered but not in the conventional Oedipal way by the son. It's a jarring ending and very insulting in the way it casually brushes aside the deaths and troubles these two men caused but the Oedipal implications are nevertheless interesting. Here's the son's refusal to resort to the gun is viewed as an essential improvement upon Wayne's triggerhappy frontier justice. This is common of westerns. Matt becomes the new American a reconciliation of two paradigms savagerybarbarism and civilitychivalry. It is no coincidence that it is a band of marauding Indians who brings Matt and Wayne to Tess and robs Wayne of his own wife. Covertly the film presents the slaughter of the red skins and Wayne's own white tyrannical violence as just another hurdle to be overcome on the way to better things. But though the film probes the barbarity of colonising the west When exactly does the use of force condoned by Manifest Destiny end? Who can stop the regime of violence? Who dares propose a more moderate programme? Once law and order replaces guns how does society deal with the perpetrators of violence? How does civilisation handle the violence at the core of its creation? it quickly expiates that which it acknowledges. In the film there are no blood ties no genetic links connecting Matt to Wayne and Wayne's character ultimately remains celebrated. This trauma avoidance is typical of the genre. The ethics of Western violence coincide with the imperatives of entrepreneurial ideology which are the core of the politicaleconomic mythology of the United States historian Richard Soltkin says. However the Western deflects masks or denies the validity of economic selfinterest  greed  which is the motivating principle of that ideology. In this way Westerns offer a vehicle in which the culture can both affirm its values and express its doubts and ambivalence. And so for all its probing Wayne's actions never make much sense and even if they did the film says it doesn't matter anyway. He's a good guy now and has been replaced by an even better one. Turn Wayne into Sgt Barnes and Tess into Sgt Elias and you'd have the Hollywood woundlicking of Oliver Stone's Platoon VietnamThe Wild west superficially resurrected the monsters atoned and the world healed for tomorrow's generation of good little children. 7.910  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks' western venture starring Wayne and Clift his career debut indeed as two plumb opposite types of men from almost every aspect lead a mighty cattle migration in the vast prairie and notably to stride across the red river but en route the bigoted Thomas Wayne slowly loses his trust among his crew and dissent emerges eventually his adopted son Matthew Clift has to oust Thomas in order to finish their drive to the right destination an ultimate chase from Thomas will heighten the drama to its peak. To say nothing of the deployment of the night stampede rumpus plainly wielding such a massive quantity of cattle is indisputably taxing for the crew meanwhile an aweinspiring spectacle for its audiences in the primitive black and white. All along this laborious trek there are presumable threats looming large native Indians or borderline gangsters but what's fatal to the solidarity is the disruption from within Thomas is a hardbitten fogey his tyrannical domination of the bunch is shortsighted but in propria persona he is not a loathsome character at least not as he assumes to be he has a wound in his heart a responsibility to shield his properties and a paternal attachment to Matthew so he takes the mutiny too seriously and there is a death wish in his heart to sacrifice and sublimate himself to a higher cause of love very stupid and rather egotistic in hindsight but probably is the fashion for the sake of manhood during the time within a tunnel vision. However rather interestingly Matthew represents exactly another fashion of manhood a percipient tenderhearted gunslinger with a slender figure and an appealing face exuding an irresistible sex appeal which panders to meet more modern eyes. Thus the conflict can also be reckoned as a combat between these two sorts of aesthetics yet in my humble opinion the biggest letdown is the hasty ending in the brink of an eye a gratuitous buffer a babbling Dru abruptly jumps into the foreground and lambastes them in a most comic way which is not align with the wholesome tone whatsoever then everything has been miraculously resolved what an inadequate happy ending and an overkill to all the tension amassed for almost 2 hours. Anyway it is a solid western picture and Wayne even proves to be a qualified thespian against a ravishing Clift Brennan is the comic relief and Dru is literally redundant with a ridiculous and bellylaughing reaction after being shot in the shoulder by an arrow. But the most LOL reference is a tacit pun comes alive with Ireland's banter with Clift  There is a goodlooking gun you were about to use back there can I see it? Maybe you'd like to see mine! hell yeah no one can resist that!".

	schema:headline " I didn't ask for a 'happy ending' Don't beat my cattle1010";
	schema:reviewBody "I understand the reason why a lot of people are disappointed over the ending of Red River. The movie up until the ending does a wonderful job of drawing us in to the story of the hardnosed tyrannical cattle owner Thomas Dunson John Wayne and his adopted son Matt Garth Montgomery Clift. Dunson and Garth along with Dunson's lifetime side kick and cook Nadine Groot Walter Brennan have set out along with many other hired men to relocate as much of Dunson's cattle as they can. Against terrible odds of survival the hired men set out with dreams of making 100 a person for their efforts. Along the way many of the men talk of an easier and quicker passage for relocation through Abilene but Dunson will not hear of it unless he has absolute proof that a railroad runs through this spot. This becomes the seedling of mutiny. After many days of adversity the hired men become more restless. We slowly see that his men are giving up on Dunson's methods of leadership by intimidation and have become increasingly tired of Dunson and his stubborn plight of relocating his cattle across the states while battling through hostile territories. We also see that Dunson is starting to break under the strain of herding two drives one of his cattle and the other of his cattle herders. Dunson resorts to shooting and killing some of the men that tried to quit the drive. Dunson is not only becoming ornery with his hired help but with Garth and Root as well. Dunson snaps at Groot and doesn't listen to Garth's thoughts of a different passage. Dunson won't sleep at night for fear of other men quitting on the job. The hired men begin to think that they can either do battle against the ever waiting Indians or other cowboys trying to steal Dunson's cattle or they can run away from Dunson. Onenight three hired men take a chance and try for their escape once Dunson finally collapses into sleep from exhaustion. These escapees figure they don't want to end up like the others who wanted to quit and were killed buried and read their last rites by Dunson. In this way Dunson is a precursor to Jules Winnfield Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Except when Dunson is sermonizing he's already killed you.Once the surviving escapees are caught and brought back to Dunson Dunson only needs a second to figure on how he will kill them. When he mentions that he intends to hang the deserters the rest of the men including Garth rebel against Dunson. The quick draw of his son helps to spare the life of the deserters but also severs the father and son relationship to the point that a broken down and dejected Dunson tells Garth I'm going to find you Matt I'm going to find you and then I'm going to kill ya. This moment was very powerful. And it is perhaps the best moment in the film. This event refocuses Dunson and it makes him blind to anything else in the world. The rest of the movie starts back up with a new dynamic. I started to care more about what would happen to Garth and Dunson than I did at all about the destination of the cattle drive. You know the ending is going to be severe and that someone is going to have to die. Well you would think so.And this is where the debate starts up. Some people really like the feel good ending. For me the ending comes across as what I would expect a movie made in 1998 to end like not 1948. That damn speech by that woman I won't mention her name who came into the story more than two thirds the way through that just tidies everything up I just can't see it. All in all I can't hold that against the movie. It was so excellent up to that point. I can accept the ending I just don't like it. And furthermore Howard Hawks didn't like the ending either.What I did like was The scene of the cattle before the drive the one that does a 360degree pan. For its time it was very impressive. Walter Brennan. Then again I like almost anything with Walter Brennan in it. The on going joke about losing his teeth in a poker game is fantastic. However I didn't get to see the version that Brennan narrates I saw the one that plays out through a diary. Apparently the Brennan narrative is the better version. Or so Howard Hawks seemed to think.Montgomery Clift was a revelation. It's too bad he died so early in his life.Despite the happy ending it still ranks 1010.Clark Richards".

	schema:reviewBody "A Western masterpiece of high emotion told beautifully through Hawks' fluent direction and the remarkable cinematography.Wayne proved he could really act in this one as Tom Dunson who has worked hard over the years to build a cattle empire in midwest America. The ageing cattle baron has been assisted throughout the years by his adopted son Matt Garth Montgomery Clift in a great contrast with Wayne whose parents were killed in Indian attacks. Indeed the toughshelled Dunson has been carrying a personal wound for years after his sweetheart was also killed by Indians. The pair are preparing to drive their cattle to market from Texas to the Missouri railhead.But in shades of 'Mutiny On The Bounty' Dunson goes tyrannical in his quest to maintain control of his enterprise whilst on the drive and Matt takes the herd away from Dunson to Kansas on better advice. Dunson loves Matt but swears to kill him. A fascinating psychological game ensues with old hand Wayne pursuing young determined Clift across the states.Excellent acting from both male leads. Wayne is really excellent in this one portraying a man older than him in years. Clift the Method Actor matches him well throughout and it is wonderful to watch the interactions between these two. The great Walter Brennan lends a hand as the toothless Groot Dunson's lifelong friend. John Ireland also pops up as a rival gunslinger to Clift Cherry Valance. The homoerotic subtext is a much talked about point in this film with Clift and Ireland's first encounter where they 'shoot it out' being filled with all sorts of innuendo and symbols.Perhaps the only downer in the casting is the females. In Westerns the gals were always characterised a bit sketchy and Joanne Dru as Matt's love interest Tess is slightly annoying at times overacting and all. Still it's not enough to ruin the film and she does have a feisty presence I do love the part where she barely flinches after getting an arrow in the shoulder.Wonderful cinematography and a grand score. Hawks is such an underrated director just look at those beautiful fluid shots of the cattle wandering along the countryside and the supreme closeups of Wayne whose facial expressions tell more than any speech or dialogue. This is an epic to behold and to watch over and over again. It is the most moving of Westerns more than just your standard 'shootemup'. Wayne and Clift imbue their characters with real emotions and the final confrontation between the two is both breathtaking and nailbiting.1010.".

The constant fall in the value of livestock means that Tom and his adopted son Matthew must drive the gathered herd thru the perilous Chisholm Trail and then hope to get good value for the beef. With their assembled group of hands they head off North but many problems will come their way not least a fallout due to Dunson's tyrannical ways meaning there could well be mutiny on the range.Without a shadow of doubt Red River is one of the greatest Westerns ever made boasting incredible performances from the cast directed with sumptuous skill by Howard Hawks and photographed as good as any film in the genre. Based on the novel The Chisholm Trail written by Borden Chase also co writing duties for the film Red River is a sweeping spectacle that doesn't have a frame that's wasted. Hawks this his first Western frames his wonderfully vivid characters in lush expansive landscapes fleshing them out amongst the constant stream of drama and action. Tho Chase would be annoyed at the changes Hawks made to the story he surely would have marvelled at the finished product with Harlan's photography in and around Arizona's locales capturing a cowboys terrain expertly and Dimitri Tiomkin's score stirring the blood and pumping the viewer with Cowboy adrenaline.If anyone doubts John Wayne as an actor of note then they need look no further than his performance here as Dunson. Tough and durable in essence the character is but Wayne manages to fuse those traits with a believable earthy determination that layers the character perfectly. With Wayne all the way matching him stride for stride is Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth sensitive without being overly so it's the perfect foil to Wayne's machismo showing. Walter Brennan and John Ireland also shine bright in support while a special mention has to go to a wonderful turn from Joanne Dru as Tess Millay Howard Hawks' CV shows a ream of strong female characters and here Dru firmly puts herself in amongst the best of them check out her first appearance alongside Clift it's precious.Red River made a fortune upon its release it was revered by the critics back then and it's still being revered today. Rightly so because it is quite simply magic cinema a case where everything comes together perfectly it's in short a film that even none Western fans should be able to marvel at as entertainment or at the very least give credit to the Tech accomplishments on offer. 1010".

Tho Chase would be annoyed at the changes Hawks made to the story he surely would have marvelled at the finished product with Harlan's photography in and around Arizona's locales capturing a cowboys terrain expertly and Dimitri Tiomkin's score stirring the blood and pumping the viewer with Cowboy adrenaline.If anyone doubts John Wayne as an actor of note then they need look no further than his performance here as Dunson. Tough and durable in essence the character is but Wayne manages to fuse those traits with a believable earthy determination that layers the character perfectly. With Wayne all the way matching him stride for stride is Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth sensitive without being overly so it's the perfect foil to Wayne's machismo showing. Walter Brennan and John Ireland also shine bright in support while a special mention has to go to a wonderful turn from Joanne Dru as Tess Millay Howard Hawks' CV shows a ream of strong female characters and here Dru firmly puts herself in amongst the best of them check out her first appearance alongside Clift it's precious.Red River made a fortune upon its release it was revered by the critics back then and it's still being revered today. Rightly so because it is quite simply magic cinema a case where everything comes together perfectly it's in short a film that even none Western fans should be able to marvel at as entertainment or at the very least give credit to the Tech accomplishments on offer. 1010";

This sprawling flick deals with the first cattle drive from Texas to Abilene a biblical name meaning city of the plains along the Chisholm Trail .Abilene was the first of the major railhead cattle towns . From 1867 to 1872 it was a booming depot  shipping some one million Texas Longhorns by railroad to Kansas City and Chicago and meat markets in the East . The place was selected as a terminus for Texas cattle drives in 1867 . Then the long drives began from Texas over the Chisholm trail . At trail's end in Abilene the rowdyfreespending cowboys attracted saloon keepers gamblers  brothels and all types of frontier RiffRaff  the town became notorious for its lawlessness .

It's a big budget film with good actors  technicians production values  pleasing results and usually regarded as one of the Westerns ever made . Interesting screenplay based on a serial published in Saturday Evening Post in which subsequently Borden Chase wrote a book titled Blazing guns on the Chisholm trail . The famous scene where Montgomery Clift and John Ireland compare their revolvers was allegedly a reference to John Ireland's endowment it may also be a reference to Clift's homosexuality. Howard Hawks was distressed by John Ireland's unprofessional and lecherous behavior during filming which were partially due to the actor's alcoholism  this contributed to Ireland's part Cherry Valance being drastically reduced in the finished film. In spite of  a bit later on  John Ireland married Joanne Dru  film's starring and Montgomery's very nominal interest .

	schema:reviewBody "The 1940s were the decade when the Western came of age. After years languishing in the Bmovie doldrums during the 1930s the genre had made a triumphal comeback with pictures of increasing stature and importance. Many of these 40s Westerns explored and restated the popular clichs of the cowboy movie. More importantly they recognised for the first time since the early 30s that the old west could be a setting for stirring and powerful stories.Red River proves this point using the plains and cattle drives as a backdrop for a tale of loyalty love and the trials of life with a scope as vast as the West itself. The screenplay is by Borden Chase who wrote many classic Westerns and Charles Schnee a dramatic writer who would win an Oscar for The Bad and the Beautiful and their two divergent strands blend beautifully. The story has a deep impact because it is a masterwork in buildup and payoff. Take for example the character played by Harry Carey Jr. who exists in the plot purely to be the human victim of a stampede. We first see him in the scene where the men sign up for the drive when he stands up just after another man has made his excuses for not coming along. We think he is also wanting to stay behind and John Wayne says as much but Carey is in fact expressing his willingness. This moment makes us remember him and perhaps the thought will cross our minds that he's a bit of a young lad to be going out on the drive. It makes his death later in the picture really mean something. On a wider scale a similar thing is done with Wayne's character. The loss of his woman is described in a brief handful of scenes at the beginning. He is never seen referring to this again but if affects the way we see the character and seems to feed into everything he does.These aspects of the story are brought out with great depth by director Howard Hawks. Those crucial opening moments are played out in a series of iconic images which in spite of their brevity linger in the mind for the duration of the picture  Wayne and Colleen Gray in a wild embrace the tiny wagon upon the landscape the Indians rushing towards us. Throughout Hawks is constantly telling the story or at least delineating the characters through visual means. In the scene where Wayne argues with another man over the quality of the coffee and says they won't turn back Montgomery Clift is placed between them and while the two men speak it's his reactions we see. When Joanne Dru first appears it looks as if she is just an extra but she is in fact centre screen and a light is on her face so we take note of her before she becomes a character. Few directors were as good as Hawks at emphasising the actions over the words. Notice how those handwritten title cards begin to fade out before you've had a chance to read them entirely  that's because the words don't really matter.The two leading stars of Red River at first seem an unlikely pairing. On the one hand we have John Wayne already intrinsically associated with the genre before this era having starred in numerous Bwesterns in the 30s. On the other we have a complete newcomer in Montgomery Clift handsome rather than rugged with a background in theatre. And yet they complement each other brilliantly. Wayne seems hewn out of very rock of the mountains which makes it all the more poignant when he shows a bit of sensitivity in what is the first of his truly great acting performances. Clift by comparison is so lithe and innocentlooking that he has all the more impact when he eventually stands up for himself and fights. Somewhere these two very different actors meet each other halfway and this is what makes their rocky fatherson relationship work.With all this bright storytelling and powerful acting not to mention the rousing and evocative Dmitri Tiomkin score Red River adds up to more than the sum of its parts. It is not merely a great Western it is a part of Western mythology. Unlike many of the pictures from its time it features few of the clichs with which the genre is saturated but is nevertheless rich in the Western's familiar imagery. This is the West of Russell and Remington the world that all those elegiac Westerns a decade or so later would be mourning the loss of. It is pictures like this that elevate the Western from a mere historical setting to a genre in its own right.".

However with John Ford and Howard Hawks making these kind of pictures it is no wonder that the Western genre is still a muchloved style. Perhaps Ford was the better of the two directors in relaying the Western themes to the screen but Hawks was the better storyteller and he shows his steady hand all throughout Red River more than just about a cattle drive from Texas to Missouri but also about the relationship between a man and his adopted son and what it would mean to each of them to see this accomplished.Who would have thought that the young handsome actor supporting and perhaps upending the great Western actor John Wayne would become that which he did? Montgomery Clift in his screen debut shines as the loyal but firmheaded Matt Garth determined to see this mission through. Wayne is great as usual in this role that is somewhat of a prequel to his Ethan Edwards in Ford's The Searchers.However this is not really about a Western story. It is the American dream shown in such a blissful and beautiful way that you cannot help but admire it. The widescreen photography suits the scenery just fine complementing the beauty of the landscape despite the lack of color. The supporting cast provides most of that especially Hawks favorite Walter Brennan as the cook Groot always ready with a sly or smart remark.Considered today one of the great American westerns it is certainly one of Hawks' finest achievements capturing an era longgone but never too far that we cannot visit again and learn that times were tough back then but the ambition and determination that drove men to do what they did is still alive in us as Americans today.".

	schema:headline " A total masterpiece with no faults";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone seems to agree that The Red River is a masterpiece with a somewhat questionable finale. Just recall some of its beauties. The magnificent cinematography shows the breathtaking immensity of western landscapes giving a sense of true epic to the work of cowboys. Few elementary violent feelings interact among the laconic fellows on the screen manly friendship hate bravery stoicism determination. All this is masterly represented that's actually what we expect from Howard Hawks one of the greatest directors ever. Now I would like to give a contribution to vindicate the finale. First the whole scene is extremely beautiful the setting in the town flooded with cattle is really an idea of great cinema. However the problem is that John Wayne  Tom Dunson usually as ruthless and stubborn to border cruelty gets to a sudden reconciliation with Montgomery Clift  Matt Garth. This seems to grate much with Dunson's psychology. Well I think that an explanation is rather simple. There is another elementary feeling the strongest of all the love for women. Since Dunson meets Joanne Dru  Tess Millay by the way how beautiful she is! his determination begins to waver. The shrewd girl promptly realizes the situation and she's ready to offer herself to Dunson in order to save her beloved Matt. By sure Dunson is stricken by the girl's sacrifice and bravery. Perhaps he recalls that his stubborness had caused the death of the only woman he really loved and that after all Matt is the actual son Dunson is so desirous to have. Is it then possible that he is wrong as his old friend Groot Nadine the great Walter Brennan continuously repeats to him? Clearly the key point of Dunson's change is when Tess guesses that he was once in love. Moreover in the final encounter between Dunson and Matt the latter refuses to defend himself and to kill a defenceless man is unacceptable for Dunson's honor code.

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone seems to agree that The Red River is a masterpiece with a somewhat questionable finale. Just recall some of its beauties. The magnificent cinematography shows the breathtaking immensity of western landscapes giving a sense of true epic to the work of cowboys. Few elementary violent feelings interact among the laconic fellows on the screen manly friendship hate bravery stoicism determination. All this is masterly represented that's actually what we expect from Howard Hawks one of the greatest directors ever. Now I would like to give a contribution to vindicate the finale. First the whole scene is extremely beautiful the setting in the town flooded with cattle is really an idea of great cinema. However the problem is that John Wayne  Tom Dunson usually as ruthless and stubborn to border cruelty gets to a sudden reconciliation with Montgomery Clift  Matt Garth. This seems to grate much with Dunson's psychology. Well I think that an explanation is rather simple. There is another elementary feeling the strongest of all the love for women. Since Dunson meets Joanne Dru  Tess Millay by the way how beautiful she is! his determination begins to waver. The shrewd girl promptly realizes the situation and she's ready to offer herself to Dunson in order to save her beloved Matt. By sure Dunson is stricken by the girl's sacrifice and bravery. Perhaps he recalls that his stubborness had caused the death of the only woman he really loved and that after all Matt is the actual son Dunson is so desirous to have. Is it then possible that he is wrong as his old friend Groot Nadine the great Walter Brennan continuously repeats to him? Clearly the key point of Dunson's change is when Tess guesses that he was once in love. Moreover in the final encounter between Dunson and Matt the latter refuses to defend himself and to kill a defenceless man is unacceptable for Dunson's honor code. All these psychological motives are treated by the director and the actors with depth and accuracy. I really think that the finale agrees smoothly with the remainder of the movie. In conclusion The Red River is a total masterpiece with a convincing faultless finale.";

	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks and Arthur Rosson's adaptation of Borden Chase's tale of cattle driving across America at first glance in other words the first twenty minutes or so seems almost like it won't have much to it except to glorify the old Cowboys and Indians approach to a western and to have the lead as a one sided viewpoint over the story.  But what soon becomes clear about Red River is that the supporting characters such as Montgomery Clift as Wayne's son Walter Brennan as one of the fellow Cattle drivers Joanne Dru as the lady of the bunch and Harry Carey as a cattle buyer bring out a greater sense of humanity to the film and there are scenes captured by Hawks and his cameraman Russell Harlan that are for lack of a better word glorious. Whatever minor flaws come up from the characters is made up by the storytelling qualities of the final product.  I'd have to see it again it was months ago I first viewed it to know for certain if it's one of the all time best westerns as some might say yet from what I saw it is an impressively executed tale.

	schema:reviewBody "Chilean director Raul Ruiz created a weird wild fantastic world with Three Lives and Only One Death. Marcello Mastroianni plays four different characters in as many different stories that at first seem completely separate but by the films end are wholly intertwined. It is beautifully almost mystically shot effectively using shadows light and computer imagery to create painted like imagery. It is a bit confusing but wholly satisfying film.In the first story Mastroianni plays a salesman who walked out on his wife Marisa Paredes twenty years ago. The wife has since found another husband Feodor Atkine and is living a seemingly happy life. For reasons left unexplained Mastroianni suddenly decides he wants his old life back. He catches the new husband at a Tabac and offers to pay him 1000 francs for a hour of his time. What proceeds is an imaginative fantastic tale of why Mastroianni has been gone for twenty years. It is far to complicated to explain here but lets say it involves a room with moving walls and tiny fairies who prefer to eat franc bills but will settle for newspaper. The end of the story finds Mastroianni wanting to leave the second husband in the fantastic room while he moves back in with his wife.In the second story Mastroianni plays a successful professor who for reasons that are all his own become a beggar and a rather successful one at that. He befriends a prostitute Anna Galiena who he later finds out isn't all she pretends to be and whose husband Jacques Pieilleris something of a psychopath.In the third story a young couple Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud find themselves being mysteriously supported by an unnamed friend. After months of finding 1000 francs in their mail box each week they learn this mysterious stranger has died and left them his mansion. The catch is they must keep on a peculiar butler Mastroianni of course or lose everything. The fourth story is really a means to tie all three stories together and yes it is weird. There is a lot going on throughout the film. It is visually stunning complex in story and a delight throughout. It is the type of film that really deserves a second and third viewing to allow thoughtful absorption of the many details. In what was his second to last film before his death Mastroianni does a masterful job playing these varied and interesting characters.It is a film not meant for everyone. The story is a weird and complex as anything put out by David Lynch. But for the lover of cinema there is much to appease the appetite. It is a beautiful layered surreal film that is a true pleasure to watch.Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more.".

Basically Marcello Mastroianni plays a man with multiple personalities the film focuses on four travelling Parisian salesman Mateo Strano Sorbonne university professor of negative anthropology Georges Vickers a mute country house Butler working for a wealthy newlywed couple and industrial magnate Luc Alamand. Mateo shows up at the home of the wife he abandoned twenty years ago Mara Marisa Paredes she remarried Andr Fodor Atkine he tells his story to Andr that he has in fact been living in an apartment across the street the entire time he lures Andr to him and murders him with a hammer Mara suspects nothing as he returns calmly she even introduces him to their adopted daughter. George Vickers still lives with his cranky mother until he becomes a tramp on the streets he encounters streetwalker Tania Anna Galiena with a passion for philosophy the hooker and tramp stay together until Vickers returns and leaves following this George discovers Tania is in fact president of a major corporation and when he learns she has been jailed for the attempted murder of her creepy exhusband Vickers comes to her rescue. The newlywed couple are struggling a little but their lives change dramatically when a benefactor provides them a marvellous country house they are also given a mute butler who serves them well but they slowly figure out their valet who actually owns the chteau is plotting to kill them with slow poising to steal their fortune terrified the leave but he finds them and demands they give him their baby daughter he gives the child to Maria Mateo's exwife. Finally Luc Alamand is in trouble learning that potential clients he wants to impress want to meet his wife daughter and sister and they are actually coming the stress causes his other personalities to emerge each have wildly different lives but are all clearly similar characters and it is all bound to end in sdestruction and confusion for himself and some others. Also starring Melvil Poupaud as Martin Chiara Mastroianni as Ccile Arielle Dombasle as Hlne and JeanYves Gautier as Mario. Mastroianni is amusing playing the four different personalities embodied in one man the story is okay but rather hard to follow and to be honest I didn't laugh at a lot of it I know it is meant to be funny and I'm not sure the placing in the 1001 Movies book is one I agree with but it was an interesting enough fantasy comedy drama. Good!".

George Vickers still lives with his cranky mother until he becomes a tramp on the streets he encounters streetwalker Tania Anna Galiena with a passion for philosophy the hooker and tramp stay together until Vickers returns and leaves following this George discovers Tania is in fact president of a major corporation and when he learns she has been jailed for the attempted murder of her creepy exhusband Vickers comes to her rescue. The newlywed couple are struggling a little but their lives change dramatically when a benefactor provides them a marvellous country house they are also given a mute butler who serves them well but they slowly figure out their valet who actually owns the chteau is plotting to kill them with slow poising to steal their fortune terrified the leave but he finds them and demands they give him their baby daughter he gives the child to Maria Mateo's exwife. Finally Luc Alamand is in trouble learning that potential clients he wants to impress want to meet his wife daughter and sister and they are actually coming the stress causes his other personalities to emerge each have wildly different lives but are all clearly similar characters and it is all bound to end in sdestruction and confusion for himself and some others. Also starring Melvil Poupaud as Martin Chiara Mastroianni as Ccile Arielle Dombasle as Hlne and JeanYves Gautier as Mario. Mastroianni is amusing playing the four different personalities embodied in one man the story is okay but rather hard to follow and to be honest I didn't laugh at a lot of it I know it is meant to be funny and I'm not sure the placing in the 1001 Movies book is one I agree with but it was an interesting enough fantasy comedy drama. Good!";

	schema:reviewBody "Three Lives and Only One Death directed by Raoul Ruiz was probably a vehicle for Marcello Mastroianni. The film marked the end of the life of one of the greatest actors of all times. A giant among giants the actor probably sensing his own death played not only one but three different roles. There are many messages within the story one of which seems to be pointing to the unification of the single currency not only in France but in the countries of the European Union something much in the news these days.The narrative consists on three stories that are interconnected. Each one shows Mr. Mastroianni at the center of the story. Mr. Ruiz showed his admiration to the surrealists masters of the genre like Luis Bunuel and his followers. As far as the narrative is concerned the film has an absurdist character in stories that speak about everyday life played by larger than life characters. The situations do not make sense although there is a basic story line that is kept throughout the film.The best excuse for watching the film is to see Marcello Mastroianni in his heavily accented French having a good time playing disparate people. Others in the cast include the actor's daughter Chiara in the third vignette playing opposite Melvil Poupaud. The first story features Feodor Atkine who meets an unexpected fatal attack. Marisa Paredes Aurore Dombasle and Anna Galiena also appear as the three women in the main character's life.".

The story is based on an ancient Chinese folk tale. Two sisters are snakes but they disguise themselves as humans since snakes are looked down upon. A master monk is out to destroy the sisters fearing that they're a threat. White snake wants to be normal she marries a clumsy monk who has no idea she's a snake. Green Snake is the wild sister who enjoys morphing from snake to human form. Although the film's giant snake looks kind of fake the film makes up for it with creativity. Bright colors surreal dreamlike landscapes and martial arts magic are all part of Tsui Hark's Green Snake. It's also very trippy like Fellini Satyricon.

	schema:reviewBody "Tsui Hark is one of those director's that sort of polarizes his audience. You either go along with his loopy unique directorial style or you get angry at him. Other directors like him are Sam Raimi and Takeshi Miike. They all go where their muse takes them regardless of where the movie is at the moment.The film tells the story of two giant magical snakes who decide to experience human emotional life. We first encounter them while a super powered Buddhist is searching for evil spirits to destroy. He starts to attack them but relents when he discovers that the snakes are sheltering a pregnant woman in labor from a torrential downpour. The snakes enter the local town and one White Snake chances upon a bureaucrat who catches her fancy. The two transform into human form create a mansion by spell and lure the bureaucrat there. White Snake falls in love with the man marrying him while Green Snake her sister has problems understanding the human emotions her sister is so capable of enjoying. Green is also having a hard time hiding her true snake self from her sister's husband. It gets complicated with the monk entering the picture once again with bad consequences for all.First of all this is a story that fully compliments Hark's style. Unlike other films of his that I felt were compromised by his experiments and vaudeville style here it almost all works wonderfully. The fantastic characters and action of Chinese mythology are colorfully illustrated here. The art direction and photography is excellent as well. Music score is great.I felt the film was a commentary on religious rigidity but clearly this production has many meanings to different viewers. That's a sign of a good movie. Recommended.".

And once in a while something really neat pops up. Green Snake is one of those films ranking among the top films the early 90s Hong Kong period has to offer.Green Snake is a strange blend of genres but not at all uncommon for those type of films. If you want to compare it to anything that is remotely known I guess A Chinese Ghost Story comes closest.The film's main focus are two demon snakes that have traveled to the human world to live a better life. They act as dames and try to find a husband as they can secure their lives in the human world by getting a human child. This might sound a bit silly but in essence it differs little from many Roman or Greek legends we know and accept them for what they are.Of course no HK film from that period is complete with at least some flashes of martial arts thrown in. So a traveling monk and Buddha priest are added to make the lives of our snakes a bit harder. Both are trained in the more magical areas of the martial arts field resulting in many magical spells and little hand to hand combat.What sets this film apart from his peers is the visual brilliance. It won't be to everyone's liking but the abundant use of color is simply superb. Every shot in the film looks lush be it through it's impressive colorful set design or through the many filters that are used. The editing gives you little time to absorb all this beauty but every new shot is impressive enough not to care.Also typical for these type of films is the type of editing used. Because the means and budgets were not high enough to create the effects required in a believable way many magical scenes are often shot up close and edited in such a way that the viewer will fill in the blanks. It can become a bit confusing this way but all in all it's a splendid solution. Some scenes still look pretty cheap but overall the effects never take away from the film.Another thing worth mentioning is the music. Although probably hit and miss for many I liked the music Hark has chosen for this film. Especially the song with the Indian ? dancers stayed long after the movie had finished. Pretty strange not everyone will far for it but I think it worked wonders here.Of course there's also the quirky acting and silly humor that are ever present in these HK films. It comes with the territory and I don't mind one single bit but it's another factor that will turn off some people from films like Green Snake. Their loss I guess.It's pretty easy to love or hate these kind of films. But if you're a fan of this kind of cinema Green Snake is one of the best films to pick. It's Tsui Hark at his best the film is lush in its visuals and score is entertaining to the core and wastes no time on unnecessary things. Very likable and extremely wellmade. 4.05.0".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was a big hit when I was a little girl. At that time I was more into the love story however when I watched Ching Se Green Snake again something suddenly struck me and finally I get a glimpse of the true meaning of the film.As some may have already knew the story was adapted from ancient Chinese mythology. The original story was about love and humanity the monk Fahai did not understand love he believed that all monsters are born to be evil and broke up the couple of the white snake and the man. The movie was quite different though as the true love couple in this film was meant to be the white snake and the green snake.The green snake Qingas can be seen from the tile of the film is the main character. She went all the way trying to find what love and human emotions are and to no avail. When the white snake Bai fell in love with the human Xian Xu Qing copied Bai's moves and try to seduce Xian Xu. Bai has known Qing for a very long time therefore she knew that Qing is doing this only to test if Bai cares about her. Qing's jealousy was forgiven but Bai suggest that Qing go back into the forest because she was carrying the man's baby at that time. Fahai found Xian Xu and insisted that he was blinded by his desire lost morality and that he should go to be a monk throwing away all the emotions and reaching a new level of understanding to the world. Qing and Bai went to save Xian Xu and were engaged in a fight with Fahai using their magic they brought flood to the Jinshan temple. In the middle of the fight Bai gave birth to her baby indicating that she was already a human and no longer a snake. Fahai was shocked by the fact that all this time he has been battling with a human and to save them he drove the flood to another way but killed dozens of monks in Jinshan temple accidentally. Bai asked Qing to save her husband she pleaded and it broke Qing's heart. The best line of the movie lies here Qing saidYou always talk about love and being human but what is love? I don't even think the human understands. You and me we sisters have been together for 500 years isn't this love between us? Have you ever thought about me as a human and consider my emotions? Qing went to save Xian Xu only to find that the man has agreed to become a emotionless monk in order to stop Fahai from hurting the snakes. She laughed and said Xu betrayed Bai's love and he was not worth it. She brought Xu outside but at that time Bai has already gone. Now heartbroken Qing killed Xu for the purpose of him accompany Bai in the other world and finish her last wishes. She was in such grief that she was about to kill herself but then she remembered that she had no right to  she was not the one Bai loved.Fahai was going to punish Qing for murdering but Qing just laughed and asked if he made no mistake. At the beginning of the story Fahai was seduced by Qing to test if he was really noble and has no desire there were metaphor and symbolic techniques used but the director was meant to say that they had already have sex therefore the monk has sin. It is true as Fahai hurt a human pregnant woman Bai and killed several monks by accidents and he is evil too. Qing was dead inside she left and said she will come back if the human really has the answer to What is love.Like any other Chinese film especially mythology and tales the story was told in a indirect way and many symbolic clips were used. The atmosphere and use of light smoke and color are amazing there are novel with same title and it was even darker than the movie. The ancient Chinese mythology is not like those in any other countries but they too talk about humanity and the never ending topic of love. This is a masterpiece and is really worth watching.".

White falls in love with an honest man and even after he finds out she is a snake he still loves her. But Green doesn't like all the attention that White is getting and starts flirting with her man. Vincent Zhao plays a high monk with unlimited power and his job is to kill any evil beings who do not follow the Heavenly laws. He has problems of his own and does not know for sure if these 2 snakes are truly evil.This is quite an adventure and it never gets boring. Joey Wong is very good in her role but Maggie Cheung manages to outshine her. I would have liked to see some actual kung fu moves from Vincent Zhao but he is perfect for his role. He is a master of playing straightfaced roles like the one he plays in this movie. The music is mesmerizing and the ending is very special even though it is a bit illogical. But then again this is a movie with snakes and spiders acting as humans so the end doesn't feel too far fetched. It is one of the best endings I have ever seen. This is not you typical mindless Hong Kong movie. I had to watch it a few times to take it all in and it manages to get better every time I see it. This movie is a real gem.There is no real fighting and the action is what you would expect from a Tsui Hark wuxia. All of the action involves flying around posing and using magical powers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tsui Hark's magical fantasy Green Snake is such a tour de force of stunning visuals and expertly crafted moments of cinema magic that one can easily forgive the occasional dodgy special effect or lapse in narrative cohesion.Maggie Cheung plays the beautiful titular character one of a pair of benign female snake demons who have mastered the ability to transform themselves into humans. Her companion White Snake Joey Wang is far more experienced than Green at altering her appearance and has also managed to acquire human emotions falling in love with a young scholar Hsui Xien who is quite unaware that his girl is actually a scaly serpent in disguise.Desperate to experience the same feelings as White but unable to control her desires Green also attempts to seduce Hsui Xien the lucky old soandso and even tries to seduce a powerful monk Faat Hoi whose mission it is to trap demons this naturally causes all kinds of problems which eventually result in Hsui Xien discovering White's secret.For the majority of its running time the lyrical beauty of Hark's tale is more than enough to retain one's attention even when there isn't much happening storywise the film is shot with such style that it is totally captivating. For example the scene in which Green gatecrashes a Bollywood dance routine while a raindrenched White slithers off to spy on the scholar might not add much to the plot but with its lush colours amazing soundtrack and Cheung's impossibly sexy performance it's one of the most memorable cinematic sequences that I've seen.Towards the end of the film events do start to become slightly wearisome and perhaps the film is a little too long for its own good some viewers may find Hark's leisurely pace a little too slow whilst others might laugh at the sometimes lessthaneffective special effects the CGI magic crane is certainly very weak. However the film's positives far outweigh its negatives and fans of Asian fantasy should definitely seek it out.".

Give me 20 and a new bicycle and u got it by next week.What a wild ride got lucky and saw it on the big screen but what would you expect from Tsui Hark. The guy is just awesome with the camera its so kinetic it can make the weak sick. The story line of this movie is also kinetic  part myth part fantasy part romance part comedy with a little bit of kungfu thrown in as well. I loved the setting the canal town it was really beautiful. The effects wern't bad either.The whole move is basically about the struggles of female sexuality in a male world. I think the points of the story are great but the action is just so nuts its almost hard to watch. Seeing Maggie Cheung and her costar slither around on their bellies was really funny. The two were quite sexy together and there were some fantastic scenes in the movie but I think it was just a little too much for me to take. I was a bit disappointed because I was hoping for a little more action than the silly comedy. Fans of the fantasy genre should get a kick out of it. But I'd rather see some Wutang clan stuff or just watch Maggie Cheung for 2 hours.  oh  the title song will haunt you!".

	schema:reviewBody "Oddly enough I have never gotten around to watching Green Snake aka Ching se before 2016 despite being a huge fan of Maggie Cheung. But with hand on heart then I can say that I hadn't been missing out on a masterpiece. Sure Green Snake was entertaining enough for what it was but it just wasn't outstanding or particularly memorable.The story is about two female snake spirits aspiring to become humans and they are mingling with humans in order to learn how to become human. And a monk comes across the two snakes learning about their nature and behavior he must rectify their behavior in the eyes of Buddha.The storyline was adequate but I think you must be Chinese in order to fully appreciate the story and be familiar with the legend upon which director Tsui Hark based his movie. For a Westerner then Green Snake seemed a silly action comedy more than anything else.What makes Green Snake work out on the screen is the acting talents that they had recruited for the movie. Joey Wang playing White Snake and Maggie Cheung playing Green Snake were really carrying the movie quite nicely and they were wellcast for the roles of the snakesmorphedintohumanshape. HsingKuo Wu playing the scholar was also adding a good amount to the movie with his performance. However personally then I can't claim to think that Wenzhuo Zhao playing the monk really had any good acting skill in this movie.The effects in the movie were adequate for what the movie was and taking into consideration that the movie is from 1993 then don't get your hopes up too high. The snakes were adequate but the summoned fiery dragon was ludicrous to look at.What did work for the movie was the transition between human and snake that the sisters had going on. There was a great sense of them actually being snakes in human bodies. And thumbs up to Tsui Hark Maggie Cheung Joey Wang and the special effects team on their accomplishments in order to make this believable.If you are expecting a grand martial arts drama then Green Snake will leave you sorely disappointed. This is not a martial arts movie despite having some fighting sequences here and there. This is a fantasy drama movie based on a Chinese legend.This 1993 movie is not really amongst the more impressive of movies to have been directed at the hand of Tsui Hark.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very much entertained then touched and finally saddened by the movie. It was very beautiful despite some technical shortcomings and lack of good fights. Definitely the CG and magic could seem funny and outdated they are not important though and do not detract from the overall quality and value. The music seems very good as well at least to my not very discerning ear I liked it a lot.The movie was very interesting to watch for a few reasons. Obviously the two actresses were very pretty and there were many really pleasant scenes in the movie involving them taking the clothes off. There are enough silly and funny scenes as well.I would not say this is a martialarts or Kung Fu movie definitely not a typical one. There is litte going for the martial arts and the movie concentrates on the love life of the two heroines and their naive teacher with some interruptions from a crazy blind taoist monk ghosthunter. For me it was deep enough to think about and entertaining at the same time with an unfortunate but maybetypical pessimistic ending.What is important in the movie is the moral story of Buddhist improvement and the circle of life and death. Two snake spirits sisters most likely are training to become humans to be able to advance their spiritual position the way I understand it in order to achieve nirvana? Or maybe because they think the emotions of humans are very important and beautiful it is difficult for me to say. I did definitely find this story touching. One of the sisters the white snake wifey says white is the color of wisdom has been training twice as long as the Green Blue Snake and is very powerful. She gets herself a man and they fall in love. Part of the movie is about her falling in love with him with the sister being doubtful if human emotions are worth it. This is indeed a very light and beautiful part of the movie I did love it. The Blue is trying to understand the emotions but she is a bit lazy and likes being a snake so is not training hard enough. Additionally she is an erotic dancer to add a bit spice to the movie the initial scene where the two appear is worth watching for sure. She is also trying to get the man of her sister maybe out of jealousy were it not too human a feeling.After the first part of the movie there is the second where the sisters live together with the man who starts noticing that they are a bit strange and suspects they are indeed evil snake spirits. In fact he is absolutely terrified the more noble to be later when despite terror he refuses to poison them. He obviously loves both of them and cannot help the monk who is after themThe Monk... I really truly despise this persona. He did seem noble besides incredibly powerful. He is a Buddhist monk living his belief 110 holier than thou. He seemed to understand that the spirits are not all to be hunted. However he has a terrible fault in his character a typical universal transcultural hamartia where he cannot see that he has human emotions and that he is a man who cannot escape desire. He is fighting those feelings and though the refusal to accepts them develops hatred pettiness vengefulness PRIDE  and forgets about mercy and compassion. He does realize it at the end but it is too late for some of the main characters... I hate when it happens.It is too much to describe the movie in its totality. However it is difficult to stop writing about this movie too. I need to finish saying that the last part of the movie is spent despising the proud monk and hoping he realizes the mistake. In other words the hallmarks of good tragedy. Beautiful but sad with the lasting feeling that by changing a minute of the ending we would be able to finish with a more positive and heartwarming outcome. I understand this would not be as cathartic but catharsis is often and overpriced commodity.If you are inclined this way you could consider the ending more positive with some characters having a chance to meet in future lives having achieved the humanity they sought others realizing the mistakes and being burdened with the feelings and unwelcome pain.Hated the ending and loved the movie.".

It's actually a quite sad and sympathetic look at the way abnormalities were treated in the early part of the 20th century and has direct parallels to the obsession with physical perfection causing eating disorders today. Tod Browning of course asks us to consider who are the bigger freaks those with deformed bodies or those with deformed souls? The two normal people who are out to cheat and steal are monstrous whereas the freaks are quite likable and charming. The ending is disturbing to be sure but it's hard to condemn the freaks for acts that seem largely justified.Is it a coincidence that in several shots showing Cleopatra reclining on a sofa she appears to be deformed herself in one shot it looks as if she has no legs. Has anybody else noticed this? Freaks was obviously way ahead of its time. There's a very interesting documentary on the DVD about its reception in 1932 it bombed and pretty much ruined Browning's career. Thank God that the general public is not allowed to be the final arbiter of a film's value. Think how many priceless films we would have lost by now if that were the case.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "I really dig 1930s horror movies. There's just something special about them that can never be recreated. A lot of it has to do with the talkies being new territory many of the directors adapting German Expressionist techniques to Hollywood melodrama and the freedom allowed before the Hayes Code really kicked in.  Movies like 'Dracula' 'Frankenstein' 'Bride Of Frankenstein' 'Island Of Lost Souls' 'The Invisible Man' and 'White Zombie' are horror classics which still impress today. I wonder whether anyone will be watching the lame horror movies of today in seventy years for any other reason than some cheap laughs? Todd Browning made the transition from silent movies and directed the hugely successful 'Dracula' in 1931. It was a sensation and made Bela Lugosi a horror icon. Browning could pretty much do anything he chose after that. He chose to do 'Freaks'. Great for us as not so great for him. The movie was universally reviled and even banned in some countries and his career never fully recovered. But 'Freaks' is an extraordinary movie with a lot of heart.  It has faults sure   some corny acting at times  and not so great production values  but it really doesn't matter. I don't know anyone who's seen it who hasn't been deeply affected by it. The reason the movie caused such a negative reaction back in the 1930s was because it used real circus performers including Zip the Pinhead and Radian The Living Torso. Many people found this to be distasteful and exploitative but the performers seemed to be glad to get the opportunity to work and the whole crux of the movie is that the freaks are more decent than the normal Cleopatra Olga Baclanova  the trapeze artist who marries little person Hans Harry Earls for his money. 'Freaks' is still a very powerful and unique movie. It has inspired many creative people over the years from the Surrealists to The Ramones to Jodorowsky to David Lynch. 'Freaks' comes with my highest recommendation!".

	schema:reviewBody "A forest glade somewhere in Europe. A warm sunny day with children playing on the grass. But the camera moves closer and reveals that something is terribly wrong. For these are not children but tragically misshapen human beings. Pinheads. Dwarfs. A young man with only half a body. A man without arms or legs. These are the Freaks.In 1932 director Tod Browning fresh from his success with DRACULA was instructed by Irving Thalberg to top FRANKENSTEIN. He succeeded. The resulting film was considered so ghastly that it was banned in Britain for 30 years. It is the strangest film MGM ever released.Browning wanted to tell a tale of love greed  revenge set in a circus most particularly in the sideshow of human anomalies. He scoured Europe  America for the perfect cast. He got them Violet  Daisy Hilton the celebrated Siamese twins dwarf brother  sister Harry  Daisy Earles Johnny Eck the Half Boy a good actor he will remain in your mind a long time the tragic Josephine Joseph a hermaphrodite as well as a human skeleton armless girls and the female pinheads among others.While the plot is exploitive  the title tasteless these people show us glimpses of their hearts some of the agony of their condition and make us wonder What if I'd been born as one of them?'The rest of the cast is made up of MGM stock players Leila Hyams Wallace Ford Edward Brophy Olga Baclanova and the screen's champion stutterer Roscoe Ates.The plot is simple. A beautiful trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money then plots his murder with her lover the circus strong man. The subsequent action is both horrifying  strangely satisfying. Various scenes  the Freaks' Banquet the chase through the storm  are among the most bizarre ever filmed. You won't soon forget the time you spend with the FREAKS.".

These are the Freaks.In 1932 director Tod Browning fresh from his success with DRACULA was instructed by Irving Thalberg to top FRANKENSTEIN. He succeeded. The resulting film was considered so ghastly that it was banned in Britain for 30 years. It is the strangest film MGM ever released.Browning wanted to tell a tale of love greed  revenge set in a circus most particularly in the sideshow of human anomalies. He scoured Europe  America for the perfect cast. He got them Violet  Daisy Hilton the celebrated Siamese twins dwarf brother  sister Harry  Daisy Earles Johnny Eck the Half Boy a good actor he will remain in your mind a long time the tragic Josephine Joseph a hermaphrodite as well as a human skeleton armless girls and the female pinheads among others.While the plot is exploitive  the title tasteless these people show us glimpses of their hearts some of the agony of their condition and make us wonder What if I'd been born as one of them?'The rest of the cast is made up of MGM stock players Leila Hyams Wallace Ford Edward Brophy Olga Baclanova and the screen's champion stutterer Roscoe Ates.The plot is simple. A beautiful trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money then plots his murder with her lover the circus strong man. The subsequent action is both horrifying  strangely satisfying. Various scenes  the Freaks' Banquet the chase through the storm  are among the most bizarre ever filmed. You won't soon forget the time you spend with the FREAKS.";

The script developed out of an earlier one named Spurs that had been in MGM's possession since the late 1920s. The success of Universal's horror films of 1931 Dracula and Frankenstein had studios scrambling to cash in on the trend. Horror films weren't new of course but repeated commercial success of horror films released in quick succession was. A number of factors contributed to the phenomenon including the Great Depression the lingering cultural impact from World War I and the advent of sound films. So even though Freaks wasn't exactly horror and the protagonists weren't exactly monsters it was close enough. In the early 1930s the public had not yet been overexposed to mediasensationalized differences in human appearances and behavior. The effect of the film then in conjunction with memories of real life horrors including those of warmangled veterans offered the emotional reaction that producers and studios are often seeking from horror films.But Freaks is really part tragic drama part character study and in many ways it is almost a documentary. The modern attraction to the film comes from a few sources. One the gawking effect or the simple fact of watching the freaks in action. Sideshows are an unfortunately dying phenomenon if they're not already dead many would say they are largely because of a combination of medical advances which often cure the physical differences that would have made victims sideshow candidates and political correctness which mistakenly sees sideshows as negatively exploitative. It's fascinating watching the different kinds of people in the film and their behavior including not only their social interactions but how some of them manage to just get around and perform everyday activities such as eating lighting a cigarette and so on. This kind of material takes up at least half of the film's short running time 64 minutes initially it ran closer to 90 minutes but 26 minutes of cuts were made and are now apparently lost to appease the New York State censor board.Two this was a lost film figuratively and almost literally for quite some time. MGM wanted nothing to do with it. For a while it had been playing the roadshow circuit in different cuts under different titles such as Nature's Mistakes. The film had been banned in many areas and at least technically is still banned in some. It eventually appeared on VHS in the 1980s but until the recent DVD release it has never been very easy to find in most rental or retail outlets.Three the most common modern reading of the filmand this was also part of director Tod Browning's intention in making Freaks even if the average audience member didn't see it this way at first has it as a Nightbreed 1990like turning of the dramatic tables where the extremely alienated monsters are the sympathetic protagonists and the ostensibly normal humans turn out to be the real monsters. For those who like films best where they can identify in some emotional way with the characters Freaks is particularly attractive to anyone who feels alienated or strongly different even looked down upon by normal society. At various times and by various people Freaks has been read as everything from purely exploitative schlock to a socialist parable to a film imbued with odd commentary metaphors and subtexts about malefemale couplings and Oedipal complexes.Freaks isn't a great film in terms of the usual criteria such as storytelling exquisite performances and so on but it's appropriate that it wouldn't be a masterpiece per the normal criteriait's not about normal people. The film is certainly valuable as a creative almost experimental artwork not to mention as a more or less permanent record of the decayed and almost abandoned artform of sideshows. It's not surprising that not every cast member is an incredible actorfor many roles there was only one person available who could have fulfilled the character in a particular way making the stilted delivery of dialogue more excusable. In any event this is an important film historically and a joy to watch.".

In the 1930's it seemed as though the filmmakers had to set up the audience or apologize in a way for what they were about to see. The opening before the title card explains how freaks or human oddities have been treated by society. It tells how such deformed people were shunned from society but how they have normal thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. This truly is the power of this truly moving funny very strange and ultimately frightening film from the Dark Carnival mind of director Tod Browning...No reason to do a summary here that ruins the experience for new audiences to discover on their own and the rest of the reviewers have all ready done a stellar job I'm sure of giving plot synopsis. Let's say that the average viewer will be stunned at first by the fact that real deformed dwarfs midgetssiamese twins and other oddities were the actors in this film. And that in itself lends the film its mysterious power and casts its spell on the viewer as much now in 2004 as I'm sure it did in the 30's and upon its rediscovery in the 1960's. The tone of this film varies throughout. At it's center really are several relationships Hans and his fiance Hans and the Big Lady Cleopatra Frozo the Clown and Venus Hercules the strong man and Cleopatra and of course the Freaks vs. Hercules and Cleopatra and the special code of the Freaks.There are several lame 1930's jokes an example I thinks she likes you bbbbut hhe don't! stutters a clown in the circus when the half malefemale character walks by Hercules and stops to take a gander. It's a strange perverse joke and an example of what you're in for with this movie.The power of the film is within the freaks themselves. We are invited to gawk stare but ultimately sympathize with them. We want to see anyone who threatens them get their comeuppance and boy do they ever get that! The freak that will freak you out the most The Living Torso Radian.You'll love Frozo and Venus and pull for them throughout.You'll root for Hans and Frida.You'll enjoy Rosco the clown's humorous performance.You'll be truly disturbed by the classic uberhorror scene of the freaks crawling with knives in the mud in the rainstorm revenge sequence toward the end. Some of the most classic images in all of film not just horror.I love it when Hans calls other big people in the circus who make him angry  Swine! He rules. When the title card THE WEDDING FEAST comes up you too will be truly FREAKED out! I love this movie and it has quickly become one of my favorites of all time right alongside 1930's classics like Dracula Frankenstein etc.".

	schema:headline " Gasp this movie is brilliant!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Freaks' is a totally unique and superb film by Tod Browning. He made himself legendary one year before this came out  in 1931  with the alltime horror classic Dracula'. This film however is something completely different and it nearly cost Browning his career. Since Browning had the courage to cast actual deformed actors the words distasteful' and exploitative' were automatically attached to his masterpiece and it remained banned in many countries for too many years. Very unjustified of course because throughout the whole film you NEVER feel like a voyeur and neither is the misery of these unfortunate people overly exposed. On the contrary I'd sayyou can't but get deeply affected by these circus freaks. Especially in the 30's when the people didn't know much about physical anomalies and feared the unknown I dare to say Tod Browning's Freaks' could have been an essential social portrait. And keep in mind that Browning's main moral is that the freaks' show a lot more solidarity and honesty than the normal' people whose every motivation is driven by greed and power. The plot of this purely gold film is set in a traveling circus in which the freaks and normally formed people work together. The beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover plot a cowardly plan and she uses her beauty to seduce the rich midget named Hans a brilliant Harry Earless who also starred in Browning's The Unholy Tree'. When the greedy couple openly insults the group spirit of the freaks and publicly humiliates Hans an eerie act of vengeance is thought up. This film is over 70 years old and it'll still unquestionably shock and amaze you. To me it's just perfect. An outstanding mixture of warmhearted characters great dialogue and tension. The climax in which the freaks seal the portentous fate of their enemies is an immortal piece of pure terror! Freaks' is one of the most dazzling classics ever made and must be seen by anybody who ever showed any interest in cinema.".

	schema:headline " Fascinating!";
	schema:reviewBody "Over the years I've seen Freaks perhaps four times  all in theatres and on cinema screens in revivals. I've never seen it on TV though I imagine it's been shown there.It's fascinating and hypnotically watchable still not always for the right reasons. Yes it's exploitive of the freaks. Yet given their opportunities in 1932 when they were either confined in institutions or exhibited in sideshows all over the world the film gives them a curious dignity simply by offering them a onetime appearance in a Hollywood film that demanded more of them some of them than mere sideshow antics. The script of course also gives them dignity of a kind at least relative to the prejudices of the times i.e. Don't betray the freaks or they'll turn on you cut you up and make you one of them..That the film was shocking in its day and often banned says far more about audiences of the '30s than the actual film. The only truly powerful sequence is the brilliant storm sequence that climaxes Freaks. Emotionally it is perfectly positioned in the film's structure audiences inwardly understand and root for the freaks creeping and slithering through the mud beneath the wagon wheels to exact their revenge . . . while simultaneously being frightened of them and of what's to come. A brilliant and inspired sequence that deserves its legendary status.The remainder of Freaks though entirely watchable is not always watchable for the right reasons as mentioned.Namely the dialogue and the acting. The structure is fine. But many of the lines are stilted and phony even for films of that era. None of the freaks were trained actors. Such careers simply didn't exist in those days. Midget Daisy Earles as Frieda does perhaps the best job. Yet even she has no notion nor experience of how to sustain a character arc. Her brother Harry Earles as Hans has tremendous vitality in his role but no idea how to deliver these lines convincingly. Yet he's a good instinctive actor as witness his silent moments in the film. Olga Baclanova as Cleopatra certainly holds the screen and is the best actor in the cast. Hers must have been a difficult task  playing a completely despicable circus diva with no redeeming value whatsoever. Henry Victor as Hercules? Mediocre.Tod Browning's VISION for this film was  is breathtaking. Contrast real physical mutants with 'normal' people and get the audience to identify with the 'freaks.' Then take them through a murderous mutilating emotionally wrenching climax. That's a challenge in 2005 much less 73 years ago.Browning's decision to use real freaks as opposed to madeup actors is noble and brave and true. But so intense were the prejudices of the day that that single decision affected every decision that followed. No name actor would agree to appear in the cast citing disgust and worse. Five writers are credited on IMDb with the script  always a bad sign. None of the freaks had any real acting training or careers as actors. Much of the cast were amateurs in other words and it shows.Whatever tensions are generated by the story's structure dissipate whenever the lead midgets are on screen. Though Daisy Earles has some intermittent moments of effectiveness Harry Earles does not. He almost sounds as if he's delivering his lines phonetically.Absent good actors in the lead roles Baclanova overacts continually but it works in context with her character I've often wondered what Freaks might have been as a silent film.The two great setpieces the wedding sequence and the storm climax are amazing  for entirely different reasons.At the wedding the freaks are obviously having a grand time acting for Hollywood's cameras while Baclanova convincingly goes over the top. The sequence is disturbing on more than one level. First it's impossible to believe that silly One of us! chant. Yet it's disturbing at the same time it's phony. Possibly it was accepted as real in 1932 but I doubt it. Second you have an actress who was reportedly sweet and kind to her costars having to behave abominably with them on camera. How did Browning explain all this to some of his mentally childlike freaks? Visually the wedding sequence is nothing out of the ordinary. Emotionally it is wrenching  both within the story structure and outside the fiction this and several other scenes that are blatantly exploitive beg the question How were these people treated? Did they understand what was going on?From all reports the freaks were treated with respect and appreciation.The storm climax on the other hand is simply stunning cinema. Silent except for the deafening thunderstorm it is brilliantly lit shot and edited. It is also emotionally jolting. Here finally the freaks we have identified and empathized with are reduced to monstrous things snaking through mud puddles in the dark of night. They're on their way to do GodKnowsWhat to the normals. But by now the audience has realized that the normals are really the freaks and vice versa.That's an amazing level of dualaudience identification and sophistication for 1932  or even today.Freaks is a failed enterprise in many ways. But Tod Browning's VISION of it was so audacious that it continues to stir controversy even now.The ending seems abrupt. Yet what other image could so immediately efficiently crystallize the themes of all that's gone before?".

Whereas the sets in Dracula were as skillfully rendered as the most elaborate of tapestries the abstraction of Freaks comes from the title characters who are at once hideous wonderful and all too human. Browning doesn't present these characterswho were actual sideshow performersin an exploitative manner though the long disclaimer that precedes the film is a definite reflection of his concern but instead touches on a humility modesty and altruism that makes them as capable of expressing joy sorrow and vengeance as any 'normal' human being. And that's the overriding moral of Freaks wherein busty trapeze artist Cleopatra marries sensitive midget Hans only so she and her lunkheaded strongman lover can make off with his inheritance. Granted this plot has since become clich but to apply it to sideshow performers who are truly in their element 'under the big top' is something of a masterstroke...as it makes the 'normals' seem that much more outofplace and unwelcome. A complaint as some of the dialog is difficult to decipher it seems that the sound quality was either poorly recorded at the time or when it was transferred to video.".

	schema:reviewBody "So much has been written about this film one is wary of writing about it figuring that most everything that can be said about it has already been said and that there's not much more to add. It has been praised and damned and was so hated by the boss of the studio that produced it that he had his company's trademark removed from the credits and sold it to an independent distributor. It was banned in England for thirty years. The movie's director Tod Browning was best known for a series of highly popular macabre melodramas he had made with silent picture star Lon Chaney in the twenties. Just prior to making Freaks he had made Dracula with Bela Lugosi. As the result of the controversy surrounding Freaks his career was ruined. He was allowed to make a few more films but none did well and his career's momentum which had been strong in the early thirties was soon lost. For all intents and purposes Browning gambled his reputation on this one movie and he lost badly.Freaks concerns life in a circus that features a particularly large side show of freaks pinheads a bearded lady midgets an armless and legless man and so forth. The story revolves around the efforts of a beautiful 'normal' woman known as Cleopatra to woo and wed a midget she knows to be worth a good deal of money. This woman has a lover Hercules the circus strong man and together they plot against the hapless little fellow who is quite smitten with her. Cleopatra hates her tiny husband and plans to poison him for her inheritance. The midget becomes quite ill from a lethal drink she gives him however by this time the other freaks are onto her. As their little friend ails in bed they extract a terrible vengeance for what was done to their comrade. The bare bones of the story make the film sound better than it is. By no means is Freaks a bad film but it moves like molasses and is for the most part badly acted. Its ideas are better than its images. This surely is not the fault of the freaks themselves who are the best thing about the picture. Despite their appearance they are an engaging lot. In this respect the movie succeeds. We come to like the freaks and care what happens to them. The ideas behind the film are exciting to think about. Normal people are indeed often hateful and the suffering and crippled souls among us seem far worthier. Beauty has a cruelty about it. But the vehicle that carries these and the other messages that Browning put forth is sadly inadequate and not up to the task.Yet I highly recommend this film. For all its faults it is at its best a powerful and original work. That it deals with the entertainment world cannot but raise the issue of the movie being perhaps a criticism of Hollywood and the studio system which may also be why it was so despised within the industry. It is a guilty pleasure if ever there was one but it is in the end more interesting to talk about and look back on than to actually experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tod Browning's FREAKS is still haunting and unsettling after more than 75 years despite draconian edits clumsy dialog implausible and ultracontrived situations mostly amateurish acting and a deteriorated soundtrack at least half the dialog is barely comprehensible solely because of the human types on display. If a similar scenario say a group of nonfreakish circus performers who gang up on a newly arrived golddigger who upsets the camaraderie of their tribe had been cast with normal human beings it would have come and gone with minor praise for some interesting cinematography.The imagery harks back to the silent era. When an intertitle The Wedding Feast appears one can't help wondering if this film might have worked better a few years earlier as a lateperiod silent with elaborate musical scoring and sound effects. The feast itself has been accurately described as bizarre by many viewers. A dwarf dances awkwardly on a banquet table to an audience of fellow freaks chanting one of us one of us! as Cleopatra the beautiful but heartless trapeze artist Olga Baclanova gulps champagne and repeatedly bursts into explosive guffaws. The dialog is so crude and ridiculous one wonders if it wasn't improvised on the spot. Baclanova overacts shamelessly throughout this sequence.Harry and Daisy Earles alternately move and embarrass us as a midget couple torn apart by Cleopatra's intrigues. Daisy manages to be heartbreakingly sincere but simultaneously wooden. The scene of Madame Tetrallini supervising the microcephalics pinheads at a picnic in the forest is deeply touching. The human torso Rardion is perhaps the most mindboggling to behold like a plump stockingsheathed caterpillar with a human head stuck on.Ultimately it's a story about humanity bonding comradeship. The fear comes from the uncomfortable empathy we experience at the sight of those born without legs or arms or fully developed brains or common gender characteristics. We imagine how we would feel if we too had been born that way. Through most of the film it is painful for us to gaze upon these individuals whose mere appearance is drama in itself. The melodramatic scenario that is imposed on them seems unnecessary. But the climax works even if the coda with the Earles is stilted. I think this film encourages us to love or at least respect one another as humans. A very simple message which appearing at the dawn of the Holocaust when people like the ones depicted here were routinely exterminated by the Nazis takes on new meaning for the contemporary viewer.".

This film would fail on all fronts if given a show trial by the MPAA.Don't let that discourage you from the movie. The film has a very positive view towards the sideshow performers. They may be exploited in some sense and made to be fools. But they are never treated with malice. And in the end they come across as the good guys. A film like this doesn't try to cop out and give us a Snow White ending or plot. Almost everyone comes out at least a little dirty. Though some more dirty than others apparently the original script had everyone coming out equally as bad.The film does have one fatal flaw though its only about an hour long. Many scenes seem terribly rushed and the plot seems to zoom by. This film would have developed at a more comfortable pace if it were 105 minutes. The film finishes with an amazing climax. This almost makes up for the short length.Make sure to see this movie any way you can. Beg steal or borrow its a film you are not likely to forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "Freaks was a highly controversial film at the time of its creation and its easy to see why. The casting of actual deformed people in a movie is an audacious decision. This can be seen in two ways a real freak show which is very very disturbing or an investigation into human character. I like to think that Tod Browning was striving for the bigger picture but sometimes its not so obvious. The reallife freak show actors were definitely fascinating but not much was done to create sympathy at the individual level. Rather the freaks are represented as a varied group that works together to get things done. While this is effective in some ways it didn't let the viewer surpass the barrier between seeing it on screen and understanding how it feels.The subject matter is successful in bringing some deep messages about human character. The film is unique in that it does not try to hide anything. The freaks are not meant to be liked right away although possibly pitied. But as the film progresses the contrast between the normal people Hercules and Cleopatra with the collection of freaks builds up. When the marriage between Cleopatra and the midget occurs the freaks are aware that its a plot. The is meant to define the freaks as the good guys but the conclusion returns to a dark theme.Freaks is one of those films that was fascinating but disturbing at the same time. It is unlikely that there will ever be a movie similar to Freaks. Tod Browning took a risk that impacted the rest of his career with this film. It is worth seeing because of the important subject and the real actors. Its one of those things that we cannot cover up or pretend doesn't exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Freaks is many things but boring is not one of them. Tod Browning's film happens to have a certain power to it in that it's actually kind of conventional with its story a man falls in love with a woman who wants him not immediately but soon after finding out for his money and when his friends find out they plot revenge against the dastardly woman. It almost reminded me of a fable in a way like some kind of cautionary tale. But it's definitely not simplistic in the way of what you might expect from 1932 i.e. 'watch out for these deformed crazy people who may kill you in the dead of night etc'. It's the other way around where the woman Cleo and her real lover Hercules are the 'freaks' of the film as they lack the real friendship compassion understanding and reality of their situation like the other sideshow attractions do. It's Hans who ends up getting duped but then getting a happy ending and rightfully so with maybe the most normal of the bunch his shouldbe wife who also happens to be a dwarf.So in terms of being a 'message' movie it's actually quite good by sticking very firmly to its onedimensional guns. It doesn't fool its audience exactly by being something else that it isn't and Browning's background in silent and horror films is shown in some very memorable scenes. Chiefly of these are the wedding banquet with the milestone of cheerily creepy cinematic moments with the 'ooblegobble' chant where everything becomes clear. There are also some really horrifying images in the climax when the 'freaks' finally get their payback against Cleo. Now because of such drama being put alongside such a demented atmosphere the film lacks a lot of things other conventional films even have. The story even at only over an hour takes some time to really get started after some gettingtoknow scenes with the bulk of the ensemble. And there are a couple of holes that pop up as well the end moment where Cleo is revealed in the sideshow literally having become 'one of them' it's too ridiculous and silly to even think of how it happened.But somehow Browning's film doesn't feel too aged it's actually one of those superbly shot early talkies where the images still speak well enough on their own while the dialog from these mostly nonprofessionals adds more of the emotional impact in the scenes. Once the audience can come to accept what these people are born with or have become and in this day and age where day time talk show outranks most of what is seen in the film it's not hard to do it's hard not to dismiss its worth. But if you turn it off after starting to see some of these strange oddities of human nature you'll be missing the point. This is one hell of a picture that should stand the test of time.".

The film treats them quite affectionately with only a few scenes that could be considered gratuitous.Another fascinating element of FREAKS is as an artifact of its time. The sound is awkward because director Tod Browning still hadn't mastered talkies a Hollywood veteran of dozens of films Browning would only make three more films after FREAKS.

Basically a soapopera set in a sideshow it is a look into the lives of a group of sideshow performers in a traveling circus.In the beginning of the film we meet Cleopatra Baclanova a beautiful but avaricious trapeze artist who seduces and marries midget circus owner Hans Earles to get at his money. At the wedding reception the closeknit society of freaks welcomes her into the family as one of us one of us. Cleopatra is disgusted however by this very thought and tells them she will never be grotesque while her secret lover Hercules the strongman howls with laughter. She humiliates her smitten husband by openly kissing Hercules. After they find out they tried to poison Hans the group comes up with an idea to take revenge at the beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover.Tod Browning DRACULA THE UNHOLY THREE put his career on the line with the making of this film. MGM trying to compete with Universal and cash in on the new appetite for horror films in the early thirties never knew what hit them with this film. It caused quite a stir and such an amount of negative publicity they decided to virtually disown it and until the '60s it remained practically unseen. The fact that infamous bad film maker Dwain Esper REEFER MADNESS MANIAC see my earlier review showed the film in road shows and burlesque houses only enhanced the film's notorious cult reputation. Even today many scour away from seeing this film because of its supposed voyeurism. It might be seen as a very disturbing and ugly film but at the same time a beautiful and ultimately a moving account of the shortcomings and prejudice of mankind. Most people didn't get it and many thought of it as a new low in Hollywood depravity and were horrified with the film. In truth it's a very warm and humane look at how physically deformed people manage on their own and a fascinating insight in the world of sideshow performers a milieu Browning a former snake man in the circus himself was very familiar with. Not an outstanding film in terms of cinematic qualities but because of the completely unique subject matter and the almost documentary like approach to the phenomenon of the side show whilst using actual freaks a term that didn't have the same connotation as today. In 1994 the film was selected for the National Film Registry's archive of cinematic treasures. Rightfully so not only because it's a unique piece of cinema but historically one the very few cinematic accounts left on attitudes towards disabled persons. Even today the reluctance by most people to even admit this film's very existence only exemplifies how many misunderstandings about people that are not normal still exist.The recent DVDrelease comes with the excellent documentary Freaks Sideshow Cinema.Camera Obscura  910".

And wouldn't you know it the pinheads including Schlitze the inspiration for The Ramones' mascot who always came out to join the band during their live shows at the end of the Pinhead song were in FREAKS.The Ramones also slightly modified the freak chant from the wedding scene changing GoobleGobble to GabbaGabba. I guess Jeffrey Hyman Joey Ramone must have viewed himself as somewhat freakish he did have an incredible look and really related to the group of circus curiosities assembled for this film.After being shelved for about three decades FREAKS started playing again at arthouse theaters in the mid60's and that's where Joey had to have come across it.As far as my film review this movie needs to be viewed. Look past the stilted acting and soak up the message. It will stay with you for a long long time.".

England has need of the Rogues Of Sherwood Forest because Prince John is now King John and ruling like the tyrant we had a hint of when he was Regent and Richard I his older brother was on the throne.Now John is King in fact and he's proving to be as bad as he promised and he's played by George MacReady which is never good in most films. MacReady wants to put onerous new taxes to pay for troops that are to be supplied by MacReady's new good friend the Count of Flanders played by Lowell Gilmore. They're to enforce John's will.Derek as the Earl of Huntington opposes John and is branded a traitor. After this it's time to send a clarion call out for the Merry Men those who rode with Dad and newer and younger ones.Making his third appearance in the role of Little John is Alan Hale. Hale played the part with both Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. This film isn't quite up to those standards.In fact as do so many Hollywood epics it rewrites history quite a bit. The upshot of it all is the Magna Carta but it was never arrived at quite like in this film.Derek's love interest is a new Maid Marianne in the person of Diana Lynn. She's MacReady's royal ward and when she falls of Derek she agrees to be his spy at court.One thing that was really dumb in my opinion was Lowell Gilmore's change in attitude. Throughout most of the film Gilmore is presented as a cold fish who's just interested in money. Than toward the end to spice things up Gilmore says he's willing to let MacReady have those Flemish mercenaries if he can just marry Lynn. A really dumb script idea.The action sequences aren't bad though but the film isn't as good as either the Douglas Fairbanks silent or the Errol Flynn sound classic. Not even Alan Hale's presence can change that.".

But it's definitely not for everyone... you have to back off and understand the mood and general feel of the movie before you have the context to find the actions of the characters funny. Then you will get it. And what is this context I'm referring to? This movie explores the very essence of boredom and mediocrity as you follow the daily life of a dorky guy doing uninteresting things in a small unexciting town. Napolean's constant openmouth blank stare says I'm only tolerating this monotonous existence because I've got nothing better to do. It took me about 15 minutes into the movie and then I GOT it. The movie has no real plot because it isn't about an interesting story it's about the real life that exists BETWEEN the interesting stories. Ever call up your bud because you're bored then talk about what you're not doing then decide to get together and be bored together and spend the remainder of the evening trying to think of something to do to no avail? This movie is about this very type of thing... a tribute to the ordinary everyday stuff that you have no reason or desire to remember... like eating reheated leftover Hamburger Helper or that old shirt you wear when you're working that you're not afraid to get dirty or some magazine you flipped through to pass the time in the dentist's waiting room.I constantly found myself saying This all seems too strangely familiar. I knew a guy like that. I've done stuff like that. I've been to a store like that. I've been in a house like that. This isn't the kind of movie to make you suddenly laugh out loud it's a movie that will first make you chuckle and then chuckle some more and pretty soon you can't stop laughing as scenes and characters continuously remind you about the absurdity of watching random stupid pointlessness. Why would something boring be interesting to watch? You'll just have to see it to understand.".

He has no friends he's picked on by bullies he has a somewhatodd home life ... but through it all he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.Napoleon and his older brother Kip Aaron Ruell live with their grandmother but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico Jon Gries a selfstarter who's living in 1982 when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback thus altering Rico's life forever. Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's oftencombative relationship with Uncle Rico Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.Napoleon befriends the new kid in school Pedro Efren Ramirez who has a sweet bike can talk to girls and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student Deb Tina Majorino all grown up from Waterworld who secretly it seems likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit  while fitting in with others like him.Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky dorky Napoleon he resembles ButtHead in countenance although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg although he seems to overreact at times What are you gonna do today Napoleon? Napoleon Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH! Still his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.I think where the film ultimately succeeds aside from the casting of Heder is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure it's a high school movie and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks but not much time is devoted to them. Sure there's a big dance but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with then isn't a typical comingofage story but rather a unique take on a rather mundane  albeit lifealtering  time in a boy's life.".

If you are between 1220 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However there are some adults in here who play key roles too.The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common they are nerds and weird people and they are all hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words this movie is an original.I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original looking at new faces. That begins with the title character played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut oversized glasses moon boots and an unpredictable and lowkey personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out he does something unexpected. Whatever he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.Suffice to say Napoleon and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them  male female young old good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes like the bimbo prettiest girl in school running for class president  and her stupid macho boyfriend but most of the people were pretty unique.If you like absurd humor this is your cup of tea and you don't have to be a teen to enjoy this. Hey I'm old enough to be Napoleon's grandfather and I laughed my butt off from the beginning to the end of this unconventional film.".

There are Napoleons Pedros Summers Debs and Dons in EVERY American High School. One of the funniest parts about this movie is that it IS so accurate. And who hasn't run across an internet geek like Kip? This movie is filled with jokes about our culture today. I haven't met one person yet who has seen it and not liked it. Talk about a cult classic in the making. The film uses witty humor and a little goofy humor. It's the PERFECT film for light comedy. If you're into those kind of films that make you think a lot this one definitely isn't for you. On the other hand if you laugh at things like Napoleon getting psyched for a milktesting contest or lying about hunting wolverines in Alaska exaggerating about his bow staff skills or his brother bragging about chatting online with babes all day you can't go wrong. 1010".

The only thing that gave it away that this film takes place more recently were the references to the Internet for Uncle Rico's time machine the heavy technodance music that Pedro's cousin play in their muscle mobile and Kip's online romance with Lafawnduh as well as Napoleon's dance sequence to Jamiroquoi's Canned Heat at the very end which BTW seemed to be inspired by the Solid Gold dancers of the 70's and 80's.Then something strange happened.

The first couple minutes I was kinda worried that the naysayers were right but as the movie continued I couldn't stop laughing! And for those how think that it was wrong to exploit the nerds in society you definitely missed the whole point of the movie. It wasn't exploited them it was more celebrating them and their uniqueness. And as for being unrealistic this movie was more realistic than any movie I have seen. That was part of what made it hilarious. Not doubt this will be a cult classic! GO NAPOLEON!I give this film a 10 out of 10".

The first couple minutes I was kinda worried that the naysayers were right but as the movie continued I couldn't stop laughing! And for those how think that it was wrong to exploit the nerds in society you definitely missed the whole point of the movie. It wasn't exploited them it was more celebrating them and their uniqueness. And as for being unrealistic this movie was more realistic than any movie I have seen. That was part of what made it hilarious. Not doubt this will be a cult classic! GO NAPOLEON!I give this film a 10 out of 10";

Perhaps the funniest movie I've seen in years ND explores character profiles we never thought would make it to the movies. The characters cover a wide range of social misfits and exhibit the nuances of their behavior in a way that makes sense to them if not to the general public. It's like a sociological case study of a primitive and exotic tribe of Nerds. Everyone of us should be able to recognize at least one of the ND characters from somewhere in our past or somewhere in our psyches. The acting is sublime because sometimes we forget that they ARE acting. The writing and dialogue are inventive and unexpected and so dry it might take you a few days to start laughing. But once you do start laughing you won't be able to stop. This movie is sure to be a cult classic for the new millennium the way Repo Man was the the 80's. And if you like this film consider yourself luckEEEE because not everyone will.".

In terms of story this one is tops. All of the good characters grow  and become much more than they were when the movie began. This film  celebrates friendship at it's basest level and demonstrates the triumph  of good people above overwhelming odds.  The true appeal of this movie though for me was the close attention  that the director paid to making this movie feel like the early 1990's  or late 1980's. Characters wear zubbas and hand out friendship  bracelets. Even the vocabulary the actors use comes from this era when  was the last time you called someone retarded for example but it  is done so in such a genuine manner. The music and the style are very  appropriate and you can really feel the social awkwardness of Napoleon  and his friends.  While this movie was made in many ways to appeal to those who can most  relate to the awkward years of growing up the unpopular kids the new  kid the medieval warrior obsessed clique the metal heads the stoners  all the general low lifes you probably associated with or possibly  were at school this will nevertheless appeal to everyone else. The  comedy is not made to be knee slapping but it's sublety is wonderful  and I found myself laughing throughout the entire film.  If you have ever rooted for the underdog this is the movie for you. I  can't spoil the ending for you but for real no movie has ever made me  feel as happy and as inspired as this one. I can't wait to see what  this director comes up with next!".

The screening I attended had more laughs than I was expecting because as it is obvious this is not a comedy for the masses. The director is spoofing the genre in his own way. Napoleon deep down inside is a great kid. He is not malicious and he has to suffer because this culture will reward a stupid person that appears to be cool and will put down a person such as Napoleon because they perceive him as a nerd prototype. Napoleon belongs to a dysfunctional family if ever there was one.His brother Kid is playing against type also. He appears to be a feminine boy who is into the chat rooms and has fallen in love with a mystery woman from Detroit. The uncle that comes to supervise them while their grandma is in the hospital is a grease ball and a con man rolled into one. The ending is just hysterical as Uncle Rico can't see the woman he is selling his bogus merchandise is a muscled person with a super strong husband.All the actors are excellent in their roles. One's heart goes to Jon Heder the Napoleon of the story for making his character so sweet and likable. Jon Gries as Uncle Rico is effective. Napoleon's brother played by Aaaron Ruell goes through such transformation but deep inside he is just a pretender. Efren Ramirez as Pedro seems to be in a fog throughout the film. What a joke to have him as class president! Finally Shondrella Avery as LaFawnduh gives an incredible performance and Tina Marjorino is perfect as Deb.A film to be discovered for its humor.".

My boyfriend and I also watched it together and he just rolled and replayed many of the scenes over again. I later watched the director's cut and was captivated by how they used real people from Preston and actual site locations including interiors of homes. I can only imagine that it wasn't very expensive to produce unlike some of high budget low entertainment movies that sometimes come out of Hollywood.

	schema:reviewBody "When discussing overrated movies this movie is mentioned pretty often. Most criticism I've heard stems from the movies hype as indie classic and the annoying fan base. I agree some what. Comparing it to Juno and the likes does the movie a disservice as did the great number of people spouting lines like vote for Pedro and Tina eat the ham. However. This does not change the fact that  when viewed in the right mindset and the ability to let the movie stand on its own  it is an extremely beautiful and touching story about teenage life. Napoleon is himself the very epitome of the highschool outcast shunned by the popular and taking refuge in the back of the bus. We've seen that before in various forms. Neither is his transformation which culminates in the famous dance scene original. But it is portrayed in such a perfect way. From the choice of music and the cinematography my two favorite scenes are the ones with Napoleon and Deb dancing at the disco and also the final scene with the two of them playing tetherball  the music and the camera work makes these two scenes truly spectacular  to the great work the directorswriters did with portraying the world that Napoleon Deb Pedro and others live in. The dialogue is delivered stilted and monotone. There is no real drama to speak of. It is slow. But it fits. Everything fits together and creates this backdrop of an endless land stuck in time never moving forward. To me that's why the comparison with i.e. Juno falters  nothing in this movie is in there just because. There is no pop culture references made just so the audience can get the cheap thrill of saying hey! I remember that from my childhood!. Everything is a piece of the puzzle. The dry way the characters act and speak the scenery and backdrops the deliberately aged soundtrack. Maybe that's why it's so uplifting to see the journeys the characters make from nothing out to something  Napoleon Pedro Deb Uncle Rico and not to mention Kip  whose journey mirrors Napoleons but ten times more bizarre.I could write more about this much more but I'd rather just encourage everyone who didn't like it because of the supposed indieness to watch it again. Don't mind the fan base. There is so much more to this movie than some hilarious quotes to repeat over and over again. Just give it an honest try!".

Okay second grade.It seems that from a graphic point of view the studio did absolutely nothing with colouring at all.

Rather than laughing uproariously like i was led to believe I sat there the majority of the time with a What the hell IS this... look on my face. I honestly don't get the appeal of this movie. Yes we've all known someone who was like Napoleon and there are aspects to his character that almost everyone can relate to. But that is not enough to carry an entire movie. Yes there were some funny moments. But the vast majority of the film was slow boring and thoroughly depressing.One huge problem is the characters  which considering the big selling point of this movie is the characters is not a good thing. Almost all of the characters especially the lead are incredibly UNlikable. Napoleon in particular is a mean spirited individual who has no redeeming characteristics nor does he gain any over the course of the movie. The only people who are even slightly appealing are Deb and Pedro. Unfortunately they are also as dull as dishwater which makes it really hard to root for them or anyone else. And while quirky is good to a degree you have to have an anchorpoint. This movie had none  every character was unbearably quirky with no normal characters to balance out the oddness of everyone else. There needed to be at least one normal character to relay what everyone in the audience was thinking  This placethese people are really messed up.Not to mention the utter despair of the lives these characters led. If I lived in that town I would've shot myself a long time ago. I suppose the end of the movie would be considered uplifting for those who actually led lives like that but it's only a small break in the incredibly dull lives of these characters.I did appreciate the fact that this movie was a solid PG  a comedy that doesn't rely on fart jokes or sexual innuendo every other line is great. Too bad it wasn't actually funny. As for the violence that another viewer referred to  it was incredibly minor compared to what's on daytime TV.So if you get this movie great  wear your Vote for Pedro tshirts and say IDIOT! and GOSH! every other sentence. But while this movie was supposedly targeted at someone like me Gen Xer who didn't exactly fit in in high school it completely missed the mark as far as I am concerned.".

I suppose the end of the movie would be considered uplifting for those who actually led lives like that but it's only a small break in the incredibly dull lives of these characters.I did appreciate the fact that this movie was a solid PG  a comedy that doesn't rely on fart jokes or sexual innuendo every other line is great. Too bad it wasn't actually funny. As for the violence that another viewer referred to  it was incredibly minor compared to what's on daytime TV.So if you get this movie great  wear your Vote for Pedro tshirts and say IDIOT! and GOSH! every other sentence. But while this movie was supposedly targeted at someone like me Gen Xer who didn't exactly fit in in high school it completely missed the mark as far as I am concerned.";

It tells the story of Carmine Crocco a 19thcentury Italian brigand who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the brigandage during the Italian unification by opposing the army of King Victor Emmanuel II. It stars Enrico Lo Verso Claudia Cardinale Franco Nero Remo Girone Giorgio Albertazzi among the others. The movie was quickly suspended from its cinema run and it is not available on VHS or DVD.Movie Plot Carmine Crocco Enrico Lo Verso is an outlaw native of Rionero in Vulture Basilicata who was forced to the bandit's life after killing a man who had harassed his sister. He joined Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies hoping for a pardon because the Savoy's government promised to forgive deserters in exchange for military service. But the promise wasn't kept and Crocco was arrested. He also noted that the economic situation was getting worse with new taxes and growing unemployment.He is soon released with the help of the local clergy and disappointed by the unfulfilled promise of the new government Crocco is persuaded by the cleric Don Pietro Remo Girone to become the leader of the resistance against Victor Emmanuel II promising him money and weapons. Thus Crocco joins the Bourbon side forming an army composed mainly of poor people.The brigand and his men conquer the Vulture region in the name of king Francis II gaining the support of the local population. The new Italian government is worried about this rebellion and General Enrico Cialdini Benot Valls is assigned to suppress it. The repression is cruel Cialdini orders the shooting of the brigands and anyone who deals with them mass killings where even women and children are not spared and confiscation of basic necessities.Meanwhile the Bourbon government in exile sends the Spanish General Jos Borjes Francesco Mazzini to Basilicata to reinforce and discipline the bands. Crocco does not trust Borjes from the start because he is worried about losing his leadership but he accepts the alliance. After some victorious battles Crocco breaks the alliance with Borjes because he does not want to serve under a foreigner.Crocco's lieutenant Caruso Ennio Coltorti betrays him hoping for clemency revealing to the authorities the hideouts of the brigands. After his betrayal Crocco's army suffers many casualties and many of his men are captured and executed by firing squad.

Jing knows that both their future and the welfare of her family depend in view of the authorities on their good behavior. A small error would be enough to ruin their lives.

	schema:headline " A lovely new film from Chinese master Zhang Yimou. Why has it not been given a proper worldwide release?";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene about two thirds of the way through in which an older woman mother to three children sits down with her eldest daughter and the boy she has fallen in love with and for about five minutes they speak to each other. These are hard times  all three know it. At the beginning of the scene the mother is sceptical. She treats the two as children with their heads in the clouds. But the conversation develops and gradually we realise a change in the mother. She cannot back down  in practical surviving terms she is in the right. But she softens her approach and by the end even has a kind of basic respect for the two behind her frosty exterior. For she has seen the love that these two have for each other and recognised it. It was then that I knew I was watching a great movieIf 'Lola' was a disappointment in the Asia Triennial Film Festival this year Zhang Yimou's new film  a love story set during the Chinese Cultural Revolution  makes up for it tenfold. It's not very often I get the opportunity to rave about a film like this as they are so rarely done well cynicism plot complication and saccharine clich at turns are what often makes a love story such as this horrifically superficial and painful to watch. But Yimou knows what he is doing. Arguably the finest working Chinese director with the masterpieces 'Raise The Red Lantern' 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers' to his name he has succeeded here in making a beautiful heartfelt film spilling over with the love and care that has gone into its production. Zhang Jingqiu is a student sent to do research and write a report for her school on a small village in Yichang City. She stays with the head of the village and his family. While there she meets Sun a geology student. What follows is inevitable. But how delicately rendered it is Jing is the most beautiful innocent young woman Sun has ever seen and Jing emotional and vulnerable is amazed by him. Love at first sight! But this isn't as whimsical as it sounds. Yimou hasn't completely forgotten his political ideals and ability for scathing criticism with this latest endeavour he explores just how stifled and suffocating Mao's regime was for everyone under his power and the emotional deadlock that threaten to destroy his protagonists at every turn. Frolicking even in the most innocent sense of the work was risky Sun and Jing are from different classes exacerbating the issue. Were they to be found out her life and ambitions to work as a teacher would be ruined.I was unsure during the first half of the film what to think. Yimou makes some interesting structural choices as regarding his narrative  many of the scenes are divided by intertitles telling us of an event we are not allowed to see and then moving on to its aftermath. Most directors would die before doing this  especially in a film requiring the emotional impact this needs  and I admit I doubted its benefits at first. But instead of hindering the drive of the plot Yimou has used it in such a way  not to cut the film into a digestible running length but simply to avoid over melodramatics and focus almost entirely on the couple in question. Supplementary information is given to us by other means  the filmed scenes are belong exclusively to Yimou's exploration of our two protagonists' relationship. It works perfectly. Of course we all know the rules. Both lovers are alive at the beginning the same cannot be said after the end credits begin to roll. What makes this movie so wonderful isn't its startling originality it isn't going to revolutionise cinema as we know it or spark off long lasting controversy. Rather what we are offered is a little less prestigious but by no means less special. What we find is emotional honesty  when we start to cry at the end we don't feel cheated instead we revel in the director's success. More importantly though we have felt for his characters having engaged with them completely and have a kind of renewed respect for the kind of pure unconditional love we have been shown. The film is yet another example of Yimou's mastery of the 'antimelodrama'  much like his early work this is incredibly restrained beautifully measured and patiently observed shot through with a warmth and tender humanity that shouldn't inspire anything but admiration. Cynics  stay away. But for all the romantics out there of which I admittedly am one I couldn't recommend this more highly. Simply put it's exquisite.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the debacle that was A Woman a Gun and a Noodle Shop 2009 a disappointing remake of the Coens' Blood Simple 1984 Chinese auteur Zhang Yimou restores his reputation with his latest effort that is a nostalgic throwback to the preHero period in the nineties that made the director one of the few Asian masters of the dramatic form. Under the Hawthorn Tree is clearly not Zhang at the top of his game but it is a reminder of his talent in crafting powerful tearjerkers set in the various turbulent eras of China's modern history.Hawthorn Tree is similar to The Road Home 2000 in approach. It is a beautiful love story acted out by a competent cast at times playful at times emotional but never too overtly sentimental. This is especially so for Hawthorn Tree which some have described as the purest love story ever told and I believe it just might be true. I have not seen a filmmaker approach the nearancient notion of love at first sight and the blossoming of a boygirl romance with such purity and subtlety in direction and narration in years.Zhang has unearthed a new acting gem in Zhou Dongyu a young actress who may just be the next Gong Li that is if she continues to place herself under the director's radar for the next decade. Like Zhang Ziyi who similarly made her debut in The Road Home Zhou's acting is striking because she balances restrain with her natural ability to emote the latter very potently displayed in the film's final act. Her chemistry with the male lead played by Shawn Dou who is also a newcomer is strong enough for Zhang to heavily rely on to engage viewers.As always for every Zhang film the cinematography by Zhao Xiaoding an Oscar nominee for House of Flying Daggers 2004 is stunning as the film captures and juxtaposes the misty villages with dusty urban buildings in great visual detail. Admirers of Zhang's visual style however would notice that Hawthorn Tree does not feature the flamboyant colors that characterize most of his works such as Raise the Red Lantern 1991 Hero 2002 and Curse of the Golden Flower 2006. Yes the color palette is more muted here and there is a reason for it.I would think Zhang desires to paint a more poetic picture rather than being unnecessarily grandeur. After all this is a film about the innocence of first love. With Under the Hawthorn Tree Zhang has made a romance picture that is not only memorable for the star performance by Zhou but also admirable for the film's artful simplicity.GRADE B www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved".

	schema:reviewBody "In some restaurants the chef goes out of his way to create complex dishes with intricate combinations of tastes colours and cooking styles. Others specialize in simple dishes that stand out because of the quality of the ingredients. A simple pasta pesto can be a treat if it's made with the best olive oil freshly grated parmesan and homegrown basil. Under the Hawthorn Tree is like such a simple but delicious dish. It's a straightforward story of a forbidden love told in a basic way without many frills. But Zhang Yimou is such a craftsman that he doesn't need much to make a great movie. The story is set during the cultural revolution a period of ruthless oppression by the communist regime. The young girl Jing is being watched by the authorities because her father was a 'reactionary' and she risks losing her job as a teacher. During a trip to the countryside she falls in love with Sun. Her mother is afraid the affair will harm Jing's future career and she forbids the two lovers to see each other. Zhang Yimou tells the story in a simple way focusing on the two lovers. He uses title cards to make the story go forward a smart move because it prevents the script from having to explain too much. In this way Zhang concentrates on the story of Jing and her lover Sun and nothing else. China in the seventies was a country where people led simple lives. Zhang emphasizes this by using simple props like a goldfish keychain made of yarn and beads or a metal bowl with a special decoration. The hawthorn tree from the title also has a symbolic meaning and in the very last image of the movie when we see the tree blossoming Zhang has an unexpected surprise that will make you smile. The acting is wonderful. The two leads tell just as much with their eyes their laughs and their expressions as with their words. Take for example the scene where Jing gives her goldfish to Sun and the camera lingers on their faces to show us how they feel. Wonderful film making. With this film Zhang Yimou returns to his earlier style of film making telling stories about the daily life in China. Under the Hawthorn Tree has more in common with his lesserknown films like Not One Less or The Road Home than with his visually more spectacular films like The House of Flying Daggers or even Raise The Red Lantern. Some people may be disappointed by the slow story in which nothing spectacular happens. But some of history's greatest film classics are slow and subtle. In a way Under the Hawthorn Tree made me think of David Lean's classic Brief Encounter another story about a forbidden love that stands out because of the impeccable directing and acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "With his many recent works that are nothing short of being opulent and an Olympic project that was sheer spectacle director Zhang Yimou still shows he has what it takes to take it down some notches in telling a simple but no less emotional tale of first love and romance set during the Cultural Revolution in 60s and 70s China. It is this historical setting that perhaps piqued interest in bringing the Internet novel by Ai Mi onto the big screen which lifts it beyond a typical romantic weepy.Starring newcomer Zhou Dongyu  mind you Zhang Yimou has this knack of bringing new faces to the scene  and Shawn Dou as the star crossed lovers Jing and Sun respectively the story tackles both the saccharine sweet moments that the duo have to steal away from society's prying eyes and that of objections that come from Jing's mother. It's a time when Chairman Mao is very much revered and the story takes aim at how his policies impacted the ordinary man on the street giving rise to complications on survival matters especially if you're deemed an intellect and are sent to be reeducated as with Jing's father held as a political prisoner and her teacher mom into becoming a school cleaner earning extra through the folding 1000 envelopes for a single cent.Constantly cautioned on her family's lack of status and being under the scrutiny of the powers that be hopes are pinned on Jing as the next generation to lift their family's plight since there are also two other younger siblings to take care of rather than to spend time in romantic affairs of the heart with Sun. But undeterred both parties forge on despite the rich and poor have and have not divide with Sun's more privileged background meant a lot more giving on materials on his end to ensure that his loved one makes it through what life has dished out to her under the current circumstances.The story also doesn't shy away from the airing of grouses which is probably quite unheard of and bordering on treason too at least for its time when such statements get made in hushed tones. While one can be quite gung ho about it as proclaiming one's love for another it's another ball game altogether when taking pot shots at an establishment. The secrecy of the lovers relationship provide ample moments for the usual tried and tested formula of stolen glances growing into more daring meets involving some frolicking into a river and moments of temptation when they're all but alone in a rented room.Having the lovers meet when Jing was sent to the countryside as part of curricular and Sun being attached to a geological project meant the film can bask in a lot of lush landscapes brought out by beautiful cinematography. The art direction was top notch to make this period piece believable and some of the best moments in the film occur when little things get detailed and time spent to showcase it such as the amount of propaganda posters pasted on walls as well as that of a rousing morale boosting song performed by the students with aplomb even if some of them do not quite actually harbour the same sentiments as what's being sung out loud.The fresh faced leads also breathed some life into what would be a typical narrative of a romantic weepy. Zhou Dongyu is excellent as the innocent and wideeyed girl who takes on a very firm stance against her mother's wishes putting a risk in jeopardizing her family's fate and that of her own future should she be found out. Shawn Dou plays his hunky character of the almost perfect man with that steely determination of wanting the best for his loved one yet being presented with a dilemma of a request made by an elder which I'm sure many guys out there would share in similar emotions if put in the same boat. At some angles he reminded me of a certain television actor in Singapore as well but blessed with better acting ability.In a way the story's quite sprawling and not everything from the novel can be filmed without sacrificing pace and this accounted for the very frequent use of intertitles to split the scenes into logical chapters. I would rank this as one of Zhang Yimou's more accessible films and certainly one that shows he's more than capable to tackle a rather straightforward tale no lacking in powerful emotions and melodrama. Recommended!".

The girl even dares not call the boy intimately which leads to the regret.On the whole it is a poetic and beautifully shot love story with a charismatic cast with different nuances of facial expression.

	schema:reviewBody "To many who have been director Zhang Yimou's loyal followers for decades this film must feel like home coming. While I enjoyed and appreciated his earlier films from Red Sorghum 1987 on I am no loyal follower and therefore said to hell with him when he degenerated to making trash after trash culminating in The curse of the golden flower 2006 in his vain and nave hope for Oscar fame. On the other hand I do welcome the return of Zhang in Under the hawthorn tree to pre5thgeneration directors' simplicity and honesty.While adapted from a true story what this movie shows us is certainly not something unique. More likely there would have been countless such stories consider the population of China in the postCulturalRevolution era of the 70s albeit perhaps with variations in details. Billed as the cleanest romance in history Hawthorn depicts how two zhiqings young cityborn intellectuals meet in a customary sent down temporary deployment by school and government to the village to learn from peasants. The romance that budded in the idyllic setting continues back in the city. One obstacle is the girl's rightist background which means that she must be particularly careful to avoid being expelled from school and subsequent teaching career on any smallest excuse. With this the young lovers can cope as they can afford to wait. But then not unlike in some of the contrived and formulaic Korean romances in the 80s terminal illness sets in. This is basically the simply plot.This movie stands out in its refreshingly simple narration with sequences preceded by quotations from the original book in a fashion similar to the silent movies. The quotations however give you the sense of actually reading the book. It is moving in the most natural way without any of the sappy tearjerking devises that swarm the Korean romances. Cinematography is almost mesmerising. Zhou Dongyu the 17year old girl who won the part over thousands of contestants is without question absolutely deserving  fresh intelligent and innocent both and unspoilt by professional training. Shawn Dou is also good but his character is less developed  pure perfection to the extent of being almost angelic.".

Maybe it's because I love Asian films especially Chinese because they have a certain sadness and drama into them. The description of the movie is a poor example of the greatness of emotion that the movie reaches for sure. The movie tells the story of an innocent young love that ends tragically. But the freshness of the two young people that are in love and happy blends beautifully with the restrictions of the society and the fear of a bad future. The optimism of the lovers leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling in the end when the movie concludes. I wasn't sure about the black text sequences that often pop up to provide a boost to the film but eventually they turn the movie into a novel and you don't even notice them any more. Nice performances from the actors full of emotion. So 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful and tragic love story with some distracting blemishes";
	schema:reviewBody "Zhang Yimou reportedly auditioned 10000 girls in search of untarnished innocent old school Chinese beauty when looking to cast the lead in this film.These young folks are looking worse and worse with each generation. Pretty girls obviously aren't marrying handsome guys these days. They're hooking up with this sugar daddy and that old lonely bachelor with money. No wonder the kids are lacking in the looks department.When you look at any picture of young Chinese women from the 60s and 70s period you'll almost always have an eager face that radiates innocent beauty looking back at you. This is now a thing of the past young folks rarely have that innocence about them any more.I read that before seeing this film and it put an awful lot of pressure on the young actress who passed the audition. She's cute but she's no Gong Li. She's hardly a Zhang Ziyi either but that may have more to do with the way the film is assembled than anything else.I'm a BIG fan of Zhang Yimou's common people films. I love his nostalgic looks at the past and his thinly veiled commentaries on the Cultural Revolution and cultural change in general in China. But Zhang seems to have tossed this one off before finishing a proper script. Title cards are used to fill in narrative gaps red flag and to allow for fadetoblack wistful shots of the girl biting her lower lip pouting and looking like the innocent beauty Zhang craves. I think the need for fadetoblack wistful shots of the girl biting her lower lip and pouting suggests he didn't find it.The film is adapted from a popular mainland novel which was based on a true story set during the Cultural Revolution. There's lots of good stuff and great attention to detail concerning the period and it satisfied my desire for that. There's a pretty standard love story complete with terminal disease tugs at your heart strings plopped on top of it all. And not just a love story but a Japanese styled pure love love story. That part is fine as well. A little Korean style melodrama mixed with some Japanese pure love stylings works for me most of the time. So why didn't I love this movie?Honestly the title cards bothered me. Not just because the girl bit her lip and pouted going into many of them which got on my nerves as well but because they gave the film an unfinished quality. It's difficult to remain completely faithful to a novel when adapting it for the big screen and just as voiceover narration can be used successfully to fill in narrative gaps or it can stick out like a sore thumb so go the title cards.Sun told Jing that he would be waiting for her upon her returnSticks out like a sore thumb.To be fair dancer and senior high school girl Zhou Dongyu from Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province with eyes that are clear like the mountain springs is pretty fetching as the young girl who is sent to reeducation camp and falls in love with an upwardly mobile land prospector. The film's theme of with whom and when one falls in love being up to the discretion of Communist Party leaders is far more tragic than the terminal disease. Shawn Dou Xiao is outrageously handsome and appealing as the young man who falls in love with her.Under the Hawthorne Tree is delicately shot and filled with wonderful period detail. My final waffling verdict is It's a beautiful and tragic love story with some distracting blemishes. If Zhang Yimou had spent as much time fleshing out a proper screenplay as he did finding a girl to play the lead character he might have produced another masterpiece. I recommend the film to those who like pure love stories.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly likable family film";
	schema:reviewBody "Oskar and Josefine released in Russia as Thorsen's Medallion is a surprisingly likable European familyfantasy film I randomly picked up in a videostore. Much later I found that it's a sort of sequel to a very popular and successful Danish TV series Jesus and Josefine but of course I've never heard of it before. In short words it's a Christian related story of a girl Josefine who with her friend Oskar come to the past and meet Jesus who at that time is just a young boy. Some reckless acts lead to ultimate changes in future and Josefine must try to fix everything before it will be too late.After a rather short introduction of the above mentioned past events we meet our heroes Oskar and Josefine at the railway station in Copenhagen. Now the friends are on vacations and they are going to countryside to spend summer at Oskar grandparents' farm. The place looked quite and beautiful until Josefine met Thorsen the old man who gave her time machine and whom she eventually has defeated in original TV series. This time he is full of remorse and persuaded Josefine to take another gift a magic medallion which can bring her through the time and back home but only for three times. Accidentally Oskar and Josefine come to the past and meet Oskar's ancestors who lived at the same farm 400 years ago. However one act of kindness from modern girl creates a chain of unexpected events that changed course of the past and even threatens Oskar's existence in this world. The game becomes too dangerous and now two children with a help of new friends have to find a way to resolve the problem and return home.I don't know if it sounds any promising or not but I really enjoyed Oskar and Josefine. The production quality is pretty good all over the film. It was filmed in different locations in Denmark and everything looks more or less plain and simple. Hovewer from the first minutes it's also easy to see that there is always something beyond that. With careful camera work and light even ordinary things and places become rather extraordinary and memorable. What is also important is that visuals are not overused they are just where it's necessary for the story and their quality is acceptable and convincing particularly for a low budget film. The same thing is about the plot where acceptable is definitely a key word. Of course with a close look it's not too hard to find some minor logical problems and sometimes the plot unrolls itself too smoothly and straightforward but I don't want to be harsh on it. What's even more I don't need it because good points easily outweigh all possible drawbacks. The journey of two likable characters is not just a shallow fantasy adventure it's a story of moral values loyalty friendship and courage against cruelty ignorance and superstitions. With two emotional and memorable performances of leading actors Pernille Kaae Hier and Mikkel Konyher Oskar and Josefine become an enjoyable 80 minutes film that is definitely a worthy choice for family audience all over the world. It's also nice to see that European filmmakers are ready to invest money into family filmmaking even sometimes without strong hopes for commercial success. I'm glad that this time they succeeded and the film become a solid hit in Denmark. Definitely a worthy effort. 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "When you are used to get great things and you expect them again the average won't satisfy you.This happened to me when I saw this Danish movie. As a person who adores movies from Northern Europe especially when it comes to children in movies regardless if it is a kid's movie or an adult drama with kids in important roles and finding Danish movies usually even better than their northern neighbors I expected too much.Oskar  Josefine is made after a TV serial as a sequel. Though it is more than obvious throughout the movie there is no problem to understand the plot because of the introduction sufficient to those who haven't seen the serial like me.The serial was a fairy tale for younger kids. The actors in the movie are a bit older and so are the characters they are a boy and girl who are in love and going on vacation together though they go to boy's grandparents and though it is Denmark we can assume that the authors aren't persuading us they are 12. But the plot is again a fantasy in a fairy tale style so the target audience appears to be rather unclear. Kids who watch the movie must have some knowledge of history and other subjects not easy for 9 or 10 years old who would maybe otherwise be interested in such a fairy tale but the knowledge of characters is also sometimes surprisingly weak. Just for example Josefine a girl old enough to go with her boyfriend on vacation and who has already saved Jesus and Christianity in serial doesn't know what antibiotics are.Movie for younger kids though a fairy tale can still be enjoyable for the whole family. Ronja Rvardotter maybe pushed the standards unreachably high but it's not the only good one. This one is watchable but nothing more.I have another problem with Oskar  Josefine. Teenager traveling through time in North European movie reminds me in a second on Sofies verden unbelievably intelligent movie for a bit older audience again the one very suitable for adults as well who succeeded on different levels so can be watched as an adventure from early years though preteens might be bored SF not for hardcore fans semidocumentary a lot of facts that can make adults repeat their history and philosophy lessons and a real art movie with references from Carroll's Alice to Fahrenheit 451. People who haven't seen Sophies verden are in advantage when watching Oskar  Josefine because they won't compare these two movies and the latter is weaker in any aspect you analyze.The choice of actors was not perfect either. Not only ageplot relation but their acting wasn't impressive as Danish and Scandinavian kids usually act. There is a strong hollywoodisation of Danish cinema in new millennium. But the work with young actors has never lost its quality that hasn't been achieved almost anywhere else. Pernille Kaae Hoier is no Sarah Juel Werner or Line Kruse  but this role would be perfect for Julie Zangenberg whose age would fit as well. Instead of Mikkel Konyher I would prefer to see Adam Gilbert Jespersen or Anastasios Soulis from Sweden but borders were never a problem in North Europe however as a couple Julia Krohn and Bernhard Naglestad from Norwegian movie Ikke naken would fit the best.On the other hand adult actors played just the way this movie needed. Average photography and music won't be remembered after the closing credits.So if you are not familiar with Danish movies don't start with this one. You might give up with further explorations what would be a great loss considering how great Danish cinematography is.".

	schema:headline " Terrific film for film collectors and film buffs";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the 1951 feature made by the British film industry to celebrate the festival of Britain. The film stars a virtual who's who of all the famous British cinema actors of that time and one of the fun things about this film is trying to identify all of them as they pop up in various cameo roles. The story is the biography of William Friese Greene who this film claims invented the motion picture camera and projector. Edison and Lumiere are casually acknowledged as also being motion picture pioneers but FrieseGreene is claimed to have had the first intermittent mechanism presumably the Maltese cross used in today's cinema projectors. It also claims that he invented the biocolour process where color motion pictures are produced by rotating two color filters in front of the camera and projector KinemaColour. The lead role is beautifully played by Robert Donat as the quiet intense inventor obsessed with producing moving photographs and his wife is competently played by Maria Schell. Also appearing in cameo roles are Michael Redgrave Richard Attenborough Peter Ustinov Stanley Holloway Michael Dennison the great Dennis Price the beautiful Glynnis Johns and her father Mervyn Johns the eccentric Joyce Grenfell the wonderful Margeret Rutherford and a host of others too long to mention. The most famous cameo is by Sir Laurence Olivier as the astonished policeman who witnesses FrieseGreene's first triumph the projection of moving images of Hyde Park on an improvised sheet screen. This is the most remembered scene of the film and Friese Greene's excitement at this event reminded me of my own excitement when I first turned the handle on my first Pathescope 9.5mm projector! The film is of great interest to film collectors and movie buffs containing beautiful shots of old wood and brass magic lanterns and early movie equipment. There are many wonderful scenes such as the Victorian photo studio where they show customers having to stand absolutely still for 30 seconds to get their photo taken! The film was produced by Roy Boulting and the beautiful Victorian settings and costumes are sumptuously photographed by Jack Cardiff. My family and friends really enjoyed this movie it is low key almost like a BBC period drama but if you are a film collector you will love it. We take the showing of films in our homes for granted these days and it easy to forget the real struggle by inventors such as Friese Greene to achieve what seemed impossible at the time. American audiences will of course have to at least temporarily suspend their belief that Edison was the sole inventor of the motion picture camera  in fact Edison was primarily a business man and entrepreneur who copied many of the motion picture concepts developed by Lumiere in France This film is very rare indeed. I don't think it exists on VHS or DVDcertainly not in the USA however Super 8mm film prints do exist so if you find an S8 print grab it! My particular super 8 print is a 2400 ft Agfa color print pin sharp with beautiful rich colors and great contrast. The mono magnetic track sound quality is very good for a film of 1951 vintage. Highly recommended if you can find it.".

The Magic Box is a fine tribute to someone generally forgotten if known at all to American audiences especially.Robert Donat brings his Mr. Chips character and weaves it into the character of William FrieseGreene. The story is told in flashback and in reverse order first by his second wife Margaret Johnston from their first meeting in 1897 through their marriages and then later by Donat himself as he remembers his first wife Maria Schell. But in both remembrances the thing that stands out is his driving obsession to capture movement on some medium. As Donat eloquently puts it 'movement is life'.It costs him dear he does not get the credit he feels due him it goes to that upstart Thomas Edison from the USA. Actually fellow Britishers George Alfred Smith and Charles Urban and Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumiere and Emile Reynaud all could claim pioneering contributions to the motion picture as well. FrieseGreene was a fine portrait photographer but spent all his money on his experiments even selling the patent he took out on his early motion picture camera.Donat Johnston and Schell are supported by a massive cast of the best British players doing small parts in tribute and belated recognition to the guy who now is considered if not THE inventor of motion pictures the founder of British cinema. From Laurence Olivier in the role of an astonished policeman who is the first to see Robert Donat's breakthrough to Bernard Miles as Donat's stuffy cousin who's worried about having the bite put on him to young John Howard Davies as the youngest of FrieseGreene's sons you'll recognize lots of familiar faces.Still the film belongs to Donat as the obsessed but touching Friese Greene who helped give the world a universal medium of entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "The Magic Box documents FrieseGreene's obsession to be the first to produce moving images using a continuous strip of photographic film. Robert Donat as FrieseGreene as usual gives a professional performance as we follow his endless trials  in two senses. Yet one short scene lifts the film above being just a parade of Britain's acting talents in a worthy centennial celebration of FG's life. Arguably the most illustrious actor of his generation Laurence Olivier has an apparently minor part as a London copper called in by an overexcited FrieseGreene to witness his first successful projection of a moving image. It is though through Olivier's star performance that we are able to share the extraordinary experience of being only the second person in the world to see moving pictures. They surely knew when casting that this was the star role.FrieseGreene is buried at the famous Highgate Cemetery East in North London. The obelisk with his name can be seen from the road about 100 yards down from the entrance. The inscription is simple William FrieseGreene Inventor of Cinematography. The premise of The Magic Box was exactly that yet sadly the man the film and the claim itself have in recent years received the most shabby treatment of all in the country which produced them. FrieseGreene's patent was for using perforated celluloid film moving at up to 10 frames per second  quite enough to give an impression of movement. That but using 16 frames per second became the industry standard for silent film.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Magic Box documents FrieseGreene's obsession to be the first to produce moving images using a continuous strip of photographic film. Robert Donat as FrieseGreene as usual gives a professional performance as we follow his endless trials  in two senses. Yet one short scene lifts the film above being just a parade of Britain's acting talents in a worthy centennial celebration of FG's life. Arguably the most illustrious actor of his generation Laurence Olivier has an apparently minor part as a London copper called in by an overexcited FrieseGreene to witness his first successful projection of a moving image. It is though through Olivier's star performance that we are able to share the extraordinary experience of being only the second person in the world to see moving pictures. They surely knew when casting that this was the star role.FrieseGreene is buried at the famous Highgate Cemetery East in North London. The obelisk with his name can be seen from the road about 100 yards down from the entrance. The inscription is simple William FrieseGreene Inventor of Cinematography. The premise of The Magic Box was exactly that yet sadly the man the film and the claim itself have in recent years received the most shabby treatment of all in the country which produced them. FrieseGreene's patent was for using perforated celluloid film moving at up to 10 frames per second  quite enough to give an impression of movement. That but using 16 frames per second became the industry standard for silent film.";

Whether he was the first to do so is largely insignificant the fact that he went largely unrecognized assumes far greater importance.Planned to celebrate the Festival of Britain in 1951 THE MAGIC BOX recognizes the achievements of someone who spent just about everything  time money and effort  on his work. Director Boulting alternates between scenes in Friese Greene's Robert Donat's laboratory with domestic sequences involving his wives Edith Margaret Johnston and Helena Maria Schell. Although a devoted husband FrieseGreene is so obsessed with his work that he neglects his family as shown in several sequences where he begins to talk excitedly about his discoveries while remaining oblivious to his wives' complaints.

Boulting is fond of using the quick closeup to register his emotions.As well as being a celebration of the inventor THE MAGIC BOX celebrates the British film industry by offering roles to virtually all the major stars and supporting actors working in the studios at that time. The film offers fans the pleasure of identifying people in the smallest roles and enjoying scenestealing cameos such as Margaret Ruthferford's irascible dowager telling Friese Greene's first employer Guttenberg Frederick Valk off Joyce Grenfell at her toothiest as a member of Edith's choral society Sidney James and William Hartnell as a pair of World War One army personnel and Laurence Olivier in his famous cameo as a London police officer marveling at FrieseGreene's invention.Thematically speaking Eric Ambler's script might be a familiar one but that does not prevent viewers from enjoying the film as a celebration of a longforgotten figure as well as British films as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "This biopic of inventor William FrieseGreene was based on Ray Allister's book FrieseGreene Closeup of an Inventor. Allister used the recollections of the inventor's family and friends for his biography. Such sources have oft proved unreliable and this is such a case. Brian Coe and other historians have since debunked some of the myths invented by FrieseGreene and perpetuated by his family friends and biographers. The mythical result here in this film is that FrieseGreene appears as the primary inventor of motion pictures and cinema.The climax of The Magic Box has FrieseGreene projecting his film taken at Hyde Park to a policeman. The filmwithinthefilm is not the actual photographs taken by FrieseGreene but the invention of the makers of The Magic Box. This first film appears in a condition that would rival the Lumire programs of some six years later the flickers and jitters are unrealistically light. Moreover it would be the first multishot film preceding by about eight years the earliest such films that I've seen or read of. The first part which takes place in the park with a man and his son approaching the camera is followed by the socalled scene of leisurely pedestrians opentopped buses and hansom cabs with trotting horses. In this last part however which doesn't exist today appears within The Magic Box as a scene of curious observers looking at the likewise observing camera.Allister however has reprinted six frames of the first part of the subjects. Others have surmised that this film was taken at about four or five frames per second. The film within The Magic Box however appears to have been photographed at least at 16 frames per second which is generally acknowledged as the minimum speed for the illusion of motion. Moreover the Hyde Park film probably wasn't seamlessly projected the film wasn't even perforated. Two frames each were also photographed at a time which explains why as you can see in The Magic Box FrieseGreene's camera features two lenses. This was because the film was a stereoscopy attempt that is FrieseGreene thought he might be able to produce threedimensional images by overlapping two simultaneously photographed frames. Allister has also reprinted four frames from another film by FrieseGreenea street scene taken in Chelsea. This film is perforated but still appears to have been photographed at probably no more than five frames per second.On a further historical note FrieseGreene is said to have given some public demonstrations of films although he doesn't seem to have been too successful with them. Later he gave public showings of Birt Acres's films which seems an indication of his own incomplete work on motion pictures. Additionally Greene's former business partner Arthur Collings did go on to become one of Britain's earliest filmmakers he was giving public performances of his films in late 1896.In short the movie industry demonstrated itself incapable of rendering even its own history accurately. This isn't necessarily a knock on the quality of The Magic Box though. I've come not to expect accurate history lessons from movies and sometimes not even from books. Interestingly and probably more accurately FrieseGreene's life is depicted throughout the rest of the film as an indebted and failed inventor who lost his family and it would seem part of his sanity. The flashback storytelling structure is accessible. The fictionalized climactic moment of success as a dramatic selfreflexive scene is quite moving. The film in general is absorbing and the production values are topnotch. FrieseGreene's camera other precinema trinkets and the originally slow process of taking photographs are well rendered. I also liked the fairground scene where they catch a glimpse of three Lumire films projected within a tent. Its history is inaccurate but The Magic Box is nevertheless an inspired look back at the beginnings of the art form.".

The story of film inventor FrieseGreene is told mainly from the viewpoint of his two successive wives starting with his later wife. The film starts off when FrieseGreene is already approaching the end of his life when he visits his wife who has separated him. From then on she begins to tell about the time she lived with him when he already had put his invention into practice. By now FrieseGreene was a bankrupt debtor who vainly tries to expand and innovate his cinematic ambitions and we see how he brings his family along with him in his downfall.The second part of the movie focuses on the start of his career as a photographer and his gradual success in creating the moving picture. This is the most intriguing part of the movie where we witness the birth of a new era. However it is regrettable that we already know what is going to come of our hero this way all that we observe somehow leaves us with a bitter aftertaste. And it detracts from the overall 'suspense'.I guess that the main reason for this awkward order of life events is the fact that the interlude between the death of his first wife and his meeting his second is left undone. And this is unforgivable because this is also the period FrieseGreene brought his new invention to public attention. The recurring attention at his failed recognition lies in this period also it would be nice to see how this totally new experience took place.What we are left with is a tolerable movie about a man who is blind with ambition and therefore also blind to the people who love him and the people who he is indebted to. The acting camera work and soundtrack are all fine. As said the major setback is the screenplay deplorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie stars Robert Donat as William Friese Greene who more or less invented the movie camera and thus made available those things being commented on at IMDb.com.It's received splendid reviews over the years and on this site as well and it's easy to understand why. The story has Friese Greene and his family suffering for his obsession with the camera. He sacrifices everything for it and his wife and friends chip into the pit. In the end he dies at a public meeting in 1921 while trying to speak to the audience about developing art preserving history and putting moneymaking on the back burner. The audience must examine his body to find out who he is because he's an old man long forgotten.For lagniappe we have brief appearances by just about every wellknown name in the British film industry at the time from Lawrence Olivier as a wary police constable to Muir Mathieson as a conductor.So I hate to say that I found the biography a familiar one. Man persists in his pursuit of the invention. Sells everything. Suffers multiple tragedies. Wife gets sick and dies. Friends desert him. But he carries on until his goal is achieved. A cinematic biography wouldn't be a cinematic biography without these formulaic elements. What would you prefer  a fiveminute movie in which a man is inspired by an idea goes down to the basement puts some device together sells franchises at an immense profit marries some suitable mate like Paris Hilton and settles down to happily raise five chubby children and a dozen thoroughbred horses? It's well acted and nicely directed by John Boulting but similar stories have been better told. The Warner Brothers' biopics of the 30s  starring people like Edward G. Robinson as Dr. Ehrlich  were equally well done if more crudely presented. Lust for Life was more gripping. If William Friese Greene was really like Robert Donat in temperament he was comparatively dull although mighty lucky to have a wife who looked like Maria Schell. She has a dazzling smile that when it appears seems to cause all the features of her face to light up at once.For what it's worth towards late middle age Friese Greene bemoans the fact that the contemporary encyclopedia entry doesn't even mention his name. Wikipedia does now. There were a number of people working on the idea around the same time and the human mind being what it is a single inventor is called for. Today that name is Edison. I wish Friese Green had won the gold medal because Edison was something of a rat. He patented everything he could get his hands on including the inventions of people working in his own laboratory not in pursuit of a dream but in order to make money. He fought it out with Westinghouse over who had the rights to the juice in the electric chair. The depths of Edison's avarice were plumbless.".

William FrieseGreene spent his life working on the motion picture camera and though he isn't the official inventor he is someone who contributed his work to what became the final product. His story is told by an allstar cast even in tiny roles in 1951's The Magic Box starring Robert Donat and Maria Schell.Greene held the first patent on a motion picture camera and financial problems by which he was beset his entire life caused him to sell his patent for 500 pounds. He also created a Biocolor system which won in a lawsuit against a system called Kinemacolor. This early color process was too expensive for commercial use however.From what I can gather Greene had good ideas that weren't very practical and the film is basically about how he went from a highly successful photographer to a bankrupt inventor and how his obsession with film and color controlled his life. Not mentioned is the fact that his son Claude FrieseGreene became a cinematographer and was very prolific in British films until his death in 1943. He continued to develop his father's color process and produced a series of travelogues in the 1920s using this system.Robert Donat is excellent but the film is not very interesting except to spot all of the huge British stars in minor roles such as Laurence Olivier as a bobby.Some people are fairly dismissive of FrieseGreene and his place in the creation of the moving picture is controversial. There's no question that today he is considered an early pioneer in moving pictures and in working with color. He was in touch with Edison regarding his work and just because the credit goes to the individual who makes a product commercial is no reason to ignore the work of others. If this film makes people aware that a credited inventor isn't always the only inventor so be it.".

The subject of the film is William FrieseGreene a man whose invention of a movingpicture format saw him contributing to the development of early cinema although he is very much a forgotten figure today. As such this film is surprisingly downbeat and plays out as a tragedy at times. It's very realistic harshly so in fact and details poverty oppression and the impact of turgid real life on one man's dreams.

	onyx:emotionText "THE MAGIC BOX is a 1951 biopic from the Boulting Brothers. The subject of the film is William FrieseGreene a man whose invention of a movingpicture format saw him contributing to the development of early cinema although he is very much a forgotten figure today. As such this film is surprisingly downbeat and plays out as a tragedy at times. It's very realistic harshly so in fact and details poverty oppression and the impact of turgid real life on one man's dreams. However a succession of endless cameos from about half of all the famous faces of the era keeps it watchable and Robert Donat  of THE 39 STEPS fame  delivers a winning performance as the protagonist.";

	schema:reviewBody "For the first time in my life I was recently married 23 and unemployed. My wife was working and I was home watching TV. A British movie came on The Magic Box which caught my interest immediately . The frustrating life of film innovator William Freese Greene Robert Donat. The real inventor of color motion pictures. Yes there will be debates that will go on for a time about who invented the motion picture projector and who put in the patents first. But the 100 percent perspiration and dedication of one man shines throughout this movie. Despite bouts with money and marriage problems our inventor chap continued to persevere in his quest for a beautiful finished product. Earlier I watched the original Good Bye Mister Chips starring Robert Donat in the lead. What paralleled these two pictures was the similarity of Robert Donat playing different ages throughout the picture. As in the film Mister Chips you see Donat as a young Freshman Professor at a boarding school and as the film wears on he ages well into his early eighties. In this movie Donat starts as an elderly man at a London conference and the film flashes back showing a younger spry apprentice photographer. Our movie starts with the fore mentioned conference with the older Greene speaking to fellow businessmen in the film industry. Greene's stands up frustrated as he wants to make his message about the innovations of filming but the crowd was saturated with money hungry businessmen interested in complacency. Silent black and white movies being the norm rather than technical advances stressed by Greene. The response from his peers was complacent at the very least. Greene sits himself down and ponders his past. Greene's story flashed back in time as a young studio portrait photographer for a man called Maurice Guttenberg Frederick Valk. Guttenberg and Greene have a falling out. Greene insists on shooting a picture his way. Greene and his new bride venture out on their own. Green opens his own photography business and slowly makes a solid customer base. With the money and the help of businessman he invests it all on developing a color film with quite a few failures along the way but persistence pays off as he finally develops a celluloid that could handle a movie projector. One night Greene sets up his makeshift projector. Greene is excited about a scene he filmed in Hyde Park earlier in the day. Greene is about to run the film but there's no audience. He calls down to the street where a Bobby is walking his beat.The Bobby is played by the exemplary Actor Sir Laurence Olivier. Greene tells the befuddled Officer to sit and watch the bed sheet on the wall. Greene runs the film to the amazement of the confused constable as he runs to the sheet and tries to grab the images. This movie has so many cameos of Iconic British cinema actors. Here are some familiars Leo Genn David Tomlinson Peter Ustinov and Michael Redgrave. I always like the acting of Robert Donat and his soft spoken approach. When this movie was released it was a box office flop but to me it was informative and poignant.".

If you think Evans too patrician for the part of an old woman living in a working class district of an industrial mostly derelict and rainsodden city she does point out that 'she married beneath her' and since she is hardly ever off the screen this is a real tourdeforce and she was nominated for the Oscar for it as well as winning a whole slew of other awards. There are also firstrate supporting performances from the wonderful Avis Bunnage and the always consistently reliable Gerald Sim and Eric Portman terrific as her errand husband. Unfortunately the film's subplots involving stolen money and some gangsters seems superfluous and gives the film a somewhat melodramatic air and its downbeat mood meant it was never a popular success and it is hardly ever revived. But seek it out all the same it is certainly worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dame Edith Evans one of the British theater's greatest actresses of the first half of the twentieth century gives a brilliant performance as a lonely old lady existing in seedy rented rooms in a grimy industrial town while scraping by on National Assistance.  This film should be shown to everyone on their first day of work before they fill out their tax deferred pension withholdings.  If ever there was a good lesson for putting something away for one's old age it is this film.  It is a horror story of This is what's going to happen to you if you don't start putting something aside for your old age.Mrs. Ross lives alone in poverty despite a family of sorts a workshy husband who deserted her and a son who only comes by to hide stolen loot while pretending to visit.  Her rooms are a disorderly clutter of books old newspapers glass bottles and anything she doesn't want to throw away. Her endless days are filled with visits to the local library reading room to keep warm the local mission church the police station to complain about the neighbors and the social security office to beg for more public assistance which is doled out a few shillings at a time.To escape this grim reality Mrs. Ross builds a fantasy world not unlike Luis in Kiss of the Spider Woman.  She exists in her fantasy of a privileged upbringing as the daughter of a Bishop living in a palace and watching the white gloved dancers at a ball.  She awaits the settling of her fantasy father's estate and the fortune from the family cattle business.  When she finds stolen money hidden by her shiftless son during a quick visit she believes that her ship has finally come home and her fantasies are reality. It is not long before the vulnerable old lady is befriended and robbed by a steely eyed con woman and dumped in an alley near her home. Although the welfare people do all they can to get her back on her feet and her husband to take care of her by the film's end she has come full circle and has resumed her daily routine and her fantasy world.Dame Edith who was the original St. Joan on stage in the 1920's and for whom Shaw wrote The Millionairess is rarely off the screen and gives a faultless performance in what could otherwise be a very depressing film about poverty and loneliness. Where at first you sympathise with the old lady who has come down in the world and is now living in genteel poverty you come to understand that she never went up in the first place the only genteel world she ever inhabited was in her mind and that is where she now resides.As for an acting tour de force just watching the way Dame Edith conveys the lowly origins of Mrs. Ross without words as in the way she eats   out of tins   lifting large slices of bread to her mouth where they fall apart rather than cutting the slice to small manageable portions licking her fingers reading at the table  all the things considered to be bad manners. The way she conveys old tired poverty by slipping off her shoes in the library to warm her feet on the hot pipes is a lesson in technique that all aspiring actors should take note of.  You know as you watch her slowly make her way down the cobbled streets carrying her large tote bag that this pathetic old lady is a prime target for a mugging or a slip and fall. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to study great acting and to those who are concerned with the plight of the elderly.".

	schema:reviewBody "This grim tale about the loneliness and vulnerability of old age set in what must be the most rundown section of Manchester manages to touch us in an unsentimental manner. Its chief quality is the crisply photographed slum in which it largely takes place like the last remains of the 19th century surviving into the postWar 20th. The protagonist Margaret Ross played by the stately Edith Evans lives in a cluttered ground floor flat in this urban wasteland of rainslicked cobblestone streets without cars or pedestrians but an abundance of crumbling brick walls gutted buildings and stray cats. The opening credit sequence of grey rooftops under rainy skies is particularly striking.At home she looks through newspapers eats bread with honey sips tea and listens to radio as her sink faucet drips drips drips. She constantly hears voices the whisperers of the title and turns up the radio to drown them out. When the upstairs neighbors an interracial couple with an infant pound on the floor in protest she pounds back on the ceiling with a broomstick and is showered with bits of plaster. We see the bald patch from where the plaster has fallen but the absence of other patches means that she has never before banged on the ceiling this strand of the story would have been more convincing if more of the ceiling was similarly defaced. When not talking to the imagined voices she spends her solitary life visiting the library where she surreptitiously warms her feet on the heating pipes collecting welfare from a local government office where she makes frequent references to her good breeding and highclass family connections listening to sermons at a local evangelical storefront chapel and tending to household chores which seem to consist mostly of emptying large quantities of dust coal ashes and bottles and cans from which she derives most of her nourishment.Evans brings dignity to the role but somehow she does not seem to be the right actress for the part. Margaret Ross is a woman of humble origins. Evans is a thoroughbred. True she does claim that she married beneath herself but that would be putting it mildly. Still she has the acting skills to keep us entertained and she gets brilliant support from the secondary players Eric Portman as her surly husband Avis Bunnage as a predatory welfare mom and Gerald Sim as a welfare clerk add a great deal to the overall presentation. Leonard Rossiter too shows up for a strong few minutes as a government official. And John Barry supplies a melancholy but unobtrusive musical score.Evans got an Oscar nomination for this performance. Fair enough. But I think Gerry Turpin should have also gotten one for his beautiful cinematography.".

In an Oscar nominated role Edith Evans also gives off a fine performance and there is some good work with extended dissolves to edit between different shots. It is not an easy film to like and admire in spite of its virtues though. There are excesses of melodrama thrown in such as cops and robbers and these subplots serve to distract from the protagonist. The lack of dialogue at times is distracting in itself too and there are also odd characters in small segments thrown in here and there that do nothing at all. The dual spoken narration is also rather awkward. Yes there are some things that can be complained about here  one could also complain that the nastiness is excessive. There is still a lot that makes this a good film however and these virtues definitely show through. It is an excellent film but it may not satisfy all tastes. Bryan Forbes is a great director and almost all his films are worth a look if one is interested in good directing regardless of the plot or characters.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps the finest performance by an elderly actress ever";
	schema:reviewBody "What a treat that this amazing classic has been released on DVD at last. It came out in 2010 as one of the initial trial batch of unjustly ignored old MGMowned titles it was a Lopert Production which have been released as MGM Limited Edition titles by the CreateSpace division of American Amazon not yet available in Britain despite being a British film. The other most important title issued at the same time is Sidney Lumet's THE GROUP. Every serious student of acting should order this film immediately in order to study the mindblowing performance of Dame Edith Evans as the lead character Margaret Ross aged 76. Edith Evans herself was the antithesis of this character but she throws her own personality overboard and drowns it dead as a dodo to transform herself as if by magic into this person. Rarely has a screen impersonation been so complete that one feels it goes down not just to the bone but to the marrow. To say that Edith Evans 18881976 could act the socks off all comers is an understatement one only has to admit simply that when it comes to mastery of her profession no one can touch her. She was a genius. It is astonishing that she did not receive an Oscar for this film although she was nominated for one but she did receive the 1968 BAFTA award for it as well as the Golden Globe in America the New York Film Critics Circle Award an award which was at its most prestigious in the 1960s and the Berlin Silver Bear Best Actress award. So at least she did not go unappreciated at the time though the film has tended to be forgotten since. The film was written and directed by Bryan Forbes and inevitably has his wife Nanette Newman in it in a small part. Forbes is not normally noted as one of the giants of the cinema but in this instance he really delivered. Only three years earlier he had drearily depressed everyone with a very boring film SANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON 1964 which was also shot by Gerry Turpin who was the cinematographer on this. Turpin's black and white lighting camera work is so spectacular in this film that it also should have won an Oscar. It is absolutely inspired. Various old timers deliver fine supporting performances in the film chiefly Eric Portman as Evans's callous drunken husband whom she has not seen for twenty years but also Gerald Sim as a welfare officer and Ronnie Fraser as Evans's ne'erdowell son and there is a hairraising performance as a wicked scheming woman by Avis Bunnage. The story and main character are pathetic in the extreme. The film is largely a poignant study of the extreme loneliness isolation and cruel victimisation of the elderly. Goodness knows where Forbes got this idea from but it seems deeply personal somehow. Did he have a greataunt like this one wonders. The film is far from cheerful. It is bleak and disturbing and tells the kind of story which is often called 'deeply human'. It is sad and also frankly heartbreaking because of the pathos aroused by Evans's portrayal of the woman. The film is set up north somewhere but evidently not very far north for Manchester is mentioned in the credits. It seems that the vast stretches of desolation the hundreds of acres of demolished terrace houses and the eerie emptiness of the strange place where Evans lives in a flat on the ground floor of a crumbling house must have been Manchester as it was being demolished in 1966 to make way for the new highrise buildings. What was once a depressing twodimensional world was transformed into an even more depressing threedimensional world in the sky but we do not see the future results of all the devastation in this film we merely see the flattened beginnings of it. It looks as if the whole city has been bombed by the Nazis but in this case the Nazis appear to have had large relentless treads and gone under the name of bulldozers. I suppose the desolation of the setting was meant to evoke the desolation of Evan's loneliness. So there is plenty to be depressed about if you are that way inclined. The story is a simple one in its way. Evans is an abandoned old lady who hears voices 'the whisperers' and talks to invisible presences. But at other times she has her dignity and speaks in what is known in England as 'a good voice' which ruffles the feathers of all the lower orders no end. It seems that she was the daughter of a bishop who married a chauffeur and came down in the world. As she puts it in a voice over 'I married beneath me'. We see some flashbacks of her as a child on the stairs watching the grownups at a grand party in the bishop's palace. Her pretensions of being a bishop's daughter are derided by a civil servant who claims she was just a cleaning woman in a bishop's palace once. But in that case how did she come by her infallibly upper class manners and accent which are not an affectation? What is so astonishing about Evans is the way she throws herself into every word and every mood as if she were a World Champion diver never missing a twirl of her personality as she plunges into the abyss of otherness. This really is something it really really is. Did I say too many really's? It's the real thing all right.".

We see her back at the free reading room warming her foot on the heater pipe. We see her back at the church service singing hymns. The last scene finds her making her tea and reading her paper. When did she start to collect papers and reading materials to study? Was it during her marriage or after? Remember how Archie got so upset when he came home after a day of looking for a job placing bets at the sporting office and there was no paper from the morning for him to study? She returned from hospital to find her flat spicnspan and then Archie comes home a new start? I think she felt it was. Notice how she kept up the house found order. It wasn't about happiness or love or even companionship. He hurt her and that wasn't forgotten but it could be lived with. It was about his physical presence. This was about some lifting of the loneliness and the lesser need for fantasy. The idea that there would be someone within the walls filled the space the voices used to take up. I wish my thoughts were more clear and I was better at explaining but I really want to see this movie again or should I say I want to watch the character of Margeret again.

	schema:reviewBody "The Whisperers is written and directed by Bryan Forbes  the excellent Sance On A Wet Afternoon. Adapted from Robert Nicolson's novel it's about an impoverished elderly woman Mrs. Maggie Ross Dame Edith Evans who lives alone after her goodfornothing husband and son Eric Portman  Ronald Fraser respectively have long since abandoned her. Living in a run down flat in the rough part of the neighbourhood Mrs. Ross relies on public assistance to make ends meet. She also hears voices The Whisperers of the title and indulges in a delusional fantasy world. A world that amazingly opens up when she discovers a significant amount of money hidden in one of her cupboards.Tho the novel is set in Glasgow Forbes sets the film adaptation in Manchester. Joining Dame Evans Academy Award nominated for Best ActressBAFTA winner Porter  Fraser in the cast are also Nanette Newman Avis Bunnage and Gerald Sim. What first should be made clear is that this is no fun fantastical movie the kind that the advertisement I read for it indicated it was going to be. This is a tough melodramatic picture that while it 's backed up my a top performance from Evans drifts along all too happy to wallow in its borderline misery whilst offering up a rather bleak message in the outcome. Serious things are glossed over by leaning too much towards the dubious point that the piece wants to make. While a crims and coppers subplot feels forced in for impact but actually hinders the purpose of the story. Having not read the novel myself I don't know who's to blame Nicolson or Forbes and his team? So although the film scores high for achieving a stifling sense of paranoia one that is akin to poor Mrs. Ross it none the less strangles us with intent to only then confuse its aims and deliver substandard melodramatics. 510".

A world that amazingly opens up when she discovers a significant amount of money hidden in one of her cupboards.Tho the novel is set in Glasgow Forbes sets the film adaptation in Manchester. Joining Dame Evans Academy Award nominated for Best ActressBAFTA winner Porter  Fraser in the cast are also Nanette Newman Avis Bunnage and Gerald Sim. What first should be made clear is that this is no fun fantastical movie the kind that the advertisement I read for it indicated it was going to be. This is a tough melodramatic picture that while it 's backed up my a top performance from Evans drifts along all too happy to wallow in its borderline misery whilst offering up a rather bleak message in the outcome. Serious things are glossed over by leaning too much towards the dubious point that the piece wants to make. While a crims and coppers subplot feels forced in for impact but actually hinders the purpose of the story. Having not read the novel myself I don't know who's to blame Nicolson or Forbes and his team? So although the film scores high for achieving a stifling sense of paranoia one that is akin to poor Mrs. Ross it none the less strangles us with intent to only then confuse its aims and deliver substandard melodramatics. 510";

They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation it cuts your wings it eats into your soul like a cancer.The spirit of what he said pervades this disturbing film. No doubt this work would have to resonate more in Britain but even 50years later unemployment abandonment of the elderly and welfare subsistence are fairly universal maladies of the Western World.The Whisperers is not a comfortable experience. A disturbed old woman Mrs Ross Edith Evans who lives alone is slowly losing her grip on reality she lives in impoverished circumstances and is dependent on welfare. When she accidentally comes into a little money she is preyed on like a wounded animal in the jungle. Even her son Charlie Ronald Fraser and her estranged husband Archie Eric Portman take advantage of her.This is more than a performance by Edith Evans when it's over you believe Mrs Ross existed.She lives in a society where ruthless opportunists abound. However the story is not devoid of decent people her young neighbour and especially the understanding Mr Conrad Gerald Sim at the welfare office redeem what would be a very jaundiced look at modern life.Bryan Forbes was a man of many talents actor writer and director but this film would have to be at the pinnacle of his achievements. The film boasts brilliant photography and real locations. You can almost smell the rising damp and cheap tobacco and feel the mud splattered on your shoes  not to mention the edge of the cutthroat razors in one disturbing scene powerful imagery in the impressive tradition of British 'kitchen sink dramas'.The film has a score by John Barry. Although I didn't see this film until 50 years after it was made I knew the theme far earlier from a Barry compilation album and always wanted to see the film it went with. This was before Barry settled into that languid style when many of his scores seemed interchangeable. During the 60's and 70's he was the one of the most experimental composers. He used a harpsichord here in a smallscale work which suited the poignancy and bleakness of the story.Although dramatised the film shows a slice of modern life but from a rather dispassionate pointofview and that makes it hit home all the more.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Whisperers is a quiet British film set in Manchester England which is northern and quite separate from the southern part of the country. In this film Dame Edith Evans plays Margaret or Maggie Ross a lonely elderly woman who has a son Charlie and an estranged husband Archie. The film opens as she spends her day going to the police complaining about the interracial couple upstairs or anything. She goes to the library to read the newspaper and places her feet by the heater for warmth. She also stops at the office for assistance where one person Conrad played wonderfully by underappreciated Gerald Sim looks upon her very well. Her son visits for only five minutes and leaves a secret stash of money behind which causes more problems than solves for her. Maggie is quite lonely but fiercely independent. She gets the money and believes it's hers from assistance. Not realizing it may have been her son's stolen money Charlie goes to prison but no mention of him after the money leads to meeting a woman who takes her to the bar and takes advantage of Maggie's vulnerability. Once she is passed out the wife's husband takes her and dumps her near her home. They have robbed her and left her to die in exposure. She survives and recovers and somehow the audience meets Archie who is bribed into taking Maggie home from the hospital and staying with her. Maggie kept all of his newspapers just as he ordered and read them in her spare room which was like a library. When she comes home to the flat the room is cleaned up. We learn that the newspapers symbolized her husband's presence in the household. After all she never bought the paper but read it at the library for free. So all the old papers were his is cleared up. You feel sorry for Maggie but there are so many of Maggies out there who just want a little companionship friendship and compassion without something in return. Dame Edith Evans surely proved her acting skills making us feel for Maggie Ross.".

She has a rich fantasy life where she imagines she is a bishop's daughter waiting for her father's inheritance. Her sleazy son Charlie comes by and hides some stolen loot in her apartment. She finds the money and is thunderstruck convinced that the money is indeed her long lost inheritance. Unfortunately she boasts about it to the wrong person and is robbed and left for dead. After a slow recovery Social Services manages to contact her husband Archie and reunite them. Her husband is grifter forced for once in his life to be responsible. She returns to her tidiedup flat. She's looked after but she's robbed of the paranoia and fantasies that she used to dignify her impoverished life. Archie steals money from her handbag and gaslights her into thinking she lost it. Archie doesn't stick around for long so in the end she's back to her usual solitary life of fantasizing and hoarding but it's more nourishing than her depressing life with Archie. And she does have a social safety net that is more than most older Americans have today. A kindly clerk at the welfare office Mr. Conrad Douglas Sim cares about her personally and is in a way the son she never had. As the other reviewers have pointed out the film is filled with melodramatic cops and robbers plot elements that detract from the engrossing story of this aging woman. Edith Evan's acting is extraordinary. Highly recommended.".

If you feel you are a good person DON'T see this film! It doesn't pretend to represent anything it just is. If you think humanity is worth saving SEE this film! Personally I pray for global warming. We're just no damn good. We muck up everything and then complain about it.";

Whether these are in her head or real sounds that inspire her imagination is almost irrelevant. The point is they prevent her from being utterly lonely. So I would say it's a great title for this story.As for Dame Evans herself well it is without a doubt a masterful performance. While watching it I kept thinking how different it was from her work in FITZWILLY. She seems to have the market cornered on eccentric old women but she doesn't turn these roles into predictable mush she elevates them beyond the stereotype carefully doling out equal measures of vulnerability and dignity.

I think it tried to be like Sex in the City. But it actually turned out much funnier and dirtier and far more entertaining. How all of these people can give it such a low rating is beyond me. There must be a lot of prudes out there. I give it a 9 only because I can't give it a 9.5.".

It's not a coincidence that the majority of critics who panned this movie are crotchety old men.I laughed out loud constantly the dialogue was pretty good  there were lots of quoteworthy scenes and the best part was that the girls seemed to have such a good time.  I had fun watching them goofing around.  The interaction between the female characters and the depth of their friendship was entirely realistic.  Women DO sit around being crass they DO sometimes use men for sex and leave them to eat dirt and have fun all the while.What endeared me forever was the scene where Christinia Applegate is dressed up as Vivian the hooker from 'Pretty Woman'  her send up of Julia Robert's horsey overlaugh TM fametracker.com was SPOT.

They were what I would imagine their real life counterparts would be like more so Cameron Diaz. I'm sure she didn't tap into her acting talent one bit to perform this role. She just showed up on set and somehow memorized her lines.I can imagine the executive in Hollywood who approved this script is some old horny fat repulsive swine with a huge cigar in his mouth and whiskey on his desk.

I'm sure he was incredibly disappointed to find neither of them actually got naked in the film which in a desperate sort of way would have been the only thing that could have even remotely made this film worth watching.I can't remember very many details from this film probably my subconscious protecting me from mental trauma but I do remember feeling all the more stupid for having watched this.Christina Appelgate's character meets Thomas Jane's character in a nightclub which instantly annoyed me. Who the hell goes to a nightclub to meet the man of their dreams? She becomes fond of him in the only way a superficial tramp can become fond of someone and decides to chase him down via a road trip to stop his imminent wedding and profess her crushlust whatever to him. Thomas Jane is cool though he starred in a movie called Thursday which is a great sleeper of a film. However having him in the film was like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound that just wasn't enough to fix it.You won't enjoy this unless you're a stupid self centered shallow ditsy yet sarcastic and fairly heartless bimbo.

To portray young professional women or any women in such a disgusting way is beyond comprehension but then after reading some of the reviews I can understand why film makers produce such trash. What did it for me was seeing Christina Applegate trying to use the urinal in one of the filthiest bathrooms I had ever seen. And everything that came before that was not much better. I have seen Knocked Up and The FortyYearOld Virgin and loved those movies in spite of the crude humor but The Sweetest Thing is nothing like that. All it did was make me cringe. Avoid at all cost.".

The plot is so stupid that it makes Harold  Kumar Go to White Castle look like a Shakespeare's work. The characters are as irritating as a mosquito bite on your butt. I'll erase so many scenes of this movie that in the end you wouldn't even have a videoclip. The first scene in the club is superannoying the one in the Chinese restaurant is gross and so are basically all the scenes with Selma Blair. Everything's terrible!!!

To appreciate this very realistic modest slice of New York life the film presents it helps to watch the features added to the DVD the film is released to the public for the first time interviews with the cast and with Diesel give a sensitive and heartwarming background that enhances the movie experience. Though Diesel studied acting and worked in theater in New York prior to this film it was not until he made his own film that he captured the attention of the people who make things happen. And now that Vin Diesel is a major Hollywood presence it is fascinating to see this initial opener.The plot is simple enough Rick Diesel is a minor drug dealer who also works as a bouncer with his buddy Tony F. Valentino Morales and hangs with Fred Joey Dedio and his 'brother' Mike Epps in his first role in film. The guys live mainly for easy sex and camaraderie  all of the have been raised by mothers without knowing their fathers thus are 'strays'. As Rick matures he grows tired of his shallow lifestyle misses the connection with his mother he never developed and is prime bait for a relationship. Into his life steps Heather Suzanne Lanza a wholesome Midwestern girl the two have a mutual attraction but as their courtship dance progresses Heather disapproves of Rick's at times ganglike behavior and his drug dealing. They come together in an extended park bench conversation excellent writing during which they realize they each have repairs to do on their previous lives before they can enter a serious relationship.One aspect of this little film that makes it a cut above the many others like it is the quality of natural acting Diesel draws from his cast uncredited female actors who provide the sex interest for the men are variably excellent and Morales Dedio and Lanza are particularly strong in their commitment to ensemble acting. The script is fairly strong though the barrage of expletives becomes tiresome after a while. Yet in the end Diesel establishes his skills as a serious actor and as a fine director and writer and for the chance to see one of Hollywood's major talents in his nascent stage this film is well worth watching.

And now that Vin Diesel is a major Hollywood presence it is fascinating to see this initial opener.The plot is simple enough Rick Diesel is a minor drug dealer who also works as a bouncer with his buddy Tony F. Valentino Morales and hangs with Fred Joey Dedio and his 'brother' Mike Epps in his first role in film. The guys live mainly for easy sex and camaraderie  all of the have been raised by mothers without knowing their fathers thus are 'strays'. As Rick matures he grows tired of his shallow lifestyle misses the connection with his mother he never developed and is prime bait for a relationship. Into his life steps Heather Suzanne Lanza a wholesome Midwestern girl the two have a mutual attraction but as their courtship dance progresses Heather disapproves of Rick's at times ganglike behavior and his drug dealing. They come together in an extended park bench conversation excellent writing during which they realize they each have repairs to do on their previous lives before they can enter a serious relationship.One aspect of this little film that makes it a cut above the many others like it is the quality of natural acting Diesel draws from his cast uncredited female actors who provide the sex interest for the men are variably excellent and Morales Dedio and Lanza are particularly strong in their commitment to ensemble acting. The script is fairly strong though the barrage of expletives becomes tiresome after a while. Yet in the end Diesel establishes his skills as a serious actor and as a fine director and writer and for the chance to see one of Hollywood's major talents in his nascent stage this film is well worth watching.

	schema:headline " Another great movie with unexpected depth that practically no one will see.";
	schema:reviewBody "Vin Diesel. He can write he can direct and he can act. The movie is a macho man version of a chick flick and he and a great supporting cast Joey Dedio in particular completely pull it off. Do yourself a favor and read the children's book The Story of Ferdinand before you see this movie. It will take all of 5 minutes. Rick the main character has a huge drawing of Ferdinand on the wall of his Bank St. apartment and the book has had a significant impact on his life besides the fact that an illustrated bull has been just about the only male role model he has ever had. If you don't know the story you won't see the rather obvious parallels between Ferdinand and Rick such as what you look like on the outside doesn't always translate into what you are like on the inside life is a matador and we all know what happens to the bull if he takes the bait and fights just because you are a bull doesn't mean you have to act like one and if you make the right choices and stay true to yourself you can survive and ultimately be happy. The dialogue between Rick and his posse rings so true that it comes across as unscripted. It's completely natural as is the acting. The cast genuinely makes you forget that you are watching a movie. Some of the uncensored conversations his friends have amongst themselves are downright hilarious and truthful at the same time. I was genuinely surprised to learn that some of the male cast members had not known each other before auditioning for this movie. The bond between them came across as genuine.Stereotypes abound but each and every one is someone most people can relate to knowing or having known. The acting is so good that you forget they are indeed acting and begin to wonder exactly how much of this was drawn from real experiences and conversations. Rick is hot broke streetsmart and sought after by women who think that getting him into their body will somehow get them into his heart in return. The only problem is that Rick has begun to mature and change and he is gradually becoming aware of the fact that his life has no real meaning. He has taken care of his body but not his spirit. He desperately wants to show who he really is on the inside and watching him take each uncertain step towards that goal is poignant.The blank looks that two of Rick's friend's Joey Dedio and Valentino Morales give him when he explodes after hearing them laugh over something truly reprehensible that one has done to his girl and the pivotal selfrealization that Rick experiences as a result of witnessing the callous and clueless responses of his friends is painful to watch as it should be. Rick while gradually introspective is clearly not fully prepared for the regrets and emotional upheaval that true selfexamination brings. Watching Rick make choices that go against everything he and his life so far have conditioned him into believing are all that matters combined with the realization that he truly is all on his own is touching without being sappy. The true extent of his vulnerability becomes apparent in a scene where one of his friends brings up a conversation he and his mother had about Rick. Rick's eyes and face express just how troubled he is over an unresolved situation with his own mother and it becomes clear to him how this has immobilized him in other areas of his life. He conveys all of this without speaking a single word. Watching Vin Diesel emote is something most people aren't used to but he does do it well. Witnessing Rick slowly but surely allow himself to become increasingly emotionally vulnerable and hopeful of the possibilities that may result from doing so even with an unsure outcome is moving. The movie's low budget works entirely in its favor as far as realism goes. Shot entirely on location everything from Rick's apartment with the bathroom in the hallway to the street scenes around the Bank11thHudsonBleeker area along with all the West Village locations is a real visual treat. It's Rick's life and not all prettied up Hollywood style. Rick is a smalltime drug dealer and he doesn't have an unrealistic seven grand a month Friends style apartment. Everything onscreen is authentic and real. I loved it.".

Although Vin Diesel is best known for portraying one dimensional meat heads and action heroes he has later shown that he got some more acting chops in such films like 'Find My Guilty' or 'Boiler Room' but 'Strays' was were it all started. Don't expect anything on Woody Allen level but here Vin showing off his acting skills and his directing skills is not very off. Although 'Strays' starts bit slow it manages to build up interest in first half an hour too long some might say but we are still left with an hour and ten minutes worth well paced story with characters we start to care about enough to stick to the end.Vin Diesel followed one other muscular Hollywood legend's path and wrote his own starring role. Vin's effort never reached far in popularity and it never become classic but with that little film he managed to create another example how one can build his own success.This film also left me guessing what kind of Vin Diesel the world would know if he would kept directing he obviously had some talent for that and writing rather than going on to play in all those silly triple X and Fast and Furious movies.".

Although Vin Diesel is best known for portraying one dimensional meat heads and action heroes he has later shown that he got some more acting chops in such films like 'Find My Guilty' or 'Boiler Room' but 'Strays' was were it all started. Don't expect anything on Woody Allen level but here Vin showing off his acting skills and his directing skills is not very off. Although 'Strays' starts bit slow it manages to build up interest in first half an hour too long some might say but we are still left with an hour and ten minutes worth well paced story with characters we start to care about enough to stick to the end.Vin Diesel followed one other muscular Hollywood legend's path and wrote his own starring role. Vin's effort never reached far in popularity and it never become classic but with that little film he managed to create another example how one can build his own success.This film also left me guessing what kind of Vin Diesel the world would know if he would kept directing he obviously had some talent for that and writing rather than going on to play in all those silly triple X and Fast and Furious movies.";

	schema:headline " Low budget early Diesel! 310";
	schema:reviewBody "Review Although the movie seems cheap and it doesn't really start off that well it does end up with a moral to the story and it's good to see Vin Diesel really act. We are all used to seeing Diesel play the tough guy in his big budget movies but in this film he shows that he has a heart and that bullets can't always bounce off of his body. All of the cast look like there on steroids except for Mike Epps and it has a deep undertone of a band of brothers who grow up doing everything together. Personally I hated the beginning but when the storyline kicks in its pretty average. If you keep in mind that this was made with a very low budget totally by Vin Diesel it is well put together but it's not a classic like earlier Scorsese movies which it did remind me of. Average!RoundUp After watching Riddick last week it's amazing to see how far Diesel has come. It's a shame that Diesel doesn't show his acting skills more in his movies because he actually can act. At this point we all know what to expect from his films. They all seem to be big budget action movies which shows that he has become type casted. Maybe he needs to go back to the drawing board to show that he doesn't have to show his muscles and kick ass in all of his films. As for the other cast you can tell that this is the first time that they have been in front of a camera but the chemistry between the cast seemed very real.I recommend this movie to people who want to see an early Vin Diesel trying to get out of the hood and falling in love. 310".

Such is the case with 'When Eagles Strike' a movie so horrendously awful that I struggled not to tear my eyes from their very sockets during the viewing.

If you plan on watching this movie I recommend it be with friends because if you don't have anyone to laugh with you'll probably end up crying and checking into a neurological center to correct your enfeebled cerebral cortex melted to a runny goo by the sheer stupidity of this movie. Yes it was funny because it was such a failure but I for one am not willing to trade my sanity for a few good laughs.

If that doesn't shy you away then keep reading. The rescue mission is headed by General Thurmond as played by Stacy Keach yes the father from 'Titus' who thought it would be funny to trick his son into thinking he had AIDs. Thurmond assumes command by radio from the base. This base is effectively the director's unfinished basement replete with camouflage netting tacked to the ceiling and a map of the world mounted on a wall. As is to be expected Thurmond is an imbecile and poorly acted. Maybe this is why Stacy Keach can only find work nowadays narrating anthropology and vulcanology documentaries. The commandos are no less inept than their commander. Their covert trek through the jungle reminded me of the nature hike in Heavyweights in which a number of fat disoriented children stumble around aimlessly through the woods and generally make as much noise as possible. Friend A often complained of the ridiculous whiffs presented in the movie people are knocked backwards by fists that never came within three feet of their faces. Friend B noted that the machine guns sounded like futuristic space lasers. Evidently some form of ape subbed for the foley artists during postproduction. There is even a stereotypical nerd commando much like Friend C who was unfortunately unable to come to the viewing who is obsessed with computers and nearly fudges the mission on several occasions because he is a coward. And I have a sneaking suspicion that the movie wasn't really filmed in a jungle ... are maples and oaks normally found in tropical environments? Looks more like the director's backyard without the hippies and squatters. Friend A apparently even noticed some footage ripped from other war films. For notes on the script and dialogue refer questions to Mrs. Howard's thirdgrade speech class. I just don't get it. The director Cirio H. Santiago has been making movies since the early sixties.

	schema:headline " something for everyone";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fastpaced sometimes slightly confusing but never boring semidocumentary style FBI drama about the hunt for a ring of Nazi spies in the US in the years leading up to World War Two. The nastiest Nazis are played by such villainous actors as George Sanders Martin Kosleck and Hans von Twardowski somewhat softer but still powerful characterizations are supplied by Frances Lederer as a misfit with dreams of grandeur and Paul Lukas as a cultivated and respected doctor who lectures at gatherings of the German American Bund. They are all scheming to steal military secrets for the use of the Third Reich in its ambitions to conquer America. Edward G. Robinson plays the FBI official who tracks them down. If you are familiar with later movies like House on 92nd Street Double Indemnity Hangmen Also Die They Drive By Night The Stranger and Man Hunt you will see that all of these actors were past masters of the types of roles they played therein. Based on a true story of a spy ring in the Yorkville section of Manhattan these frightening individuals are brought to compelling life under the nononsense direction of Anatole Litvak. Although the film can certainly be described as propagandistic particularly with the bombastic Walter Winchellesque narration who can argue that something sinister wasn't afoot in those days and that America wasn't directly threatened by a powerful and totalitarian rival? Sure America was not perfect either but it is easy to be roused by the spirit of independence and individual liberty that is evoked by the good guys trapping and defeating the bad guys. One of the best scenes is the interrogation of Frances Lederer by the seasoned FBI agent Robinson who cleverly yet forcefully appeals to Lederer's vanity to coax him into confessing and naming names. Paul Lukas is also gripping as the suave and confident doctor who by degrees crumbles in defeat after first being cornered by the FBI and then set upon by the Gestapo.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a fastpaced sometimes slightly confusing but never boring semidocumentary style FBI drama about the hunt for a ring of Nazi spies in the US in the years leading up to World War Two. The nastiest Nazis are played by such villainous actors as George Sanders Martin Kosleck and Hans von Twardowski somewhat softer but still powerful characterizations are supplied by Frances Lederer as a misfit with dreams of grandeur and Paul Lukas as a cultivated and respected doctor who lectures at gatherings of the German American Bund. They are all scheming to steal military secrets for the use of the Third Reich in its ambitions to conquer America. Edward G. Robinson plays the FBI official who tracks them down. If you are familiar with later movies like House on 92nd Street Double Indemnity Hangmen Also Die They Drive By Night The Stranger and Man Hunt you will see that all of these actors were past masters of the types of roles they played therein. Based on a true story of a spy ring in the Yorkville section of Manhattan these frightening individuals are brought to compelling life under the nononsense direction of Anatole Litvak. Although the film can certainly be described as propagandistic particularly with the bombastic Walter Winchellesque narration who can argue that something sinister wasn't afoot in those days and that America wasn't directly threatened by a powerful and totalitarian rival? Sure America was not perfect either but it is easy to be roused by the spirit of independence and individual liberty that is evoked by the good guys trapping and defeating the bad guys. One of the best scenes is the interrogation of Frances Lederer by the seasoned FBI agent Robinson who cleverly yet forcefully appeals to Lederer's vanity to coax him into confessing and naming names. Paul Lukas is also gripping as the suave and confident doctor who by degrees crumbles in defeat after first being cornered by the FBI and then set upon by the Gestapo. Unfortunately the fate of some of the spies is not resolved at the end and the narrative just seems to drop them in favor of a blitzkrieg of wartime propaganda much of it added after the film's initial release to update it for 1940 audiences.

Since the United States was officially neutral at the time it is surprising that this film received such a wide distribution. One must remember however that FDR early on recognized the threat to world security including the danger to our interests from Der Fuher. He was in the process of asking Congress for the approval of Lend Lease and worked closely with Winston Churchill following the fiasco of the Munich appeasement which ousted the incompetent Neville Chamberlain.The movie turns out to be somewhat of a mixed bag. There are really three main elements composing the film. From time to time there is a documentarystyle narration by John Deering of actual events taking place in Europe such as the Anschluss second there is the main story which is well written directed and acted concerning a spy network in the United States attempting to lure the minds of German Americans into the Nazi trap with help from the Gestapo Hitler's private police force of bullying goons third is the preachy part filled with patriotic talk some noble some propaganda some prophetic. The best element is the actual story with standout performances by Edward G. Robinson who doesn't appear until the movie is almost half over George Sanders playing a Nazi Stooge who is a go between for agents in Germany and their counterparts in the United States Paul Lukas playing a medical doctor who mixes medical facts with Nazi myth and who gives stirring speeches for the Party to get recruits and to hold his own ring of spies together Francis Lederer as a Nazi agent who places fame and fortune above all else including the master race and Dorothy Tree playing Hilda a true believer until she breaks under pressure from FBI agent Ed Renard Edward G. Robinson.Whether you like this film depends a lot on how much you like espionage flicks dealing with World War II. As a spy movie from 1939 Confessions of a Nazi Spy holds up well. It comes across not as a relic from a bygone era but as an exciting movie thriller based on historical events.".

	schema:reviewBody "Confessions of a Nazi Spy is an excellent film about real events. It's based on a true story and uncovered facts at a time when the whole world was on the verge of war. As such it's also an outstanding piece of propaganda  indeed a classic example of the beneficial use of propaganda. More on that later.Some of the reviews I've read give the impression that propaganda is all bad. Some imply that it's false or deceptive. Some don't like the fact that propaganda is or can be manipulative. But there are differences between propaganda and how it's used and between it and outright lies and deception. World War II was a time rife with propaganda and with outright lies and deception. But before looking at how it applies to this film it would help to have a better overall understanding of propaganda.Propaganda is everywhere around us. It's in the ads we watch listen to and read in the media. It's in the news media itself. It's in our history books and school courses at all levels. It's in the government programs created by Congress. It's in the political rhetoric of our elected officials. Indeed it's a proof of freedom of speech and of the press. The propaganda this refers to is the category of facts ideas and information that is used widely to explain promote or encourage support for programs positions efforts projects and products. In this vein propaganda helps inform the public about something. It may help a person make up his or her mind to support or oppose a policy or proposal. It may help a shopper decide which products or brands to buy. It helps people understand how a government program works. That's what most propaganda is and does. But there is another aspect of some propaganda and that has to do with spreading rumor or making allegations about some one or thing. This is a malicious use of propaganda and it fits in the realm of slander. It's used to attack belittle or discredit some one or something in the eyes of the public. It's always negative. Curiously no definition of propaganda states that it is ever outright deception and lies. So there is a clear distinction between propaganda which is not wrong or bad in itself and lies or deception which are wrong.Now back to this film. It's based on a true story and events. It covers a great deal of information about the GermanAmerican Bund that many  indeed most Americans then probably did not know. It exposed the real malicious and oppressive designs and intentions of the Nazis. This was at a time when many Americans were pacifists and didn't want to see a repeat of WWI. And this film showed very well the deliberate Nazi plan to use the natural healthy pacifism as a means to keep America divided and out of the war. For the first time many Americans found out what the Nazi party was really up to and how it was a threat to our own country. Confessions shows that the Nazis used outright lies and deception to cover up the truth of their operations. That was not propaganda but misinformation. Toward the end we saw that they planned to use rumor allegation and slander in propaganda. This movie doesn't include several of the sabotages that Nazi agents carried out in some eastern U.S. cities. And we learn in the film that before that time the U.S. did not have a counterintelligence agency to deal with such insurgency.Who could argue that the conclusions of the film and the resulting security measures and efforts were not right? The government and all Americans learned about the dangers of loose lips  that can sink ships. So as a propaganda piece this film alerted the public to be cautious and wary. Confessions is indeed an historical film. It was the first real intelligent factbased movie that warned about the designs of the Nazis. And its value and importance became clear right away when organized Nazi efforts tried to stop the film's release with demonstrations in some eastern cities.".

He has some great lines particularly when cutting down the bad guys. It's interesting to see him on the right side of the law for once and equally interesting to see Paul Lukas best known for playing the antiNazi hero of Watch on the Rhine playing a German sympathizer.An almostunrecognizable George Sanders steals the show doesn't he always? as a hardcore Nazi soldier.The movie is heavyhanded propaganda which becomes almost comical with its overdramatic narration and failure to recognize the irony in its supposed hate of propaganda. The narrator does offer up the movie's most hilarious line describing how the Germans manufacture mass stupidity.".

	onyx:emotionText "Not a bad film particularly in its historical importance. Reportedly the Warner brothers and Edward G. Robinson all fought to make this film which was made at a time when Americans remembering the devastation of WWI were still wary about entering another European conflict.Structured a little strangely  we don't get enough of our favorite character Robinson's who is a prototype of the thirties GMan. He has some great lines particularly when cutting down the bad guys. It's interesting to see him on the right side of the law for once and equally interesting to see Paul Lukas best known for playing the antiNazi hero of Watch on the Rhine playing a German sympathizer.An almostunrecognizable George Sanders steals the show doesn't he always? as a hardcore Nazi soldier.The movie is heavyhanded propaganda which becomes almost comical with its overdramatic narration and failure to recognize the irony in its supposed hate of propaganda. The narrator does offer up the movie's most hilarious line describing how the Germans manufacture mass stupidity.";

Released in 1939 it was one of the earliest movies with a distinct antiNazi theme. There is no subtlety here. The film's theme is that there is a vast network of Nazi spies and sympathizers at work to subvert America. The film ignores the the likelihood that there were  more and better organized communists running around then Nazi supporters. But the purpose was political convince Americans that there was a eminent Nazi threat. I suspect in this the Warner Brothers succeeded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a series of articles then a book Nazi Spies in America by exF.B.I agent Leo Turrou who lost his job for writing this is an interesting period piece. The dialogue has its clunky moments especially when characters pause to speechify. But that was probably necessary as part of the propaganda of the time when it was important to wake up America to the dangers of Nazism before Pearl Harbor. It was a time when too many voices were saying Hitler's was a European war and that America should keep out of it and proNazis like Charles Lindberg and the radio priest Father Charles Coughlin drew large audiences. Although there certainly were Nazi spies in the U.S. resulting in numerous convictions at the same time it's worth noting that the direct threat to America was exaggerated in the film. In 19391940 Hitler was focused on continental Europe first then Britain and had spent little time thinking about America. But the existence of Nazi spies certainly justified setting off alarm bells across the country and an effort to determine just how serious the threat was. Again the film's value is largely as a period piece.I do fault the script for portraying the spies as confessing and switching sides much too easily. Those moments struck me as highly unrealistic.The website of the FBI describes the spy cases on which the articles book and film were based. The case of Guenther Rumrich who attempted to obtain 50 blank passports by posing as the Secretary of State is described at http1.usa.govSbtCWj although the FBI describe him as crafty while in the film he appears as a fool. The FBI also admits its failure in the case reporting that four times as many spies had escaped including the biggest fishes. Leon Turrou the exagent who wrote the book on which Confessions of a Nazi Spy was based fares very badly in the FBI account. Another case related to the movies was the Duquesne Spy Ring involving 33 spies described by the FBI at http1.usa.govTcR74V.".

I have to admit there were times the story got pretty chilling for me the way it portrayed Nazi infiltration into American daily life look so easy to do. The blind obedience to Adolph Hitler professed by Dr. Karl Kassel Paul Lukas in his speeches to local bund gatherings is somewhat hard to imagine today but then again I've seen era footage of a Hitler rally in Madison Square Garden so I have to believe this wouldn't have been impossible.What I thought was pretty cool was the way Agent Renard Robinson got Kurt Schneider Francis Lederer to crack playing to his vanity and sense of self importance. No doubt the job was made easier by Schneider's inability to make his spy activities pay off in a big way with his German contact Schlager George Sanders. It's also noteworthy to mention how Germans in the film reacted in horror to the mere mention of the word 'Gestapo' every time it was uttered it brought on a near panic attack.I'm really curious how this film was received back when first released. Gallup polls taken in 1936 showed that only one in twenty Americans were in favor of America getting involved in another war but it took only two more years of Hitler's aggression to convince Americans that strengthening our Armed Forces for a conflict would be in our best interest. In perhaps the best line of dialog that would preview America's eventual entry into World War II Attorney Kellogg Henry O'Neill states his considered view to Agent Renard that When our basic liberties are threatened we wake up.".

Robinson plays an FBI agent who catches one GermanAmerican Frances Lederer acting as a spy and uses him to try and nab bigger Nazi fish.Fascinating from a historical perspective but also gripping entertainment. It was based on a real case which might explain why it has this realistic feel to it that you don't often see in pictures of the time. For example they don't even catch all the bad guys in the end. I'm surprised the Code allowed that as it usually called for all evildoers to be punished. The newsreelstyle narration is also a nice touch. The cast is good with mostly solid performances from everyone. Frances Lederer is hammy but he grows on you after awhile. Paul Lukas and George Sanders play Nazis. Sanders is good and Lukas is fantastic in the film's meatiest role. Robinson is also great in an understated performance. Given that this is WB we're dealing with there's of course a wonderful supporting cast featuring the likes of Joe Sawyer Dorothy Tree and many German actors some of whom used fake names to protect their families back in Germany.You guys are worse than gangsters shouts one man when he's thrown out of a German American Bund meeting for expressing a dissenting opinion. There's some humor in that I suppose since WB was the pioneer of the gangster movie. But they would also make some of the best antNazi war films during WW2. In many ways this could be seen as their first step in that direction.".

In the case of Francis Lederer's Kurt Schneider he thinks he is too important and too smart to be bogged down in the every day routine of making a living although it is ironic that accumulating capital seems to be his central goal.It's true that this film goes over the top at times but it is still a fine example of filmmaking in that golden year of Hollywood 1939.

The film has a definite feeling of being a documentary and that is vital to the film's success. Various suspects with alleged links to the Third Reich movement are having their movements monitored by the F.B.I. The Bureau have dossiers on people who plan to liaison with confirmed Nazis once the latter people reach the United States so that they can spread their reign of terror. Edward G. Robinson doesn't come into the film until half way but his role is very important. He plays an agent for the Bureau and who is building a case for the prosecution of the different suspects. The film has a gripping narrative especially during the scenes that show the underground meetings of the Nazis. This isn't the sort of film that entertains as such but it is very informative and the film gives a clear indication of the way the world was looking and would look for the next several years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Anatole Litvak this straightforward antiNazi propaganda film was based on real events involving a New York spy ring and four of its members that were convicted of spying on behalf of the German government. After about 45 minutes of setup and character establishment Edward G. Robinson is introduced as the FBI agent who ends up unraveling the ring. Francis Lederer George Sanders Paul Lukas and Sig Ruman among others play various Nazis whereas Henry O'Neill plays the U.S. Attorney who prosecutes the four accused.The film's historical value lies in its telling of actual events which occurred in the same time period the growth of Nazism in Europe its relating the obviously flawed Nazi philosophies and methods and in its alerting the American audiences at that time of the very real dangers which existed within the United States e.g. loose lips sink ships.The story begins at a meeting being held in a room which adjoins a German restaurant in New York. Dr. Kassel Lukas a committed Nazi party member is telling his fellow German Americans in attendance that their loyalty should be to their fatherland. That their fuhrer Adolf Hitler has declared war against all democracies and that it is their duty to carry out his wishes. Ward Bond uncredited appears as an American Legionnaire in attendance who objects to the rhetoric and is promptly thrown out. Kurt Schneider Lederer an out of work language teacher is so caught up in proceedings that he writes letters to Germany hoping Nazi party leadership will consider using him as a spy.Franz Schlager Sanders accompanied by an assistant Hilda Kleinhauer Dorothy Tree who regularly cross the Atlantic on the Bismarck visit Schneider to see if he's gotten the information he'd been ordered to obtain by those in Germany. By using his daring and his livein friend Werner Renz Joe Sawyer Schneider had he's given 50month for his troubles and eventually is assigned more difficult tasks. Frustrated by not being given more responsibility and pay for his wife Grace Stafford is pregnant Schneider writes a letter to the liaison Eily Malyon in Scotland which when its intercepted by British Military Intelligence James Stephenson begins the spy ring's downfall.FBI agent Ed Renard Robinson quickly realizes the significance of what the letter means and the amateur nature of its author. John Hamilton appears uncredited as an FBI chief. He is also able to all to easily capture Schneider when he's daring enough to try to obtain 15 blank passports for Schlager. Using Schneider's vanity against him Renard's questions lead him to Hilda and then Kassel who's affair with another woman Lya Lys contributes to his undoing. Renard's simple techniques for obtaining confirmation of his suspicions and the Germans willingness to confess their deeds make the story rather incredible.Schneider's wife Hedwiga Reicher inadvertently leads him into the Gestapo's hands and Krogman Ruman gaffes by admitting to Renard that the suspects are operating on orders from the German government. In any event some of the guilty parties the characters played by Lederer Tree Sawyer and Hans Heinrich von Twardowski's Max Helldorf character are successfully prosecuted whereas Kassel and draftsman Westphal Wolfgang Zilzer are returned via the Bismarck to face penalties in their own country at the hands of the Gestapo Lionel Royce and Henry Victor. Another German American Greutzwald Willy Kaufman had been dealt with earlier for disagreeing with Kassel's speeches.Selmer Jackson John Ridgely Regis Toomey and Charles Trowbridge are all recognizable in small uncredited parts.".

The common link between the three sequences is a network of Nazi espionage and subversion centred on Franz Schlager an officer on a German passenger liner the SS Bismarck which makes regular trips to New York. On the voyage from Germany the Bismarck brings Nazi propaganda material for distribution by Kassel's organisation and on the homeward run she takes US military plans and other classified information obtained by Schlager's agents. Schlager is also the ship's political leader. As such he is able to lord it over everyone even the captain and he warns the crew that they will not escape the protecting eye' of their government even when they are on American soil  a veiled reference to the Gestapo whose agents are seen keeping tabs on Germans in America. One of Schlager's recruits is a man called Kurt Schneider who fancies himself as a spy. Initially Schneider has some success partly because American security is wide open. He recruits a former army colleague the simpleminded Werner who is now a private in Army Air Corps. But he comes undone when he goes over Schlager's head and writes via Mary McLaughlin to Berlin proposing the kidnapping of an American colonel. Tipped off by the postman who has become suspicious of McLaughlin's frequent letters from abroad British Military Intelligence arrests McLaughlin and tips off the FBI about Schneider. FBI agent Edward Renard who has so far specialised in combating gangsters now turns to counterespionage and makes a clean sweep of the spy ring including Kassel. When Kassel is released on bail he gets a taste of his own medicine he is kidnapped by the Gestapo and sent back to Germany as others have been before him. As the remaining spies are convicted spinning newspaper headlines report how the fifth column' proNazi Germans have used subversion and sabotage to pave the way for Hitler's conquest of Western Europe. Following the trial a conversation between Renard and the attorney who prosecuted the case serves as a warning to Americans not to take their liberty or their security for granted.".

Watching this film today the subject matter is rather heavily handled and preachy. I'd go even further to say that the director and screenwriter are constantly beating their subjected over the head of the viewer but one has to remember that the Nazi movements in America were pretty much kept quiet back in the day and this film bravely threw them under the bus a few times. One has to applaud the film for trying what it did in 1939 and I'm sure the movie opened the eyes of many people even though I've heard it wasn't a hit for the studio. The story told here is a pretty good one that will certainly grab your attention and keep you going throughout the film. The documentarystyle telling doesn't work overly well but that doesn't matter too much. Robinson turns in a good quiet performance as the main FBI guy. He doesn't shout or get too worked up which is something I haven't seen from him in his earlier films. I really enjoyed how Robinson played the character and it really paid off in the end. Francis Lederer George Sanders Paul Lukas Henry O'Neill and Joe Sawyer add nice supporting performances.".

He being drafted is despite he not having organized baseball experience at any level. He is nicknamed Deuce by his fellow players as the two finger signal is the catcher's sign to throw a curve ball Coop's favorite and most killer pitch. But in the early going Coop demonstrates that he chokes under pressure as throwing his famous curve ball usually results in an outofthepark home run. Kirby the son of the team owner purchases a chimpanzee as the team mascot who the team members name Ed Sullivan. The coach Chubb decides that Ed will room with Coop a move not without ulterior motives. Ed ends up being an overgrown kid in mentality which makes him a pain for Coop to manage leading to one misadventure after another for the pair. Ed not only is a fan of baseball but has a rocket arm of his own. As such Chubb also decides to use Ed as a player at third base a ...";

	schema:headline " The 3Banana Scale";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite persistent talk of Hollywood's Golden Age of Cinema moviemaking did not truly reach its zenith until 1996. The movie was Ed not to be confused with the Whoopie Goldberg abortion of celluloid Eddie that premiered during that same year. In Ed awardwinning documentary filmmaker Bill Couturie employs the technique of cinema verite that lets the camera capture a true slice of sporting Americana... a monkey playing minor league baseball. Ed is not merely as Brad Laidman of filmthreat.com raved a movie some would say that kids may like but rather the examination of the symbiotic relationship between man and monkey. Despite their outward appearances can a clear distinction really be made between the monkey Ed and his human counterpart Matt LeBlanc? In the film excel at baseball although the monkey is the star both delight in flatulence and both have giant cartoon teeth. And wonderfully when the film reaches it's glorious climax it is the monkey that most clearly embodies our notions of humanity imbibing LeBlanc with the confidence to again throw his curveball the pitch that eventually paves his way into the Big Leagues this is despite LeBlanc's supposed ability to throw a 125 mph fastball. Although there may be some factual inaccuracies in the film in a conversation with LeBlanc a teammate tells him that Carlton Fisk was a flop in Boston but went on to find greatness in Chicago the true essence of Ed is in it's spirit... and in the fact that it has a monkey as it's star. Watching this film for the first time I realized that I was examining the very embodiment of greatness. This being the case Ed became the basis on which I would judge all future films. Forget Siskel and Ebert especially Siskel with their thumbs... forget Leonard Maltin with his stars... and forget A.O. Scott with his homosexual liberal bias. The only scale worthy of film review is the Banana Scale. Based on 3 bananas because really who needs five? this scale cuts through all the other ridiculous criteria such as plot character development acting and direction commonly used by other critics in their evaluations and judges movies based on three essential elements. These elements are1. Does the movie contain a character from Friends? 2. Does the movie contain a monkey? 3. Is the movie about baseball? As you probably realize there is only one film in history that contains all these elements and therefore it is the greatest movie ever made. Citizen Kane by comparison the film often mislabeled as the greatest contains none of the essential elements of greatness. Therefore it is hardly worth mentioning. But a movie such as M.V.P. Most Valuable Primate centers it's story around a chimpanzee that plays for a youth hockey team. This is one of those interesting films that strives for greatness but lacks certain characteristics that would've put it over the top. One may ask what director Robert Vince was thinking when he cast Rick Ducommun in the role of Coach Marlow when he could certainly have had David Schwimmer. And instead of hockey why not youth baseball? But decisions such as these have presented film buffs with interesting fodder for years wondering what could have been if say O.J. Simpson had in fact played the title role in The Terminator or if instead of Leonardo DiCaprio director James Cameron had cast Dustin Diamond as he originally planned? But judging on it's finished product MVP receives 1 12 bananas... one for containing a monkey and 12 for being about a sport other than baseball. Not bad judging against the current deplorable standards of Hollywood. Based on it's greatness it comes as a surprise to most that an Ed sequel has never been attempted. I have always assumed that the movie has become a victim of it's own greatness. Much like Roberto Clemente who walked away during the apex of his career knowing that he had reached a level of greatness that would doom his future endeavors to failure in the public eye by comparison Ed director Bill Couturie knows that another installment would be severely overshadowed by it's predecessor. But taking matters into my own hands I penned a letter to Mr. Couturie outlining my ideas for a suitable sequel. The idea goes like this Both LeBlanc's character and Ed the monkey are playing in the major leagues... one for a team in the National league the other for a team in the American. By coincidence the two teams meet in the World Series. Although LeBlanc is now recognized as one of the greatest pitchers of all time he is no match for the hitting prowess of Ed the monkey. And when they square of manoemonkeyo Ed the monkey is forced to make a decision whether to allow his friend LeBlanc to strike him out or propel his team to victory by hitting a homerun which he can do at will. I argue that this will be the first film that allows it's viewers to really get inside the mind of the monkey... to see his thought process to witness what makes the monkey tick. By the time the last pitch is thrown there won't be a dry eye in the house... and those tears will be both tears of laughter and tears of empathy... a rare combination. Although I haven't heard back from Couturie as of yet I expect a response before too long. Ideas like this don't come around everyday. If not Couturie I imagine a Hollywood heavyweight director will jump on board. From what I understand Kubrick was considering optioning my treatment before his untimely passing. Although the idea was intriguing I thought that perhaps Kubrick would understate the levity in a project such as this... opting for lingering shots subtle dialog and a brooding score by Beethoven instead of the sped up action scenes screaming monkey dialog and circus music score that I believe the film Ed II Monkey in the Majors calls for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Cooper is a pitcher on a minor league baseball team hoping for a crack at the majors.  Sadly his pitching so perfect in practice is way off in the games.  Things get worse for him when the team drafts in a new mascot  a monkey Ed and Cooper is selected to room with him.  However Ed turns out to much more valuable to both the team and Cooper.This film was shown in the UK at 1130 at night!  This was why I had taped it as I assumed it was more for adults than children after all Clint Eastwood had done a couple of films with a monkey in it  so why not? Watching I was left baffled as to why it was on so late at night when clearly the only people who would want to see it are children who will laugh at the sight of a monkey eating ice cream and dressing up.  The plot is pointless here and no child would care anyway  if you can't guess what will happen at the end then you are a fool!  Will Cooper ever pitch again?  What side will the coin fall on?  Will Cooper and Ed bond?  All these are givens and there is no enjoyment from watching the plot unfold exactly as you know it would.While we're talking about lazy writing how about the fact that every scene is a clich.  We have the monkey dressing up and causing mayhem etc  every scene feels like it is a template to which a baseball film has been applied! None of it is funny for adults anyway and must of it is just puerile  I laughed once and halflaughed another time.  The laugh was Cooper saying oh I'm gonna spank that monkey' and the half was Ed watching TV and seeing the episode of Friends with a monkey in it.  Other than this there is nothing.Part of the film's problem is that Ed looks like two things  and neither of them is a likeable monkey.  First he never for once looks or moves like anything other than a guy in a monkey suit.  Secondly his face and his expressions make him look like a slightly crazy old man  I wondered if children would take to this character or be slightly freaked out by him. Matt LeBlanc plays a character in the mould of Joey  but without the good writers to support him.  He plays second fiddle to a monkey and you can see that the confidence and comfort he enjoys in Friends is absent here.  How people like Cobb Warden and Caviezel must feel watching this is anyone's guess  I suppose they were looking at it being a really big kids movie with the star of Friends how could they lose?Overall I found this a rather dire experience.  Ed has no personality and looks really creepy and the comedy and plot are both as unimaginative as you'd expect them to be.  To be a good kids' film this needed to have a bit of spark to it  instead it brings to mind the fading embers on a dying fire.".

Any of my future ambitions was so much disappointing. Here we are now in 2008exactly 10 years after while i'm searching strange movies on IMDb for a good laughthat this ''movie'' appears to my memories again and a long chill goes through my spine. I had to write a comment at this awful movie. My mind goes to all the unfortunate people that payed the cinema ticket to watch this bad copy of a movieand to all the producers that have the face to propose such a shameful movie.I remember that back in '96 this movie was publicized as much as ''Slepeers'' and Robin Williams ''Jack''int he TV movie trailersjust to make the point. If you find funny the idea of a chimpanzee that farts and makes the poor Leblache eat dog food this is the movie for you. I think that the vote up reported is very generous.".

A little girl once commenting about a guy having a great butt and another time asking another if he's gay. Come on! Also you can tag on the normal amount of what it called bathroom humor. It's everywhere here. What the film is basically is garbage despite the baseball angle. I usually enjoy baseball films but I can't classify this as such.

I can only assume that the writers and execs at the studio were under the influence of some mindaltering drug while they were watching a rerun of a Francis the Mule film or else had loved ones kidnapped in order to force this film to be made. This is the only way you could understand this film. Even the worst of the most contrived Disney films of the 1960s and 70s look like Gone With the Wind compared to this! Matt LeBlanc stars as a guy who has a great pitching arm. However when his game stinks the manager punishes him by sending him to pick someone up at the bus stop. That 'someone' turns out to be a baseball playing chimp who is the team's new mascot. When I first saw this chimp he really looked creepyand I assume it was just a midget in an ape suit. It looked more realistic than chimps looked in films in 1940 but still looked bizarre and a bit scary! Well only in a movie would it turn out that the chimp was a fantastic baseball playerwith an arm like a rocket AND a thorough knowledge of how to play ball! How all the actors were able to participate in this farce of a film with straight faces is beyond me. Talk about an insane plot! Even small children would find this tough to swallow. However given that he ultimately is SMARTER than LeBlanc isn't quite as hard to believe at least in light of his role on Friends.Some of the lowpoints in this dreadful film include frequent fart jokes snot jokes Ed and LeBlanc both peeing together at the same toilet belching Ed driving a truck at what appears to be 400 mph more fart jokes and Ed plying dressup with grandma's clothes. At no point in the film is it clever or does it poke fun of itself the only way this MIGHT have worked.Overall a sorry mess of a film that is so inexplicably dumb that I can't believe it was made in the first place. Practically every clich known to baseball is in this film and its only entertainment value is for people who want to laugh at the sheer inanity of the movie. Clearly this film has earned its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list!".

I made it to the big date and past cut week and the chimp and neighbor girl were doing something with food but I have no idea just how long the thing would go on.  Bad script bad sports bad effects not so much bad digital effects but incomprehensible ones what was the deal with the dollar signs in the owner's eyes?  I know that the guy couldn't act but still let him put on his greed face that he'd been practicing in the mirrorI kept hoping that Matt LeBlanc who I love on friends and liked in Lost in Space had agreed to do this before he had a going career like Jennifer Aniston and Leprechaun.  But there was a scene where the chimp was watching Friends!  I shudder to think how much LeBlanc must have been paid to be in this bomb.  I hope for his sake it was a lot.And just one comment on the Chimp outfit  couldn't they have somehow disguised the relative size of its head?  I know that there were people under the mask but with the chimp head on it looks like the cranium is half again the volume of Matt LeBlanc's! A chimpanzee with a brain that size would certainly be smarter than anybody involved in this film.  Oh well. A thoroughly hideous experience gave me a severe migraine and remembering it now sickens me.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had to comment because this piece of Chimp dung finally replaced Mannequin 2 as my personal worst movie of all time as well as replacing Blame it on the Bellboy as last movie I physically could not watch all the way through.  I made it to the big date and past cut week and the chimp and neighbor girl were doing something with food but I have no idea just how long the thing would go on.  Bad script bad sports bad effects not so much bad digital effects but incomprehensible ones what was the deal with the dollar signs in the owner's eyes?  I know that the guy couldn't act but still let him put on his greed face that he'd been practicing in the mirrorI kept hoping that Matt LeBlanc who I love on friends and liked in Lost in Space had agreed to do this before he had a going career like Jennifer Aniston and Leprechaun.  But there was a scene where the chimp was watching Friends!  I shudder to think how much LeBlanc must have been paid to be in this bomb.  I hope for his sake it was a lot.And just one comment on the Chimp outfit  couldn't they have somehow disguised the relative size of its head?  I know that there were people under the mask but with the chimp head on it looks like the cranium is half again the volume of Matt LeBlanc's! A chimpanzee with a brain that size would certainly be smarter than anybody involved in this film.  Oh well. A thoroughly hideous experience gave me a severe migraine and remembering it now sickens me.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh great you think. another guy giving it a high rating for this beep just to be contrary. Ahyawn. Well maybe. It depends on your perspective and I'm sincere in my belief that there's something about this movie that transcends it's own badness. From the look of the TV spots over a decade ago it seemed like it was so horrible by all accounts that it SHOULDN'T exist! Anyway me and my brother relived Edmania on premium cable the other night and something odd struck me. Is it possible that this movie is a satire on what Hollywood thinks the lowest common denominator enjoys? Sports? Check. The show Friends? Cast member that the sports bar crowd fancies as their ideal self is in tow. A primate dressing like a person? We'll do you one recursion better. A person dressed as a primate dressing like a person.The Chuck Jones cartoon sound effects are there transforming the shock of violence and injury into temporary and absurd conditions. The spirit of the Munsters a satire on immigrants living in American suburbia arises in unnecessary fasttracking film techniques to make this world more cartoonlike and sped up during moments of intensity.The American ideals are constantly lampooned upon sometimes in ways we're so used to living here that we don't immediately notice them. It's very telling throughout the picture but I'll only focus on some of the final scenes which is everything that follows a car chase I mean after all car chases are part and parcel in crazy American life.A girl child prays to God at the eve of the big game to spare the life of the chimp in the hospital bed. As soon as she lays the chimp's pitcher mitt on his lap to go blithely get a drink of some apple juice or something I was distracted the heart monitor begins to beep in steady rhythm and the once comatose chimp recovers and is eager to go to the big game. This entire drama from the setup to the climax is about twenty seconds in length. We didn't know beforehand that the chimp was so badly frozen in the truck that it would resign him to a hospital bed and that cognitive dissonance is just as intentional as the scene where the chimp watches late night TV and plays with his food I assure you.Before the final pitch of the big game a distressed Matt LeBlanc wipes the sweat on his brow and calls for a time out. He runs to the stands and steals a kiss from the attractive woman and turns to the chimp. The chimp licks his finger tip and knowingly chalks up another as Matt LeBlanc shows his dental work and nods in sinister agreement. As he heads back to the mound he is now destined not to blow the game at all. The woman and a girl child stand in awe as their hair blows in the wind in one half of the shot and the other half of the angle incorporates the American flag flying high and proudly. Now we have a nuclear family including a family pet. Except the pet is not a pet. And the girl is not her daughter. Yes those conflicts with the ideal are intentional. It's pointing out an absurdity that even the misfits can pull themselves together and be the ideal if we so choose but only in movies.There are many ways to take the symbolism in this movie and all of them are deeply cynical and rightfully critical of white culture and Hollywood alike. Unfortunately this film will only be preaching to the converted just as Beavis and Butthead also did in the same era while sterile and boring masses take it at face value. The roman a clef to that show was that what they were saying itself was not the joke but the fact that THEY THEMSELVES found it funny. The further recursion was that the kids who took the show at face value were looking in the mirror while looking in the TVsitting on their couch looking dead ahead at BB sitting on the couch.I only go off on that tangent to say that Ed is doing a similar thing but not getting the same kind of recognition for it because it's a few steps ahead of even this time and offers us no crutch of the mirror stage. That is with the nobrow ironic movement starting to wane and with the introduction of the new sincerity movement where there is NO shred of irony this is a very hard movie to place because the intent isn't spelled out for us. Were the movie makers being sincere in the way Ed Wood was sincere and just didn't know they were making a terrible movie children would hate? Were they trying to be ironic and try to make a farce of the Hollywood conventions in the hopes that the audience would go through an hour and a half deprogramming session? Or what is most likely in the children's market todaytry to make a quick buck off in the risky market of imitating more successful movies in hopes that parents would accidentally pick their movie up thinking it was a Disney Home Video movie? These are three dangerous prongs to dance on because nobody has time to think about these things except for young adults that play XBOX Live too much. So the movie is a Chinese puzzle box in this way...and I have the sneaking suspicion that the Ed team planned that all along.Trust me if you smoke a few bowls this will all make sense man.".

	schema:headline " The Raven Who Gave Us Texas";
	schema:reviewBody "If I may if you want to understand the career of Sam Houston turn to a wonderful old biography of the man called The Raven Houston's nickname with the Indians by Marquis James. It won the Pulitzer Prize for biography back in 1937 or so. Houston was one of the two really big historical figures remembered from our Westward Expansion who were not gunfighters gunslingers or military men. He and Deseret  Utah founder Brigham Young are still impressive figures  and far more memorable than some of the U.S. Presidents of their age. In fact Young's confrontation with the U.S. Government in the socalled Mormon War of 185760 makes one really wish he had been U.S. President rather than the joker we had at the time James Buchanan. Houston might have made an interesting President too but his only attempt to really get a nomination was in 1856 and it was with the antiimmigrant KnowNothing Party. Houston had fought alongside Andrew Jackson and rose in Tennessee politics as a Congressman and Governor. Then his very promising marriage to a socially connected young woman collapsed. The actual reason is still unknown but this film wisely keeps most of the details in including how it led to a divorce unheard of in 1829 the resignation of Houston and then a prolonged bender he got a new name for awhile of Big Drunk. But with the help of the Cherokees whom he always treated well he regained his balance.

But it backfired this time He tried go give a small fee to Marquis James for the use of the book. James rejected the paltry sum so the film title was changed. Most of the material in the movie mangled or otherwise came from James' biography. This led to a plagiarism case which the great lawyer Louis Nizer discusses in My Life In Court. It was won because the script writers copied a bit of poetic license used by James in the biography an Indian chant sequence that he added for color  including the language. Yates settled out of court.Houston has been seen in several films about Texas like The First Texan and television's The Road To Texas. But no definitive film has ever been made  possibly because he was a slave owner as was Jackson. He does deserve one for his outlandish and on the whole successful career. But if one would like to see a proper capoff to any of these films try to catch the old Profiles In Courage episode on Houston starring J.D. Cannon showing his fierce devotion to the Union in 1861 and how it led to political oblivion. Cannon in the conclusion puts his successful Confederate opponents to shame.".

	onyx:emotionText "If I may if you want to understand the career of Sam Houston turn to a wonderful old biography of the man called The Raven Houston's nickname with the Indians by Marquis James. It won the Pulitzer Prize for biography back in 1937 or so. Houston was one of the two really big historical figures remembered from our Westward Expansion who were not gunfighters gunslingers or military men. He and Deseret  Utah founder Brigham Young are still impressive figures  and far more memorable than some of the U.S. Presidents of their age. In fact Young's confrontation with the U.S. Government in the socalled Mormon War of 185760 makes one really wish he had been U.S. President rather than the joker we had at the time James Buchanan. Houston might have made an interesting President too but his only attempt to really get a nomination was in 1856 and it was with the antiimmigrant KnowNothing Party. Houston had fought alongside Andrew Jackson and rose in Tennessee politics as a Congressman and Governor. Then his very promising marriage to a socially connected young woman collapsed. The actual reason is still unknown but this film wisely keeps most of the details in including how it led to a divorce unheard of in 1829 the resignation of Houston and then a prolonged bender he got a new name for awhile of Big Drunk. But with the help of the Cherokees whom he always treated well he regained his balance. He tried to get a better deal for them when they were ordered on the Trail of Tears by his pal Jackson but I don't think he was as successful as the movie makes him. Then he turned to Texas and eventually became the avenger of the Alamo at the battle of San Jacinto and one of it's Presidents there were about four Presidents of Texas.

	schema:reviewBody "The dynamic and colorful life of Sam Houston is one of those epics stories that truly deserve a miniseries. Hopefully one day one will be done for him. My guess is that his background as a slave owner works against having Houston honored in that way. One of the most glaring omissions of Man Of Conquest is the lack of black people and the issue of slavery which is one of the darker parts of the Texas story.The film resembles D.W. Griffith's Abraham Lincoln biographical film in format. A quick passage through Houston's youth and military service with Andrew Jackson and he's governor of Tennessee. Then the story continues until the Battle Of San Jacinto with a brief epilogue. Another error mentions Houston was at the Battle Of New Orleans he was not. He did however do some considerable Indian fighting but also developed a great respect for the native people. In fact he moved in with his adoptive tribe the Cherokees after the scandal of his divorce wrecked his political career in Tennessee.Richard Dix makes a solid and heroic Houston and his wives are played by Joan Fontaine as Eliza Allen and Gail Patrick as Margaret Lea. And Houston did not even meet Margaret Lea until after Texas was a republic on a visit to the United States.Mexico by not populating its territory north of the Rio Grande left it pretty much open to whomever would settle and for awhile it was only Comanches Arankawas and Kiowa tribes. The bulk of settlers from the USA came from the south and some brought slavery and their slaves with them. Eventually East Texas became a cotton growing region like the rest of the cotton culture south. This is the part we don't talk about in this film.The rest of the characters of Texas history are there popularized by Walt Disney and John Wayne later on. Robert Armstrong Robert Barrat Victory Jory Ralph Morgan play Jim Bowie Davy Crockett William B. Travis and Stephen F. Austin respectively. Edward Ellis plays a thinner and more subdued Andrew Jackson than you saw Lionel Barrymore do in The Gorgeous Hussy. Did you know Andrew Jackson took a secret trip to Texas while in the White House? I didn't either until I saw this film.Two of Republic Pictures cowboy sidekicks got roles in this film. Max Terhune minus his ventriloquist dummy plays famed scout Deaf Smith and Gabby Hayes has an all purpose fictional sidekick role.The Battle of San Jacinto isn't even played right. In fact it wasn't much of a battle because of the complete surprise that Houston got on General Santa Anna at dawn. The whole thing was over in about 20 minutes and more Texans lost their lives on the screen in Man Of Conquest than at the real battle.This was Republic Pictures big budget item for 1939 and got Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction Best Sound and Best Musical Scoring. Herbert J. Yates really laid a lot of loot out from Republic for this film. The budget of about 10 Gene Autry and 10 Roy Rogers films went into Man Of Conquest.The best treatment of the Sam Houston story is in TV film Gone To Texas which starred Sam Elliot as Houston. Man Of Conquest has not worn well over the years and its glaring historical inaccuracies will make any true Texan wince.".

	schema:reviewBody "2nd unit director B. REEVES EASON. Stunts staged by Yakima Canutt. Copyright 15 May 1939 by Republic Pictures Corp. New York opening at the Capitol 27 April 1939. U.S. release 15 May 1939. Australian release through British Empire Films 10 August 1939. 99 minutes. SYNOPSIS A potted biography of Samuel Houston 17931863 concentrating mainly on the trivial and the fictitious whilst ignoring many of the more salient facts. COMMENT With much raiding of library footage for its battle and montage shots this Republic epic seems spectacular enough for unsophisticated audiences. Unfortunately though they are the sort of patrons unlikely to sit still for all the pretty speeches of patriotic pep!Miscast Richard Dix makes but a fair fist of the role. Gail Patrick is her usual selfrighteous colorless self Victor Jory makes little of a miniscule part whilst Robert Barrat is cast as an unlikely Davy Crockett and Robert Armstrong an equally unacceptable Jim Bowie. History or no history George Hayes contributes his usual Gabby characterization minus his crumpled hat. Of the main players the only ones we really liked were Edward Ellis  and even he outlives his welcome  and Joan Fontaine. Of the cameo artists Ralph Morgan C. Henry Gordon and of course Charles Stevens. OTHER VIEWS Despite some impressive crowd scenes and an allout battle climax this Republic miniepic concentrates on political polemics rather than action and characterization. All the characters are cut from the same onedimensional cloth. Aside from Miss Fontaine who leaves the story early on we weary of all the principals long before The End title signals the finish of our ordeal. George Nicholls Jr borrowed along with Dix and Fontaine from RKO directs this dreary affair in a resolutely plodding fashion. The boring scenario isn't even leavened by bright photography or a rousing score. In fact both photographer and composer contribute work well below their usual standard. Ruthless scissoring would have helped but as it is this Man of Conquest is dullsville all the way from Tennessee to the Alamo.  John Howard Reid writing as George Addison.".

I really liked the bad guys design in the end after eating the golden hornsso I do suggest watching it but be warned you might not like it on account of the fact that it feels rushed just saying";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the very first show of this movie . I expected a lot from itBut it doesn't meet my expectations. First of all i wanna tell about actors....Ramcharan after Magadheera  selected a Romantic story different from from his past two action movies His performance was improved than the past two films. The skydiving in movie will make audience surprise.. He is glamorous  stylish  funny .... Genelia acted so well only after the first 20 minutes but a bit overacting... Genelia screaming is unbearable first 20 minutes. But rest of the movie is Good  can make audience to sit and watch in theater for rest of 2 hours.Shajan Padmasee as Rooba was beautiful and done justice to her part Rooba Rooba song was well pictured with her Nagababu  Prakash Raj  Prabhu though performed very short roles they acted well . Manjula as Ramcharan's sister performed surprisingly very well. Thinking of Brahmanandam ? God this guy is hilarious . But he can still perform well. Actors are good . But the plot of this movie is weak. Fact is that the concept is truly very new But the presentation part is not good.Thinking of Music ? Harris rocks again with his wonderful music especially Rooba Rooba   background score is awesome .. We have to give 1010 for MusicThe first 20 minutes of movie can be barely watchable  The rest of movie is Very GoodFinally it's a cool movie .. Its Funny  Romantic  Hilarious.. watchable with Family.Not a must see  But a good one from Bhaskar  RamCharan. If you had some free time  money and to want kill some time .

	onyx:emotionText "I watched the very first show of this movie . I expected a lot from itBut it doesn't meet my expectations. First of all i wanna tell about actors....Ramcharan after Magadheera  selected a Romantic story different from from his past two action movies His performance was improved than the past two films. The skydiving in movie will make audience surprise.. He is glamorous  stylish  funny .... Genelia acted so well only after the first 20 minutes but a bit overacting... Genelia screaming is unbearable first 20 minutes. But rest of the movie is Good  can make audience to sit and watch in theater for rest of 2 hours.Shajan Padmasee as Rooba was beautiful and done justice to her part Rooba Rooba song was well pictured with her Nagababu  Prakash Raj  Prabhu though performed very short roles they acted well . Manjula as Ramcharan's sister performed surprisingly very well. Thinking of Brahmanandam ? God this guy is hilarious . But he can still perform well. Actors are good . But the plot of this movie is weak. Fact is that the concept is truly very new But the presentation part is not good.Thinking of Music ? Harris rocks again with his wonderful music especially Rooba Rooba   background score is awesome .. We have to give 1010 for MusicThe first 20 minutes of movie can be barely watchable  The rest of movie is Very GoodFinally it's a cool movie ..

Also another error Stereotyping all graffiti artists as criminal rapists yet he is a good guy graffiti artist. One good thing Brimful of Asha was playing in the club. Awesome.

Reason simple if it was the other way it would have ended up being an overdose. A mediocre 3040 minutes with an undercurrent indication to the flash back opened up doors to what is undoubtedly the best achievement in Telugu cinema in movies of this Genre.Awesome is what I had in my mind leaving to the interval break. Rarely does one feel the break time in Indian cinema is not needed and this happens to be one such occasion. Second half started the rollercoaster ride. You see all the effort that the technicians had put in the movie. While songs are not at their best while listening they were much better on picture. Dheera Dhreera song should be one of the best pictured songs in Telugu cinema. Charan has a long way to go but there are a few areas where he needs to work out a lot. But well.. for someone in his very second movie he seems to had put extraordinary effort for this outcome. A pat on back for Rajamouli too. Some scenes of the movie will haunt you for a long time. The starting scene and the scene where the horse Badshah comes back to rescue Charan. The horse chase sequences leading to scene are also superbly pictured. In spite of some obvious logical errors I felt utterly satisfied for a Telugu movie after a long time. Hard work pays off.PS Rarely sad but true!  we'll get chance to take our nonTelugu colleagues to a Telugu movie and feel proud. Make the most of it with Magadheera. Let all know that our industry can make the best of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Magadheera is an indigenous product from our own very soil with significant portion of the plot inspired by bedtime tales of taatayya naanamma ammama and presented on screen at a lavish scale benchmarked by likes of Gladiator 300. Without an iota of doubt Magadheera is a praise worthy effort for the topclass CGI's that transports the audience straight into the period era. Next to CGI I am afraid everything comes to a grinding halt. The entire team seems to have been obsessed with overthetop production values that nobody bothered to tap even a single shoulder and ask Where is the plot heading dude?. It would be an understatement to mention the writing has holes as the proceedings give an impression that the impromptu scribbling act was attempted on the set a few minutes before the shot was canned. The editor I am sure made a silent prayer with every stitch that logic remains unquestioned by the audience. Songs by Keeravani don't quite rise upto the expectations. The action sequences are well executed though.  Kajal Agarwal The new postergirl on the block thanks to the good looks. It was evident that she attempts to cover up her acting skills with her coy expressions. Undoubtedly Ms. Kajal is good as Indira but sadly a misfit to pulloff the regal character of Yuvarani Mitravinda Devi. On that note perhaps there was a good opportunity for heroine 2 to stage an entry on the lines of every papa Chiranjeevi's movie. Rao Ramesh Brings in the stagelike performance coupled with his makeup gait and hissing dialogue delivery to breathe life into the character of Aghora.  Mumait Khan Attempts to displace Disco Shanti in the garb of Bangaru Kodi Petta remix. On behalf of the fans of the original version do I need to spell the word foul? Suneel  Brahmanandam were merely a forcefit into the storyline. The appalling act in the name of comedy was easily dispensable.  Kim Sharma Her item song was clearly a forcefit. Dev Gill Has got what is takes to breathe a menacingly evil re incarnate into life. Stands out clearly and now that Sonu Sood has found glory in his own hamlet perhaps Dev Gill should consider filling in his shoes. Sarathbabu Though a short role but effortlessly essayed. Srihari Again the writing is at lowest ebb with regards to fleshing out the character of Sher Khan Solomon. Dropping straight into the climax outoftheblue is cinematic liberties at its best.  Chiranjeevi Reprises his persona of megastar with his signature style signature dialogues and signature mannerism in a cameo which can be best described as There you go son my fanbase is now all yours. Entice them!. Encapsulating fatherson in the same screen space is nothing more than a Kodak moment.And finally about.... Ram Charan Teja Every heir to a legacy wishes for a wand which could make the comparison go away and magically exceeds expectations. If such did exist I am sure Chiranjeevi Junior would have been the highest bidder. Under the garb of technical brilliance everything gets pushed under the carpet which includes his performance. Chiru's fans might be benevolent this time and a few times more but in order to stay in business he needs to build his own army of loyal soldiers. Ram Charan Teja clearly has miles to go before papa can sleep.".

And i am now a fan of ram charan teja.the start of the movie was surprising but after 10 minutes it changed to different. But the first 15 minutes seemed little bit boring to me. I mean very very little. the love scenes between ram and kajal was very beautiful. And i literally had goosebumps on the scene where teja chase the bus in a horse. Songs were good. The real excitement begins after the interval. From there the movie is like like? i cant describe it in words. The 100 men fight scene was excellent though its inspired from 300 which is also my one of favourite movies. All in all this is something special!!!".

My friend Kumar recommended me to watch this movie but I didn't count on it on that time. After his lots of persuasion I watched it and I was literary surprised dazzled and entertained. I wasn't expecting that I will like it to such great height.Movie is about a guy RamCharan named Harsha who accidentally touch the hand of a young girlKajal Agarwal Indu without seeing her face and that soul touchconnects his present to the past. He try to find her as 400 yearsbefore in 1609 AD in the kingdom of Udaigarh he was a warrior namedKalaBhairava Ram Charan who trains soldier. The Senadhipathi RandheerDev Gil lusts on Yuvarani Mitravinda Kajal but the latter loves Kalabhirava. That results in a huge battle between Randheer and Kalabhairava which puts end for their lives. Sher Khan Sri Hari the Muslim invader witnesses the valor and love of Kalabhairava and salutes to him. They take rebirth as Harsha and Indu. And many characters from the past also come to present with the soul connectivity. How the past unfold what happens next?? And how story ends all answers lie in the movie. Magadheera might have old school story and concept but it is refreshing and stupendous because of very good direction by S.S Rajamouli great Cinematography Art Direction 'the marvelous sets of Udaigarh and costumes' was commendable good Visual Effects Action Sequences were breathtaking and nail biting especially the war sequence between Bhairava and Sher Khan's soldiersthis is the HIGH POINT of the movie and not forgetting about acting of Ram Charan and Kajal Agarwal. Ram Charan was the show stealer. Looked cool and cute as a lover boy and vigorous  valor as Bhairava the Warrior. Kajal Agarwal was equally good in her role. The music was extremely well. Pleasing to hear ironically I can't get any lyrics as Movie is in Telugu but still two songs are my favorite because of their rhythm and music. The Background Score is also justifying. Overall a great movie with all elements in it. Very entertaining indeed. Ram Charan lives up his father's reputation Chiranjiv. A definitely MUST WATCH movie. If some unnecessary scenes one and two songs in the 2nd half had been skipped and more Editing had been done making the movie little bit short and more crispier then it would have been a PERFECT 1010. I rate it 910. CATCH IT!".

It sets up a different standard all together. I completely disagree with people who say that the special affects are a lift off from Hollywood movies because sure a couple of scenes might be influenced but other than those the ingenuity shown by the screenwriter and director in every scene is spellbinding. I think this movie is the best visual treat I have ever experienced and this includes all the amazing Hollywood movies I've seen as well. Yes the visuals the smartness and detailing in ever scene is so unique and intelligent that it surpasses even the best of Hollywood. Maybe it is the fact that this story is about your people that makes it more relatable but neways this is surely THe MOVIe for me. There are so many more things That I can say about it but this should be sufficient. So just go ahead and indulge ur senses and see Indian Cinema make its mark and affect you in the most splendid way...!!!".

When I heard initially that it would be a rebirth story I felt nostalgic about how it would shape up but seeing the movie made me completely reverse my opinions.The story starts impressively with Ramcharan as Kaala Bhairava and Kajal the princess talking in their dying moments. They are reborn as Harsha and Indhu. Read many comments that the next 30 Min's to 1 hour in the new world is boring but the pair's bubbliness makes that enjoyable too. I would have loved Chiranjeevi to have done something different though. I always enjoyed the spontaneousness and effortless dance of Chiranjeevi and hence seeing Ramcharan dance was little bit anticlimax. The steps were great and he is a fabulous dancer but you get a feeling that he is trying too hard to get the tough steps correctly which shouldn't be how dances are pictured . The villain does great job of his part and deserves the brickbats he receives . Rebirth  Special effects on Ramcharan touching Kajal's fingers can be termed as cinematic liberty though some of the sequences like jumping off the rooftop to reach helicopter and the final sumo bouncing to reach the helicopter are definitely aberrations that could have been avoided. Two scenes that highlight the entire movie are with Ramcharan as the warrior getting saved by his horse and the other one where he fights 100 Sher khan's soldier's singlehandedly reminiscent of the movie 300 with narrow passage and the fights that take place. Sheer brilliance !!! The movies visuals is great compared to their lousy official site httpmagadheera.com. Music is good. Songs gel with the movie and hence are better viewed than listened at least for the first few times. Overall a great movie that is thoroughly enjoyable even for viewing multiple times.

	schema:reviewBody "This film really had the potential but fell short due to a lot of issues. First of all the graphics are pretty good for a telugu movie but there is obviously scope for improvement and it will come in time but that does not take away the hardwork and boldness on part of the directorproducer to bring such standards to telugu movies. Apart from that the story is drawn from a standard rebirth tale that has been narrated in many movies. Performance of charan is average esp. dialouge delivery The way his character remembers its past life is pretty naive some more time could have been spent on that and how does the heroine believe the guy loves her without knowing her?. the whole chopper episode is a bit confusingits supposed to go to a hospital but goes to Vizag and then Rajasthan!!! Cheap stunts bike lighting fire with foot Unnecessary scene and senseless dialouges with chirufor the masses i guess Fight sequences in killing 100men are repetitive with hero just standing there and slashing his sword for most of the time It could have been made a bit more interesting with some intelligent moves The whole concept of planets lining up and meteor crash!! could have been shown differently the animation shown in the sky is hilarious.On a positive note the chariot race episode chemistry between the lead pair dialouges music and depiction of actress Kajal are good. As far as special effects are concerned this is just the beginning and the standards will improve as the demand will increase in coming years. Overall there is entertainment good visuals and hence commercial value".

But gradually I got pulled into the epic and beautiful story. This movie just has it all a sense of history a sense of wonder spiritualism action romance humor music and dance. There is room for many different moods which follow each other in a very natural way. Almost unknown in the selfcentered West I think this movie deserves way more praise.".

But there is a bad relative of the king who wants to marry her. Sher Khan Srihari plans to invade Udayghad. In the process ensued all of them die. These four people take rebirth after 400 years in the contemporary era.Ram Charan's performance in his debut film Chiruta is like a show reel of what he is capable of doing. In this movie he gets an opportunity to do some real good performance and he performs them convincingly with effortless ease. And he had gone through tremendous physical toil in this film as it involves horse riding sword fighting dances and many more. His dance in Bangaru Kodipetta after the completion of Chiranjeevi's appearance is stunning. He is gifted with a good voice and he should fine tune it further to come up with pristine Telugu diction.Story of the movie is about rebirths. Rajamouli opened the movie by revealing the story right in the first episode. The challenge lies in Rajamouli's handling of telling the story interestingly to the audiences though audiences know what he is going to narrate. Screenplay of the movie is good and the Rajamouli trade mark commercial paybacks are nicely inserted at regular intervals.Rajamouli should be appreciated for giving due credit to all his technicians by dedicating a fullsong to them during the end titles of the movie. Watching that was fun. Background music a combined effort of Keeravani and Kalyani Malik is excellent. Cinematography by Senthil Kumar is very good. It is extremely difficult to recreate the era of 400 years old and art direction by Ravinder is splendid. Fights composed by Peter Hynes are excellent.ANALYSIS Opening episode of the movie is superb. First half of the movie is nice and second half is decent. The tempo goes down right after the flashback episode as it's everybody's guess that what follows is a predictable climax. The plus points of the movie are Ram Charan Teja novel subject of rebirth flashback episode grandeur and commercial pay offs.TAILPIECE There is uncanny resemblance to Arundhati and Magadheera stories. Both these films are about incarnations. Both these movies have aghora episodes. And villain lusts heroine and that forms the central conflict point in both these movies.".

Though it is basically a remake of the Jackie Chan starrer film San wa The Myth it is far better than the original. Actually what the director did was that he used all the usual Telugu movie clichs and raised his film into an extraordinary visual treat...The computer graphics used in this film is one of the best i have seen in Indian screen. The artwork and visuals of Udhaigar was mind blowing. I thought that i was watching an English Movie. But there were some scenes were the graphics looked very ordinary especially in the modern day scenes. The story was pretty effective in Indian Screen. As for we are related to the reincarnation theme. Ram Charan Teja looked too good for a 2 movie old star. Kajal Agarwal was also perfect.Srihari did a wonderful job. As far as i'm concerned he is the show stealer.The music is one thing that let me down though the background score and the Udhaigar song was awesome...All credits go to SS Rajamouli for this film and it is a must watch for all the Indian movie fans.".

The first item song was the only thing which was a little bit boring as far as the rest of the movie is considered. Ram Charan Theja is perfect for his role as Bhairava and he did it well. Fight scenes are absolutely overwhelming. The scene where hero chases the bus with a horse will really give you goose bumps. I must say bollywood has to learn a lot from Tollywood. If u compare Jodha Akbar and Magadheera just looking at the fight scenes u can feel the difference. Jodha Akbar is a total waste of time and money. Overall Magadheera is a must watch movie for all kind of viewers. It is a new epic in Indian film history.".

Now I want everyone to know it is not a sequel it just happens to have Death in the title and star the wonderful David Carradine. I also liked how Deathsport solved the flaw of Death race 2000 by saying that the movie takes place in a thousand years after tomorrow. I really thought with the bad rating and the more serious plot that it was going to suck balls big time. But then when I played it I was so shocked that it actually was awesome. Notice I said awesome and not good because I even know that yes its a terrible movie. But it is also extremely entertaining. I have literally not seen so many explosions in a movie. The movie does have huge flaws and is done horribly but its definitely a its so bad its good type movie. Now it isn't so bad that its unwatchable i.e. Plan 9 in fact I find it very watchable. I will say go into this movie prob with a friend who also likes sty bmovies because its hard to laugh at this movie by yourself. Minor Spoilers If you like movies with naked playmates motorcycle explosions some overkill horses when shot disappear awesome music by Jerry Garcia scifi cliques anticlimatic deaths including a too short duel gladiator fights cavemen painted backgrounds nomad groups a thousand years in the future citystates and a little girl in a guinea pig cage then this movie is for you!".

In my opinion a movie can only really be bad if it's boring and this movie isn't that. It is cheap and poorly made but it's moderately fun and you can laugh at it. So it's not any kind of horrid failure. It's kind of an unofficial followup to one of Roger Corman's more popular productions Death Race 2000 in that it's about a motor sport created to distract the unwashed masses and stars David Carradine. It also takes place in the future. This future is postapocalyptic and David Carrdine along with hottie Claudia Jennings are warriors who live in the wastelands. They are captured by civilization which includes crazy ruler David McLean and his minion Richard Lynch and along with a doctor who diagnosed McLean's sanity and his rebel son William Smithers and Will Walker respectively they're forced to participate in deathsport where they basically try to survive while menacing soldiers on deathcycles try to waste them. The titular deathsport really only lasts for a few minutes in the film and then the rest of the movie has the four heroes escaping on the deathcycles while pursued by Lynch and his thugs. The movie ends with a hilarious duel between Carradine and Lynch using whistlers which are clear plastic swords that whistle when you swing them.".

However although it does feature the same leading man David Carradine it lacks two key elements from the first film  the selfcaricature known as Sylvester Stallone and the arch humor of director Paul Bartel who went on to direct cult favorites Eating Raoul 1982 and Lust in the Dust 1985. Principal director Allan Arkush on the other hand was soon relegated to the wasteland of television. Roger Corman wears his producer's hat for Deathsport but is also listed as an uncredited director.

Could it really be THE Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead fame?This film should be seen by anybody interested in learning how NOT to make a movie. It is bad in so many ways that the 1000 word IMDb comment limit precludes me from even beginning to describe them.

He escapes on a silver bike together with his fellowhippie love interest and some blond dude who can't act. The rest of the movie they get chased by the evil Richard Lynch on a bike. Oh and there's mutants running around the wastelands too. Bonkers I tell you.There are a few charming mattepaintings to behold mainly of two futuristic cities. Lots of psychedelic color schemes full frontal female nudity and utterly spacedout sounds. Will you just listen to those motorcycles when they fly by? They either sound like they're screaming or farting. Even those plastic seethrough swords of Carradine  his girl make undefinable weeshsounds. Those big redlaserbeaming handblasters are pretty mindboggling too. People and things get all red and vanish into thin air when they get hit.One of the highlights is the sequence where Carradine on his bike gets chased by Lynch and his henchmen also on bikes of course. They drive into some abandoned military domain and end up driving some sort of improvised but prearranged race circuit. There's really no explanation as to why it's there. It's just there although it shouldn't be. Plus during their pursuit things just keep blowing up and randomly catch fire.In the end Carradine and Lynch get to face off one another during a weirdly edited swordbossfight. The outcome? Evil Lynch gets decapitated and Carradine gets the girl. I love it when a movie ends that way! Well not just any movie of course. Only the ones that star David Carradine as a womanizing hero. Well womanizing probably isn't the exact word as she's more like some soulmate or something. But whatever he gets the chick and that's what counts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathsport 1978  12 out of 4Many people magazines and books have called this a followup to DEATH RACE 2000 but I really don't see it as such. Yes this film takes place in the future has David Carradine and deals with a violent sport but I personally saw no connection to the previous film and not to mention Carradine is playing a different character. Set a thousand years in the future an evil lord David McLean has eliminated the death penalty and instead inmates must earn their freedom by taking part in the deathsport which is a violent game on dirt bikes. A man Carradine and woman Claudia Jennings are selected to take part in the game and of course they're better than anyone who has played before. DEATHSPORT easily is no where near the quality of the original film hey I'm a fan but at the same time it is so bad that I think bad movie fans might be able to have a good laugh at it. Whatever the budget was the majority of the money had to go towards the stunts in the film but more on that in a sec. Outside of the stunts everything in this film looks about as cheap as cheap can get and this includes the silly futuristic dirt bikes the silly looking swords and the countless bad costumes that are worn by everyone. Even worse is that the story itself really makes very little sense and in fact not too much happens throughout the running time. Those wanting gore will be disappointed because the majority of the kills are down with some sort of ray guns obviously ripping the laser stuff from STAR WARS that just make the people vanish into thin air. Both Carradine and Jennings are good sport about their roles but neither one exactly shines. Former Playmate Jennings has all sorts of nude scenes here so fans should at least enjoy this. Just wait until you check out the electrocution room and how it makes her jiggle for you. The stunt work here is actually rather incredible as there are all sorts of dangerous things being done. The highlight deals with an explosion where a man gets set on fire and he's in the middle of this amazing fire. I'm not sure how they did this stunt the way they did but it was very impressive to watch. Still DEATHSPORT is pure cheapness from start to finish and only fans of the bad need to view.".

	schema:reviewBody "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS The basic and I mean basic premise of this film is that a deranged president John Hulmes and his Statesmen' capture wandering nomads to fight against death machines' to gain their freedom and to satisfy his sadistic needs.  However the President's mental health is failing and sensing weakness his right hand man Ankar Moor Richard Lynch decides that the time is right to increase his own grip on power. Whilst this may sound like a promising story line it is unfortunately as far as the writers managed to develop the script so essentially a five minute idea gets padded out to make a 90 minute film. This is achieved by adding a completely pointless subplot' involving mutants kidnapping a young girl from Deneer's Claudia Jeenings tribe and lots of footage of bike chases. Who the mutants are and why they kidnap the girl is deemed by the writers to be completely irrelevant to the viewer. The prop budget in this film is minimal to say the least and makes a Dr Who episode seem grossly lavish.  The death machines' are essentially motorbikes with bits of silver metal attached and have an alarming tendency to explode at slightest contact reminiscent of The Simpsons' vehicles. In fact a large chunk of the budget must have been spent on pyrotechnics because things explode and catch on fire throughout the last half of the film.  The dialogue is extremely cumbersome and was probably written during a heavy smoking session. Corradine seems distracted and listless whilst Lynch halfheartedly hams it up leaving only former Playboy Playmate Jeenings seemingly intent on making any effort. This being a Corman production she of course has to be nude at some point which must be considered a positive in this film and she duly obliges during a bizarre light bulb torture scene. The same device is also used to provide a rather lame conclusion to the President story line.  Another oddity in this film is the musical score' which at times sounds like the keyboard player is suffering from a fit and at times alternates between droning sounds and jazz! The sound effects seemingly borrow' heavily from the Star Wars library   listen out for what sounds like Vader's breathing the phazer effects and the TieFighter like screaming' sound whilst the bikes travel through the tunnels. With the film meandering aimlessly midproduction and in danger of not getting finished Corman stepped in and the sense of desperation can be seen in the final product. This is essentially a poor second cousin to Deathrace 2000 a film that strangely benefited from Stallone's character. I'd only recommend this to Corman diehards or cult completists. Note Watch out for the unfortunate extra who gets unintentionally set alight during the cave scenes you can see him frantically diving to the ground and becoming engulfed in a plume of extinguisher vapour.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't really like this movie when I first started watching it because it was so confusing so silly and it felt so rushed. Well after about 10 minutes I started falling in love with this plot less goofy structure. What little plot there is is a post apocalyptic wasteland that is kind of sort of a sequel to Death Race 2000. Before you think about grouping it in with one of dozens of Mad Max ripoffs keep in mind that this film came BEFORE Mad Max. Although it looks similar to many post apocalyptic movies you remember from the 80s or even from today with something like Fury Road it is a precursor to those films and probably had some influence on them. Deathsport incorporates old magic with futuristic technology with plenty of things you'd recognize from the present which is common with many films in this genre. I know most people who have seen this flick will focus on the absurdity of it but I think there's a few impressive even intellectual things that viewers miss. The movie is clearly fueled by drugs weed LSD and cocaine if I had to guess and because of this there is a lot of experimentation with acting camera shots and filming styles. The way the movie plays with color at times it looks like the director is being influenced by Dario Argento. Also between what is happening mentally with the evil Lord Zirpola and the gladiatorial like games I'd say the writers have clearly studied the reign of Caligula. Despite the heavy drug use on the set or perhaps because of it this film is smarter than most people think. But regardless of whether you want to see a film with experimental shots and smart metaphors or you simply want to see full frontal female nudity plastic swords that would later be used for the Crystar toy line and David Carradine kicking butt in a loincloth you will enjoy this film.".

But right now I was in urgent need of a movie starring David Carradine and this was the only one within reach. Come to think of it I ought to have selected a much better movie for my tribute to this terrific cultaction cinema legend that sadly passed away this week 3rd of June 2009. Deathsport is a prototypic Roger Corman product from the late 70's. Obviously cheap and rapidly put together in order to further cash in on the unexpected but giant success of the previous Death Race 2000 also starring Carradine and also set in a crazed futuristic setting. But apart from this handful of superficial elements also including the similar title there's actually no real connection between Death Race and Deathsport. This is merely an attempt to imitate Star Wars with a lot of cheesy lightandlaser weaponry and an unintentional predecessor to postapocalyptic gladiator movies that became particularly popular during the 80's. In a very distant future practically the entire world has been destroyed due to nuclear warfare. Only a few big cities are left surrounded by endless wastelands where cannibalistic mutants are continuously on the prowl. Life inside the big city isn't that much better though as Lord Zirpola is slowly going bonkers through brain disease and becomes increasingly obsessed with Deathsport. This is a Romantype of arena battle and Zirpola ordered his right hand  the malignant Ankar Moor  to capture the mystically empowered Range Guides Kaz Oshay and Deneer to fight till the death. The Guides are good hearted nomads however and rather than to obey and fight they flee into the wastelands. Okay admittedly this sounds like a rather complex and ambitious plot but I can assure you that Deathsport is actually a pretty brainless and rudimentary SciFi vehicle. Everybody always complains about the low quality level of early 80's Italian apocalypse movies but honestly flicks like The New Gladiators The Atlantis Interceptors Endgame and The New Barbarians are a whole lot better than this dud. Deathsport is boring and repetitive with really laughable special effects the vaporizing weapon looks like a vacuum cleaner and pitiable scenery the socalled Death Machines are ordinary bikes with a metal plant on the front. The only highlights in the film occur whenever Richard Lynch appears on screen as he gives away a deliciously overthetop cheesy performance as the evil and crazyeyed Ankar Moor. Well okay other highlights include Claudia Jennings' multiple nude sequences and the scene where a dude drives off of a tremendously high cliff in slowmotion. David Carradine is sadly mundane and uninspired in this lame production and this definitely isn't one of the movies he'll get remembered for. I can list at least two dozen of movies that I rather watched instead. Rest in peace grasshopper. You were the total definition of cool and handsome.".

The explosives credit is given to Roger George who took advantage of every possible excuse to send fireballs roaring into the sky so if that was you Roger we salute you! Otherwise well you know you're in trouble when the movie opens with David Carradine riding on horseback in a fur cape and a loincloth a scene which left me asking myself If I had a hand blaster that would vaporize people would I really bother carrying around a heavyass sword? The answer is probably because Range Guides think swords are awesome cool just like everybody else.For most of its brief running time the movie is an unexceptional assemblage of awkward action scenes...for example when the good guys battle the bad guys on motorcycles it's rarely clear which stunt guy getting blasted is supposed to represent which actor...and cheesy dialog although the late great Richard Lynch must have thought it ironic to mutter the lines A man is a candle...He must set himself afire to create a life. That the movie credits two directors might explain why the final duel which is set up with a sweeping 360degree tracking shot has a sense of style and grandeur which the rest of the movie is sorely lacking clearly inspired by someone watching a lot of samurai and Wuxia films. Suddenly we realize that wow this really IS what we were waiting for the whole time just as David Carradine was waiting for a chance to finally show his stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "What made the original Vanishing Point a classic was that everyone was free to read their own meaning into it... or read no meaning at all and just watch the Challenger roar through the desert. What motivates Kowalski? Decipher it from his actions and flashbacks or just ignore the question entirely. The film is still magnificent either way.But the studio thought this uncertainty made it too esoteric back in 1971 so it was cut and given a limited release in the expectation of a quick death. But far from vanishing the original Vanishing Point became recognized as one the GREAT road movies of all time.This remake shows that Hollywood hasn't changed much. They love remaking a classic hopefully guaranteeing an audience but they still think that everything needs to be made both very obvious and very very simple. So they get rid of all the classic elements and turn it into a generic chase movie. They give Kowalski a really REALLY simple obvious reason for his drive making his flashbacks and encounters purely superfluous. And being superfluous they are populated with trite two dimensional caricatures... boring fluff that could be disposed of without diminishing this movie at all slight though it is. This is entirely unlike the original which had interesting unusual people that added to the story and gave context to the nature and character of Kowalski.And that clunky mass market mysticism thrown into the remake? ANY film is better off without that!!!They also decided to make a federal case out of Kowalski's run... literally. It's not enough that state cops will naturally chase people who run from them as in the original and assign a symbolic meaning  or not  to that if you wish. In the remake they pound you again and again with a clumsy bluntobject polemic about the government and militias with the FBI ATF etc ultimately all ganging up on Kowalski. The people who spawned this remake obviously read their own meanings into the original... that's the quality it has that makes it great. But instead of opening up any meanings we might find in their new version for us to discover ourselves they forced on us that single reading of theirs alone. Unfortunately that one narrow focus vastly shrank the appeal of the remake to something less than a vanishing point. The end result wasn't worth the wasting of either the Charger or the Challenger let alone the both of them.".

This is entirely unlike the original which had interesting unusual people that added to the story and gave context to the nature and character of Kowalski.And that clunky mass market mysticism thrown into the remake? ANY film is better off without that!!!They also decided to make a federal case out of Kowalski's run... literally. It's not enough that state cops will naturally chase people who run from them as in the original and assign a symbolic meaning  or not  to that if you wish. In the remake they pound you again and again with a clumsy bluntobject polemic about the government and militias with the FBI ATF etc ultimately all ganging up on Kowalski. The people who spawned this remake obviously read their own meanings into the original... that's the quality it has that makes it great. But instead of opening up any meanings we might find in their new version for us to discover ourselves they forced on us that single reading of theirs alone. Unfortunately that one narrow focus vastly shrank the appeal of the remake to something less than a vanishing point. The end result wasn't worth the wasting of either the Charger or the Challenger let alone the both of them.";

Several people are seen performing the signs of the cross Kowalski's conversion to Catholicism is very prevalent and even the doctor he contacts at the hospital his wife is at is named Nazren. Sounds a lot like Nazarene or Nazareth. So the whole religious side of the film was unnecessary.The FlashbackDream sequences were edited very poorly.

I love car chases in film. Movies like Death Proof and Gone in 60 Seconds have amazing car chases with lots of crashes side by side collisions all the fun stuff. This film has some decent car chase sequences but they are split apart too many times to make way for the drama that it really tarnishes the adrenaline rush they should be evoking. Not only that but they are not spectacular. The first few are a bit of a rush because you he has his mission and he means to fulfill it.

Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times.

The original had Barry Newman who somehow had the unique talent to come across as a guy who'd 'been there and done that'...and survived it all with wit humor and integrity as well as fantastic driving skills.  The bozo in this tepid rehash looks like he'd be out of his weight battling a soggy airmail envelope.  Most of the time while driving he looks as if he's a 12yearold punk out joyriding his older brother's car...and about to lose control of it at that.Even the little technical details were goofy beyond reason.  Jimmy Kowalski managed to buy a police radio scanner and somehow it doesn't need an antenna to receive signals.  Better yet since it's a crystalcontrolled radio 'magic crystals' cut for the correct radio frequencies used by cops in FOUR STATES somehow magically install themselves during the asphalt festivities.  Better yet the radio doesn't even stop scanning when a transmission is received!!!Kowalski was supposed to be a former Army Ranger and at one point he's in uniform in front of a Captain who's dressing him down for his being an 'individual'.  He's wearing a pair of army jumpwings which means he's an Airborne Ranger I guess but no Combat Infantry Badge despite being a decorated combat veteran.  Interesting.In short the numerous flaws of this movie far outweigh its virtues.On the other hand the southwestern U.S. looked as lovely as it does in real life.  Some nice footage of the area's scenic beauty was most welcome.They made the point...several times...during this flick that Kowalski wasn't a hero...just an 'ordinary guy' involved in 'extraordinary events'.  Well the REAL Kowalski Newman in the original was an extraordinary guy performing extraordinary feats.  The big mistake here was trying to give us too much backstory on the mysterious and intrepid Mr. K instead of letting us fill in the details ourselves.  If you want to see a true American classic...a unique snapshot of early 1970s America as it were stay away from this T.V. travesty and watch the original instead.".

The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. Cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original. The major government involvement was farfetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It takes many times longer than that in real life. Car guys notice this stuff. Also the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact they aren't 'car people' is painfully obvious and their passing will not be grieved. The actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.Last but surely not least the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 ??. That is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof?? Hahahaha!! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time watching this one.".

He is on a job several states away when he learns his wife has gone into a dangerous labour and sets off a full speed to get home to his wife. Pulled over early on his journey Kowalski makes a break for it and manages to evade the police across a couple of states. However as talk radio pick up on this outlaw hero his profile rises and he draws the attention of an equally gungho cop and the power of those not bound by state boundaries. Meanwhile Kowalski tries to focus on his wife and future child.There is no doubt that the producers of this remake never expected to win any friends among those who consider the original Vanishing Point to be a classic cult film. I am not one of those people but I can understand why they would hate this film because it loses whatever strange appeal the original had and replaces it with more story but nothing really that good. The casual viewer may appreciate the more meaningful plot here but really it doesn't make it a better film  just a better structured one. With more of a plot the remake could have done something different by making this more of a characterdriven story or at least although clichd made more out of the relationship between Kowalski and his pursuers or even made comments about the little man versus the Man. Instead what it does is produce a simple story where Kowalski meets people along the road in between car chases.If you want an idea of what you're getting into if they had added a few laughs here and there then this could easily have been Smokey  The Bandit 5. The car chases lack any imagination or special effort and although noisy are certainly not anywhere near special enough to justify essentially building a film around them. The whole thing smacks of television movie budgets but I suppose for some people this is enough for them  some people just like to see cars drive fast and crash and before you accuse me of being a snob please remember that I actually bothered to watch this film. The cast don't really help although looking back Mortensen looks like an attraction. Sadly he isn't because he plays the role right down the middle and didn't emotionally engage me or produce anything else of interest. Like the film itself he more or less does what he was asked to do and isn't bad but certainly isn't any good. The same goes for the rest of the cast and the only distraction was the presence of familiar faces like David and Priestly.Overall if you like the original then you will rip at your hair all the way though this because it simply doesn't compare and remember when I say this that I didn't really like the original all that much. If you have never seen the original or even heard of it then you're still not off the hook because this is a simple basic affair that relies on cardboard characters a jointhedots plot and lots of average car chases that are noisy but lack excitement. Not really worth it all round.".

As far as TV movies go this is an OUTSTANDING movie. Viggo Mortensen aptly portrays Kowalski as a deeply concerned husband trying desperately to get home to his ailing wife. The Bad Guys are played to the hilt by veterans Steve Railsback and Keith David who is the epitome of a sneering antagonist. The flaws are few and far between with the most notable maybe being the fact that this movie has commercials in it! But seriously some of the editing is below par and at one point an Extra almost runs right into Viggo Mortensen.  Neither of these affect the viewers pleasure. The cars are still beautiful. The surprise is a 1968 Dodge Charger RT that closely resembles and thus gives a nod to the one from the classic film Bullitt. The 1997 Kowalski's Challenger is identical to the 1971 Kowalski's except that the new Challenger is a 426 Hemi as opposed to a 440 Magnum. When it's all said and done  this is a great movie.".

The 1997 Kowalski's Challenger is identical to the 1971 Kowalski's except that the new Challenger is a 426 Hemi as opposed to a 440 Magnum. When it's all said and done  this is a great movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of Japanese TV dramas andor popular movies the two main actors Hiroshi Abe and Yuko Takeuchi will be instantly recognizable and will make you want to watch this. Which is good because this is an actordriven film. The weak surgerybased thriller plot and the fast pacing by the director don't leave much to be desired. with that said the two main actors working together give this film more than enough reason to watch.The actors don't have much room to stretch out in this film and show their full potential. I'm talking about all the actors. While I can point out the two main ones the rest of the medical crew are all  mostly comedyoriented mind you  very talented. They appear in numerous TV dramas and are good at holding up shows with the dumbest of plots. With Team Batista you have an Alist team of Japanese actors who can all hold their own but are herded together for this commercial film.For the Japanese dramaandmovie uninitiated this film will seem mildy entertaining. It doesn't hold up as a medical drama in any sense as not much attention is paid to the medical stuff. Not that that's a bad thing. Who wants to watch a bloody surgery when it could be a harsh reality for a lot of us in the real world as we get older? There's not much comedy either. It's there but it's tongueincheek humor not bustagut laughing kind.So what's to like about this movie? Even though the actore don't shine much  the script and the direction don't give them much room to flex as I've said before  this is one of those films that make you think Wow! They're working together I want to see their on screen chemistry! Abe Hiroshi really shines in TV dramas. Dragon Zakura comes to mind easily though that's probably something you won't find easily on DVD. No matter. What littls acting he does in this film he really shines. It's just the tip of the iceberg for his real abilities but have no doubt  he's one of the finest actors in Japan period. He can take the lousiest script and make it feasible with his overthetop abilities. He does a fine job in this as the harsh investigator.Yuko Takeuchi is slightly different as her downplayed role can be misunderstood as poor acting. If you can take the time to find the movie 'Heaven's Bookstore' which should be widely available. She plays two roles in that film showing a great range of her skills. When she plays the docile politicallycorrect investigator in this film it will seem very downplayed to one who doesn't know her from other films. But knowing how she plays her roles her passive attitude in Batista really helps Abe Hiroshi shine when he makes his grand entrance.Team Batista is a real treat for Japanese TVCinema regulars just to see the teamup of Hiroshi and Takeuchi surrounded by some great  though limited  performances of some lesserknown TV actors.If you don't know any of the actors pay attention to them and not the story and let that be a teaser to let you seek out their other film and TV performances.This is a solid middleoftheroad mainstream commercial film. I have the Japanese DVD because I love the actors and don't regret picking it up. But I think you really need to see Takeuchi's performance in 'Heaven's Bookstore' to really appreciate Team Batista.This movie while not great on its own is definitely not a waste of time. A mustsee for Japanese entertainment fans!".

Tippi Hedren and Melanie Griffith head a talented and fearless cast who literally throw themselves in the jaws of the beasts over and over again.  The picture has a terrific rhythm and is fun to watch but I couldn't help dwelling upon how dangerous a film it must have been to make. Although there were some poignant and funny moments like the scenes where dauntless John Marshall tries to pull his boat away from the shore but the lion keeps pulling it back or when he hides in a barrel filled with water and the lions begin to drink from it.  The story seems simplistic in structure but is really quite profound in the way Marshall draws sympathy for the animals brilliantly shot by John De Bont.  The closeups of the dying beasts will bring tears to your eyes.  This is must see for anyone who believes that filmmaking is artificial and safe.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know what? Sometimes words really aren't enough to do justice to something.Roar has to be without a doubt the most insanely unsafe cinematic undertaking I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The unbelievably high level of danger is quite frankly there for everyone to see up on the screen as we watch a group of actors interact with over one hundred big cats with no protection whatsoever! It was inspired by the success of the lion drama Born Free 1966. And you might make the observation that there is fifteen years between these two movies and think this strange well that's because this flick took eleven years from start to finish! Its production met with all manner of setbacks such as fire flood and disease each of which put the film's schedule back. But more to the point it was as dangerous to work on as it looks on screen. The opening credits state that no animals were hurt in the making of the film what they could not say with as much confidence was that there were no humans hurt! As it was seventy cast and crew were injured including cinematographer Jan de Bont who was partially scalped Tippi Hedren had her neck bitten Melanie Griffiths almost lost an eye Jerry and John Marshall both required extensive stitches while Noel Marshall was attacked so often it took years for him to recover from his injuries. When you watch Noel in action in this film it is not exactly hard to see why! In fact some of the injuries can be seen happening on screen. It is madness pure and utter madness.But because of this it makes for highly entertaining and bizarre viewing. Unfortunately the public back in 1981 didn't seem to agree and Roar was a box office disaster. To be honest this is not entirely surprising as this feels far more like a cult movie than blockbuster material given its utter strangeness. For a start it doesn't really have a plot and it boils down to a few events that bring our human cast into contact with the big cats. The story barely makes sense if you think about it very long. But who needs a story when you've got this insanity on screen? The madness and health and safety black hole that the events on screen represent mean that a story needs be no more than an afterthought. For what it's worth Noel Marshall  wrote starred directed and financed it and his wife Tippi Hedren who was a wildlife activist who campaigned for the protection of big cats was the big name draw. Hedren of course was previously most wellknown for her starring role in The Birds 1963 where she was famously mauled and scratched by an assortment of flying fiends. Well all I can say is that what she experiences on Roar makes the actions of the birds in Alfred Hitchcock's classic seem positively reticent by comparison.The actors are all splendidly game and deserve huge amounts of credit for their nerve but the real stars of Roar are the big cats and rampaging elephants. This is the ultimate wet dream for any lover of the big cats in particular and we have the very strange scenario of seeing lions cheetahs panthers leopards and tigers interacting with each other. Watching them violently wrestle is a pretty nerve shredding thing except if you are Noel Marshall that is he usually runs in to join them! But on the whole while there are a few continuity errors and the editing is fullon and sporadic this is exciting stuff that could never in a million years be described as boring. It truly defines the term 'one of a kind'. With health and safety legislation what it is now there is no way in hell there will ever be another film like Roar. It's truly unique and I sure lapped it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "It turns out that birds aren't the only critters to have given actress Tippi Hedren a rough time on screen! In Roar 1981 a film that Tippi and her thenhusband Noel Marshallalong with sons John and Jerry and daughter Melanie Griffithstar in Tippi and Noel also wrote produced and directed all manner of wild animals turn up to give the actress some fairly tense moments. In this virtually plot less film a mother and her three kids go to Africa to visit their scientist husbandfather after an absence of three years.

We are told at the picture's beginning that no animals were harmed during its 11year! filming I for one could use a further reassurance about the movie's humans! Siegfried  Roy eat your hearts out no lion tamer act will ever seem impressive after one sees what Noel and family do during the course of this film! How did they ever make this thing? is the question that springs to mind constantly during a viewing of Roar the humananimal interactions shown are like nothing you have ever seen. In that it is a completely sui generis experience and despite a few genuinely scary moments perfectly suitable for watching with the kiddies. Very highly recommended.".

The two were obsessed with lions so they wrote this picture where a family lives with like 50 different big cats mostly lions but also several tigers cheetahs leopards etc. There are also some elephants. The script is nearly nonexistent  I mean how exactly are you going to get 50 giant cats to do what you want? So the idea is just to write a bare sketch of a plot and then throw your cast which mostly consists of Marshall Hedron and their children to the lions like it's ancient Rome or something. Besides Noel Marshall who probably should have been in a mental institution the rest of the family members and other cast look terrified much of the time. At one point one of the Marshall sons has to speak the line I don't have to be in Chicago until next week! A lion jumps up on him halfway through the line and you can hear his voice quiver. Of course Melanie Griffith is one of the kids. Amazingly no human died during the many years of production some lions did though when the ranch was flooded. The film itself is far from great but it's a mustsee.".

The resulting shooting schedule saw over 70 injuries to cast and crew the most infamous of which was the director of photography Jan De Bont getting scalped.The enjoyment factor of this one is of the 'car crash' variety.

Nobody died during ROAR but they came close. There isn't really a script here just characters reacting to the big cats and the only decent bit is the tense midsection in which Hedren and her screen children attempt to evade the cats which are chasing them around the house which is far better than the whole of the tigerinthehouse thriller BURNING BRIGHT.

I don't know what their marriage was like behind closed doors of course but somehow it's a great gift to the Earth that they produced the film ROAR. Why this is can't be easily explained in a review but I can try with this it's about a family that lives with lions and tigers and some elephants and panthers too. Or rather it's about a guy who LOVES these lions and tigers by the way why tigers shouldn't they be in India and oh nevermind and panthers and so on and invites his wife to come live with him along with her and his kids. So here comes Tippi Hedren and actual real life children Melanie Griffith and John and Jerry Marshall's kids and when they arrive Noel is out uh doing stuff out in the plains or jungle and they have to contend with a house full of lions. Oh and these were UNTRAINED LIONS by the way.In a way I should be critical of Roar. Marshall with the exception of one sequence that takes on the qualities of a Night of the Living Dead picture with wild cats in place of the undead doesn't really set up suspense very well. The fascination with watching Roar is basic but constant these are real people many of them likely not exactly used to the fing idea of hanging out with things like lions and tigers being knocked around chased bombarded by their paws and jaws and bodies and that should in all likelihood they couldshould kill these people.There's also the behind the scenes drama that imbues real danger with what's on screen so much right on the cover of the bluray it states that 70 castcrew were harmed and looking up who got what is just staggering to give you an idea of the extent director of photography Jan de Bont got his skull practically knocked off and Melanie Griffith got facial reconstructive surgery though the fact that we didn't notice in those movies she starred in in the 80's shows how good that surgery must have been. If there was a documentary on the making of this film it might make Herzog's Grizzly Man look like kids stuff.Indeed the hero to me of this film is de Bont he gets his camera into places that I just couldn't think would be possible right in the faces of these lions capturing action that seems impossible  certainly with the knowledge that these lions didn't have proper you know TRAINERS. It's just a feeling of constant WTF that goes on with this  likely why it got picked up by Drafthouse Films as Drafthouse CEO Tim League is all about finding the freshest and brightest of those WHAT IS THIS sort of flick they also released Miami Connection some years back  and it's amazing just on that basis alone. It's also just hysterically funny in that way that the movie lacks that awareness of the danger. Or let me rephrase that I think the director knew that there would be danger with these cats but well why carp? The attitude is that Man is the biggest enemy  the closest thing to antagonists are underdeveloped hunters you know they are as they get lines showing that I guess and they have the guns  and that with the exception of one memorablesuperbloody lion named Togar the lions would be just peaceful and lovable creatures if left alone.But the ethos of the filmmakers is constantly at odds with what IS shown on screen. The actors to their credit at least Hedren and Griffith to an extent get this and play this fear well through a long midsection. There's really the feeling like there isn't really any shall we say 'acting' going on here to this end Melanie is named Melanie as are the Marshall sons though why Hedren is a different character name is anyone's guess. I'd be surprised if there even was a solid script  how do you get these lions et al to do the things they do? It's an entirely maddening enterprise to see unfold the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made and may even be borderline? unethical but as it is here you can't look away from the metaphorical trainwreck.".

I was left wondering why they made up a violent storyline instead of just showing the big cats among a family in a peaceful setting. I know a film can't be about the land of the happy people but those cats are scary when they aren't fighting. 14 yearold Melanie Griffith has a scene where the blood has drained from her face and her lips are grey. You can tell that she really was terrified not just acting. It is a movie with sheer terror mixed with enough absurdity to make you laugh in parts. The elephants in the film were my favorite to watch. They were the only elephants I've ever seen that I thought were scary. And by the time the family meets up with them I couldn't help but cheer as one tears their boat out from under them and rips it apart. I wish this had gone the same way as Uly's 'Gods Must Be Crazy' though. That was a far superior film. It's a shame the concept for this was just plain stupid. i still highly recommend watching it. The bonus documentary is also worth seeing. Tippi Hedren's extremely candid comments left me speechless. Nothing gets more real than that.".

Mativo Kyalo MativoRoar an action film about a marauding gang of jungle beasts such as lions tigers jaguars leopards and cougars is one of the worst movies I have ever seen yet like an Ed Wood production not without its amusements. While the animals appear to be real the actors are mostly gradeschool quality. Even the accomplished Tippi Hedren as Madelaine and her daughter Melanie Griffith as Melanie come off as amateurish probably because of the ineptitude of the other actors the script and her husband the writerdirector of Roar Noel Marshall who plays Hank the soulmate of the animals.While the core conflict is about poachers who are centralcasting nasty most of the story involves the loving animals chasing Hank's hapless family until we realize the animals are not going to hurt them in fact just long to hold and be held by the humans. Not so lucky are the poachers whose sneers and overall seedy looks promise retribution. Not so lucky are some real production people such a cinematographer Jan de Bont who needed a scalp reattachment and Melanie Griffith who had facial reconstruction after being mauled.It's a partlytrue story of Marshall's family who lived among 100 beasts on their California estate. Although the pedestrian plot is obvious from the getgo Roar is saved by the sincere intentions of Marshall and Hedren who must have wanted to make some kind of conservation statement with the film.Rereleased from 1981 Roar did show me that tigers love to swim and lions not so much and that anyone with money can make a movie that eventually falls into the hands of discerning unkind critics. Hank running around yelling in order to shepherd the animals is just one of many repeated scenes that lose impact the minute one realizes these are animals trained to love humans. Surprisingly the animals are housetrained or so it seems.The film feels like a Jungle Jack Hanna production spiced up from Born Free and encouraged by former Keystone Cops who also must be animal trainers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roar is a movie that manages to be nervewracking as well as tedious to sit through. Tedious because there's no story to speak of nervewracking because of what the cast and crew reportedly went through to produce it.Roar is about an American named Hank Noel Marshall who has gone to Africa where he can study lions up close  really close. To this end he's constructed a private refuge and house where lions are free to wander about inside and out. A lot of lions. And tigers. And leopards. And cougars. On this particular day Hank is awaiting a visit from his estranged wife Madelaine Tippi Hedren and their grown children who have traveled all the way from the States. But due to a lack of communications Hank spends several hours headed to the airfield while his wife sons and daughter make it to the refuge on their own. Once there wife and kids are intimidated when not downright terrified by their close encounters with Hank's friends until they eventually decide the creatures aren't so bad after all. Dad finally shows up  and that's it really. That's the whole movie aside from a halfhearted subplot involving a couple of villainous big game poachers. You'd think that once the family settles down Roar would start to tell a real story about something more substantial but instead we get a cheerful hopeful song accompanying a montage of the family interacting with the animals and... the movie ends. Just as well. At this point I really didn't want it to keep going.Said to have been a pet project you should forgive the term of Tippi Hedren and her then husband Noel Marshall Roar reportedly cost 17 million much of it their own money and earned back only a fraction of its cost. It's certainly a sincere and heartfelt plea for wildlife conservation. But as I sat there the film's opening disclaimer about how only untrained animals were used kept rattling in my brain.Untrained animals. It was alarming to see all these lovingly filmed scenes of lions playing i.e. fighting with each other. And seeing the actors let themselves be swarmed or pursued by the lions was downright heartpounding. I soon lost track of how many times I silently shouted Are you crazy? Roar was a true family affair with Noel Marshall's reallife sons and Tippi Hedren's reallife daughter Melanie Griffith playing the kids. If I ever get to meet Melanie Griffith who here plays a character named Melanie I must ask her about the scene in which she allowed one of the lions to pin her to the floor facedown.Roar seems to tell you that lions are just a bunch of oversized pussycats with big sharp claws  treat 'em right don't let them sense fear stand up to them when necessary let them lick and paw you to their hearts' content and everything will be just fine the occasional bad scratch notwithstanding. The thing is just about everyone connected with this production was injured by the animals at one point or another including the actors. By unhappy happenstance I saw this film about a month after the death in South Africa of Hollywood visual effects editor Katherine Chappell who'd made the awful mistake of rolling down a car window during a visit to a lion park to take a picture and was attacked and fatally bitten by a lioness.Perhaps instead of making a real movie Hedren and Marshall would have done better to have made a documentary about the wildlife they obviously admire so much. And speaking of documentary if they had done a behindthescenes film about the making of this movie that film could very well have been much more interesting than Roar.By the way Roar was beautifully photographed in Metrocolor. As in MGM. As in... lion? Coincidence? Of course but I couldn't resist.".

However until recently the movie was all but impossible to see. I only just now managed to watch it. So is the movie itself as much of a disaster as its problemfilled production was? Well writerdirector Noel Marshall does manage to make the whole middle section of the movie concerning the visiting family being chased around the compound by wild lions often quite tense and unnerving. Though when you are dealing with wild and unpredictable lions they certainly bring with them some genuine danger and suspense. It's absolutely unbelievable given the actors put shot after shot right next to wild lions that none of the actors were killed  though I do believe the reports that many of the cast and crew got some severe injuries. There are many moments that will have your jaw drop from risky interactions with the lions to Marshall trying to convince the audiences that lions aren't so bad and dangerous after all. Certainly what I have reported so far has some kind of perverse entertainment value but the movie all the same sinks in the end. The main problem with the movie is the script  there's barely any character development or plot here. It doesn't take too long for the movie to become somewhat repetitive and to a degree boring. Despite what I've said I think the movie is still worth a look. As I said in my summary line the movie is one of a kind. Possibly no other movie has put actors in as much risk as this movie and its noble intentions come across as so misguided that you'll wonder what the heck Noel Marshall was thinking. You may not like the movie but you'll certainly remember it for a long time afterwards  that's more you can say for a lot of other movies even some better ones.".

He took his life in his hands making this. It's more than a film. It should be taught in film schools.Try to picturing yourself behind a camera or holding a boom mike on any of the shots and you'll immediately know you are in danger.Nobody else but Noel has balls big enough to tackle an adventure like this.

	schema:reviewBody "Summer again and probably most of you think Flashpoint is the one to watch this season. Maybe but now it sure has its work cut out for it with an amazingly satisfying over the top touching and down right honorable release from dear old Benny Chan.Mr. Chan's New Police Story was an admitted wink at good action things past and Invisible Target bears the same hallmarks of quality only much better implemented.Ostensibly it's a promising flick with a strong cast finally heralding the return of two of this reviewer's fave tough guys enigmatic and oft crazed Shawn Yue and sulking intellectual trouble maker Nicholas Tse.Of course a lot could still go wrong but it dawns on one that Invisible Target is an awesome movie right from the first scene when they proceed to blow things up with extreme prejudice smack in the middle of Hong Kong's Central business area namely Queen's Road.Yes Eye in the Sky had a heist taking place in the same locale but that one was pale and forgettable. Here we have a ballsy depiction of crooks on the loose that brings a tear to the most jaded of eyes as you sit there reminding yourself that this isn't merely how they used to make them here they are making them like that in this day and age.Oh yes just like New Police Story Invisible Target has kick ass villains headed by martial artist Wu Jing whose deranged but respectable streak was previously flexed in SPL. The guy's simply spectacular as a bad guy as is cool dude Andy On. Andy shone in New Police Story alongside Daniel Wu and here he's even better adding a sensible human side to his nefarious character.Indeed the antagonists here are all well done and conspicuously Putonghua speakers. Hmmm. Regardless they help make Invisible Target an excellent release you must not miss out on.As we behold the baddies wreak havoc in jolly HK setting in motion a storyline that has Inspector Tequilainspired Shawn and Nicholas go after them with a vengeance aided by Jaycee Chan who for once is truly impressive and adds much to the story.The three cops engage with the demented robbers across a variety of locations using fists feet guns cars and a variety of other tools. This movie is a field day for makers of breakaway glass everywhere as literally not a single sheet remains intact for more than a second.Invisible Target isn't a dourfaced overly serious affair it gets the balance between crime drama and lunatic fantasy just right as cops and robbers leap huge heights and take more punishment than your average WWII battleship could ever hope to withstand.With good supporting appearances from Sam Lee Lam Suet and even Aaron Kwok this is out and out a fun thrilling and gripping film. It's aggressively cartoonish at times but always professional and never coming across ridiculous. It's also atypically long for its genre or for Hong Kong releases in general coming in at a hefty 130 minutes which still isn't close to enough.In the end good triumphs but there really isn't any evil here as even the vilest of people seen in the story has an explanation for what they do and a tale to tell which is an added bonus not to be overlooked.Plus how can you say no to the first SDU sighting in a long long long time? Yes they return to battle Wu Jing and his crew and of course promptly get their posteriors handed to them.Invisible Target is a frenzied beautiful assemblage of classical themes there's even a British cop in the briefing room like in the good old days gorgeous stunts mindboggling explosions intricate fight scenes and evershattering glass partitions.The machosensitive cast is a perfect fit and we're delighted to see them together and on screen again. In fact aside from giving logic and physical reality as we know it the finger there's nothing wrong with Invisible Target and I for one can't wait to get my hands on the DVD version.Invisible? Anything but! Don't wait for Flashpoint get your summer kicks right here right now.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Invisible Target";
	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing invisible about the target in Benny Chan's latest movie Invisible Target. And in actuality it seems that the constant target for everyone in the movie here be they the bad guys or the good cops are the plenty of glass lying around getting smashed into smithereens by hurled projectiles or more frequently human bodies. See that nice looking glass window? It'll be smashed soon. Or that double panel glass facade? Yup as soon as you notice it the next scene will show it in a million bits on the floor with a writhing body. It could be aptly titled Glass Target.But don't get me wrong. Invisible Target is still enjoyable in that it brings to you the flavour of a typical Hong Kong action movie with Benny Chan at the helm. As we slowly get nauseated by the frequent mole versus mole plots that Hong Kong crime thrillers formula usually adopted no thanks to the success of you know what I thought Invisible Target was reminiscent about an old John Woo movie Hard Boiled except that it's minus the guns and instead you get plenty of fisticuffs. A similarly long drawn out ending was a little too tedious to sit through though it had its fair share of big bangs and segmented action sequences which tried hard to hold your attention. Teahouses remain perfect locales for fights to break out as in Hard Boiled and here it serves as a male bonding moment for our three heroic cops Chan Chun Nicholas Tse Fong Yikwei Shawn Yue and Jaycee Chan's Wai Kingho.But in between the action are the woefully painful monologues that the villain Tien Yeng seng Wu Jing and his merry gang of 7 which includes Andy On as brother Yengyee dish out trying to philosophize their actions as I'm a villain so I kill and about justiceinjustice in the world. Wu Jing again never failed to disappoint as he has this charismatic aura around him which doesn't dissipate when he whups everyone's rear hard! We've seen what he can do in SPL now watch him do that with double the speed and intensity and on thrice the number of victims. If anything Invisible Target is a Wu Jing movie and one in which I'm not surprised if many actually throw their weight of support behind him. It's a movie that the villain outshines the heroes easily.With three distinct cops Invisible Target actually spends a considerable amount of time introducing them one by one. Nicholas' Chan is always brooding and a reckless one in that he's mourning the loss of his fiance. He's out to get Tien because she happened to be collateral damage. Shawn's Fong is arrogant until he's made to eat lead in a scene you have to see to believe by Tien and his bruised ego says he must take the villain down. And Jacycee's Wai is probably the wimpiest of the lot being a bythebooks street cop who's investigating the disappearance of his brother do a double take on that cameo! who might have fallen into Tien's hands. It's no doubt too that all of them are skilled in martial arts and at any time would prefer to holster their weapons.Nicholas and Shawn are no newcomers to action having starred together in recent movies like Dragon Tiger Gate and thank goodness they've ditched their long locks in that movie for contemporary shorter crop here. And while the two of them are relatively old hands in the industry I can't help but wince each time Jaycee is on screen. For starters he's the son of the legendary Jackie Chan and in Invisible Target I can't help picture it's a younger Jackie being beaten  battered and bruised. It didn't help that his character the most naive and innocent of the lot is in total contrast to the classic cop characters his father portrayed and I surely think it was deliberate that he remains the least buff of the lot with many goodytwoshoes scenes occasionally played out for comedy or to reinforce that he's basically a cut above the rest of the good cops in terms of having a good natured character. Characters like his are hard to come by in an age where grittier cinematic cops roam the street.So while big brothers Nicholas and Shawn get some fantastical set action pieces to show off their mettle Jaycee got the shorter end of the stick by being quite a deadweight at times. Oh and what of Elanne Kwong's role? Sadly there isn't too much for a pretty lass to do since her character Leung works in the Police Intelligence department and doesn't get directly involved when the going gets tough. A typical flower vase role unfortunately for a combined screen time of less than 5 minutes.Despite its reliance on hard hitting action dished out by the actors themselves and in all purpose are as realistic as they look with the obvious wire work seen in the trailers drastically reduced a few noticeable continuity errors marred the enjoyment of the movie at times. Invisible Target had all the ingredients for a classic action movie but the run time of more than 2 hours was due to an overindulgence with the slower moments which were fused with a couple of I'm a cop moments and feel good messages rammed down your throat.And what do you know Invisible Target still can't shake off the mole versus mole type plot line unfortunately. If it could have been a little more compact and gotten to the point faster than it did it would have been a tad more enjoyable given the wealth of cameo supporting talent at its disposal like Sam Lee Dog Bite Dog and the evergreen Lam Suet rather than feel the need to tie up all the loose subplots it introduced and exposing some technical loopholes in some action sequences.".

I think this movie is a pretty solid 7 so I'm glad to see that's pretty much where it is. But enough of that onto the movie itself.Released around the same time and probably competing for much of the same audience as the fantastic Donnie Yen movie Flash Point Invisible Target provides some legitimate competition albeit in the same sort of tired fashion of OCB cops doing the wrong things for the right reasons. If you're at all a fan of HK cinema you've no doubt seen this plot done to death but for some reason you're still a sucker for it. The fight scenes are very well done would you expect any less from Jackie Chan's son? the movie seems for the most part well paced and it's got a solid story.Now for the bad news. There's not much mind you but there's some. First of all for me the movie seemed too long for it's own good. Yeah it's only 2 hours but at points it feels stretched and padded for time. Where Flash Point is quite a bit shorter it leaves you wanting a little more whereas Invisible Target makes you feel like you got too much. And the glass oh the glass! Don't get too attached to anything breakable in this movie because it will invariably be punched through kicked through or fallen through. HK glass makers no doubt loved this movie...it's putting their kids through university.All in all I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of contemporary kung fu...just make sure you've got a good chunk of time set aside to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Benny Chan and staff do a mighty fine job with their cops and robbers story Invisible Target. Seven orphans who grew up in battle torn countries take on most of the Hong Kong police force. These orphans mean business as they go about their criminal activities. The movie is almost all kinetic action chases where the actors seem to jump 20 feet down from roof top to roof top as the HK police try to stop the gang from getting the loot they are after. There are dull sectionsespecially when Jaycee Chan is describing his bland philosophy of policing but hey the Chinese censors won't allow movies to be released on the mainland unless they put the police in a good light.In Invisible Target you don't see any police aided by goons hired by real estate developers clubbing farmers whose land was stolen so a new factory can be built enriching the local Communist Party boss who gets an ownership share in the factory. In the Shanxi province that would be the brick factories that used kidnapped children and mentally challenged adults as slave labor. But dealing with life's grim reality in one of the world's great bastions of robber baron capitalism would be too dull for most viewers besides getting the HK filmmaker in big trouble with the People's Public Security Bureau if he or she ever set foot in mainland China.So Benny Chan and company go the crime drama route with shootings car chases and a great explosion sequence at the start that keys in a major plot element. If there is one thing wrong with this movie it is another scene at the start where Jaycee Chan's cop gives a ticket to a guy for parking illegally a big mouth who is out with his young son. When Jackie Chan's cop character in Police Story 2 stopped and ticketed a line of trucks all Nissan trucks then and now a Chan corporate sponsor it showed Chan was no nonsense when it came to his job. Jaycee's parking ticket scene is a crummy way to introduce his character people nowadays don't like cops or anyone else who gives out parking tickets.Invisible Target is a good way to spend a little over two hours watching a very well made if improbable crime story.".

And it is wellsuited for anyone who went through the late 1980s and earlymid 1990s watching Chow Yun Fat movies. There is a lot of action in the movie in the likes of gunfights martial arts and chase scenes.The story is about three very different police officers in the Hong Kong police who are chasing after a group of criminals on a wild chase taking them wide and far around Hong Kong. The officers are heartbroken Detective Chan Chun played by Nicholas Tse who lost his fiance in an explosion during a robbery of an armored truck the arrogant Inspector Carson Fong Yik Wei played by Shawn Yue and freshoutoftheacademy officer Wai King Ho played by Jaycee Chan. Who is the mastermind behind the wellorchestrated robbery and whom can they trust?Invisible Target is driven by a great story that comes off a very plausible and realistic but it is also driven by the nonstop action not to mention the vivid and detailed characters.The people cast for the various roles really did good jobs with their given roles and that really helped the movie well along.Being a fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived there myself I found this movie very enjoyable especially because it does show off a lot of aspects of Hong Kong not just showing the glamour fluorescent lights and the rich and famous.I will say that that music score for the movie wasn't all that impressive and it was not standing out in anyway. It was mostly just faded into the background and hardly noticeable. But towards the end it ticks over and becomes rather irritating.Invisible Target is highly recommendable for people who enjoy Asian movies and action movies in particular. It is a worthy movie in any movie aficionado's DVD collection.".

The story doesn't provide too many surprises that doesn't matter though as it is still a solid story besides it is all about the action.

One would definitely be reminded by its storyline of many crime classics like L.A.Confidential. However the director didn't invest everything in promoting this one as the HK version of L.A. Confidential mainly because the sense of social responsibility motivates the makers to create a story of growing up in good directions instead of dirty cop stories.The movie is very effective in editing the fighting sequences. All the fantastic actions are well paced and deserved a nod only for that. The scenes are very Hollywood but it's acceptable. HK movies need change. After all these years the producers reflected on many mistakes the HK movies have made and all the unsuccessful productions. Although the completely westernized producing pattern may not be accepted the industry has accepted many concepts of Hollywood. You can definitely sense that from Nan Er Ben Se.Back to the most important point of the movie. Nan Er Ben Se doesn't enforce any unbelievable values or character relationships in the entire movie. The good cop is morally sound but physically incompetent to other ones while the dirty cops are tough but without much credits to the society. When they mix together this balance or imbalance has created a sense of social duty. And finally the dirty cops become clean at the cost of the life of the good cop. Fair enough? Not really. But it's the right way to do. It's simple and not enforced.Good information can make a bad movie a good one except that Nan Er Ben Se is not bad at all.".

The story is about an outrageously nice cop played by Jaycee Chen who is now under surveillance because his brother who is also a cop is suspected of turning bad.The fight scenes are pretty brutal and you'd wonder why a nice guy like Jaycee has to be involved in a situation like this but he is. Two other undercover police officers along with him battle for their lives against crooks who are trying to carve a living in society.Jaycee Chen has all the charm and character of both his mother and his father. He has looks that resembles them also but the personality is all his own.This level of brutality is unusual for Benny Chan but along with the story and its characters the movie is highly experimental but it comes together in the end with pretty outrageous fight scenes.Good movie even if you're not a fan of Benny Chan movies.".

	schema:headline " A story you've seen before filled with incredible action you haven't";
	schema:reviewBody "Good but too long story of three different cops coming together to take on a band of really nasty robbers who like to blow things up. One cop wants revenge since his fianc was killed in an earlier robbery another is a hotshot cocky cop and the third is a by the books guy who is looking for his missing brother. They are out for a band of bandits who know they are the bad guys and act accordingly not hesitating to kidnap a bus load of kids or blow up a whole block of buildings to get away.The story is clichd and you can pretty much guess how its going to come out. What is not clich is the action sequences which are truly amazing and are amped up versions of the sort of stuff that Jackie Chan used to do which isn't surprising since director Benny Chan is a close relative I've read his brother and I've read his son I'm not sure which. The action is whats key here and its of the sort that induces you to say Oh wow out loud frequently while you watch it. You'll want to see it for the fight scenes pick one and chases The roof topthat will amaze you didn't leave anyone broken or dead.If there is a flaw its that perhaps its too long at 120 minutes. The story isn't strong enough to support it and the final battle which good becomes almost too much of a good thing. Still this is one to search out if you like big action.".
