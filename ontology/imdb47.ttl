They all admit that the marriage was by no means close to being harmonious  Arnold and Elaine eventually got divorced  but the sons talk of their father while also not being always there for them as being a good man. This faade of respectability masks the fact that Arnold was buying and distributing child pornography. Following a sting operation to confirm this fact the authorities began to investigate Arnold for sexual abuse of the minoraged male students of his computer classes which he held in the basement of the family home. Based on interviews with the students not only was Arnold charged with and ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse of these ...";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1987 Great Neck Long Island a comfortable upper middle class town was rocked when Arnold Friedman a respected high school teacher and his 18year old son Jessie were arrested on charges of molestation rape and sodomy against young boys to whom they taught computer classes in their basement. The documentary Capturing the Friedmans is a dark and disturbing look at the Friedman family Arnold sons David Jessie Seth and their mother Elaine that compels us to sift through the ambiguous evidence and determine for ourselves the question of their guilt or innocence. It's a combination of different versions of different stories says firsttime director Andrew Jarecki who assembled video footage filmed by eldest son David news accounts still photos and his own original material and turned it into one of the most powerful films of the year. The documentary was conceived by Mr. Jarecki after working on a piece about Silly Billy David Friedman the number one birthday clown in New York City. He found David to be a sad clown underneath the happy face and began to probe deeper ultimately discovering the arrest court case and David's obsessive home videos documenting the family's deterioration. The first glimpse we get is a video of the happy family having fun at the beach. We are soon jolted by the revelation that Arnold collects child pornography magazines. After being alerted by the postal authorities the police search his house and find a printout of a list of students he taught computer literacy. Former students are tracked down and interviewed and Arnold and his son Jessie are accused of committing hundreds of acts of sex with their students. Listening to the Police Department one might conclude that they are guilty but as the film progresses doubts are raised about the validity of this conclusion. We are told that there was a complete lack of physical evidence that witnesses may have been hypnotized possibly coerced to give information and that some students denied anything ever took place. I began to question. If there was all of this going on why didn't any child speak up or complain of a stomachache and refuse to go back? Why did they reenroll for the advanced course? Everyone is convincing on camera but we are left scratching our heads wondering what is fantasy and what is truth. Both Arnold and Jessie maintain their innocence although Arnold admits to being a pedophile and molesting two boys at the family's summer home as well as his younger brother Howard. Though Arnold received a life sentence and Jessie was released after serving 13 of his 18year sentence it is equally plausible that they were completely innocent somewhat innocent or completely guilty.While dissecting the inner workings of the family Jarecki looks into the nature of memory to such an extent that Capturing the Friedmans is an assault on our expectation of truth. We expect the case to unfold with a clear identification of the perpetrators and victims that some revelation of intimacy will arise from home videos of the family's unguarded moments but our desires are never fulfilled. We are tantalized still seeking the missing piece to the puzzle. Though we may never know about Arnold's or Jessie's guilt or innocence to me the family was a disaster waiting to happen having bottled up inside of them years of anguish and guilt. At the end I felt tremendous sadness that we do not always have the emotional strength to act in our own best interests to admit our vulnerability to each other or operate in a way that nurtures our capacity to love. For the Friedmans the legacy of this failure is a stigmatized life and painful memories that will remain forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Documentaries that focus on the lives of their subjects are intrinsically voyeuristic.  The documentarian must be objective while often prone to being seductively enmeshed in hisher subjects' views of their lives.Capturing the Friedmans takes this reality to a much deeper and excruciatingly raw level.  Long before Arnold Friedman a deeply respected and retired high school teacher who moved on to teaching computer skills when PCs were rare and one of his son's Jesse became defendants in a widely reported and still remembered pedophile case filming and taping each other was a family staple.  What starts as a not uncommon family avocation turns infinitely darker as several of the family members seem compelled to record disturbing intrafamily encounters that both enthrall and repel.Based on a U.S. Post Office investigation leading to a search of the Friedman's Great Neck N.Y. home it is immediately clear that the pater familias at the least was a dedicated devoted collector of sickening homosexual kiddie porn.  On that charge at the least he was fully eligible for and deserved a long prison sentence.But the initial investigation yielded verbal complaints by boys that they were sexually abused during the computer training sessions in the Friedman home by both Arnold and his son Jesse.  Also living in the house were his wife Elaine and two other boys David and Seth.The police investigation led to myriad charges lodged against both Arnold and Jesse and the legal proceedings drew national media attention which I well remember.No forensic evidence existed to link either Friedman to the crimes let alone establish that they had occurred.  All the evidence which was never tested in court came from kids questioned by police and apparently in many instances the kids were seriously encouraged by outraged parents who themselves had no factual basis on which to proceed.Both Friedmans eventually and separately pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Arnold went to prison and subsequently committed suicide leaving Jesse 250000 in insurance proceeds.  Jesse who maintains his innocence to this day served thirteen years of a six to eighteen year sentence.One son Seth refused to participate in this project.  The other son David is a high society children's birthday party clown in New York City known as Silly Billy.  He worries in the film if his career will be affected.  How could it not be especially as he is the angriest speaker on the screen. And not the most rational either.On many levels this is a deeply disturbing film.  First the family members who cooperated by giving film to the director and allowing very freewheeling interviews reflect the reality of a hopelessly dysfunctional family people who had deep troubles long before the postal police showed up with a search warrant.  Elaine is alternately revealing and guarded but it's clear that her union with the popular Arnold was disturbed emotionally sexually and even in terms of practical matters like childrearing.The family films show the deterioration of the sons' relationship with their mother whom they hotly blame for supposedly not standing behind their father.  She is savagely abused verbally in scene after scene.  Arnold remains a very passive almost detached witness of his family's selfimmolation as he and Jesse await possible trials and almost certain imprisonment.  At one point Arnold appears to be nothing more than an onlooker as his sons tear into his wife who gives back a spirited defense.The most sympathetic character is Arnold's brother who can not recall Arnold's admitted and hardly selfserving statement that he engaged in sex with him when they were little kids.  The brother's anguish about the dissolution of the family is heartfelt and affecting.  He truly is a victim.Beyond all the family sturm und drang is the legal story and it's troubling. This case took place while accustations of child abuse in daycare facilities flew through the headlines.  An expert debunker of many such cases is on screen to offer her views.  She resolves nothing but plants a kernel of doubt as to the state's case.  It is clear however that there were more than a few instances when the rule of law succumbed to a miasmic hysteria.A greater injection of skepticism comes from the backtoback explanations by two involved detectives as to how to question juveniles who might have been victimized by sexual predators.  One has the right answer the other a technique proven to lead to false accusations.What followed the investigation was the loding of so many charges against each defendant as to constitute an extraordinary episode of overcharging. Overcharging  hitting a defendant with every conceivable charge and instance of its commission  is common.  It gives police much credit for clearing cases and prosecutors leverage in getting a plea deal.  In the case of the Friedmans the plethora of charges as opposed to whether each or both committed heinous offenses is simply unbelievable.  As even the prosecutor admits not one child was injured or crying when picked up by parents at the homecomputer school yet some claimed to have been anally sodomized dozens of times.  That's just not possible.What Capturing the Friedmans shows is that when a defendant like Jesse recants after pleading to so many counts it's impossible to ever be sure whether the allocution required at the guilty plea hearing was genuine or as Jesse later claims the inevitable needed confession for the best deal he could get to avoid life in prison.My view as an experienced lawyer is that both were guilty of SOME offenses against young boys.  Jesse's protestations of innocence have the scent of the eternally unrepentant malefactor.  But I can't prove it and neither could the documentarian. Arnold's starting point as a fervid consumer of kiddie porn magazines makes it easier to believe he graduated to the next step.  But again whether a jury could have so concluded beyond a reasonable doubt is something we can never know. David's defense of his dad and brother is so emotional and projected with the weight of many repetitions over the years as to be worthless.We will never know what actually happened.  This glimpse into the lives of an affluent family whose home life was rocky before the accusations is haunting troubling. It demands that we think about what we do in the vital and right but sometimes offkilter attempts to protect the young and punish their violators.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just one of the many outstanding documentaries of 2003 Capturing the Friedmans' is a riveting depressing and ultimately quite frustrating account of a pedophile and the effect he has on his community and family.In 1984 Arnold Friedman a highly respected husband parent and teacher living with his wife and three sons in an affluent suburb of northern Long Island was arrested on more than a hundred charges of child molestation purportedly committed while he and his youngest son Jesse were running a computer class for boys only apparently out of the family's home.  Jesse 18 at the time was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sodomy as well. Capturing the Friedmans' looks back not only at the trial and the circumstances surrounding it but attempts to come to grips with how all of this affected each of the family members and the community at large.  By combining present day interviews featuring several of the family members as well as some of the law enforcement officials involved in the case with glimpses of the family's life caught on film and videotape both before and after the arrest director Andrew Jarecki creates a fascinating view of a family and a community torn asunder by crisis.  We witness how each member of the family reacts to the situation.  The older sons close ranks and remain faithful to their father while the mother attempts to distance herself from the crisis at hand.  We see the denial and the enabling that are common in situations such as this one as well as the way in which deepseated and hitherto hidden feelings of anger and resentment can suddenly break forth and rise to the surface.  Because the Friedmans' sons were obsessed with videotaping the events of their lives the filmmakers had a plethora of highly revealing clips to choose from in weaving their grim but insightful tapestry.Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Capturing the Friedmans' is that even though the filmmakers acknowledge Arnold to be a pedophile they obviously have grave doubts that the crimes for which he and his son were ultimately convicted ever really occurred.  And indeed the scope elaborateness and longevity of the alleged sexual abuse and the lack of prior reporting by any of the children who were the alleged victims do raise some troubling questions of credibility and plausibility in the viewer's mind.  In fact this whole case has eerie and disturbing echoes of the highly publicized McMartin Preschool trial which was happening at roughly the same time.  Even the people the filmmakers interview often contradict one another leaving the audience not knowing who is telling the truth and who is lying  either deliberately or perhaps subconsciously.  It is this air of inconclusiveness that accounts for the viewer's feeling of frustration at the end.  Although the moviemakers' sympathies seem to lie more with the family than with the court we can't help thinking that maybe no one is really telling the whole truth and that perhaps the reality as is so often the case in life lies somewhere in between.If nothing else Capturing the Friedmans' serves as a reminder of just how messy and complicated an issue child molestation can be.  With emotions running so high on both sides of the issue and the consequences so devastating for all the parties involved the film at least shows that convictions in such cases must be pursued with the utmost rationality rigor and care.  Whatever the truth in this case may be the fact remains though that Arnold Friedman's actions led to the disintegration of a family and an undeniable human tragedy.".

The viewer can opine whether the cost to these individuals was appropriate and justified.  And the viewer also can become emotionally invested in whether any redemption or restitution is still in the future for members of this family.Capturing the Friedmans' is a short synthesis of many hours of available documentation from multiple sources reflecting snowballing events that occurred over months and years during the mid to late 1980s in Long Island New York.  In the shadow of the California McMartin preschool' alleged sexual abuse scandal the somewhat unassuming and admired schoolteachermusician Arnold Friedman was caught by postal examiners receiving and sending pedophilia pornography.This aberration evolved during Arnie's childhood was acted on to at least a limited degree twice in adulthood and was a source of guilt and worry to him with respect to his own three sons.  A subsequent zealous investigation resulted in Arnie and youngest son Jesse 18 being accused of sexually abusing many young boys during home computer classes.

Jesse was recently freed after serving 13 years of a 618 year sentence.

It is unforgettable and provokes strong and contradictory opinions an indication of the film's strength and balance and of its construction and editing.   People will even argue passionately about the true' meaning of the title without coming to agreement on which is right.' but what each person focuses on and remembers from the film is as variable as the memories of those involved in the original events!Apparently the first cut of the film was more than 5 hours in length and presumably just a portion of such edited material is included on the companion DVD.  Understandably a limited number of principle parties were interested in participating in this documentary  whether anonymously or identified  with personal and professional credibility at stake and with the cushion of time upon which to reflect and reevaluate.  Middle son Seth Friedman declined involvement.Watching the film is a bit like sitting through an abbreviated version of trials that never occurred with a few needed short breaks thrown in.  But less like a courtroom the film alternately weaves plaintiff and defendant evidence and testimony in a manner that keeps the viewer jury' both alert and interested.  We certainly are influenced by the filmmakers' decisions of what to include in the final edit and the order in which the material is presented just as we would be with courtroom decisions over what evidence and testimony could even be introduced.  We also see background material that we likely would never see in a courtroom setting.I believe that the director pursued this documentary a tangent of his original intended subject matter without prejudice and that he did a good job of presenting a succinct and balanced perspective a Cliff's Notes' version of the story.  Some of the evidence speaks for itself and other things are more ambiguous.  The demeanor and interview presentation of one anonymous alleged victim from whom a significant number of the charges originated after his posthypnotic recollections' was not staged to influence the viewer.   One alleged victim's testimony would require that he had been molested approximately once every thirty minutes during all the time he spent in the Friedman home.In an included Charlie Rose interview the director admits that he felt as though all parties he interviewed had a personal agenda' except perhaps for Jesse himself.  We the viewers don't really know the significance or importance of material not included in the film and extra disk.  Although the director does not admit a personal stand on the total truth' in this story he does express affection for the very imperfect family whom he got to know quite well over the 3year project life.  Auxiliary film footage after a Tribeca NYC premier showing of the film captures questions and discussion from an audience that included many of the principles interviewed in the documentary.  Emotions still run high.  Yours probably will too. I hope the film wins an Oscar.".

The question is whether he was guilty of the crimes charged more than 300 charges of child abuse. Furthermore could his son and assistant Jesse also be guilty? The filmmaker does not force out any answers to that question but the testimonies of his accusers and the incompetent buffoonery of the police involved in the case lead one to conclude that the answer is a resounding No. The crimes are only part of the story. The true story lies in the destruction of the Friedman family. Arnold the eccentric intellectual and apparently loving father turns out to be feeble and a pedohpile a man crippled by guilt. Elaine the loving wife and mother who is frozen out by her family turns out to be a weaker human being than her husband bowing under pressure to administer horrifying advice to her youngest son.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented Capturing the Friedmans out of curiosity. I have read about these child molestation cases made during the eighties in which many innocent people were sent to jail because of the incompetency and lack of experience the cops had in dealing with these cases. The documentary centers around the destruction of a family after Arnold Friedman patriarch and the youngest son Jesse are accused of committing horrible acts against children. Arnold Friedman as it turned out was into kiddie porn and he got busted and then led to a series of accusations made against him by his students. The documentary uses footages filmed by the Friedmans that captured all the events and reactions during the trial. It was like the film Happiness but only real. Watching the film I saw glimpses under the surfaces of these seemingly normal and happy people. The eldest son David is angry and in denial of his father's homosexuality and pedophilia. Elaine Friedman is a woman who had lost all identity of herself and eventually begins to turn on David who still resents his mother to this day Seth the middle son refused to be interviewed for the documentary but he is shown in the features. What is fascinating and even laughable is how the cops who were handling the case were incompetent and they coerced the victims with the exception of one victim whose face and name are anonymous. I for one analyzed and found that while Arnold Friedman may have been the one that was guilty I felt sorry for him and yet angry. He knew that his own guilt and his own perversions were not only convicting him but they were putting his family in danger and they were the ones in trial. I don't think that Jesse Friedman did anything nor was he abused by his father. I am sure that Arnold may have played out his fantasies in his head and possibly with one or two children but I do not think he made any advances against or even harmed his sons. I felt that the real bad guys were the lawyers and the cops who investigated and coerced the testimonies of the children interviewed and the majority of the children who accused Arnold and Jesse Friedman later on recanted their testimonies and said that nothing happened and that they only said what they said to make the interviews stop. Hell a parent even said that a police officer threatened his son into testifying against the Friedmans. If you are a psychology or criminology major than this is a great film to study.It is also sad because we see a family being ripped apart by secrets that are convicting them and putting them before the public. Capturing The Friedmans is a fascinating character study and a devastating one to watch.".

Watching the film I saw glimpses under the surfaces of these seemingly normal and happy people. The eldest son David is angry and in denial of his father's homosexuality and pedophilia. Elaine Friedman is a woman who had lost all identity of herself and eventually begins to turn on David who still resents his mother to this day Seth the middle son refused to be interviewed for the documentary but he is shown in the features. What is fascinating and even laughable is how the cops who were handling the case were incompetent and they coerced the victims with the exception of one victim whose face and name are anonymous. I for one analyzed and found that while Arnold Friedman may have been the one that was guilty I felt sorry for him and yet angry. He knew that his own guilt and his own perversions were not only convicting him but they were putting his family in danger and they were the ones in trial. I don't think that Jesse Friedman did anything nor was he abused by his father. I am sure that Arnold may have played out his fantasies in his head and possibly with one or two children but I do not think he made any advances against or even harmed his sons. I felt that the real bad guys were the lawyers and the cops who investigated and coerced the testimonies of the children interviewed and the majority of the children who accused Arnold and Jesse Friedman later on recanted their testimonies and said that nothing happened and that they only said what they said to make the interviews stop. Hell a parent even said that a police officer threatened his son into testifying against the Friedmans. If you are a psychology or criminology major than this is a great film to study.It is also sad because we see a family being ripped apart by secrets that are convicting them and putting them before the public. Capturing The Friedmans is a fascinating character study and a devastating one to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "You really have to be openminded watching this because it deals with subject matter that's so easy for us to condemn without the will to examine. We have a man Arnold who is accused of child molestation after porn magazines are found in his possession. We have his son Jesse who is accused of being his accessory in the molestations. Jesse says that he was abused by his father at a young age and that he enjoyed the attention. Then Jesse says his lawyer made that up. A man slouched on a couch inarticulate and seemingly placing himself in a sexual position while being interviewed for the film gives testimony against the Friedmans that led to 35 criminal counts. Jesse claims he is innocent. Someone is lying.This is rich complex stuff and the filmmaker doesn't put his own views into the film. He doesn't question the interviewees outright  although he does catch one guy and contrast different remembrances some of which indict the Friedmans others that wave away all accusations. The story gets told to us largely through Arnold's home videos and so we're witness to the family's selfdestruction. This is Shakespeare and there's a shattering moment when Arnold's wife Elaine asks Where did this come from?The film is craftily puttogether  there's a shock left until the end the kind of thing that calls into question what we've just seen  and the filmmaker looks at the situation as a family drama with the backdrop of the trial where understandably furious parents try and attack Arnold You raped my son!. But the film also has this sense of sleaze  or at least the sense of something iffy the sex is inherently dirty  Arnold bought gayrelated magazines and the film has mentions of incest. There's a kind of public hysteria that exists where people throw their hands up into the air when anything deviating from the sexual norm is mentioned and refuse to even listen to an argument that suggests there might not actually be anything wrong. But I think it's important to stand back and analyze the situation before we make our decision about Arnold. He does in fact eventually admit to abusing one child a son of a friend so he is a molester whether or not he abused the children that he taught and that is the subject of the documentary is another matter my own feeling is that the evidence is pretty sketchy and that he was made an example out of for possessing magazines. And he does openly admit to having experimented sexually with his brother  whose admission at the end of the film is revelatory  and his lawyer says that Arnold expressed arousal at one young boy bouncing on his father's lap when the lawyer visited Arnold in jail. It's my belief that there's nothing wrong with Arnold's pedophiliac desire and owning of child pornography. Although obviously the purchasing of pornography fuels the industry which in turn exploits and abuses more children but I'm talking specifically about his mental state. If he didn't act on his desires then he does not deserve to have his life and his family's life torn to shreds. As the film goes on it becomes clear that Arnold this somewhat meek nebbish figure probably isn't the monster he's made out to be. One student made claims against him we learn to get them off my back meaning the investigators. That claim led to 16 criminal counts. Some of the charges against Arnold sound horrific but are pretty unbelievable like the idea he lined the children up naked in a leap frog position and then proceeded to penetrate them one by one. The simple mechanics of malemale intercourse don't make it that easy. The police claimed that Arnold had stacks upon stacks of child or really adolescent teen pornography yet his wife never managed to see them and the photos of the house taken during the investigation show nothing. These are the reasons that prove Arnold's innocence not the comments made like the one by Jesse's friend who says that he couldn't be a violent molester because he was so quiet in everyday life. We all know how wrongheaded that idea is. This is a terrific documentary the investigation and the children's memories all swirling together but what makes it so crushing is how it affects the family. The looks and the words and the shadows of doubt they cast on one another is far worse than any jail sentence. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1984 a seemingly normal middleclass Jewish family is ripped apart by allegations of child abuse.  Arnold Friedman comes to the attention of the authorities when child pornography is found in his post however this soon opens up to dozens of charges that state Arnold and his 18 year old son systematically abused the children in their computer club.  This documentary follows the story using interviews and home movie footage from the time.I came to this film as a fan of documentary features despite not really knowing anything about it the trailers had been careful to be very coy about the nature of the event that ripped the family apart  a coyness that was not carried into the film.  As such I found it very difficult viewing and many others may wish to avoid this as it is not a fun way to spend 90 or so minutes as descriptions are a bit too graphic at times and some may find the allegations upsetting.  The film follows the allegations though to the very end and it is almost consistently engaging  only near the end did I start to feel fatigue given the subject matter this film is heavy going and could have lost some running time. The film is difficult to describe and after seeing it I'm not sure why anyone would really want to see it.It is not as simple as exposing the truth.  If anything the film seems to be pointing out how truth is actually a very easy thing to control  it highlights bad practice by the authorities weaknesses in the testimonies and areas where mistakes or lies had been made.  This makes it more difficult  it basically requires us to care about the injustice done to Arnold but at the same time telling us he is a paedophile.  To many of us this is an abhoration and it is easy to confuse a paedophile with a child abuser however many of the things he confesses to in his past are horrid and it made him very hard to get behind.  This is a big problem as the film is complex both subject wise and morally again making it very hard work.However unpleasant the subject matter the film is worth seeing to see how one family is destroyed by a witchhunt that would happen just the same today as it did then.  As one of the police officers comments  even being accused of this crime basically means that the accused's life is over. The home movie footage is well used and puts us in a situation where we don't have to rely on the interviews to tell us how things went.Overall this is a gripping film but one that deals with a morally complex subject that makes it very hard work to watch and is certainly not going to fill a cinema on a Saturday night!  Several times I thought about leaving the film as I was simply bewildered by it not knowing what it was saying what I was mean to be feeling or even why I had come to see a film about a paedophile who had been accused of multiple counts of child abuse.  For that reason I wondered why this film had proved so popular  who upon hearing the subject matter thinks that this is the film for them? Certainly the handful of people in the cinema with me on the opening weekend seemed to contest to the limited appeal' of this feature.  It is a gripping and interesting film but I have no intention of seeing it again and doubt I could.".

	schema:reviewBody "Capturing the Friedmans is an extraordinary documentary about a family collapsing when the otherwise respectable Arnold Friedman is discovered in possession of childpornography. Subsequently he and his son Jesse are charged with hundreds and hundreds of counts of childmolestation. This is a fascinating tragic and complex subject for a documentary and this film is brilliantly made.It contains no narrative voice nor does is seek to come to any firm conclusions. The story is developed through interviews with the people involved members of the family lawyers police the judge former victims and their families relevant experts... and these various characters often give sharply conflicting versions of events so much so that the viewer is left seriously wondering how much truth there ever was in the charges against Arnold and Jesse. At the very least the police investigation seems to have been conducted with disastrous ineptitude. But if this is a miscarriage of justice it's not a clearcut one Arnold really was a paedophile albeit a very likable one and he may or he may not have abused Jesse as a child subject to whether you believe Jesse or his lawyer. It's the desire to know the truth which we never can and to separate out these tortuous issues which really sucks the viewer in.However what makes Capturing the Friedmans so remarkable and unique is that long before director Andrew Jarecki took an interest in the case David Friedman another of Arnold's sons was already there in the thick of it filming everything. Through his camcorder we intrude on the privacy of a family in crisis for instance we really see the unbearable strain it has to endure as Arnold prepares for his trial. Later we see him bravely enjoying his last night of freedom. The family is blown apart in front of our eyes you won't have seen anything like it.Throughout the film I had the feeling that even without the childabuse charges a film about the Friedmans would still have been worth watching. Certainly they were a interestingly dysfunctional group anyway take the unsatisfactory relationship Elaine Arnold's wife had towards her husband and sons. All the characters are lively and charismatic individuals and in happier circumstances you feel this could have been a funny and charming film this adds to the sense of loss though because this film is neither funny nor charming. Whatever the truth about the allegations of abuse this film is the uncompromising and riveting human story of a family being dragged through a living hell.".

The Meyers Tape  one of only two pieces of direct evidence of heavyhanded police interviewing techniques cited by Friedman his advocates and the Court  is in fact no tape at all.

A sworn affidavit from the therapist who treated former student Computer Student One stated that she never performed hypnosis on the child. A portion of an unedited transcript of the film's interview with Computer Student One contradicted his claim of preoutcry hypnosis and had been edited out. Computer Student One claimed in a 2004 media report that Capturing the Friedmans twisted his account. The filmed allegations of Computer Student One remain the only direct evidence offered by Friedman or his advocates suggesting that hypnosis was used to induce victims to make accusations in this case.I also find it difficult to understand how these basic facts are totally omitted in the documentary such as While maintaining his innocence prior to his eventual guilty plea Friedman commissioned and failed at least two liedetector tests.Overall I found the film especially the narcissism still preserved in Friedmans' character interesting enough to google the case.

	schema:reviewBody "Well if you want to start a fight with your girlfriend. Watch this movie.This is actually a brilliantly told storyand really well don for featuring both sides of the story. The rest of this review could probably be int he philosophy section. Anyhoo.How can a documentary about a crime syndicate be two sided? Well the problem is that is how we approach most documentaries about crime. Usually we already know that Ted Bundy and Charles Manson committed the crimes and we are watching to find out how. So that is how this movie starts. An affluent US suburb on a peninsula of Long Island is rocked when customs officials following the trail of some child pornography magazines find the owner also teaches computer classes to young boys from his home. The officials go door knocking and all of a sudden the suburb is racked when a bunch of little kids start coming forth about the terrible abuse they suffered there. There are some interviews with people family of the abuser and victims too but its hard to like any of them. Somethings not right. But you follow the scenes like any normal documentary. Then there are some inconsistencies. The police say there were piles of pornographic magazines everywhere  but photos THEY took don't show any. The only witnesses who testified about the abuse are pretty screwed up characters but this is a situation that you would expect to leave any one screwed up. But it all starts to unravel as you get further into the case. The son of the abusing computer teacher is now brought into the case some victims claim he is much worse.If this was happening in your neighborhood  wouldn't you do anything to make sure they both spent the rest of their lives in jail. But slowly and cleverlydirector Andrew Jarecki draws your attention to the gaps in the case. And its a tough sell. Child molesters need to go to jail for protection of more kids and to stop others from doing it. But what if the cops were so intent on the idea of child molestation rings that they made sure they found it? What if there one hole in the case was that the son had been there and would bear witness that the father had NOT done any of those things. So they made sure the son was implicated? Is that possible?The real crux of the matter is how the students were repeatedly and forcefully coerced into testifying. They started off not knowing anything about abuse but the cops were intent on getting the information they expected from the kids until some kids just broke down. Did little kids tell the cops what they wanted to hear to get respite? One witness admitted that he didn't remember anything until he was hypnotized and to this day it is still so clear. But hypnotism has been shown to implant suggested memories as easily as uncover real ones. The real bone of contention here is now about how you feel about a potential child molester walking free but about the perversion of the US justice system. And that's why this is so difficult to talk about. If you shout for the side of justice to be served others see you indeed the whole community at the time would view you as a pervert protector... So you can imagine naysayers keep their mouths shut while angry parents and community members rally their hate anger and coerce and bully and ensure the Friedmans go away for a long time.But is it right to punish anyone like that with falsified evidence just in case? If thats' true couldn't it happen to you?The toughest part of this case was the fact that Friedman himself confessed to like young boys and having crossed the line with two young boys in another incident many years ago  but this does not mean that him or his son did these terrible things to those children  but its such a sensitive issue  no one will talk about it. Until this movie. I challenge you to watch this with loved ones and come out agreeing on what actually happened and what should happen....".

Bill Nichols an American historian and theoretician of documentary film says that they do this in three ways. Firstly they offer a depiction of the world as it actually exists or existed in real life. Secondly they stand for or represent the interests of others. Thirdly documentaries represent the world in the same way that a lawyer represents a client. They put forth a case based on facts details and evidence.That according to JeanLuc Godard is all crap. According to Godard when making a documentary you inevitably always end up making fiction. It is impossible for the director to avoid colouring the film with his or her own ideas and impressions. Likewise when you work with fiction it is inevitable that the film becomes part documentary as events and actions from the world find their way into the film. Thus spake Godard.Capturing the Friedmans is a documentary comprised of home video footage taken during a famous child abuse case in the 1980s. It records events dryly but has been edited as a work of fiction would omitting facts and revealing key details at specific points all with the intent of manipulating its audience.The plot Arnold Friedman is a retired Professor who lives in the suburban town of Great Neck with his wife Elaine and 3 boys Seth David Jessie. Arnold orders child pornography from a supplier in Denmark. The FBI intercept his mail and raid his home. They find stacks of child pornography hidden in his basement. Arnold's wife comes home and is shocked to find the police everywhere. It's okay Arnold tells his wife it's just a misunderstanding. A police investigation begins and pretty soon the town is in a state of hysteria. It turns out Arnold teaches an afterschool computer class in his basement. Over 40 children are members including Arnold's youngest son Jesse. The FBI begin to question the student's in Arnold's class. They force testimonies out of the kids and untruthfully paint Arnold as a child molester who sodomised each and every one of them. Arnold is convicted of abusing these children though to this day there is no evidence to suggest that he did.Looking through the extras on the DVD it is clear that the filmmakers had enough material to make a stronger case for Arnold's innocence. The guy was railroaded. He didn't sodomise any of the kids. In the final film however the director chooses to maintain an air of ambiguity.When people get together in large groups facts are always stretched thin between them. Too many minds trying to figure out a common picture results in a distortion. Vague ideas get taken for granted as truth. A kind of herd instinct kicks in where everyone follows everyone else. In Great Neck this occurred. Arnold was a paedophile so suddenly he just HAD to have abused all the children in his class. Pretty soon he was being tried for over 250 cases of abuse and every family in the town was pushing their sons or daughters to confess to being molested. It was insane.But the films works better as an intimate character piece than as a broad portrait of a community. We see up close Arnold's guilt ridden face. We watch as his sons completely in denial protectively stand by his side. And we observe his wife bullied by her boys for siding against their father. It's all very sad.What's even more sad are the details about Arnold's past. As a child Arnold lived with his mother and his brother in a small one room apartment. The family shared a bed and were very intimate. Arnold's mother would bring men over and have sex in front of her sons. When Arnold reached sexual maturity he was apparently confused and dysfunctional. He claims to have experimented sexually on his brother but his brother denies this. There are also rumours that Arnold himself was molested by his father before the divorce of his parents. Without a father figure and with this tortured past both brothers seem to have grown up with a warped sense of sexuality. Arnold is sexually attracted to children while his brother as the documentary reveals at the end is a homosexual.These dysfunctions have now been passed on for a third generation. Arnold admits to molesting Jesse though Jesse like Arnold's brother denies this. Arnold's son David is unmarried and is now a clown working in New York. He performs for children.Nobody knows the causes of paedophilia. It's either due to genetic or psychosocial factors. Some think it's a kind of arrested emotional development. The paedophile is attracted to children because he has never matured psychologically. Others see it as a natural genetic glitch while some regard paedophilia as the result of a need to dominate a sexual partner. Since children are smaller and usually weaker than adults they may be regarded as nonthreatening potential partners. This drive for domination is sometimes thought to explain why most paedophiles are males. But nobody knows. Yet.910 Worth one viewing. Seeing Arnold's children in denial and his wife struggling to cope with truths we sense she always knew is all very heartbreaking. See my review of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised for a list of great documentaries.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not really the type of person to jump to one conclusion based on one piece of information. Therefore I am not going to say whether or not I think Arnold  Jesse Friedman were really guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. However I will say that this movie raises some reasonable doubt of the allegations and gives a more fair shake to the Friedmans than their case ever did.Overall I felt Andrew Jarecki's documentary was pretty balanced but maybe tilting more towards the Friedmans' innocence. This isn't necessarily bad because if there wasn't any question about the crime there simply wouldn't be any documentary. That tilt towards the Friedmans becomes more apparent in Disc 2 of the DVD as you see the support the Friedmans give to this balanced documentary. But like I said this is a more fair assessment than what was achieved during the actual trial so I think the Friedmans welcomed that.As for the content of this documentary it's just striking. To say that this family is a little odd would be an understatement. The home movies they shot during this ordeal is absolutely astonishing. I simply don't know how they could videotape all that was going on during such a tumultuous and devastating time in their lives.

Therefore I am not going to say whether or not I think Arnold  Jesse Friedman were really guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. However I will say that this movie raises some reasonable doubt of the allegations and gives a more fair shake to the Friedmans than their case ever did.Overall I felt Andrew Jarecki's documentary was pretty balanced but maybe tilting more towards the Friedmans' innocence. This isn't necessarily bad because if there wasn't any question about the crime there simply wouldn't be any documentary. That tilt towards the Friedmans becomes more apparent in Disc 2 of the DVD as you see the support the Friedmans give to this balanced documentary. But like I said this is a more fair assessment than what was achieved during the actual trial so I think the Friedmans welcomed that.As for the content of this documentary it's just striking. To say that this family is a little odd would be an understatement. The home movies they shot during this ordeal is absolutely astonishing. I simply don't know how they could videotape all that was going on during such a tumultuous and devastating time in their lives. And Arnold  Jesse's tapes of their last nights before going to prison are almost confounding. I can't imagine being in that position and smiling for the camera. This is just something that you can't see anywhere else. It's truly mindboggling.While this documentary is truly groundbreaking it definitely should not be viewed on a recreational basis.

	schema:reviewBody "A complicated story from the late 1980s when mass hysteria about child abuse was raging throughout the country. In this case the hatred centered on a genuinely twisted if kind of nice quiet guy. Arnold Friedman a nebbish a good teacher a husband and father of three sons in uptrodden Great Neck Long Island answers an ad planted by the sex police on some web site about trading erotic photos of young boys or something. Unknowingly he sends a child porno magazine to the plant and when it is returned to him he accepts it. The police prompted by the postal inspectors obtain a search warrant and find a stash of porno magazines hidden behind the piano in the basement and some child porno games on his computer. It turns out that Arnold not only owns illegal literature but he has been conducting computer classes in his basement for kids between 6 and 12 or something like that. The police run off a list of his students interview all of them and file over a hundred complaints of one or another kind of sexual abuse against him  and against his son Jesse 17 who some of the students claim was involved in the various rapes and games of leapfrog and whatnot.Goodbye Arnold. He's off to prison and ODs on antidepressants. Jesse gets off with less.This family falls apart under the stress. It wasn't exactly stable to begin with. The four males were opposed to the single female Mom. Of course every family has arguments and unspoken alliances but this one is beyond the pale. The kids actually seem to hate her. They're all over her even at the Seder. She fights back well enough but that really doesn't help matters.As far as the story goes it doesn't help matters that everybody seems to lie not only to the camera but to each other. Sometimes one person tells us about a lie that another person told them. I kept waiting for someone to say that someone else lied to them about what another person had said to somebody long ago. And everybody seems so terribly PLAUSIBLE too. Not just the family members but the police and the defense counsel we see interviewed. Jesse's lawyer Polana or something like that tells a thoroughly believable story of how when asked directly if he could admit to sexual abuse in court Jesse with tears rolling down his face looked Palano in the eye and said I can admit it. Jesse equally credible says that the abuse business was Palano's idea entirely and that Palano urged him to admit to it because otherwise Palano would have been allowing his client to lie in court which is some kind of offense against the formal norms subornation of perjury or malfeasance in the first degree or something.It's a confusing story with no closure to it. That's called verisimilitude. You know what should have happened? They should have let Arnold Friedman get that magazine from Denmark then masturbate while looking at his erotic literature or having his private fantasies like 90 percent of the rest of the men on the planet. There is of course the possibility that he molested some young boys in that basement. There's no clear evidence that he did only testimony from some of the kids who were obviously coached by the police. One of them managed to recall the memory of abuse only under hypnosis which has been thoroughly discredited. Of course erotic materials and the defendant's innocence aside there is the question of whether or not Arnold might have slipped a little. He was a confirmed bisexual until at least in his forties and fantasized about young boys. Might he not have bounced some boy on his lap at one time?Who knows? In an unusually candid letter to a journalist Arnold claimed not. I don't know if he did or not. That's known as reasonable doubt.I keep waiting for the next wave of hysteria to take off. We seem to need to organize our hatred and aim it somewhere on a periodic basis. We've demonized smokers marginalizing about one quarter of the population and we get as much pleasure as we can from that. We're beginning to work on fat people now. The signs are all over the place. But is that really enough? You can despise smokers and fat people but you can't become easily enraged and you can't put them away for thirty years. We need something more. Something really evil. Internet predators will provide a suitable target in every way although nobody knows what an internet predator is yet or even if they exist. Well I'll tell you what. If they don't exist let's invent them.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this magnificent documentary is ambiguous enough to suggest the director was getting to know this family or the actual incarceration of Arnold and Jesse Friedman. Andrew Jarecki accomplishes a deeply disturbing portrait of a family in turmoil in the suburbs where everything is supposed to be ideal and things like this never happen.Arnold Friedman was a sick man. He was a homosexual and a pedophile who took refuge in the form of a normal father and husband in Great Neck. In almost all cases such as this the pedophile has been a victim himself at an earlier age. The way he translated his desires was by molesting other children that might be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Arnold must have been sexually abused by the some of the men his mother took to bed and he in turn made his own brother Howard have improper sex with him.In abusing his own son Jesse Arnold proves that his appetite doesn't differentiate between his own flesh and blood from a stranger. Jesse must have loved the attention his father always showed him and went along with the sickening arrangement to keep his father happy. Jesse in turn will probably go into being a pedophile himself because deep inside of him will be a desire to do unto others what was done to him when he couldn't fight back.Elaine the mother is a pathetic figure in this household. She had no clue of what was going on under her roof. She turned perhaps a blind eye toward what her husband was doing under her nose because there must have been indications that Jesse's relationship with his father was not normal. Jesse as a child had such a tender beauty that it's not difficult to see the way he awakened a sickening desire in his own father.As far as the case is concerned it all came about because of the Postal inquiry about the pornography that Arnold bought as a way to satisfy his cravings. Since he was heavily into taking home movies it will surprise no one that he had access to a lot of young boys that were his children's playmates and ultimately his own students of computer science at the very beginning of the technology.All the Friedmans with the exception of Seth who doesn't appear in the documentary express their opinions as commentators they all cooperated willingly or so it seems with the director. We wonder to what extent Elaine keeps denying her knowledge or David for that matter because it's obvious that Jesse is not one to ask because all what he went through is very painful or he would not be objective about this case.Even Howard Arnold's own brother can't understand what was going on in his brother's house. He talks to the camera and seems absolutely normal about telling this story. Toward the end of the documentary his male lover gives his own account and frankly it surprises the viewer because we had no indication at all that Howard was gay and living with in a seeming healthy relationship.The young people that were made to accuse the Friedmans fall under two categories either they were speaking the truth or they were made to confess things that didn't happen to them. There have been a lot of instances with smaller children where the police and criminal investigators have put into their minds things that they think occurred thus making these young ones to react as though it was indeed what they experienced in the hands of pedophiles. Jesse is taken to prison as well as Arnold because they are accused by the former students of having acted improperly.There is a revealing sequence in an interview with the lawyer that defended the Friedmans. It's seen toward the end of the film. In it the lawyer speaks about the time he visited Arnold in prison and how nearby there was a man who was holding a young boy in his lap. As the child was getting restless he kept jumping up and down and that action kept turning Arnold on sexually that he asks the lawyer to move to another area. It is at this point that we get an insight into Arnold's perverse and uncontrollable sick mind and what aroused him.By way of atoning or perhaps in a last effort to ask forgiveness from Jesse Arnold takes a life insurance policy that makes his youngest son the beneficiary but nothing else goes to the family or at least it's never explained in the film.This is one of the most disturbing documentaries that have come out in a long time. Thanks should go to the director Andrew Jarecki for delving into the tragic story of the Friedman family.".

Now I am no film critic nevertheless I have studied documentary film making and as a historian I must warn those that view this film that the documentarian's methodology is a bit sketchy. If you saw the film in the theater then you missed the discussion sessions included in the special features of the DVD.

This is irresponsible on the part of the documentarian  and altogether bad history.Here is the big question  What was it about the case that made Jesse confess and why was his mother pushing it so hard?  The documentarian should have grappled with this.  It would seem to me that a trail would have been in the best favor for Jesse  since a great deal of what he was accused of seems so unrealistic  given the lack of physical evidence.  However there must have been something else something that the prosecution had that would have damaged the defense's case.  This must have motivated Jesse's mother to push for the plea bargain  it must have saved time money and years on Jesse's sentence.

In the footage of the Judge addressing a crowd during the QA at the Great Neck premiere of the video she makes a pretty convincing case that Jesse's new claim to innocence is retrospective back peddling  and don't even get me started about David.So this is just a bit of what I think about Capturing the Friedmans.

	schema:reviewBody "Why can't American directors make movies like this? It's quiet calm small understated beautifully paced read slow and leisurely and thoughtprovoking. The premise of the movie is not whether opposites attract which would be nothing new but whether our preconceptions often keep us closed down to new people and new experiences. With some gentle nudges the characters in this lovely movie take deep breaths look again at people and situations and see what had been missed before. And yes it does make us think about how art enriches us and helps us abandon the old preconceptions. JeanPierre Bacri is as usual splendid making himself mildly repulsive and appealing almost simultaneously though he ends up definitely on the appealing side of the line. How does he do it? And it's a treat to know that the actress playing the younger woman Manie is both the film's director and screenwriter. If you want to know what I mean about pacing just watch the main character Clara as she comes out of cafe after having been stood up for an English lesson. An American director would have cut the scene as she leaves the cafe and bustles across the street in the rain annoyed and wound up tight as a drum. But in this movie the camera follows Clara as she walks in the rain down a long street  the shot just lasts forever and you can see all of Clara's irritation dissipating and turning into loneliness. It's a beautiful shot.".

There seems to be one exception to the rule surprisingly it is the character that for all the movie long has been treated like the most foolish and disgusting Castella. The end does not tell we don't know whether he and his beloved funny and complicated actress will meet. At least he tried to change its life and whilst trying to get closer to her pretending to love art and theater he discovers something deeper and true about himself. In this respect a happy end would have been completely inconsistent with the movie and would not have added anything to the depiction of the characters.

The driver's girl will not come back from America the barmaid and the former policeman are not corageous enough to make the first step. A fine written movie as it is rare to see these days 810.".

What a joy too to realize that the Cesars got it right this time around and handed this entry a bagful.  There is so much to ENJOY here from the circular storyline  Castella owns a factory and employs a chauffeur and a bodyguard.  His wife drags him to the theatre where a neice is appearing in 'Berenice' a French classic in verse.  Castella is a complete philistine from the shoes up and would rather give the play a miss and come back for the curtain.  BUT surprise surprise playing the lead is Clara Davaux a woman he had interviewed as an English teacher and dismissed without a second thought.  Now he sees her in a new light and falls in midlife crisis.  Clara drinks and eats in a bar where Manie works.  Manie deals on the side. Castella drops in for a bite to eat with chauffeur and bodyguard. It seems that the chauffeur has had sex with Manie and does not remember. They resume their relationship whilst Castella now books English lessons from Clara like there's no tomorrow. The chauffeur introduces Manie to the bodyguard and before long he and Manie are in the sack as well. All roads lead back to Castella and after being attacked he winds up in Manie's bathroom for some tlc.  By now he has declared his feelings for Clara and been deepsixed yet when she stars as Hedda Gabler she longs to see him in the audience. The acting is so perfect it makes your teeth ache.  The scene where Castella reads Clara a poem he has written for her is painful to watch because it is written and acted with such honesty.  Both writers  JeanPierre Bacri Castella and Agnes Jaoui Manie who also directed have not flinched from writing scenes in which they come off the worse for wear.  Of course with the track record of Jaoui and Bacri  before this they wrote and starred in On Connait le Chanson and Un air de famille  you expect only the finest and that is what they deliver here even Bacri's character name Castella has overtones of Bob Castella the great pianistcomposer who was for decades the accompanist for Yves Montand.  I can only guess whether any homage was intended but whether or not it is just another bonus to an unforgettable film.  This was Jaoui's debut as director and her second effort working title Comme d'un Image is now in the Cutting Room. She's gonna have a tough time eclipsing this one but if she DOES ... 1010".

Of course with the track record of Jaoui and Bacri  before this they wrote and starred in On Connait le Chanson and Un air de famille  you expect only the finest and that is what they deliver here even Bacri's character name Castella has overtones of Bob Castella the great pianistcomposer who was for decades the accompanist for Yves Montand.  I can only guess whether any homage was intended but whether or not it is just another bonus to an unforgettable film.  This was Jaoui's debut as director and her second effort working title Comme d'un Image is now in the Cutting Room. She's gonna have a tough time eclipsing this one but if she DOES ... 1010";

I should have reserved the definition for her debut The Taste of Others 2000 which was nominated for the Oscar as The Best Foreign Film and for nine Cesars. The film received four Cesars including two for Jaoui for Best film and Best Writing that she shared with her offscreen husband and costarcowriter JeanPierre Bacri. The film deserves them all. It belongs to one of my favorite genres of different kind of comedy subtle depending not on laughing out loud situations and the funny clichs but on the genuineness of the characters and their interactions. It is a character driven film and every character is alive real often weak and even boring but as their stories interweave we began to see how much the movie has to say about many important things and how well it did so. What really attracts me to Agnes Jaoui's film is nonjudgment of the main characters but the interest to and understanding them. This is the French film in the best meaning of the word  not glamorous without expensive set decorations or breathtakingly beautiful lead heroes whose passion would burn the screen no it is quiet ironic elegantly constructed it moves on its own relaxed pace but it never drags and its every word smile look and sound combine in a wonderful watching experience. I also see it as a young writerdirectorstar's comment on the importance of art in our lives and how it can really change a person and their outlook. One more thing I simply admire Jaoui's taste in music. The scores for this film and for Look at Me include the examples of some of the most beautiful classic music ever written.".

I did laugh once very brieflyand a small laugh at that. Now this ISN'T meant as negative criticismthe film's makers were not responsible for how it was mismarketed. The movie still worked for me as a romance but only once I let go of my expectations and forced myself to watch through the first 20 or so minutes which were pretty slow I found the movie interesting and differentsomething that occurs too seldom with films. I wouldn't strongly advise a person to seek out the movie but it's a harmless diversion.The main theme of the movie is mismatched pairs. Mr. Castella is in an unhappy marriage and most of this seems to be because his wife hates peoplemaking herself a lousy partner. The one laugh I had was when this terrible woman's dog bites a passerby. Instead of showing any sympathy she blames the man! Then you find out her dog bites people all the time but it's always the victim's fault! Mr. and Mrs. Castella go to a play and Mrs. Castella talks through much of the play and finds fault with everything. Mr. Castella usually hates the theater but is mesmerized by the performance of one of the actressesthe same lady who is also his English language tutor. Mr. Castella spends much of the movie trying to hang around this actress and her bohemian friendseven though he really has nothing in common with them and appears to have no chance with the lady.There are a couple parallel plots that also have to do with mismatched couples. One is Mrs. Castella who tries for once to reach out to another personin this case her estranged sisterinlaw. Another involves a drugselling lady who works in a bar and is pursued by a conservative man! All these relationships are difficult if not impossible to believe. Some work out some do not. Despite me NOT believing the old axiom that opposites attract the film is clever and well madewith very believable and lowkey acting by people who act like real people. I respect the film a lotthough I didn't find myself thrilled enough to understand how it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar. But what do I know?Incidentally JeanPierre Bacri not only played Mr. Castella but he also wrote the screenplay. I have seen him in several films and like his personaan everyman who is pretty likable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le got des autres or The Taste of Others is a French movie and therefor already not so accessible to many of you. Personally I'm used to subtitles over here we only get to see the movies in the original version so always with subtitles but I know that many of you aren't. But no problem because I guess this is a movie that will only be seen by people that like European movies anyway. Don't expect any Hollywoodian action scenes or big explosions. This is a movie about love appreciating each others opinions...This movie has been built around six characters. Three men and three women who have completely different tastes and opinions are brought together by circumstance. Castella is the owner of a trucking company who is married to a jobless interior decorator only because her taste is awful. When his wife takes him to a play he sees Clara a fortyyearold actress who isn't all too successful in her career. He immediately falls in love with her and tries to find ways to be with her as much as possible. Bruno is Castella's driver and Franck is his temporary bodyguard while he negotiates a contract with Iranians. Trough Bruno Franck meets Manie a barmaid who deals hash. They begin an affair...In my opinion this movie lacked something although I'm not really able to describe what it was. It just never grabbed me by the throat and pulled me completely into its story. Perhaps I'm a bit too young for this movie I'm in my late twenties and therefor maybe not really able to fully understand the world in which these people live midlife crisis so many uncertainties at an age that you can't deal with them anymore.... I don't know what it was it just didn't completely work for me.It's not that I don't like nonAmerican movies because I certainly do. A large part of the movies that I've seen are European and a few come from Asia and SouthAmerica. If I would make a favorite movieslist you might be surprised of how many 'foreign' movies can be found in it. I love the Italian Scandinavian and Spanish movies most but I also enjoyed several Belgian let me be a bit of a good patriot for once German and French movies but I'm afraid this one will not be a part of that list.Anyway as this movie teaches us everybody is entitled to have his own opinion. It's not because I didn't like it that you shouldn't enjoy it. I give it a 5.510 but I could understand it when you say you liked it.".

Lolita is a pudgy young woman with a very low selfesteem even though she's got a beautiful voice and passion for singing who desperately craves her father's attention. Ironically her father one of the most famous writers in France known for his deep observant and subtle novels is an arrogant selfcentered and selfinvolved man who hardly acknowledges Lolita  just to criticize her. He never finds time to listen to the tape Lolita made especially for him in hope to get his interest and approval. The beauty of the script and the movie is that Agnes Jaoui does not use only black or white colors to paint her characters. They turn with their different facets to the viewers and the film itself is a precious gem. The acting is superb by everyone. As a bonus treat we will hear some of the most beautiful music every written including the pieces by Monteverdi and Handel.910".

The film is known as Look at Me in the U.S. It's a reasonable titlejust not the title the Director gave it.The plot concerns a group of educated and successful Parisians whose lives intersect in both Paris and Burgundy. The protagonist is Lolita Cassard played by Marilou Berry. Lolita is a dedicated vocal student whose most serious problem is that her fatherplayed by JeanPierre Bacriis too selfabsorbed to pay much attention to her. tienne Cassard is a noted author and publisher who cares about his work his position of power and to some extent his beautiful trophy wife and their young daughter Lolita's halfsister. Lolita's life is more trouble to him than he cares to accept so he chooses to ignore her or belittle her.Lolita is overweight and acutely conscious of this because she is surrounded by elegant women of all ages who are slender. Lolita blames her problems on her weight andreasonably enoughshe can't bring herself to accept her father's lack of interest let alone his lack of compassion.Into this equation comes Sylvia Millet Lolita's vocal coach. Incredibly directorscreenwriter Jaoui also stars in this pivotal role. It's hard to believe that Jaoui can be both an outstanding director and an experienced star. It's even harder to believe that she can direct herself in such a nuanced and intelligent performance. She must be Wonder Woman!Sylvia has true compassion and affection for Lolita but she's not a saint and is not above using her influence with Lolita to advance her husband's writing career.To my mind Agns Jaoui represents the perfect French film star. She looks talented intelligent and strong and she's also very attractive in a nonconventional way.One reviewer wrote Look at Me is about nothing and everything simultaneously. I disagree. It's not about everything but it is about love friendship ambition hurtfulness and betrayal.Classical music is played and sung throughout the film and it's outstanding. Be prepared to hear songs and arias by Verdi Offenbach Monteverdi and Mozart. Jaoui with her costar Bacri won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes. With great acting direction music and script this movie is not to be missed!".

It's not about everything but it is about love friendship ambition hurtfulness and betrayal.Classical music is played and sung throughout the film and it's outstanding. Be prepared to hear songs and arias by Verdi Offenbach Monteverdi and Mozart. Jaoui with her costar Bacri won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes. With great acting direction music and script this movie is not to be missed!";

Agns Jaoui who cowrote and directed also has a major acting role in this story of several people who buzz around a selfcentered rich and famous writer and publisher.

She is resigned to guys asking her out in order to get the opportunity to pitch projects to her father. Jaoui is the Lolita's voice teacher. She also uses the young women to advance her husband's unsuccessful writing career but later comes to regret her actions. Marilou Berry is fine as Lolita. JeanPierre Bacri gives a human face to the egotistical father. Bacri makes him a man who simply cannot understand how his actions  no matter how cruel  could possibly be taken badly. All of the other performers including Jaoui do outstanding jobs. This is the kind of characterdriven comedy that we hope to get every time we see a new Woody Allen movie. But Woody has disappointed us for so long and so many times that maybe we can now recognize a new talented triplethreat. I am already looking forward to the next Agns Jaoui film.".

She's horrified to let her daughter have ice cream! Horreur! A chubby daughter mais non! It is clear that Etienne couldn't care less for what happens to his older daughter at the moment she most needs him. In a way the image of the title is something this bourgeois man wants to maintain. He is one of the shallowest men in recent French movies! When at the end during Lolita's triumphal recital Etienne runs away from the church where the concert is being held he does the ultimate coward act of his life in a way he betrays the daughter who loves him and is trying to show she is worthy of his love.The film is well written but the problem is that some of the characters appear to be one dimensional people. There is no warmth whatsoever between anyone with the exception of the love that grows between Lolita and Sebastien the young man that loves her in silence.The lovely Marilou Berry makes a fabulous appearance. She is the only one in the film that gets our attention and compassion. Agnes Jaoui is also the other one in the film that elicits our sympathy. Ms. Jaoui's Sylvia shows a complex woman turned off by all the shallowness around her including her own husband Pierre. Jean Pierre Bacri another excellent actor is given the terrible task to portray the horrible Etienne. The rest of the cast is good under Ms. Jaoui's direction.This is a film that feels cold from beginning to end.

	schema:headline " A WellBalanced Comedy of Character and the Occasional Lack Thereof";
	schema:reviewBody "Agnes Jaoui's Look at Me is an almost perfectlypitched comic character study a nimble amusing and thoughtful portrait of flawed people and their unlikely relationships. The principals form their attachments through a combination of accident and ambition Lolita Marilou Berry the daughter of famous writer Etienne Cassard JeanPierre Bacri seeks the aid of an overworked music teacher Sylvia Agnes Jaoui in rehearsing her chorale group for an upcoming performance. Sylvia has no interest in helping Lolita whom she considers a bit of a pest until realizing who Lolita's father is wishing to meet the famous Cassard who might be able to help her strugglingwriter husband Pierre's Laurent Grevill career Sylvia agrees to coach the ensemble. Cassard taken with Sylvia and Pierre helps the fledgling author a rave article appears in a big newspaper and Pierre is on his way to fame and fortune. Things come to a head however during one of those beloved French weekends in the country where would French cinema be without weekends in the country Cassard demonstrates himself to be a jerk by dressingdown his young attractive wife Karine Virginie Desarnauts in front of everyone Lolita realizes that her boyfriend Mathieu Julien Baumgartner is only interested in her because she's the daughter of the famous Cassard Sylvia realizes what a jerk SHE is for trying to use poor Lolita etc. The central character Lolita has the misfortune of being the offspring of a famous man she seems doomed always to exist in his shadow to fail in every effort to gain attention for herself to get someone to look at her. She's overweight and chatters incessantly and puts inordinate pressure on herself but Agnes Jaoui has not conceived her as a poor downtrodden victim instead Jaoui has made her as selfabsorbed as her father as desperate for validation creating a dynamic between them that feels wholly convincing the friction that always exists between family members who are more alike than they would care to admit. The other important relationship is that of Sylvia to Pierre Sylvia seems a woman of integrity despite her rather shameless use of Lolita to gain entre into Cassard's circle but Pierre after years of struggle seems alltoowilling to toss his principles out the window in the name of success he appears on a ridiculous talkshow confetti raining on his head and halfnaked girls grinding in his face Sylvia can only sit on the sofa and stare in astonishment at what her husband has gotten himself into. Jaoui's intent is to delineate these characters precisely to sketch as minutely as possible their motives to map out their interrelationships.

	onyx:emotionText "Agnes Jaoui's Look at Me is an almost perfectlypitched comic character study a nimble amusing and thoughtful portrait of flawed people and their unlikely relationships. The principals form their attachments through a combination of accident and ambition Lolita Marilou Berry the daughter of famous writer Etienne Cassard JeanPierre Bacri seeks the aid of an overworked music teacher Sylvia Agnes Jaoui in rehearsing her chorale group for an upcoming performance. Sylvia has no interest in helping Lolita whom she considers a bit of a pest until realizing who Lolita's father is wishing to meet the famous Cassard who might be able to help her strugglingwriter husband Pierre's Laurent Grevill career Sylvia agrees to coach the ensemble. Cassard taken with Sylvia and Pierre helps the fledgling author a rave article appears in a big newspaper and Pierre is on his way to fame and fortune. Things come to a head however during one of those beloved French weekends in the country where would French cinema be without weekends in the country Cassard demonstrates himself to be a jerk by dressingdown his young attractive wife Karine Virginie Desarnauts in front of everyone Lolita realizes that her boyfriend Mathieu Julien Baumgartner is only interested in her because she's the daughter of the famous Cassard Sylvia realizes what a jerk SHE is for trying to use poor Lolita etc. The central character Lolita has the misfortune of being the offspring of a famous man she seems doomed always to exist in his shadow to fail in every effort to gain attention for herself to get someone to look at her. She's overweight and chatters incessantly and puts inordinate pressure on herself but Agnes Jaoui has not conceived her as a poor downtrodden victim instead Jaoui has made her as selfabsorbed as her father as desperate for validation creating a dynamic between them that feels wholly convincing the friction that always exists between family members who are more alike than they would care to admit. The other important relationship is that of Sylvia to Pierre Sylvia seems a woman of integrity despite her rather shameless use of Lolita to gain entre into Cassard's circle but Pierre after years of struggle seems alltoowilling to toss his principles out the window in the name of success he appears on a ridiculous talkshow confetti raining on his head and halfnaked girls grinding in his face Sylvia can only sit on the sofa and stare in astonishment at what her husband has gotten himself into. Jaoui's intent is to delineate these characters precisely to sketch as minutely as possible their motives to map out their interrelationships. And she achieves this without apparent detriment to the narrative which moves briskly and confidently and with the aid of several excellent performers. Marilou Berry is both sunny and gloomy as Lolita she has her moments of selfdoubt almost of depression but is too fundamentally driven too stubborn to allow her disappointments to stop her. Her father Cassard is played by JeanPierre Bacri as a man who has bought into his own hype so completely that he's forgotten he was ever anyone other than the eminent personage he's become he's forgotten what it was like to be young and insecure like Lolita and behaves thoughtlessly toward her.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remarkable and moving film though due to its complexity it starts slowly. At first we have no idea who all these people are and how they relate to one another. In the beginning of the story they don't is the answer. The film is directed by and stars a highly talented woman Agnes Jaoui and the original screenplay is written by her and JeanPierre Bacri. Bacri has thus helped to create a mercilessly unflattering part for himself which he plays in the film of a man so obsessed with himself and his celebrity that he notices no one least of all his daughter from a previous marriage to a woman he didn't love. This daughter played with enormous sensitivity and courage by Marilou Berry is the central character in the story. She lacks selfconfidence because she has never been given any. She is overweight believes herself to be hopelessly ugly and uninteresting and longs only to be noticed by her father and perhaps even to receive from him the odd crumb of leftover love which might fall from the altar of his narcissism. She never gets it. But the film is not a 'downer'. The girl ironically named Lolita a cruel joke as it turns out has a beautiful singing voice and Agnes Jaoui plays her singing teacher. The film is full of wonderful classical music by Mozart Monteverdi and others and at the latter part of the film important scenes are based round a concert in a small church. There is thus plenty to interest music lovers especially classical singers. This film is a kind of tapestry of interwoven links between people which displays their flaws and their strengths their loves and their hates and reveals their deepest characters. It is a profound psychological study of human relationships and weaknesses. One comes out of it having learned much more about those strange creatures called humans. Only a woman could have made this film with its closely observed sense of the most intimate shades of personal nuances between people. Men are too busy being men to notice such subtleties most of the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Look at Me is a talky but generally interesting French drama about a teenage girl's attempt to earn the love and recognition of her strangely distant father. Lolita is an overweight aspiring singer who has lived in the shadow of her parent a selfabsorbed but successful novelist all her life. Even though Etienne seems to care for his very young second wife and fiveyearold daughter he appears to have little interest in Lolita. Indeed when he isn't completely ignoring her in public or in private he is wounding her with deprecating comments about her talent and weight. In the film's other major plot strand Lolita's voice coach Sylvia is also married to an author Pierre who has been having trouble getting published of late until she uses Lolita to secure him an introduction to the young protg's father.For the most part Look at Me doesn't go for big flashy dramatic scenes but rather tells its story in a lowkeyed way by having its characters interacting in traditionally continental social settings like restaurants taxicabs and vacation homes in the country. Virtually all the characters suffer from some form of unhappiness or depression caused by their inability to create the lives they want. Lolita spends most of her time brooding over the fact that she can't get her father to acknowledge her existence let alone support her in her endeavors. One of Lolita's biggest complaints is that people  and that includes boys  tend to befriend her solely as a means of getting to her famous father. Even her music teacher uses her for that purpose though this is one time when Lolita seems unaware of it. So paranoid has Lolita become on this score that she even keeps at arm's length a young man who is obviously genuinely interested in having a relationship with her. The two authors to varying degrees have feelings of inadequacy and frustration brought on by either selfdoubt about their talent or the fear that have begun to dry up as a writer.For the most part this is a compelling tale about people who feed off one another and compromise their values to get what they want. Etienne is in many ways the most interesting character because he seems genuinely unaware of the callous way he treats others but he is also the most frustrating in that some of his most boorish actions in regards to his daughter don't always ring totally true. For instance it is highly unlikely that even he would get up and leave in the middle of his daughter's concert performance to take a stroll outside then completely ignore her at a party he throws for her afterwards. Too often we feel as if he is being mean and thoughtless more as a plot device than as a genuine reflection of his character. The film's other intriguing secondary character is Sylvia the music teacher who really seems to be the voice of conscience in the story.Despite that flaw Look at Me succeeds more often than not at weaving a complex tapestry out of a variety of interesting and colorful characters. To that end the film features fine ensemble work by Marilou Berry JeanPierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui who also cowrote and directed the movie.".

What more can I tell you writing 910 directing 910 ensemble playing 910. Don't say I didn't warn you.";

After two unbelievably long tortuous hours I discovered this movie is two hours too long. It was as if the reviewers were praising the previous works of the directors and writers. If comparisons were made to Woody Allen's movies they are right. It resembles his last four movies all of which bombed and as the French say was chiant!

Their new project is set in the civilized ? worlds of classical music and literature. The protagonist firsttime actress Marilou Berry is an enormously talented if somewhat overweight young woman whose selfdoubt and low selfesteem impede her desired professional singing career. She craves validation from her selfabsorbed father a celebrated novelist JeanPierre Bacri who has no time for anybody. The young woman cynically feels that any kindness to her is done only to gain access to her famous father which in most instances is true. Director Jaoui plays the part of a voice teacher who shows a heightened interest in the young woman when she realizes whose daughter she is. The music teacher's husband is a struggling writer who would benefit enormously from an association with the successful author. Superbly written astutely observed with fine nuanced performances from the cast this is a film that offers many pleasures not least the exquisite music of Monteverdi.".

Virginie Desarnauts is also excellent as Lolita's young stepmother and there's also a charming turn by Keine Bouhiza as Lolita's suitor. The greatest strength of the film however is its screenplay deservingly awarded in Cannes. Jaoui and Bacri seem to have a gift for writing conversations and they show to be at her best in Come une image.This film will probably suffer from comparisons with Le gout des autres the previous film by Agns Jaoui and its superior. Which incidentally does not mean that this film is not really good. In fact it has so many brilliant moments especially towards the end of the film that makes up for the few clichs and slight flaws in pacing. Overall rating 810".

Among those sucked into the vortex created by this man are Lolita a daughter who wants to be a classical music singer Karine a trophy wife Sylvia Lolita's voice instructor Pierre Sylvia's novelist husband and Sbastian Lolita's boyfriend.Those looking for a heavy plot or action should skip this  we drop in on the characters get to know them and then leave them pretty much as they were at the beginning. Each of the main characters gets a good share of screen time.Cassard is a real piece of work. He purposely hurls insults frequently at Lolita. Lolita has the heavyset build of an opera singer and when she complains that Cassard is hurting her with a hug he says that it wouldn't hurt if she had muscle instead of fat. Being so selfobsessed Cassard wounds those around him most by ignoring them. Lolita is driven to distraction by trying to display her vocal talents to her dad but when he finally attends a concert where she performs he walks out after a couple of minutes since he has had an idea that he needs to capture. You wonder why people don't just tell him to stuff it but his fame gives him privileges and power. And when someone does confront him he can quickly lash back. When Sylvia points out that It was her Lolita's night. You said nothing to which Cassard responds in the presence of Pierre Mind your business. This lady's teaching me manners. It's true she is a guilt pusher. This last comment causes much grief between Sylvia and Pierre. Agns Jaoui directorscreenwriteractress has a wonderfully expressive face. As she watches Lolita's performance her face in profile shows us exactly what she is feeling. I really liked the way that this movie doesn't rush things. For example we get a long tracking shot of Lolita just walking along the street and are able to absorb her mood. I think only a confident director would include such a scene.Music plays a pivotal role both as background and as an integral part of the story. In addition to some original music including some salsa we are treated to Schubert Monteverdi Verdi Handel Mozart and Beethoven. I was particularly pleased that we got more than a small taste of Lolita's final performance which was enjoyable in its own right. There is some sharp and pointed dialog here but it escapes me how this movie is considered to be in good part a comedy. What humor there is tends toward the sardonic. The people seem real and the themes are serious. There are a lot of subtle undercurrents in the relationships and I found a second viewing to be of value.The DVD making of extra is worth seeing. It shows how much effort goes into making such a movie and how surprising it is that such a collaborative endeavor ever works.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just came back from seeing Tosca and I am completely enchanted. Director Jacquot manages to puzzle perplex and tease us and all the while he presents the opera in a version that will be a tough act to follow. As for the puzzlement perplexing and teasing Jacquot cuts in between the studio recording in black and white and makes no real attempt to conceal the fact that the grandiose opera scenes are play back on two occasions he permits the singers to speak their lines above their own recorded singing.The most amazing trick however is the opening of act III Mario Cavaradossi imprisoned in Castel San Angelo recollects former scenes with Tosca  backwards! They walk backwards kiss backwards pray backwards. It has a humorous effect as if the director wanted to avoid any emotional absorption in the story  and the story is in fact very touching at this point. And then he also completely abandons any cinematic rhythm visually. In act I during the duet between Tosca and Scarpia the cameraman has been sent off to lunch presumably for the camera remains absolutely dead still  this however is juxtaposed with a quadruple arc is that the right word? in Scarpia's great aria. The camera swirls in circles around the actor Ruggiero as we know it from the opening of Forman's Hair  only Tosca has FOUR full circles if I counted right. In this aria we also see a very daring interpretation as Scarpia Ruggiero thinking of Tosca has a nice little transport of a very sexual nature. It is a closeup cutting the singer off above the waistline thank God  but Ruggiero has some very convincing and suggestive acting in this scene. But the real scoop is the very end and this is where the spoiler comes!. When the entire drama is played out when Scarpia has received The kiss of Tosca  a knife in the belly  and when Cavaradossi has been shot and Tosca has taken a giant leap into the Tiber Jacquot takes us back to the black and white studio recording. We see the lovely diva following the last violent chords of the score the music stops  and then Angela Gheorghiu makes a gesture as if to say Well that's that. We pulled it off. This must be seen it can't be explained properly but it puts the whole grand opera into perspective in quite a wonderful way. And Gheorghiu by the way must be the most lovely Tosca imaginable. This film is must for all opera freaks and everybody else may begin freaking here.".

	onyx:emotionText "I just came back from seeing Tosca and I am completely enchanted. Director Jacquot manages to puzzle perplex and tease us and all the while he presents the opera in a version that will be a tough act to follow. As for the puzzlement perplexing and teasing Jacquot cuts in between the studio recording in black and white and makes no real attempt to conceal the fact that the grandiose opera scenes are play back on two occasions he permits the singers to speak their lines above their own recorded singing.The most amazing trick however is the opening of act III Mario Cavaradossi imprisoned in Castel San Angelo recollects former scenes with Tosca  backwards! They walk backwards kiss backwards pray backwards. It has a humorous effect as if the director wanted to avoid any emotional absorption in the story  and the story is in fact very touching at this point. And then he also completely abandons any cinematic rhythm visually. In act I during the duet between Tosca and Scarpia the cameraman has been sent off to lunch presumably for the camera remains absolutely dead still  this however is juxtaposed with a quadruple arc is that the right word? in Scarpia's great aria. The camera swirls in circles around the actor Ruggiero as we know it from the opening of Forman's Hair  only Tosca has FOUR full circles if I counted right. In this aria we also see a very daring interpretation as Scarpia Ruggiero thinking of Tosca has a nice little transport of a very sexual nature. It is a closeup cutting the singer off above the waistline thank God  but Ruggiero has some very convincing and suggestive acting in this scene. But the real scoop is the very end and this is where the spoiler comes!. When the entire drama is played out when Scarpia has received The kiss of Tosca  a knife in the belly  and when Cavaradossi has been shot and Tosca has taken a giant leap into the Tiber Jacquot takes us back to the black and white studio recording. We see the lovely diva following the last violent chords of the score the music stops  and then Angela Gheorghiu makes a gesture as if to say Well that's that. We pulled it off.

	schema:reviewBody "My initial reaction to this movie was negative. It took me a while to get used to the technique of showing the singers musicians and the conductor and then rapidly splicing footage of the singers performing in costume on the set of the opera. However I think this experiment gradually begins to weave a spell over the audience consider what Lawrence Olivier did with his film of HENRY V. The artificial world of theatre and opera explodes into a reality filled with excitement and vitality.The orchestra bursts into a throbbing overture that hints at the turmoil that bubbles at the tragic heart of Puccini's  opera. Antonio Pappano conducts like a man possessed he fights and wrestles the score to fiery heights and the music rises with a sweaty passion.Roberto Alagna sings and acts the role of Cavaradossi with enough conviction although Placido Domingo did an electrifying job for Giofranco De Bosio in the 1976 movie. Alagna may not have the acting ability of Domingo but he certainly more than makes up for it in the singing department. His natural charisma also shines through in the closeups that are used frequently to heighten psychological tension.Ruggero Raimondi plays the part of Scarpia with venom and overtones of violent malice. At times he almost resembles a rapist stalking his next victim. There are shades of his magnificent portrayal of the decadent Don Giovanni remember the Joseph Losey film? for example when he's at the dinner table we see Scarpia admiring his own smirking reflection in the glinting knife. His aria in this scene is about how he devours women until his appetite is sated. He proudly boasts about his varied taste in differnt kinds of females and the whole aria is very sinister and disturbing. His acting is splendid and his singing voice is still virile and strong.Tosca sung and acted by the earthy Angela Gheorghiu is first seen as almost bloodless. She is wearing a pale yellow dress and there's no trace of makeup on her anxious face. We can see insecurity and jealousy lined in her face and eyes. She peeks around like a hunted animal which has lost the will to live. This is the way Puccini wrote the part for his heroine and this superb singer delivers a haunting performance. In the latter sections of the opera we see her in a bloodred dress that swirls behind her like a crimson river. Now her eyes are raging black coals that glint with fire and her ruby lips shine with lust. Her cheeks are creamy and flushed and her heaving breast indicates the trembling fear that courses through her lascivious body. Her scene with Scarpia is erotic the fire leaps and strange shadows dance around the claustrophobic room. This whole scene is extremely erotic there is a definite sexual spark between the snakelike Scarpia and the radiant sexiness of Tosca. Her voice is tinged with a smouldering huskiness.The climax on the top of the gothic castle is beautifully lit Tosca's red dress still glows and her face has a hue of cold blue the lighting in this section would please fans who enjoy the works of Mario Bava or Dario Argento. This time we see the tragic frailty in Tosca's eyes there are hints of suspicion and fear and the closeups once again are very effective in conveying her emotional state.This film is a very good example of opera being translated over into Art House Cinemas and the experiment of intercutting footage of singers in the theatre and the film sets is byandlarge successful and will bear repeated viewings. One hopes more adaptations will follow and thus allow opera the freedom to reach new venues.Seek out this pulsating film and allow your emotions to run riot with passion and excitement.".

It is no longer enough to make an Opera Film the sort popular in Italy in the 40s and 50s when opera still enjoyed a wide audience. It is now necessary to make an Opera Film For People Who Hate Opera one with enough populist appeal to win over millions of filmgoers who are either indifferent to opera or can't bear it.It's a wellnigh impossible trick and only a handful of directors have come anywhere close to pulling it off. Still I defy even the most tonedeaf of operaphobes to watch Powell and Pressburger's 1951 Tales of Hoffmann or Losey's 1979 Don Giovanni or Zeffirelli's 1982 La Traviata and not adore every moment! As for Benoit Jacquot's new film of Tosca...well he seems to have gone one better than all the others and turned out the firstever Opera Movie By A Director Who Obviously Hates Opera So Why Did He Bother In The First Place?With its thunderous bloodandsex soaked libretto and romantically hysterical score Giacomo Puccini's Tosca is perhaps the greatest melodrama  spoken or sung  ever to hit the stage. As TS Eliot once wrote of a novel by Wilkie Collins It has no merit beyond melodrama but it has every merit that melodrama can have. No piece of musical theatre on earth is less suited to the odious codBrechtian 'distancing devices' that Jacquot employs in his deluded attempts to seem avantgarde. If you cannot wallow in the heartthumpingly overwrought melodramatics of Tosca you should not go near them at all.So what can be the logic of splicing in blackandwhite footage of the highpriced cast as they record the vocal score? Or those awful jiggly grainy shots of those monuments in Rome where the action takes place? Or forcing Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorgiu  the reigning Golden Couple on the international opera scene  to speak the dialogue 'live' while singing it on the soundtrack? This sort of hollow trickery can only outrage opera fans while leaving the vast majority of the public as bewildered as they ever were.So Jacquot is both a Philistine and a moron and his film should be an outandout disaster BUT...lacking even the courage of his own puny convictions most of the time he forgets to be PostModern and just gives us the melodrama straight. The result is nothing short of miraculous. As Floria Tosca an opera diva struggling to save her lover from the clutches of an evil Chief of Police Angela Gheorghiu is  vocally and dramatically  a rival to our memory of Maria Callas. With her torrent of raven hair triumphal cheekbones and sulphurous eyes her screen presence is an echo of Sigourney Weaver.A pity that her most erotic love interest is not the romantic and revolutionary painter Mario Cavaradossi. Roberto Alagna aka Mr. Gheorghiu lags far behind his wife in vocal skills and shows not the faintest sign of talent as an actor. Rather it is the evil police chief Baron Scarpia who deserves to win her heart. Not only a veteran of opera films  including Losey's sumptuous Don Giovanni  Ruggero Raimondi has also acted 'straight' roles notably as a dotty French nobleman obsessed with immortality in the 1983 Alain Resnais film La Vie Est Un Roman. With his haggard eyes and glittering black greatcoat Raimondi has an almost vampiric quality. Perhaps the sexiest most seductive screen villain since Basil Rathbone.And so  irony of ironies  this Opera Film By A Director Who Hates Opera turns out to be a nearclassic a close rival to Zeffirelli or Losey or PowellPressburger. Let's just hope that nobody ever gives Jacquot another opera to direct. Next time he might really wreck it! Let's hope on her next project that Angela Gheorghiu wields her everincreasing clout and hires a filmmaker who actually knows what opera is. Isn't Gerard Corbiau in need of a job? Now that I'd love to see.David Melville".

Roberto Alagna's Cavaradossi was a bit wet and pathetic but that could just have been the part. However Ruggero Raimondi was a truly frightening Scarpia and even when filmed in the recording studio you can see the fire and anger which in my opinion is a such a key part of Scarpia's personality. I thought the direction was simple but quite effective at times. I really disliked the outside footage because i felt it wasn't really necessary although it could be a device used to show the seedy side of the situation the characters are in. I found that the closeups gave you the opportunity to see deep into the personalities of the characters in a way that you can't in an opera house due to the distance between stage and audience. To compare it with another I have seen parts of Franco Zeffirelli's Tosca staged at ROH in the 60s starring Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi and i can say without doubt that although Callas may have been an exceptional performer her voice is nothing compared with Angela Gheorghiuso please please watch it to have the opportunity to hear the most beautiful voice in the world!".

For me Tosca is such a great opera that I couldn't imagine how technical trickery could do anything but spoil it.  However director Jacquot has actually enhanced it at times although the grainy pictures of outside locations didn't work for me.The film begins with black and white film of the singers recording the sound track and occasionally this device is used during the opera itself but I found it interesting and it didn't break the spell of the story in any way. In fact when Ruggero Raimondi stood up to record his entrance he looked just as frightening as he did when acting!Allowing the singers to either talk or stand silently thinking while their arias or recitatives were played was a great idea.  For me it worked best when Raimondi's Baron Scarpia was watching Angela Gheorghin's Tosca as he tried to poison her mind with jealousy so that she would lead him to her lover Mario Cavaradossi.  This could be because out of the three leads it's Raimondi who has the best screen presence.  He not only looks right he can act as well and although Angela Gheorghin looked beautiful I was disappointed in her acting skills.  For me her Tosca lacked passion and she seemed more interested in looking lovely than reacting appropriately.Her scenes with Scarpia were her best scenes mainly because Roberto Alagna failed to generate any hint of passion or sexuality which was a huge disappointment.  Even his singing sounded as though he was in an echo chamber which made me suspect that he was underpowered.  Maybe it was a technical fault but it was irritating.It was an involving film and the sumptious costumes and sheer brilliance of Raimondi's singing and acting meant that it had moments of genius. Overall it was a great film for me and one that I can't wait to see again.  The golden couple of Gheorghin and Alagna didn't quite live up to their reputations but Ruggero Raimondi certainly made up for it.  Even if you're not an opera lover it's worth watching this film for his performance alone and if you are an opera lover then see it as soon as you can for the whole production.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tosca is more involving in this film version than in most stage performances.  That is astounding. Usually closeups of opera performances spoil the effect of the music. The acting and looks of most singers detract from their musical performance. Also melodrama is out and out funny when it's filmed realistically. But in this film the three leads are fine actors and look their parts. Gheorghiu is physically a magnificent diva. It helps that the lipsynching stops at times. For example Tosca and Caravadossi embrace and kiss while the singing continues as if in their thoughts. They look right and it sounds right. Black and white video of the taping is occasionally intercut with the full color performance. This is jarring but adds to the magic of the final performance which seemss effortless.  Instead of filming the opera realistically the scenes are made theatrical and larger than life  by using impressionistic backgrounds. It feels like a stage performance  only you can see everything perfectly. Wonderful! The film makes me want to hear the opera again. The sound system at the movie theater was no substitute for the real thing or for a CD. But I know that the images from this movie will flash up next time I listen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I adore opera and classical music and Tosca has been a favourite of mine since forever. So I was interested in seeing this version despite hearing some very mixed reviews on it. And while it wasn't perfect it was interesting and fairly impressive. Is it the best Tosca I've seen performed on stage or on location? No not for me. I do prefer the 1992 and 1976 versions both were wonderful in my view.Where the 2001 version scores is in its filming which is really quite unique. There are a lot of interesting camera angles especially in the climax and the lighting just adds to the atmosphere. The costumes are just beautiful especially Tosca's dress in Act 3 and the sets and locations are superb. And I was fine with the black and white this is better when it is in colour but it was a point of interest in a way. The direction is credible enough while the conducting and the orchestra are top notch.I can't mention Tosca without mentioning the music. As fond as I am of La Boheme Madama Butterfly Manon Lescaut and Turandot I personally think Tosca is Puccini's magnum opus. For me it is certainly his darkest and most complex and Scarpia if done right is likely to live in the mind for a long while after. I cannot watch any filmed version of Tosca without watching the te deum over and over it is such a beautiful stirring and powerful piece of music that does move the story forward. I can also watch the whole of Act 2 again and again so much happens musically and storywise and it is just amazing for the ears and the senses.The story is both dark and tragic yet always compelling. The three main characters of the opera are to me among the best in opera history. There's the passionate and beautiful Floria Tosca the poignant Caveradossi and then the truly snakelike and machiavellian Baron Scarpia which is a very difficult role and perhaps the most complex of any villain in a Puccini opera and all add a lot to the opera from its opening chords to the evocative climax.The performances are fine in general. Spoletta and the Sacristan are good and the chorus are very wellblended. Angela Gheorghiu is overall wonderful as Tosca her acting mayn't be the best of the Toscas I've seen but she does have her moments such as in Scarpia's death scene but when it comes to the look and the voice she is far more impressive. She looks very passionate and beautiful and she does show good chemistry with Alagna and Raimondi while vocally she gives one of her better performances.Not to say that he was bad but Roberto Alagna was one of my two or three disappointments with this version. He looks dashing and he does sing beautifully particularly in Recondita Armonia though I agree the ambiance doesn't really do him much service but his acting does come across as rather cold. Consequently Caveradossi doesn't quite come across as poignant enough which was a little disappointing.I totally concur though about those who praise Ruggero Raimondi. He is absolutely magnificent as Scarpia. He has a great quite powerful voice and acting wise he is by far the best of the principles. I did notice some traits he put here were similar to those he used in Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni one minute Scarpia is quite charming next he is really quite menacing and I admit I got goosebumps just watching him especially in the te deum and when he tells Tosca to give herself to him. In fact Raimondi is up there as one of my favourite Scarpias up there with Tito Gobbi and Sherrill Milnesdifferent but I am quite fond of him.Other than some of the ambiance and Alagna's acting my only other disappointment was the lipsynching which was rather inconsistent. Overall though it was interesting and I quite liked it. 7.510 Bethany Cox".

The film that has been tagged onto this recording is quite a low budget affair that is very obviously studiobound. The few external shots are in grainy sepia.Angela Gheorghiu's Tosca ranks amongst the greatest interpretations of this role. Her voice has a soothing timbre it is beautifully controlled and it sounds effortless. It also looks effortless but that of course is because she is miming to her studio recording. The most convincing scenes are the sizzling love duets in the first and third acts with Roberto Alagna as Cavaradossi. They really do make a sexy couple. Alagna's light tenor is quite successful in this role but he is illserved by the artificial ambiance for his big arias. Both Recondite Armonia set in a church and E Lucevan Le Stella set on the castle ramparts have too much added echo making him sound like a crossover artist.The best acting performance comes from Ruggero Raimondi as a very understated villain Scarpia. He sings with quiet menace which unfortunately makes it all too obvious that he is miming. The triumphant procession into church is omitted in this film presumably for reasons of economy. Scarpia's anguished cry of Tosca you make me forget God is in this production just a whimper.A special word for Ms Gheorghiu's stunt double he looks very fetching in his red robe as he leaps over the ramparts.".

	schema:headline " An opera movie that can draw in the nonfan";
	schema:reviewBody "I was intrigued by the very passionate comments I'd read about this movie and was curious to see it. I'm not an opera fan but have a special interest in Tosca and remember seeing a PBS performance of it twenty or twentyfive years ago. I found this version unexpectedly entertaining the things that might repel typical opera fans seemed to work well for me maybe because I could link them to other film performances I'd seen and made this film not so purely opera. The outdoor shots always with a rather shaky moving camera reminded me of crime reconstructions I'd seen on TV and also of the dreamlike atmosphere in An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. They weren't long enough to annoy and gave a sense of urgency to the film. I didn't even mind the lyrics spoken by the performers while their voices sang in the background once again the nonopera aspect of it was appealing perhaps because I wasn't completely resolved on seeing only an opera. The three main performers all had strong points. Roberto Alagna was good enough as Cavaradossi I'm not experienced enough at opera to find the faults in his voice that other writers have though I did notice at one point that he couldn't quite hold his own against the orchestra. I just found his acting to be a little weak for the hero I'd expect a revolutionary to be a bit more fiery and he should be able to give Scarpia a run for his money during their confrontation. Perhaps this was the director's interpretation it would be natural for Cavaradossi to be scared when hauled before Scarpia but he seemed a bit pathetic when he should have been proud and defiant. Even I could tell that Angela Gheorgiu has a beautiful voice and never tired of hearing her sing. Her acting was not always to my taste though I thought her Tosca came across as coquettish in her scene with Cavaradossi in the church and I would have preferred a more openhearted and sincere Tosca at such a moment. She reminded me too much of a professional actress there and I found her a bit artificial. Her best scenes were with Ruggero Raimondi and I'll agree with everything everyone else has said about his performance  he was fantastic. That aria at the end of Act I certainly sets the pulse racing and it's extremely sexy though the performer is acting almost entirely with his eyes. As unlikely as a ToscaScarpia pairing would be it was really believable in this film and Gheorgiu really was able to convey conflicted feelings of attraction and repulsion for this terrible man. Raimondi has a real gift for bringing out her best acting  his acting ability is never in question but she isn't always as convincing. This may not be anyone's definitive version of Tosca but it is quite unique.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was intrigued by the very passionate comments I'd read about this movie and was curious to see it. I'm not an opera fan but have a special interest in Tosca and remember seeing a PBS performance of it twenty or twentyfive years ago. I found this version unexpectedly entertaining the things that might repel typical opera fans seemed to work well for me maybe because I could link them to other film performances I'd seen and made this film not so purely opera. The outdoor shots always with a rather shaky moving camera reminded me of crime reconstructions I'd seen on TV and also of the dreamlike atmosphere in An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. They weren't long enough to annoy and gave a sense of urgency to the film. I didn't even mind the lyrics spoken by the performers while their voices sang in the background once again the nonopera aspect of it was appealing perhaps because I wasn't completely resolved on seeing only an opera. The three main performers all had strong points. Roberto Alagna was good enough as Cavaradossi I'm not experienced enough at opera to find the faults in his voice that other writers have though I did notice at one point that he couldn't quite hold his own against the orchestra. I just found his acting to be a little weak for the hero I'd expect a revolutionary to be a bit more fiery and he should be able to give Scarpia a run for his money during their confrontation. Perhaps this was the director's interpretation it would be natural for Cavaradossi to be scared when hauled before Scarpia but he seemed a bit pathetic when he should have been proud and defiant. Even I could tell that Angela Gheorgiu has a beautiful voice and never tired of hearing her sing. Her acting was not always to my taste though I thought her Tosca came across as coquettish in her scene with Cavaradossi in the church and I would have preferred a more openhearted and sincere Tosca at such a moment. She reminded me too much of a professional actress there and I found her a bit artificial. Her best scenes were with Ruggero Raimondi and I'll agree with everything everyone else has said about his performance  he was fantastic. That aria at the end of Act I certainly sets the pulse racing and it's extremely sexy though the performer is acting almost entirely with his eyes. As unlikely as a ToscaScarpia pairing would be it was really believable in this film and Gheorgiu really was able to convey conflicted feelings of attraction and repulsion for this terrible man.

It is a real marathon filled with danger to get a pilot sold then possibly get it filmed then edited then tested and then through literally winning a lottery  getting it on the air!! But at the end of the day  it is the viewers who decide what stays on  if something gets numbers it stays  if it doesn't  it goes.

Network meddling turns a neat idea into a farce. First they put in an actor the creator doesn't want and his inadequacy ruins much of the chemistry. Then they change the premise and finally the title.The movie ends abruptly as the main character watches a clip for a show that looks nothing like his original idea.It works on some levels but on others it kind of falls flat.Sigourny Weaver is brilliant. Duchovny just doesn't work well in this role. You are supposed to get the idea of a man who makes Faustian bargains to get his vision on the air and then has his vision destroyed. Duchovny's character never really expresses his passion for his original concept so you don't care all that much when Weaver's character steamrollers him.I find this interesting because no doubt they cast Duchovny because of his name recognition. The premise is how a TV show can be ruined by bad casting when this movie was ruined by bad casting.".

Duchovny's character never really expresses his passion for his original concept so you don't care all that much when Weaver's character steamrollers him.I find this interesting because no doubt they cast Duchovny because of his name recognition. The premise is how a TV show can be ruined by bad casting when this movie was ruined by bad casting.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite its short running time The TV Set doesn't quite sustain its humor throughout. There are tremendous lulls inbetween some very good jokes. There are a few really big laughs and the premise is awfully enticing. Yet writerdirector Jake Kasdan who wrote and directed the very funny and hugely underrated Zero Effect 1998 cannot seem to keep things funny throughout.The film to be distributed nationally by ThinkFilm is a rather rude awakening albeit a funny one to anyone who aspires to be a writer especially a TV writer. Mike David Duchovny comes up with an idea for a TV series only to find he is forced to compromise at every turn  from the lead actor to the tone of the pilot to plot points.The first 10 minutes or so are very funny. But the film loses steam as it goes along partly because Kasdan seems to want to make a 21st century version of Network 1976 at times. But trying to emulate Paddy Chayefsky is no easy feat. Chayefsky was unique and although Kasdan scores some points he just cannot overcome these huge dull lulls when exposition takes over for comedy and the film just falls flat.Sigourney Weaver as Lenny the studio executive  incidentally the role was initially written for Ben Stiller so I suppose it's a blessing that he backed out because the man's not done a good movie in years and has ruined several potentially funny films  seems to be simply replaying her shrill bitchy Katharine Parker from Working Girl 1988. Trouble is villains need to be interesting and Weaver can't quite find what makes Lenny an intriguing person.Judy Greer does the best of the lot. She has fine comedic timing knows how to turn a phrase and realizes that good comedy requires underplaying a role sometimes. It's good to see Justine Bateman back in action but she truly is wasted as the suffering wife. Ioan Gruffudd brings a semblance of dignity to the proceedings finding the right balance for a character conflicted by personal gain and artistic integrity.Then there's Duchovny. I realize he has an incredibly loyal following for whom he can do no wrong. Every performance in their mind is Oscarworthy. I am a huge Woody Allen fan but I readily admit the man's made some turkeys. Duchovny fans on the other hand can't seem to quite grasp that he isn't all that good an actor. Duchovny has the emotional range of Patrick Swayze if that. You want to see how limited his range is? Watch Duchovny's crying scene in Return to Me 2000.Duchovny has a few good moments in The TV Set especially reacting to what's happening around him. But truth be told he gives the same performance in everything he does be it television or movies. There's no difference between his performance here and his turn in the wretched Connie and Carla 2004. It's impossible to differentiate one Duchovny performance from another. There's a smugness to him that can be appealing and which occasionally works but he desperately needs a broader range of emotions to turn him into an average actor.Kasdan misses several opportunities to get in some great jokes. After a while the film takes on a typical arc. You sense where the story's going. A couple of digs at TV work. After all Kasdan has experience having good shows canceled. And some of his best jokes seem to lurk in the background. You have to pay attention but they're good.The TV Set isn't a bad movie. It just isn't as terrific as it could be or Kasdan wants it to be. He has a lot to say about the state of TV today  which is with a few exceptions rather execrable  but he seems to struggle trying to find comedy for his entire story. Writing comedy isn't easy. And Kasdan should be credited for coming up with this. I just wish this had been funnier. Come to think of it a bit more of Slut Wars  written well of course  might have helped.".

With real world responsibilities he's forced to choose between his ability to provide for his family and his artistic integrity. I think we've all been there in one way or another  those REAL compromises in life where either option requires us to face a devastating loss.This movie was emotionally stirring as well as funny  a troubling funny a dark funny where the real laughs are in the subtext  the absurdity of the whole ordeal.David Duchovny's performance was imo perfect. I actually prefer him in more overt comedic roles but he owned this character in all it's deadpan glory.I think the most surprising performances were from Judy Greer and Sigourney Weaver. I knew Judy did good comedy but the subtle approach she applied to this character was flawless. Like Duchovny she was funny without ever seeming like she was actually trying to be. She didn't play the character funny she played a funny character  if that makes sense to anyone but me.Weaver unfortunately lands on the other end of the spectrum  as the most disappointing performance. She appeared almost desperate for a laugh in most scenes and her character never seemed to have center. Then again people in Weaver's character's position tend to be overanimated twodimensional selfingratiating twits with no artistic vision. So perhaps she played her character perfectly. Decide for yourself.Extra props to Fran Kranz for his brilliant portrayal of a slightly psychotic bad actor Ioan Gruffudd for being so damned likable as opposed to the typical stuffy brit stereotype found in most American movies...and finally Justine Bateman and Willie Garson for breathing real life into their relatively small roles. Well done...Bottom line This movie touched me. I don't think we can ask for any more from our entertainment than that.".

	schema:headline " Knowing spoof of theTV business";
	schema:reviewBody "Diehard fans of network television are sure to get a kick out of The TV Set a ribtickling parody about the making and possible unmaking of a TV pilot. Mike Klein David Duchovny is the writer who has high hopes for his new dark comedy series entitled The Wexley Chronicles  until that is he sees the purity of his artistic vision becoming increasingly compromised the longer the filming goes on. Klein views his creation as a cuttingedge mixture of comedy and tragedy but the powersthatbe seem to have their own concept of where it ought to be heading i.e. the tragedy is too depressing and the comedy needs to be kicked up a notch or two if the show is to have any chance of achieving broad popular appeal. The foremost liability is that against his better judgment and strenuous protestations Klein has been saddled with an actor Zach Harper who's a scenerychewing ham if ever there was one whom naturally the show's hamfisted producers feel is just perfect for the role. In short Klein finds his work being undermined and sabotaged every step of the way by bottomline corporate executives intrusive producers sycophantic underlings temperamental performers fencesitting decisionmakers knobturning testaudiences and even a pregnant wife who though supportive of Klein's vision keeps insisting he hang in there for the sake of the baby on the way.The TV Set succeeds primarily because it has been conceived more as a gentle spoof than as a fullthrottled ripeverythingtoshreds farce. As such it resists the temptation to go more broad and overthetop than it needs to in its comedy thereby allowing us to relate more fully with the characters. Basing the film in part on some of his own personal experiences in the business writerdirector Jake Kasdan has written a sly script filled with subtle humor laughoutloud moments and cunning insight into all the behindthescenes compromising that goes into the making of a TV show.The film is further buoyed by its sharp and delightful cast consisting of Duchovny his face all but buried under a bushy beard Ioan Gruffudd Judy Greer Fran Kranz Lindsay Sloane Justine Bateman and Philip Baker Hall. Sigourney Weaver deserves special recognition for her juicy turn as the producer whose ratingsdriven ruthlessness is barely hidden beneath a thin veneer of faux caring and sweetness think of this as a somewhat toneddown version of Faye Dunaway's character in Network.The TV Set makes it clear that's it's hard for any artist to keep true to his principles in a cutthroat industry where business generally comes ahead of art and where the lowestcommon denominator often serves as the sole criterion for deciding which series will be greenlighted and which will be stopped dead in their tracks.

	onyx:emotionText "Diehard fans of network television are sure to get a kick out of The TV Set a ribtickling parody about the making and possible unmaking of a TV pilot. Mike Klein David Duchovny is the writer who has high hopes for his new dark comedy series entitled The Wexley Chronicles  until that is he sees the purity of his artistic vision becoming increasingly compromised the longer the filming goes on. Klein views his creation as a cuttingedge mixture of comedy and tragedy but the powersthatbe seem to have their own concept of where it ought to be heading i.e. the tragedy is too depressing and the comedy needs to be kicked up a notch or two if the show is to have any chance of achieving broad popular appeal. The foremost liability is that against his better judgment and strenuous protestations Klein has been saddled with an actor Zach Harper who's a scenerychewing ham if ever there was one whom naturally the show's hamfisted producers feel is just perfect for the role. In short Klein finds his work being undermined and sabotaged every step of the way by bottomline corporate executives intrusive producers sycophantic underlings temperamental performers fencesitting decisionmakers knobturning testaudiences and even a pregnant wife who though supportive of Klein's vision keeps insisting he hang in there for the sake of the baby on the way.The TV Set succeeds primarily because it has been conceived more as a gentle spoof than as a fullthrottled ripeverythingtoshreds farce. As such it resists the temptation to go more broad and overthetop than it needs to in its comedy thereby allowing us to relate more fully with the characters. Basing the film in part on some of his own personal experiences in the business writerdirector Jake Kasdan has written a sly script filled with subtle humor laughoutloud moments and cunning insight into all the behindthescenes compromising that goes into the making of a TV show.The film is further buoyed by its sharp and delightful cast consisting of Duchovny his face all but buried under a bushy beard Ioan Gruffudd Judy Greer Fran Kranz Lindsay Sloane Justine Bateman and Philip Baker Hall. Sigourney Weaver deserves special recognition for her juicy turn as the producer whose ratingsdriven ruthlessness is barely hidden beneath a thin veneer of faux caring and sweetness think of this as a somewhat toneddown version of Faye Dunaway's character in Network.The TV Set makes it clear that's it's hard for any artist to keep true to his principles in a cutthroat industry where business generally comes ahead of art and where the lowestcommon denominator often serves as the sole criterion for deciding which series will be greenlighted and which will be stopped dead in their tracks. But it does so in such a lighthearted tweaking sort of way that it prevents any potential bitterness or rancor from slipping into the tone.";

	schema:headline " An extended whine from people who weren't as successful as they expected to be";
	schema:reviewBody "The TV Set wants to tell us what's wrong with television but the tone and substance of the film never rises above a snarky whine.The story follows a writer David Duchovny who's trying to sell his show to a network. Things start in a conference room full of suits deciding who's going to star in the show moves through shooting the pilot and concludes at the grand unveiling of the network's new schedule in front of a convention hall full of network affiliates. WriterDirector Jake Hasdan thinks he's showing us how talented people end up making terrible shows but he's not fair and honest enough to do that.Hasdan wants people to see David Duchovny as this talented guy with a great script battling to protect it from selfindulgent actors and directors and a network executive Sigourney Weaver who is relentlessly trying to dumb the show down and tear out its creative soul. The problem is that while we see a lot of terrible changes made to it we never get to see the supposedly great show being butchered. It's a sitcom that we're told is smart and funny and touching but we never get to see any of the smart funny stuff and the touching scenes we see are straight out of a daytime soap opera. The movie is essentially a scam that wants to make fun of all the stupid nonsensical stuff that happens to create bad TV without showing us what good TV actually is. It never rises much above mildly amusing because the punch lines are almost all based on the contrast between the silly and shallow ideas of the network executives and the smart and worthwhile ideas of the writer. But since we never get to see the writer's great ideas the contrast is weak and so is the humor.I must say if Weaver's performance is at all close to the real thing you do get a sense of sympathy for people in television. She's got no real taste at all and relies on her teenage daughter to tell her what's good but is entirely convinced that things should be done her way and holds the success and failure of others completely in her own hands. The TV Set portrays working in television like it's living in a totalitarian state where standing up against the powers that be requires heroic courage and a willingness to suffer.The film also comes at the good TV vs. bad TV from another perspective. Ione Gruffud plays a former BBC executive who's been hired by the network to improve the quality of their shows. The movie briefly uses him to embody a different approach to television one with more highminded goals and more respect for the creative process.

	onyx:emotionText "The TV Set wants to tell us what's wrong with television but the tone and substance of the film never rises above a snarky whine.The story follows a writer David Duchovny who's trying to sell his show to a network. Things start in a conference room full of suits deciding who's going to star in the show moves through shooting the pilot and concludes at the grand unveiling of the network's new schedule in front of a convention hall full of network affiliates. WriterDirector Jake Hasdan thinks he's showing us how talented people end up making terrible shows but he's not fair and honest enough to do that.Hasdan wants people to see David Duchovny as this talented guy with a great script battling to protect it from selfindulgent actors and directors and a network executive Sigourney Weaver who is relentlessly trying to dumb the show down and tear out its creative soul. The problem is that while we see a lot of terrible changes made to it we never get to see the supposedly great show being butchered. It's a sitcom that we're told is smart and funny and touching but we never get to see any of the smart funny stuff and the touching scenes we see are straight out of a daytime soap opera. The movie is essentially a scam that wants to make fun of all the stupid nonsensical stuff that happens to create bad TV without showing us what good TV actually is. It never rises much above mildly amusing because the punch lines are almost all based on the contrast between the silly and shallow ideas of the network executives and the smart and worthwhile ideas of the writer. But since we never get to see the writer's great ideas the contrast is weak and so is the humor.I must say if Weaver's performance is at all close to the real thing you do get a sense of sympathy for people in television. She's got no real taste at all and relies on her teenage daughter to tell her what's good but is entirely convinced that things should be done her way and holds the success and failure of others completely in her own hands. The TV Set portrays working in television like it's living in a totalitarian state where standing up against the powers that be requires heroic courage and a willingness to suffer.The film also comes at the good TV vs. bad TV from another perspective. Ione Gruffud plays a former BBC executive who's been hired by the network to improve the quality of their shows. The movie briefly uses him to embody a different approach to television one with more highminded goals and more respect for the creative process. But he soon knuckles under and goes along with Weaver's crude lowestcommondenominator style and the movie never really explains why.That's because the story scrupulously avoids examining the true root of all TV evilmoney.

All of this is a shame as the film's premise had some potential.The island location and diving scenes deserved much better cinematography. Likewise the premise of a search for a mythological treasure and the treachery of the boat's crew could have made this a great boy's own adventure film. Instead the entire work is hackneyed and marred by the awkward flashback sequence and obviously lack of funding.Of course the reason that this film is wellknown at all today is because it marks one of the earliest appearances of Brigitte Bardot. Although she only appears late in the film she is noteworthy in the sense that she is the first modern woman to appear on the screen with her long blonde hair and body confidence she marks an abrupt change from the prim actresses who preceded her.Overall though this film is hack work. It is inoffensive but truly does waste a potentially interesting premise due to its poor direction and underdeveloped script.".

With this in mind scrutinizing 'Manina' nevertheless reveal some small charms. A romantic story about a hidden treasure in the Mediterranean Sea with some robbers around. Bedded in eternal sunshine its location is set on a lone deserted rockisland  involving the local lighthousekeeper's beautiful daughter who falls in love with our honest treasurehunter.Second 'Manina' introduces the happy marriage between Brigitte Bardot and the Mediterranean Sea. A marriage that features prominently in Brigitte's life both private and in her films. Four years after 'Manina' this marriage also made an important cornerstone in Brigitte's worldfamous Big Breakthroughfilm 'Et Dieu crea la femme'  French for 'And God created woman'.Third 'Manina' deserves to be mentioned for her many under waterscenes. These are brightened up by some fine music of Jean Yatove another forgotten name. Back in 1952 Yatove's music was issued on a long playrecord that later on became one of the most huntedafter BBartifacts. Gearing up prices up to 1.000 English pounds.Last but not least our memory of 'Manina' is greatly supported by one of the most famous Bardotphotos ever. Showing her fully naked which was very daring in 1952 on a sunny Mediterranean beach. Lying on her belly from her waist down in the low water. Apart from BB's nudity this photo also makes a great composition Brigitte's hooked right leg gives it life while the sea moving against her left thigh makes it move.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm getting really tired of people who don't like a particular film genre giving bad reviews of movies belonging to that genre. I don't like gory horror films so I wouldn't review or see something like Hostel or Saw. But somehow people and reviewers delight in putting down romcoms not because there's anything wrong with the films but because it would have to be something absolutely extraordinary to even merit a satisfactory from them.That's why it pisses me off that Adam and Steve hasn't gotten the critical acclaim that it deserves. I honestly feel that most of the bad reviews were of people predisposed to dislike it just as they'd be predisposed to dislike any new romantic comedy gay or straight. That's not to say that it hasn't gotten its fair share of good reviews and deservedly so!Yes the romantic comedy genre has been done and done again and not always well but I can count the number of GAY romantic comedies on the fingers of one hand. All Over the Guy and Adam and Steve and...? How many others follow the formula of two people who meet cute fall in love face some kind of crisis and then overcome it in a tear and laughter filled climactic scene? Yes I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for a good romcom. I can see While You Were Sleeping any day of the week. But as a gay man I've been cheated of this genre always having to superimpose my own boyboy couple over the boygirl couple in the film.Adam and Steve is the film I and others I'm sure have been waiting for. One of the funniest admittedly crude at times Thank you Farrely bros and at the same time most gloriously romantic romcoms ever and this time it's a boy meets boy boy loses boy boy gets boy back story! The chemistry between Craig Chester and Malcolm Gets is palpable and thank you openly gay hero Chester for casting another gay man to play opposite. As Chester says in the film commentary he and Gets don't have to worry about playing gay but can simply play the characters and when they are in bed together or sharing a romantic moment lots of kissing in this film you don't have to wonder if they felt odd or uncomfortable. It's obvious that they didn't and don't.Parker Posey and Chris Kattan are along for the ride Ms. Posey giving yet another lovable quirky performance that's made her the indie queen and Mr. Kattan showing himself a real actor and real person something that his usual over the top roles don't allow him to do.If you don't like romantic comedies don't see this movie. But if you're like me someone who loves the genre but has felt cheated out of his own romcom by all means BUY the DVD because this is a movie you'll be watching again and again.".

Also Chester wrote the script AND directed it as well as starring in itthis guy is very talented.Acting is good all around. Gets and Chester are just great and perfectly believable. It's always great to see Parker Posey and she's just wonderful catch her outfit at the twostepping. Even Kattan is goodhe annoyed me totally in SNL. And the supporting cast includes Julie Hagerty Sally Kirkland and Melinda Dillonall are just great.I saw this at a sold out viewing at the Provincetown Film Festival.

I know that there are important issues dealing with the gay community but it is nice to see a film that looks past all of the usual topics points and moves on to very funny comedy. The writer director Craig Chester did a superb job at ramping up the humor and staying dedicated to keeping the story funny. When you think that was funny he turns it up and takes it even farther. The sell out crowd of about 1500 at Tribeca was incredible entertained by this film. There were very few dull moments and the audience kept pace with the humor. The guys at Funnyboy Films made a good choice making Adam and Steve. This film along with their first success of LATTERDAYS shows the potential for this company to be a strong force in the future of the filmmaking community.".

Is it possible that this will be the first gay date movie that straight couples will go to and laugh with?Maybe that's hoping for an America more openminded than it is but certainly the open minded heterosexual partners are in for a good time.Kudos to writerdirecter Chester for creating what is an impressive mosaic of styles. In lesser hands the film with everything from emotional honesty to slapstick comedy to overthetop and I do mean WAAYYYY overthetop camp should be a mess. But somehow scenes of first love are actually made sweeter all the more by the slapstick running gag that accompanies them sorry no spoilers here!.The leads are extremely appealing the dialog is wellrealized and the realities of dating are sharply realized in a film that walks the fine line between maudlin and frank but rarely feels dishonest. That's going to sound ridiculous in the context of a film that includes a choreographed danceoff featuring a drag queen but the movie is wise to use broad strokes of humor to help otherwise clichd movie devices go down easier. Additional kudos to Parker Posey who becomes the heterosexual equivalent of the Jack character on Will  Grace. Her comic contributions are noteperfect.Chester has commented that the use of comedy has a role in helping straight audiences better accept a budding romance between men. I hope that's true because this film deserves better than the cult or gaylesbian dungeon in your local video store.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am gay and I saw this film 3 times in the theater and just bought the movie on DVD today at Best Buy.I have to say that Adam  Steve is one of the most hilarious films I have ever seen. I've read comments talking about how overthetop and unbelievable the film is. Yes that is true but how many straight romantic comedies are not believable as well? This film left me feeling better than Brokeback Mountain. Yes Brokeback Mountain had a bigger budget by many millions of dollars but the plot left me feeling disappointed and depressed at the end. There need to be more films where gay men don't die or contract HIVAIDS. Adam  Steve is one of those films and I thank FunnyBoy Films for making it.The film starts off in the 1980s when Adam a goth and his obese friend Rhonda go to a dance club in NYC called Danceateria. Adam meets a dazzle dancer who performed at the club and they go back to Adam's apartment for a onenightstand that ends disastrously. See the film for yourself this will be one of the grossest and most hilarious scenes in a film since the 'hairgel' incident in There's Something About Mary. Fast forward twenty years Adam and Steve meet again without realizing they had met two decades earlier. They start dating and only after they've been dating for a while do they realize that they had met at Danceteria back in 1987.This film has a wonderful cast. Craig Chester as Adam Malcolm Gets as Steve and Parker Posey as Rhonda. I could have done without Chris Kattan as Steve's roommate Michael but he's not in a larger percentage of the film so that's okay.Adam  Steve combines an irreverent sense of humor as well as genuine and heartfelt emotions that demonstrates the trials of relationships whether they be gay or straight. This film is overthetop at times with crass and unapologetically vulgar humor but trust me this film will make you laugh hysterically.While the film did have a relatively small budget there is no issues with the quality of the cameras used. The footage is not grainy or amateurish in any sense. This film certainly would not be an Oscar contender but in a world where there seems to be a barrage of bad news I think that we could use more outrageously funny comedies like Adam  Steve.".

No gaybashing isn't funny but this running gag IS.One scene was absolutely STUNNING A danceoff developed between Malcolm Gets and Craig Chester that was so welldone and remarkably entertaining that I KNOW I must buy this movie on DVD as soon as it comes out just to see this dance number again.

And how sweet to finally see Malcolm Gets in an out role acting his heart out and his butt off. Don't miss the gag reel. How many movies have a gag reel that is even funnier than the movie? Shortbus eat your heart out whatever that director's name is. Now I'm just padding so they'll print this. What casting! What a treat to finally see Paul Sand again not to mention Sally Kirkland and Julie Hagerty.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film of 100 minutes was at first set up of the feasting story before my eyes was a bit of getting used to the retro time frame in this story. We meet the the fag hag Rhonda and Steve. The usual clichs of early gayness are displayed in a nightclub atmosphere. A bit too much drug use is prevalent. So the pair hooks up Adam and Steve for some raunchy time? Some mistake makes for a disaster that happens. WE get projected into a time frame later in which circumstances pair up the two again. I kind of love the chemistry between the leads which gave hope and joy and laughter and tears. This version should have been 10 minutes longer in scope. I felt myself loving the pair with Micheal and Rhonda as another subplot running as the main pair develops a relationship together. One cute plot involves a New York city cowboy dance meeting place. We get scenes of the city in great quantity. The pacing of the movie goes at a pace that did not make me fall asleep as some love stories have a long tedious climb to a ultimate yes or no. We meet both sets of families each with different attributes. A revelation kind of messes thing up and the repair makes for a brief stopping of the heart. Do they make up or they go their separate ways as friends is to be seen. If they end up in one direction I wished that would be longer in time to make us sure their meant to be together and shorter in scope to just end it as friends watch them get hooked up with someone else and let us be happy with that. It is a nice gay movie I seen for a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing more here than a standard clich romantic comedy that you would find in a dozen Adam Sandler films or poorly written African American comedies except for that it focuses on a homoesexual relationship. None of the characters are believable the tone is mostly a farce but there is not a lot of intelligence behind it.I believe this film is getting a decent buzz primarily because the two leads are actually gay and rarely do we see supposed reallife portrayal of gays in romantic comedies.The filmmakers intent was to show what it is really like to be in a homosexual relationship and that they have the same feelings concerns desires etc as heterosexual couples. The main problem is that the tone is so absurd and light and none of it seems like real life at all you don't believe or engage in the characters at all so the message is lost. I am not gay and did not leave the film feeling any more informed about the difficulties of gay relationships or anything even close.There are some funny scenes and lines but also many awkward moments and irrelevant scenes just thrown in and dialouge that just doesn't work. Many parts tried to be over the top and absurd just for the sake of doing so nothing real or organic about them. The acting and pacing also needed work. I just didn't engage or become interested in the characters at any level.It didn't need to be as heavy or shocking as Queer as Folk or other gay films but moving the tone more toward Kissing Jessica Stein would have served it much better. Beleiving in the characters as actual people instead of over the to characatures would have let me empathize and allowed me to learn a lot more than I didThe 911 references were empty and useless. I lived in NY at the time and if your're going to try to capture it at least give it some time attention and drama. Any I don't mean to focus on the gay aspect it fails as a film period straight gay or other but the producersfilmmakers are promoting it this way so that will inevitably be the focus.I'd be interested in hearing any opinions from anyone gay who saw the film to see if they felt it represented their struggles properly or if they were maybe just happy to see a light comedy focused on gay life.Will be interesting to see what happens ifwhen it is released".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems exceptionally difficult to make a gay romance or any gaythemed film it seems without delving into cheap stereotypes. There have been a few diamonds in the rough but Adam  Steve is a painfully unfunny and extremely dull film that is neither romantic nor comedic. Aside from the throwaway sight gags the poor directing the mediocre acting the spectacularly awful writing Adam  Steve's real problem is its tonal shifts. The mishmash of genres here keeps adding barrier after barrier to push the audience out of the picture. The film begins with an odd introduction of the main characters complete with Parker Posey in a fat suit. Next up we get two visual sight gags of poop and vomit in one scene one of which is so poorly done I laughed in spite of how unfunny it was.There are scenes of drama there are scenes of comedy there are scenes of musical numbers and a choreographed dance sequence. It only takes about 15 minutes to realize how bad this picture really is. Parker Posey and Chris Kattan along with a handful of supporting character actors upstage the two main leads who are about as charismatic as two rocks. There are scenes where Posey and Kattan both seem to be rolling their eyes maybe wondering how they got roped into this production.Adam  Steve has no direction and flounders in search of one. It jumps all over the place going from a completely screwball grossout comedy attempting a pale imitation of the Farrelly Brothers to a tender love story admittedly neither tender nor particularly loving... not even really a story for that matter. It almost seems as if the screenplay were written in segments and then spliced together. There are a handful of humorous moments most of which come courtesy of Posey and Kattan that prevent the movie from becoming a complete waste of time. And the final climactic moments are nicely handled a welcome break from the maddening confusion that has preceded it all. The only reason to see this one is if you are a fan of either Posey or Kattan. And really if you are both have done far superior work.".

In addition to not being particularly convincing as played and written as the romantic leads Chester and Gets should not have played there far younger self even in Chester's case with his Robert Smithish goth makeup. Unfortunately under all that makeup you could still easily see the lines in his face and around his eyes which he certainly didn't have in Swoon. In addition to these inconsistencies in tone and genre and the weakness of the chemistry between the leads think Anne Heche and Harrison Ford only both at the same age the film also suffered from predictability in both the gags and the serious notes of the script.Worth a rental at most  not worthing adding to your collection and certainly not worth theater admission.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scrolling through the 135 comments I'm amazed at how outraged so many viewers are at the excessive violence explicit sex foul language etc. etc. etc.  C'mon.  A film is advertised as Elvises robbing a Las Vegas casino during an Elvis convention.  How much more lead in do you want? You expect action thrills and ... content?  Amazing.  Listen.  This is one of the funniest outrageous films I've seen in a long time. Yes.  The story's incredible.  But in any film we have to consider the level at which we're willing to buy in.  I mean some people were outraged at the farting scenes in Shrek.  Now they're complaining because Russell and Costner especially the latter are too violent.  Well let's go back a year or so when Russell and Costner both made Wyatt Earp films playing the title roles.  From my view both vehicles were ghastly but entertaining. So I submit that what we have here is the COSTNER and RUSSELL Revenge vehicle.  Costner is always on the leafy edge whether he's dancing with wolves building baseball fields for ghosts or waterskiing as bait for sea monsters.  Russell whose track record in shoot 'emups is no less than Stallone or Arnie is likewise coming off some hound dog roles such as being an automated soldier a remake of his Escape from New York LA?  Why'd anyone want to go there in the first place? and the scifi Stargate.  Now we get these two guys in a mindless black comedy full of SV the most since the cult film Thursday with quirky twists and turns.  Mindless violence? Yes.  Gratuitious sex? Yes.  Entertaining?  Yes but only if you don't take it too seriously.  I loved it.".

An old western show down and being a road movie it gives the junk food escapism I love and need.  The acting is great Costner plays such a great jerk in this film his attitude makes the viewer dislike him like a bad guys in wrestling.  Costner should keep playing bad guys. I believe this is his strong point.  Russell plays the hero or the not too bad bad guy. Russell character is the all American type he acts too the tee.

Judging from the television spots and theatrical trailers one would assume the film revolves around the slowly bubbling brewing plan to knock off a Vegas casino dressed as Elvises on International Elvis Night. But that is where you would be wrong. The ten minutes of nonstop action that are a result of the casino robbery and in a weird dimension almost mirror the bank robbery scene in HEAThappen in the first ten minutes of the movie the other 120 minutes revolve around the aftermath and repercussions of the bloodbath.Costner who I swear to God will never do wrong in my eyes does well for himself departing from the usual character and plays a bad guy. The great thing about this film is that all the characters are bad guys we just have to decide how bad they are and how much we want to let ourselves care about them. Costner is the baddest of them all and eventually it becomes clear that the bad guy we are supposed to care about is the one played by the best Average Guy actor of all time Kurt Russell remember BREAKDOWN?In any case we have the romance Courtney Cox and Russell. We have the bloody cold hearted illegitimate possibly son of Elvis Costner. We have the two cops chasing them Kevin Pollack and Thomas Haden Church who compliment each other with wonderful chemistry. And we have the slew of supporting actors that plug up any possible holes the film might but doesn't have Howie Long David Arquette Bokeem Woodbine a Black Elvis IceT Christian Slater. Blah Blah Blah.This film on the whole becomes the first film in quite some time that I know I will see multiple times in the theater and one that I am sure I will eventually know all the words to. Making it the fourth of the Costner Movies I can recite word for word Robin Hood Tin Cup PostmanThe relatively young director also made a unique decision in the editing of the film allowing both of its stars Costner and Russell cut their own version of the film. Costner's version concentrated more on the action the blood the guts the death the explosion the F word with a strange annunciation of the G. And Russell's focused on the budding and slowly blossoming love between Cox and himself. Costner's cut won but I can't see anywhere that film lacks because of it. overall this is one of the most fully fleshed well rounded films I have seen in quite a while.I loved it.A".

The climax is predictable unfortunately  and doesn't leave us with much to chew on but the overwrought stylings  are the thing.

	schema:reviewBody "3000 Miles to Graceland' isn't quite as dopey as the cover art featuring Kurt Russell and Kevin Kostner clad in Elvis regalia would suggest. Although it breaks little new ground in its already overworked genre the film does emerge as an efficient crime drama thanks to a gallery of interesting characters some impressive performances and Demian Lichtenstein's flashy directorial style.After a shaky first half hour or so in which the film seems to be struggling to establish its direction and tone the movie miraculously hits its stride and thereafter never really lets up.  The story centers around a band of excons united by their almost obsessive love for the King of rock'n'roll who decide to knock over a Las Vegas casino dressed as Elvis impersonators.  Predictably the heist serves merely as the pretext for one of them the obviously psychotic Murphy Kostner to coldbloodedly eliminate his accomplices.  The fly in his ointment turns out to be Michael Zane Russell the most principled one of the group who survives the holocaust and spends his time along with a pretty single mother and her precocious child trying to keep out of Murphy's way.In terms of plotting the film follows a pretty traditional route for this kind of film.  However the characters here seem a bit more fleshed out than they often do in some of those other films particularly Zane who seems caught between his criminal inclinations and his innate goodness as a human being.  Cybil the single mother played by Courteney Cox likewise seems conflicted between genuine love and emotion and the excitement of easy wealth and a life lived on the edge.  But it is Kostner as Murphy who sets the real tone for the film.  His portrayal of a steelyeyed psychotic killer literally sets the teeth on edge as he callously mows down scores of policemen and innocent bystanders who happen to get in his way.  He makes for a truly soulcringing villain.  Russell who played the actual legend back in his own younger more halcyon days makes a fascinating subtle counterpoint to Murphy's unbridled ruthlessness.The film is not however a total success.  For one thing the violence often seems excessively brutal graphic and mean spirited for a movie that seems to want to be a lark of sorts after all a movie featuring robbers dressed as Elvis impersonators can't be bidding to be taken too seriously. Moreover the plotting which far too often relies on unlikely coincidences to keep it rolling also borders frequently on the incoherent.  Finally the morally ambiguous ending doesn't really sit well with those of us who find a couple of thieves no matter how charming they may appear to be unlikely candidates for heroism in the context of a happy' ending.All in all however 3000 Miles to Graceland' will probably appeal to those who like their crime dramas offbeat quirky and filled with interesting characters.".

For one thing the violence often seems excessively brutal graphic and mean spirited for a movie that seems to want to be a lark of sorts after all a movie featuring robbers dressed as Elvis impersonators can't be bidding to be taken too seriously. Moreover the plotting which far too often relies on unlikely coincidences to keep it rolling also borders frequently on the incoherent.  Finally the morally ambiguous ending doesn't really sit well with those of us who find a couple of thieves no matter how charming they may appear to be unlikely candidates for heroism in the context of a happy' ending.All in all however 3000 Miles to Graceland' will probably appeal to those who like their crime dramas offbeat quirky and filled with interesting characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "some spoilersIt's official 3000 Miles to Graceland is a very strong contender for the worst movie of 2001. Rarely have I seen such a long boring mindnumbing mess. There's the germ of an offbeat ideaElvis impersonators robbing a Vegas casinobut right from the start something's amiss and the film only gets worse as it goes on. The first part is a mildly diverting heist picture but it degenerates into a mindless road movie making it clear that the filmmakers had no idea where to go. The third act is nearly unwatchable and I felt tired and depressed when it was over. It would be hard to list every flaw in a single review but the most prominent impression on my mind was that it's an assault on the senses. A handful of viewers liked it but I don't envision this movie becoming a cult classic anytime soon. The director makes everything flashy looking with rapid editing and tilted camera angles. He thought he was making the film exciting but all it did was give me a headache. I am reminded of Armageddon which had a similar problem but was at least a marginally more entertaining movie. Graceland isn't exciting it's a poorly directed sloppily written ordeal.I do not know how Kevin Costner was persuaded to appear in this travesty except that perhaps he was tired of being the hero all the time. Well if he wanted to play a villain he got his wish. After watching the results my guess is that he will stick with his more traditional roles from this day on. His approach to the character a psychotic thug ringleader doesn't have enough force or energy. It's clear that he didn't have any idea what to do with this nearly unplayable role so he just faked it. On the other had Kurt Russell does a fairly good job as his heartofgold partner who eventually befriends a lonely single mother. I liked Courteney Cox's character but her motivations are too vague for her actions to be credible. Does she love this guy or what? And does she so easily forget his threat to kill her? Likewise David Kaye is reasonably good as Cox's son but he's such a little brat. Christian Slater Kevin Pollak and David Arquette are utterly wasted and dispensed with early on. There should be a law against such misuse of resources.Demian Lichtenstein is one of the worst directors ever to helm a bigbudget movie and one hopes it will be a long time before anyone lets him near Hollywood again. Thankfully his film was a miserable boxoffice bomb so the worst of his legacy is probably over. According to the Internet Movie Database he is better known for his rock videos commercials and short films. He should be forbidden from ever moving from that arena and inflicting more harm upon the moviegoing public. Who greenlit this thing? Who thought it would make a workable movie? What did the stars see in the material? Did everyone owe the director a favor? Why hasn't Elvis' estate sued? out of Released by Warner Bros.".

As it is there's one abbreviated way to sum up the effect this movie will eventually have on a thinking feeling filmgoerTake a camera. Point it at a ludicrously immense mound of compost or a heap of various kinds of manure. Take about thirty million dollars in cash throw it on top of the crap. Douse it liberally with gasoline nitro toss in some dynamite and C4. Light a match and throw it in.The resulting explosion of waste products would probably be more engaging to watch than this entire film and probably end up smelling a lot better too. This is filmmaking at its absolute worst irresponsibility bordering on the contemptuous for the stars and those of its intended audience intelligent enough to be outraged by it. If this is the best the creative team responsible for this dreck felt they could do maybe they should all retire from the business. Like yesterday.Kurt Russell who did a decent portrayal of Elvis in the TV biopic nearly undoes all the good work he did before here. The only reason he doesn't come off as totally assinine is because Kevin Costner steals THAT honor from him without so much as breaking a sweat or losing those atrocious fake sideburns. Take it from those of us who've been watching you Kev...we all like actors who stretch and take risks. It's generally conceded that you need a change of pace to revitalize your career but bubby THESE kind of changes you don't need.Maybe it's just me but I thought I detected a few glimpses of nearembarassment from the supporting cast regarding their brief appearances in this sorry excuse for an action film. Slater Woodbine Arquette Cox Jon Lovitz Kevin Pollak and Thomas Haden Church are capable of doing much better work than this and they have. They've also done some things I'm sure they've left off their resumes in recent times but nothing THIS bad. Only Howie Long taking a break from his Radio Shack commercials seems to escape absolute shame in his brief cameo and the young actor who plays Cox's juvenile brat of a son delivers what is possibly the best performance in this whole mess. As for Paul Anka...well we'll give him the benefit of the doubt.Demian Lichtenstein is a former MTV video maven and this shows in every frame. But does anyone have patience for an overlong music video masquerading as a subpar action dramedy? If you seek to find the answer to that question make sure that your local video store is running a twofer special before you put this on the evening's itinerary.BTW there are better action movies you could watch that are so overthetop they're damn near enjoyable. THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and REMO WILLIAMS are two excellent examples. Or better still go for Kurt one more time in the funky junky comicbookextravagant BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA. Even seeing that flick for the nineteenth time is better than your initial viewing of this one.".

It could have been a really satisfying package if they'd wrapped things up a good half hour sooner.On the plus side I have to say this is my favorite Kevin Costner performance.

At least his character was fun and didn't have nearly as many horrid lines as the other characters like It's not me you don't trust it's yourself!  Just one of many lines that had me bursting into laughter at the theater.  The best interchange in the film comes when Cox asks Russell's character What are we going to do? Russell responds What everyone should do in this situation... and I stand up and yell Get our 8 back!  This movie wouldn't have been half as bad if it were only 1.5 hours long and Cox's character and her son weren't in the movie.

What I finally saw is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It even has a plot you can follow doesn't need bloody guts and severed body parts to be shown in closeup. It is just a film about bank robbers that decided to rob a casino because everybody else robs banks. There is a huge shootout and security guards and innocent bystanders drop dead by the dozen. The rivalry between the robbers evolves and finally leads through some twiststo the showdown between Costner  Russell  dozens of law enforcers. The way Costner portraits the lunatic actually believing himself to be one of Elvis' illegitimate childrenis just fantastic and worth watching the movie. Russell is also wonderful to watch as the excon who just wants to get enough money to settle down on his boat nice twist thereand who doesn't share the enthusiasm of the others for killing. Even Cox as the woman in the middle shows a surprisingly good performance. Admittedly you don't have to switch on your brain to understand it but it is really cool to watch funny and entertaining. If you don't want to spend any money on a theater ticket get it on DVD  it's worth it.".

People always complain that they take movies too seriously and they gotta learn to have fun at the movies.  I've heard more regular audience members btch about this movie than professional critics.  As a matter of fact Richard Roeper gave it a thumbs up!  He knew how to have fun with the movie!I'm proud to have 3000 Miles as part of my DVD collection because it's one of those great guiltypleasure popcorn flicks.  You can attack it on so many levels artistically.  Its director Demian Lichtenstein is a firsttime director only having directed music videos in the past.  So the whole film plays out like a music video with nonstop use of quick cutting. But in a bizarre way it works considering the film's lightningfast pace. The story at times makes no sense.  The music going back to the director's history in making videos seems to upstage the action in many circumstances. Nevertheless I love the music in this movie whether or not the songs fit the tone of each scene.  Yes Kevin Costner's performance is overstated to say the least.  Who cares?  This ain't Remains of the Day.  This is a comicbookstyle action movie meant to entertain and entertain only.  His character is almost like a comic book villain.  He's not meant to have a human side.  And Costner's performance was perfect in the context of the character and he seemed to be having tons of fun.  When you have the joy of performance you don't need much else.  I always love seeing Kurt Russell.  The rest of the actors except for Kevin Pollak and Thomas HadenChurch give decent but throwaway performances.  One complaint about this movie was the endangering of children during several scenes.  There's one thing people forgot to throw in  Kevin Costner's THE VILLAIN!  His violence against children works within the context of the character it's not in any way exploiting it.  If that's the case we can blame The Silence of the Lambs for exploiting cannabilism. Admittedly Costner's character did have some cool elements to him but not in a way that you want to be just like him and start hurting children. There's some real cool lines of dialogue which I enjoy reciting on a regular basis.  Overall it's not an art film by any means but it makes damn fine entertainment!  As long as you set aside all pretentions you should enjoy this movie.  But it's still a matter of taste.  Just don't speak out against the film 'cause you want to be part of the bandwagon. My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford would consent to appear in a movie together is amazing. Shearer in 1939 was the queen of MGM being the widow of Irving Thalberg and had her choice of material and costars. Crawford although a power in her own right didn't have Shearer's pull and complained bitterly about it. Crawford agreed to take the somewhat supporting albeit juicy role because she needed an A picture after a string of flops. So she had to suck it up to work with Shearer.The two stars had only one scene alone together and there were no reported problems except one. Director George Cukor sent Crawford home early when she caused a distraction by loudly clicking her knitting needles off camera as Shearer tried to do her closeups.Crawford was proved right in taking the movie it's one of her most memorable and finally for once villainous roles. As Crystal Allen the scheming homewrecker who is out to sleep her way to a Park Avenue penthouse she was ideally cast. It was her life. Rosalind Russell previously not known as a comedienne surprised everyone with her rapidfire sarcastic delivery. She would continue to perfect the biting style for 20 years until she reached the pinnacle with Auntie Mame. Roz gives the strongest performance of the film as the viciously catty Sylvia Fowler and I don't think Shearer or Crawford knew what hit them.As for the longsuffering hairclutching heavysighing Norma Shearer even she was able to make the difficult role of saintly Mary Haines memorable. One of her best moments is when she raises her nails and growls I've had two years to grow claws Mother and they're Jungle Red! and then goes to take her husband back from Crawford. Unfortunately Shearer has a few Silent Screen moments that look out of place such as collapsing and weeping at her mother's knee. But she makes the character warm and likable and we root for her to win. There are many gems in the supporting cast. Most spectacular is Mary Boland as the heavydrinking highliving Countess De Lave. L'amour L'amour she wails as she's about to divorce her fourth studly husband  for trying to kill her. Paulette Goddard the most beautiful member of the cast is the best I've seen her as the streetwise Miriam Aarons. Like Crawford she plays a role she understands the chorus girl who snags a millionaire. But unlike Crystal Miriam has a heart  and Goddard is great at doling out straightshooting advice and rolling out putdowns.Marjorie Main gives a preview of the persona she would later use as Ma Kettle. It was the first time she was able to step out and create the character and she used it the rest of her career. I never tired of her raucous horse laugh.I wish Hollywood had had the good sense not to attempt a remake with an update of this classic. Time is not kind. It is a priceless diamond in a golden setting.".

	schema:reviewBody "The female of the species goes jungle red in tooth and claw in this brilliant screen adaptation of Claire Boothe Luce's famous Broadway playa wickedly funny portrait of 1930s society women whose lives revolve around beauty treatments luncheons fashion shows and each other's men. Socialite Mary Haines is the envy of her set rich beautiful and happily married... but when her husband steps out on her with a golddigging perfume counter sales clerk Mary's socalled friends dish enough dirt to make divorce inevitable whether Mary wants it or not.The script is wickedly mercilessly funny fast paced razor sharp and filled with such memorable invective that you'll be quoting it for weeks and months afterward He says he'd like to do Sylvia's nails right down to the wrist with a buzzsaw Why that old gasoline truck she's sixty if she's a minute Gimme a bromideand put some gin in it! And the allfemale cast which includes every one from Cora Witherspoon to Butterfly McQueen to Hedda Hopper plays it with tremendous spark.This was the last significant starring role for Norma Shearer one of MGM's greatest stars of the 1930s and she acquits herself very well as the muchwronged Mary Haines. But the real winners are the members of the supporting cast. Joan Crawford is truly astonishing as Crystal Allen the shop girl who leads Mary's husband astray and Rosalind Russell gives an outrageously funny performance as the backbiting gossip whose nasty comments precipitate Mary's divorce. Indeed it is hard to do anything except rave about the entire the cast which includes such diverse performers as Marjorie Main Paulette Goddard Joan Fontaine and Lucille Watson. Even the smallest bit parts score with oneliners that have the impact of a slap in the face and director George Cukor does an incredible job of keeping everything and every one in sharp focus.Perhaps one of the most interesting things about THE WOMEN is the way in which director Cukor ties the behavior of its characters to their social status. Possessed of absolute leisure and considerable wealth their energies are inevitably directed into competition for the ultimate status symbol a successful man. Cukor allows us to sympathize with Mary Shearer and laugh at Sylvia Russell but he also requires us to pity themand indirectly encourages grudging admiration for the devious Crystal Crawford and the savvy Miriam Goddard characters who are considerably more selfreliant. Consequently not only does THE WOMEN paint a poisonously funny portrait of women as a sex it takes a hatchet to the society that has shaped their characters as well.Unfortunately this landmark comedy has not received the full benefit of what DVD offers. Although the print is crisp the film has not been restored and the extras are spurious and hardly do the film justice while I would recommend the DVD simply because you're likely to wear out a VHS the DVD has no great advantage over the VHS release. But whether you have it on VHS or DVD this is one title that you must have in your collection you'll watch it again and again. A musthave! Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "Women having cat fights over men never looked better than they did in George Cukor's adaptation of Clare BootheLuce's hit Broadway play. An allstar cast of actresses which included the established the Broadway vets and the rising in one huge ensemble THE WOMEN never once seems as if it's aged a bit because its story could very well be placed in a modern setting. The only shame I think is that its release coincided with the year 1939. There were too many other movies that were already vying for recognition and because of this massive competition it got lost in the shuffle. Had its release been withheld until the following year there's no doubt it would have gotten at least an acting nomination or multiple nominations in different categories including best picture.The story at the center is any woman's nightmare that her husband is having an affair and that everyone but her knows about it. Norma Shearer is this woman. She plays Mary Haines happily married to Stephen Haines and mother of Little Mary. She has no idea that Stephen is having a torrid affair with perfume clerk Crystal Allen but Sylvia does as does everyone else and plans to have Mary find out about it. Sylvia uses the communication skills of a manicurist to have Mary find out about her husband's secret and things boil up to a crescendo at a fashion show when both Mary and Crystal meet and spar. Mary decides after an argument to leave her husband in a quickie divorce signing at Reno where she meets not only the eccentric Countess deLave but Miriam Aarons who is the other woman in the Fowler marriage. Sylvia later also arrives in tears and then finds out that Miriam is set to be the next Mrs. Fowler and a fight ensues. At the last moment Mary gets a call from Stephen he will marry Crystal Allen after all. Crystal now the new Mrs. Stephen Haines takes to his money and her new lifestyle with a vengeance and makes Stephen pretty miserable. On top of that she is carrying on with a new guy Buck who was up to now the Countess deLave's husband. Sylvia of course learns of this and the news reaches Mary's ears who tries to win back her husband and rekindle her marriage using the same viciousness used against her.At first glance this is a pretty straightforward comedy of manners among the women who inhabit this world  who are more real than anyone would like to imagine. However there are a lot of little elements that the script adaptation of BoothLuce's play tell about women and how they see not only other women in society rich or poor but how they see themselves in a world where the next young thing could displace them and their perfect homes. In essence this is the first movie to tackle the issue of divorce so successfully and movies like THE FIRST WIVES' CLUB and the TV soaps MELROSE PLACE and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES owe a lot to THE WOMEN. The use of the term 'sister' is an interesting one it being at the heart of the feminist movement  female bonding is one of the film's strongest points and serves as a counterpart to the viciousness that we see early on. Interesting that Miriam Aarons herself an other woman is the first to come up with the term. She is the exact opposite of Crystal Allen. She also comes from the streets but is a wellmeaning woman and Paulette Goddard plays her like she herself has been there.Cukor definitely knows his actresses and extracts their best performances of their careers. Of the main actresses the only one to have been past her prime is Norma Shearer but she gives here her last great performance. Restrained at times even underplayed vulnerable in a world of female sharks watch for the scene when she collapses into tears at the news that her husband will marry another woman. This other woman played by Joan Crawford at a time when she needed the boost in her career albeit a temporary one is vicious made of steel and Crawford sinks her teeth and claws into Crystal all growls and purrs and literally walks off with the movie. Too bad she wasn't considered for a Best Supporting Oscar. This is her best performance on screen multilayered fascinating. An interesting sequence between her and Virginia Weidler who outdoes her admirably in a sensitive role playing Mary's daughter is one with future Mommie Dearest echoes. And needless to say the rich comedic timing that Rosalind Russell brings to pretty horrific character Sylvia Fowler. What an actress! She pulls out all the stops in her scenes going from plain bitchy to conniving to furious to deceived and all the time in that rapidfire speech of hers. Marjorie Main Mary Boland Lucille Watson and Joan Fontaine are all great  well written characters all directed by the equally great George Cukor who has created a timeless classic with this movie.".

Because of his direction this is a Hollywood classic at its best.They certainly don't make pictures like this anymore. Imagine what it would have cost to have a first rate cast to fill the shoes of all these women in today's Hollywood? It would probably be so prohibitive that no one in the present climate would touch it with a ten foot pole.The Women as written by Clare Booth Luce for the stage was a delicious comedy about New York society as it was in the late 30s. Of course by today's standards this is a very chaste take on that subject. Had it been done today it would have been done entirely different and the excellent text by Ms. Luce would have probably been thrown away to satisfy the taste of contemporary audiences.Norma Shearer was excellent as Mary Haines the suffering wife who has no clue of how her husband has fallen to the charms of Crystal Allen beautifully played by Joan Crawford. Rosalind Russell Mary Boland Paulette Goddard Joan Fontaine and the rest of the cast seem to be having a lot of fun while playing these women. One thing does come clear those women had a style and a sophistication well beyond the times they lived. It's very clear that Claire Booth Luce was well ahead of it all as she had an understanding for what was going on around her. What a thrill it must have been to have been around New York in that glamorous era!Women Love them as we cannot live without them!".

It showcases so many wonderful actresses all at once. Norma Shearer is just outstanding this is my favorite movie of hers.It also shows the values and thinking about women's roles at that time but challenges them at the same time. As embodied by Mary's motherinlaw there's a feeling of boys will be boys and the thought that even though her husband is playing around for no good reason given  they seem to be a happy couple Mary should let him get his wild oats out of his system and look the other way. On the other hand it shows a rich and varied view of all types of women intelligent catty gentle vicious etc. They are not necessarily defined by the men in their lives  who are not shown.

The Women is brilliantly written brilliantly acted and a whole lot of fun! Norma Shearer is such a sympathetic Mrs. Haines and the Jungle red scene had me in laughing fits.  I just could not stop the video for anything. Rosalind Russell was so funny!  I thought the scene in the exercise room was absolutely hysterical.  I've always been a fan of the demeure Joan Fontaine of Rebecca and I was surprised to see her here though not surprised that she played the lamb!  This film is such a delight.  I think anyone of any age would enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was fitting that MGM was the studio that brought The Women to the screen. Claire Boothe Luce's play which ran on Broadway for 657 performances was her view of the Republican ladies of Park Avenue in whose society she fit in so well. None of those studio bosses were exactly flaming liberals but probably the most political of all was Louis B. Mayer who served on the California Republican State Committee and had his stable of stars ready to do or die for the GOP whether they wanted to or not. Mayer was very active in the campaign to defeat Upton Sinclair for Governor of California in 1934 and put all of MGM's propaganda resources to defeat the radical Mr. Sinclair.Claire Boothe Luce knew this world well and certainly had the satirical skills to define it. But make no mistake about it the real villain here is Joan Crawford shop girl working class and I've got no doubt is a Democrat.Norma Shearer is her opposite tasteful refined and unfortunately getting a little stale with age. Why would her husband now be eying Crawford at the perfume counter if not so.Due to a lot of interference by not so well meaning friends like Rosalind Russell who does nothing but gossip about others Shearer's marriage does break up and her husband goes off with Crawford. Norma's down but not out.The Women has aged very well as entertainment. It's as fresh as it was when first presented on Broadway in 1936. There's always the complaint about no good parts for women being written for the female sex. Definitely not as good as the characters that Clare Boothe Luce created in this play.My favorite in the cast is Rosalind Russell. Usually cast as second leads and colorless heroines she fought hard for the part she got her as the heroine's best friend and worst nightmare. She also fought hard to share above the title billing with Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford who had lots more seniority at MGM than Russell. In her memoirs Russell gives total credit to George Cukor for bringing out comedic talents that no one really thought she possessed. Russell had done comedy before but had not been as well received as she was in The Women.George Cukor always had that reputation as a women's director and I think this film with the obvious title probably is what gave him that reputation. The Women takes a lot of its edge also from the real life situation at MGM. Norma Shearer being the widow of Irving Thalberg was the dowager queen of the lot and she still got the first pick of dramatic parts. Only Greta Garbo at MGM who was in a different plane of existence practically topped her. The rest got Shearer's leavings especially Joan Crawford. That led to a lot of resentment around MGM.Among the supporting cast look for good performances from Joan Fontaine as the young and shy divorce Mary Boland as the scatterbrained Zsa Zsa Gabor of the day Paulette Goddard who gets Russell's goat her man and the best of her in a chick fight and Marjorie Main as the wisecracking owner of a Reno dude ranch where the women stay when they're shedding their mates.Within two years Norma Shearer would retire from the screen and Joan Crawford in four years would leave MGM. This was the last really good film either of them did at Leo the Lion's den and it's fabulous.".

The performances all blend together perfectly which is what you need if you are going to tell a story like this. Joan Crawford is sublime as the husband stealer and Norma Shearer plays the usual virtuous kind of part she always played in her career. However in my opinion Roz Russell who played Mrs. Fowler simply is at her best. It is one of the most funny and exquisite performances that i have ever seen given by an actress on film. It is plain to see she only cares about herself and her own superficial motives but you cant help being on her side and enjoying all the trouble she stirs up. And also Paulette Goddard gave a sassy performance as the sarcastic woman who has seen it all and wants no more of it. The best scene of hers is when she and Mrs. Fowler fight at the divorce ranch. I loved this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "1939 was a TERRIBLE year to release a movie and have any hopes for an Oscar. After all GONE WITH THE WIND GOODBY MR. CHIPS MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and many many other huge profile films came out of Hollywood that year and in any other year THE WOMEN might have garnered several Oscarssuch as for Writing and Best Actress and Supporting Actress. But wonderful performances by Norma Shearer Rosalind Russell and the rest were pretty much overlooked due to a major glut in great films that year. Plus director George Cukor who was called a women's director because of how he handled women and made the most of their performances lost out to Victor Fleming for GONE WITH THE WINDeven though many different directors including Cukor had actually worked on the film producer David O. Selznick fired them faster than on possibly any film project in history.THE WOMEN is amazing because all the parts even the dogs and pieces of art throughout the film are played by females. Some ladies might love this since it is a form of giving equal time but others might be dismayed because many of the roles are pretty stereotypical and oldfashioned. I assume many of the more rabid feminists out there might strongly dislike the film because of this but in its context it's a fine film. The only part I thought was pretty lame was the very beginning where it showed the actresses onebyone and then had them turn into animals meant to symbolize their personalities. This seemed pretty heavyhanded and kind of silly. Also there are probably some guys who simply will dismiss the film because it's a chick moviebut this is a mistake because anyone with an open mind can enjoy this movie.The film is presented in three segments. The first centers on Norma Shearer's marriage and her many friends and socalled friends. It seems that everyone but Shearer knows that her husband is cheating on her with bimbo Joan Crawford. Through most of this segment Shearer is happy and oblivious. When she discovers the truth and this was handled very well in the film she is tornshe loves her husband but keeps getting barraged by messages from everyone. Her mother ably played by Lucille Watson in a less domineering part than is typical for her advises Shearer to pretend nothing is happening and it will all blow overa view that seems to be what the film is trying to tell women! This really was annoying. It seemed to say that infidelity was inevitable and women should just mind their own business!! Despite this old fashioned idea the rest of Shearer's friends and socalled friends also have a variety of opinions and some push her to get a divorce some push her to ignore it and some push her to confront the evil tramp that is breaking up the marriage. Oddly no one seemed to blame the manas if ALL men are salivating pigs who can be led anywhere by a conniving tramp. UGGGH! I hated this message but could look past it because this WAS the 1930s and because the film was brilliant in how it portrayed those who seemed to love Shearer's plightdespite the fact she was a nice and decent person. In particular Rosalind Russell was wonderfully cast as a viper of a woman who did everything to spread gossip and make the problem explode.In the second segment Shearer leaves for Reno to get a divorce. Here she is escorted by her sweet friend Joan Fontaine and she meets a lot of new friends while staying at a ranchrooming house run by the always funny Marjorie Main. This section mostly is about women's solidarity and comradeship. All this is deflated somewhat when Ms. Russell shows upas her husband just left her a smart move based on what we've seen of her.The third section takes place over a couple years. Joan Crawford is now married to Norma's exhusband and life is NOT as wonderful for this new family as you might have expected. This is due to the fact that Shearer and her ex really cared for each other AND because Crawfor turned out to be a selfish pig. And not surprisingly her new bestfriend is Rosalind Russellwho has thankfully drifted away from Shearer. What follows is very very enjoyablewith Shearer deciding maybe she wants her old husband back but not until she hatches a plan. How this all comes together in the end is GREAT and well worth seeing.Despite some complaints above the humorous and ironic script and the exceptional acting of dozens and dozens of great MGM contract actresses make this a mustsee film for old movie buffs. According to IMDb all the contract women at MGM were in the film apart from Greta Garbo and Myrna Loy. If you look close during the dressing room scene you can even see Blossum Rockthat's Grandmama from the ADDAMS FAMILY and the older sister of Jeanette MacDonald.".

Even Rosalind Russell had to prove that she was perfect for her role because the studio felt that she wouldn't make a good comedy actress! She sure showed them! Now team the comedic Roz up with the seductress Joan Crawford against the sweet Norma Shearer and watch out! As if the cast isn't enough throw in the funny Paulette Goddard and you have a very exciting hour and a half! If you love golden age comedies this will surely be a treat!  Ciao Christina";

	schema:reviewBody "There have been plenty of films with an allmale or almost allmale cast but films with an allfemale cast are much rarer in the thirties they were virtually unheardof. There were of course plenty of what were called women's pictures aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast if only as secondary characters. The Women however is a woman's picture in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism but films like this one remind us that in America at least the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shopgirl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know and so it proves here but the timelag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one largely because she has the sort of friends who in the words of the song can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldlywise old mother who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life Mary travels to Reno Nevada to obtain a divorce. In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which despite being liberal in many other matters has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law it was the last state to legalise nofault divorce as recently as 2010. Stephen marries Crystal but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary the noble idealistic longsuffering wronged wife not unattractive but a bit sexless seemed readymade for Norma Shearer who seemed to specialise insuch parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary conniving Crystal but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret but she seems to have been born around 1904 making her about 35 in 1939 only two years or so younger than Shearer. The agegap between Mary andCrystal needs to be much greater a dedicated gold digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her midthirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as The Opposite Sex Crystal was played by another Joan C Collins sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Maryfigure. The Womenis often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points there is occasionally some witty dialogue Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also however has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick the makers of The Opposite Sex clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is after all the marriage of Mary and Stephen and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is inblackandwhite but includes a tenminute fashion parade filmed inTechnicolor which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled bythe studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the welldressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times however it seems that Cukor perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst although by no means the only offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. Russell was to be better in another comedy His Girl Friday the following year. The film's third and worst fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a woman's picture it is surprisingly misogynistic embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in The Womeninhabit the sort of world where nearly all women Mary being one of the few exceptions are spiteful scheming bitchy gossipy andbackstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman often her socalled best friend who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a war of the sexes the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of the elements in this classic are sexist by today's standards and the ending is a bit of a washout. But the topnotch performances and series of zingers and oneliners transcend any plot discrepancies. But overall it is the performances that make the movie. Norma Shearer is engaging at first palling around with her daughter in the yard. Unfortunately after her husband cheats she becomes too saccharine and nobly strong to be enjoyed in an otherwise wisecracking comedy at least she's always fashion conscious during one of her numerous breakdowns she collapses on a couch that matches her plaid shirt. Joan Fontaine is an adorable parody of Shearer's soft character she's especially ridiculous and charming in a phone call to her husband at the ranch. Joan Crawford is a little too terrifyingly mean to be convincing as a sexy temptress her gorgeous and sassy coworker Virginia Grey would in reality be the more obvious choice for an erring husband but she's exuberant and energetic a welcome contrast to Shearer's refined humility. Paulette Goddard is equally exuberant and energetic exuding confidence and assurance in every line she utters. She's a foxy little charmer. Mary Boland is hilarious and giggly though her l'amour l'amour lines get a little old. Marjorie Main's appearance is all too brief her salty ranchowner a welcome change of pace from the more sophisticated lodgers.The most triumphant turn comes from Rosalind Russell as the highsterical Sylvia Fowler. It's as if an escapee from an insane asylum were masquerading as a highsociety wife turning her charade into a mad burlesque. She's wonderful. Her tall slouchy slinky frame is so perfect for the role and I can't recall having ever seen anything funnier than her cat fight with Goddard and its aftermath. You can tell you're watching an underappreciated genius at work when in a frenzy she destroys various dishes and pitchers while yelling I hate you! I hate you! I hate everybody! It's regretful that her motives and fate are left ambiguous while too much screentime is devoted to Shearer's precious tears meditating on her plight and redemption. Or her husband's redemption. Oroh who knows! The moral dilemma is too muddled and neither Cukor nor the screenwriters seem to know how to resolve it. All the attention paid to this darker storyline messes up the screwball rhythm setup by Russell and others and it's so jarring it wrecks the movie once in awhile. It's worth these occasional transgressions however for some of the finest performances to come out of old Hollywood's best actresses. Not to mention the privilege of witnessing them utter such great lines as Well let the story ride! No one will remember! You remember those awful things they said about What's her name before she jumped out that window? See I can't even remember her name so who cares? Or the classic closer There's a name for you ladies only it isn't used in high society. Outside of a kennel.".

Central to the whole is Norma Shearer whose perfect marriage is shattered by her husband's casual infidelity with onthemake shop girl Joan Crawford in a terrific venomous turn. Shearer effectively plays queen bee to the drones around her both in her society set and in the motley assemblage at the divorce farm in Reno. She makes the journey from marriage to divorce and back with dignity and intelligence and even if I personally disagree with her choice and the sickly schmaltzy closeup with which she ends the film about to fall back into her errant ex husband's arms this doesn't invalidate the fun and wit that has gone before.

Perhaps too many of the speeches are head and shoulder shots fore square to the camera and having got good play out of two servant staff extemporising the doings of their masters Cukor makes the mistake of repeating the trick immediately afterwards thus diminishing the comedic impact. Nevertheless appreciating that some of these criticisms are merely due to a retrospective eye obviously cinematic times and styles change on a film which in some respects is dated there are still some neat turns in the language and phrases used which still resonate today.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading other user comments for this film I will admit that a good many viewers saw this movie as I did a raucous freeforall with memorable quotes scenes and personalities. I do however wish to expand upon a couple of reasonably untouched areas for commentary...the understated underrated performances in the film namely Joan Fontaine's portrayal of Peggy Day and Lucille Watson's Mrs. Moorehead.One viewer commented that Fontaine's Peggy was at times along the lines of mentally retarded other user's words NOT mine. While everyone is entitled his own opinion I assert that the complete point of the Peggy character can be lost in the mix of bigger brasher characters and stars in the film. In every group of female friends there is a Peggy... the naive doeeyed woman who is unsure and uncertain and tends to seek the counsel and affirmation of her older wiser more experienced friends. When it comes down to it Peggy is a young woman newly married and dealing with the pressures of maintaining a Park Avenue life on a tight budget at least by the standards of her friends!!. She is timid and unsure and she finds solace and security in her older friends. This is incredibly normal where female relationships are concerned. So while Fontaine's performance may seem at times to be a little overdramatic remember that the whole movie is over the top. That's part of what makes it so fun. The character of Peggy merely adds a little sincerity and innocence to a plot full of backstabbing and lost youth.Peggy's polar opposite Mrs. Moorehead is yet another understated character and performance played by Lucile Watson. This woman is the mother of the wise Mary Haines and serves as Mary's sounding board. She offers advice to her daughter and dispatches sarcastic oneliners off the cuff that rival even many of Roz Russell and Paulette Goddard's best lines. She also pulls no punches with her honesty whether you agree with her or not. Her comments about those dreadful women and her fumigating scene are particularly humorous. Keep an eye on her character and I assure you the movie will be that much better!! This movie maybe more than any other I have seen depends on the presence of all of the characters to a large degree. No one in this film is there on accident...they each have a very specific purpose in the plot. Allowing oneself to really appreciate the lesser characters can only serve to make to viewing experience more enjoyable each time.".

Joan Rice is delightful as Maid Marion but ....Admittedly one shouldn't substitute 'Highland Rogue' for a documentary on Scottish history of the period.

He was one of the most passionately animated actors to achieve leading man status. His dark good looks range of expression and obvious athleticism he served as a paratrooper in WWII complemented his energetic performances.Those who after watching him have wondered why he didn't have even greater success in North America should remember two things Britain aflame with patriotic fervor after the war had a very strong film industry of its own therefore many actors felt no desire to join Hollywood's 'British Colony'. Also Todd fell slightly short pardon the pun of North America's standard for romantic leading men.For those concerned about coarse language explicit sex or graphic violence when selecting family viewing  this is a keeper. The historic struggle warm interaction between the stars and humour should satisfy the more mature members while the bright colours and action sequences should appeal to all.I first saw this movie about 45 years ago and 3 scenes stayed with me until 'my good woman' was able to find a copy for me last year. Since I watch it every month she uses it as one of her arguments when she feels a need to remind me why I should appreciate her so much! I also heartily recommend the other two movies from the trilogy as wonderful family viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walt Disney's followup to THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN 1952 is this similar epic about another legendary outlaw emanating from Scotland this time around. He is once again played by Irishman Richard Todd who has just passed away at the venerable age of 90 and the film even reunites the actor with his three costars from yet another period outing from the Disney Studios THE SWORD AND THE ROSE 1953 namely Glynis Johns James Robertson Justice and Michael Gough. For some reason the film is fairly maligned awarded a measly 12 by the Leonard Maltin Film Guide! but I rather enjoyed it while readily admitting to be the least of Disney's three colorful adventures derived from the pages of English history. In traditional Disney fashion the familiar events were simplified though by no means rendered juvenile as would often prove the case later but there is enough sprawling action and engrossing drama  to say nothing of the beautiful scenery captured in gleaming Technicolor  to please most audiences. Similarly characterization for this type of largerthanlife fare is pretty much standard but given careful casting all round it emerges as forceful rather than clichd besides at a terse 81 minutes the film has little chance of outstaying its welcome. Incidentally I had found the flabby oddly uninvolving and illcast 1995 remake which had garnered critical praise and at least one top Oscar nod back in the day a major disappointment on my sole viewing so far!".

He is once again played by Irishman Richard Todd who has just passed away at the venerable age of 90 and the film even reunites the actor with his three costars from yet another period outing from the Disney Studios THE SWORD AND THE ROSE 1953 namely Glynis Johns James Robertson Justice and Michael Gough. For some reason the film is fairly maligned awarded a measly 12 by the Leonard Maltin Film Guide! but I rather enjoyed it while readily admitting to be the least of Disney's three colorful adventures derived from the pages of English history. In traditional Disney fashion the familiar events were simplified though by no means rendered juvenile as would often prove the case later but there is enough sprawling action and engrossing drama  to say nothing of the beautiful scenery captured in gleaming Technicolor  to please most audiences. Similarly characterization for this type of largerthanlife fare is pretty much standard but given careful casting all round it emerges as forceful rather than clichd besides at a terse 81 minutes the film has little chance of outstaying its welcome. Incidentally I had found the flabby oddly uninvolving and illcast 1995 remake which had garnered critical praise and at least one top Oscar nod back in the day a major disappointment on my sole viewing so far!";

	schema:reviewBody "After the lamentably unseen The First Time the next Frank Tashlin movie showing at my local revival theater was Susan Slept Here. I was sure that SSH could not live up to the high standard set by the first film. But it did and surpassed it. Personally I think it's one of my five or ten favorite comedies. Dick Powell whom I've always loved stars as Mark Christopher a Hollywood screenwriter who hasn't had any success after winning an Oscar which incidentally serves as the narrator. He once had an idea to write a serious picture as opposed to the frivolous comedies that he has specialized in about a juvenile delinquent which he mentioned to a policeman friend of his. Well on Christmas Eve that policeman along with his partner shows up at Mark's door with a 17 yearold juvenile delinquent as a present. Her name is Susan Debbie Reynolds whom I also love almost desperately! and the policeman proposes that Mark hang around her for a couple of days you know for research. He's in a hurry to take his girlfriend the gorgeous but ferocious Anne Francis who would star in Forbidden Planet a couple of years later out on a date but that comes to an abrupt halt when Susan answers Mark's phone. You know the schtick Mark starts out annoyed at Susan but they grow attached. The age difference is brought up frequently enough so it doesn't get too creepy. Mark is 35 laugh  maybe when Powell was dancing with Busby Berkeley and Susan is 17 Reynolds was 22 at the time but she is probably the only actress who could get away with playing a teenager until she was in her 40s. For a very long time Mark doesn't respond to Susan's crush. The only major flaw in the film  and even it's acceptable  is Mark's motivation in marrying Susan. He does it he says to save her from six months jail time she has been arrested for assault on a sailor and vagrancy. It's not very believable but it's also not that big a deal.The two leads are exceptional. This was Powell's last movie. After it he retired to television although I only call it retirement as a movie snob he was enormously enormously successful in the new medium. He's more or less the straight man here. He has a particularly great scene where he watches a 20 yearold movie for which he wrote the dialogue on television. As the actors speak their horrendous dialogue we watch Powell as he mouths their words both a man's and a woman's it's a breakup scene with an embarrassed look in his eyes. If Powell is good Reynolds is masterful. She's such an odd actress not conventional in any way. She had her own niche in Hollywood. Her acting is dolllike with its jerky movements and huge facial expressions. That isn't a criticism whatsoever. I have never seen her in a straight drama the closest is How the West Was Won I'd imagine she acts differently or she never made one. In comedies like this and Singin' in the Rain she's absolutely perfect. There is not a moment when she's on screen during which I was not laughing myself to tears. The film also has one of the greatest supporting casts ever. Anne Francis I've already mentioned. I very much appreciate the fact that the writers didn't make her character abominable Susan Slept Here although it's not a musical is very much a direct descendent of An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain. One criticism I have of Singin' is that Jean Hagan's villain is too cartoonish or at least I would have that criticism if Hagan weren't so damn funny in that movie. Francis in SSH is played sympathetically for the most part. Glenda Farrell plays Mark's secretary Maude an alcoholic who answers the telephone on Christmas morning You talk I can't. Alvy Moore is Mark's friend and assistant Virgil who can crack wise with the best of them. Horace McMahon and Herb Vigran play the two cops and Les Tremayne plays Mark's lawyer who is obsessive about his therapy sessions. Red Skeleton has a wordless but amusing cameo as Maude's teenage sweetheart. 1010.".

Debbie Reynolds is cute and funny the dialogue is witty and even the kind of creepy age gap thing has its charm!  I've seen this a few times on turner classics but missed taping it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys stylish witty comedies with a twist of the surreal.";

But I've got to admit she brings genuine verve and sparkle to the role. Never mind that Dick Powell is closer to 50 than the movie claimed 35 and at least twice as old as the juvenile Reynolds. Fortunately their clinches are kept to a minimum even as the underage innuendo is exploited to the hilt for titillated 1950's audiences. If the plot skirts the bounds of good taste director Tashlin keeps things from straying with a speededup pace that allows little pause for contemplation. I would love to have been in on the meetings where studio exec's kicked this premise around for the censors.Anyway Powell is appropriately dour as the sobersided screenwriter while Glenda Farrell gets the kind of caustic role that would later suit Thelma Ritter to the proverbial T. And of course there's Alvy Moore looking like a college freshman and getting all the clever wisecracks even if in real life he was a veteran of the bloody WWII battle for Iwo Jima! Too bad Anne Francis doesn't get more screen time as the other woman. But then she does show why she deserved that dropdead sexy outfit she wore in Forbidden Planet 1956. Cult director Tashlin manages a few of trademark effects from his cartoonist past note Reynolds cooling off her libido with a swinging freezer door and of course the fantasy sequences that fit in perfectly.All in all I think RKO got away with one had the movie been handled less deftly someone might have landed in 1954's county clink.".

In Mr. Powell's last appearance on the silver screen he would soon slide over to the small screen the former juvenile crooner turned hardedged gumshoe actor finds himself entangled in one of the most bizarre babysitting assignments ever. Debbie Reynolds plays the swooning teenager placed in the charge of bachelor Powell. He's a screenwriter and she's a piece of work. Incorrigible really. Also on hand is the Amazonlike Anne Francisall 5'8 of her. She's his fianc and is striking to look at her famous facial mole comfortably in place face impeccably made up and her blue eyes popping like fireflies kissing an electric bug zapper. She's definitely a sight for sore eyes. The plot as it is revolves around Debbie trying her best to break up the upcoming marriage between Dick and Miss Francis and steal Powell for herself. Nothing new. But expertly rendered off. Oh did I mention that the proceedings occur between Christmas and New Year's Eve the twelve days of Cristmas falling firmly into play. Director Frank Tashlin has the seasonal colors lordsaleaping off the screen. I love the fake white Christmas tree adorned with blood red balls. All of the apartment's holiday decorations signal a sobering degree of suburban chic. There's a wild dream sequence involving Debbie trapped in a bird cage and Anne spinning a spider's web. Have I mentioned how lovely Anne Francis was? She's a knockout. In the end the movie is pure farce and slightly perverted. Otherwise this film might be the perfect package to open up on a Christmas morning. The RKO logo is in color and the film is narrated strangely by an Oscar statuette. So enjoy. Pass the eggnog and light the yule log please.".

	schema:headline " Somewhat curious love story plot for the 1950s...and Powell's last acting part";
	schema:reviewBody "It must have been in the air at the time though why in the Eisenhower Years? In the 1950s several films two by Billy Wilder had successful marriages between young women and middle aged men. Wilder's two films were SABRINA where Audrey Hepburn falls for Humphrey Bogart and LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON where Hepburn fell for Gary Cooper. Hepburn also was paired in FUNNY FACE with Fred Astaire. Astaire was also in the movie DADDY LONG LEGS with Leslie Caron as his ward turned lover. Caron would also be in GIGI where her little girl is paired off with a slightly older Louis Jourdan. And there was SUSAN SLEPT HERE Frank Tashlin's second feature film comedy starring Dick Powell and Debbie Reynolds. The difference in ages is mentioned  Debbie Reynolds is supposed to be 17 she was 21 at the time but Powell is supposed to be roughly 20 years older. He is supposed to have been an early Oscar winner for screenplay and to have served in the navy with his friend Virgil Alvy Moore who was his superior officer. It is possible if Powell was 55 to concede this but he is supposed to be about 43 or so. He just looks too old. But despite this the film does work. It has good lines in it particularly some zingers used by Glenda Farrell at her favorite target Anne Francis and by Les Tremayne as Powell's overwrought and overworked attorney. Powell is a successful if jaded screenwriter who is dating Anne Francis a snobbish Senator's daughter. On Christmas Eve he is visited by two members of the L.A. Vice Squad Herb Vigran and Horace MacNally who have a gift to drop off. Vigran had been an adviser on a film script that Powell worked on and the latter made the mistake of mumbling an idea about having a day or so talk with a genuine juvenile delinquent about his lifestyle. Of course the problem is he meant a male juvenile delinquent. Vigran in what is really the only weakness of the story has arrested Debbie Reynolds in a brawl with some military police but has not reported it yet. He thinks she'd be perfect to give to Powell for his research over Christmas Day Vigran eventually pays for this stupidity and it's outcome by getting demoted  he's lucky in real life he might get arrested and charged with pimping. The plan is for Debbie to be rearrested on December 26th and thus to act as though nothing wrong was done.Powell is not pleased with this  he can't depend on his secretary Farrell nor on Moore who quickly takes a powder. He tries to work around the Susan problem but no matter what he tries it blows up in his face. Worse Reynolds answers the phone by habit and Francis discovers that her boy friend has an underage girl in his house.Slowly however Powell and Reynolds settle down and learn about each other's life. It turns out Reynolds mother is out of the U.S. with her second husband a man Reynolds thinks was a better choice than the first husband who was her own father. The mother is one of these modern types and has left a note of consent for whomever Reynolds meets whom she may wish to marry. Powell finds that she is a feisty and independent young woman and he finds himself falling for her. But when Moore learns that they shared Powell's apartment for the night he drags Powell's lawyer Tremayne into it. Tremayne starts planning damage control to prevent a scandal or worse But the detectives return to pick up Reynolds Vigran's Sergeant is not very understanding about what they did  really hard to understand that reaction!!. Having sexual relations with any underage child or girl is always treated quite harshly in the U.S. but California had a really heavy reputation in this area back in the 1920s  1960s because of the Hollywood crowd. In the Marx Brothers' 1940 comedy GO WEST Groucho's name of S. Quentin Quayle was based on the term San Quentin quail which was about underaged but attractive girls who got men into serious trouble when arrested. The trial of Errol Flynn for rape in 1944 was worse because the two victims were teenage girls. I may remind you also of the still odd situation involving director Roman Polanski today concerning a statutory rape charge from California.Powell flees with Reynolds to Las Vegas where they can get legally married despite her age. He reasons that they can remain married for a few months while he is working in Sun Valley on a screenplay and she can then get the marriage annulled while he finds her a job. But Reynolds is determined to prove herself a good wife. And Powell is not all that sure if he wants her to cease being his wife  especially after Tremayne sees evidence that she may be pregnant.The wit in the script is hard to describe  it ranges from comments like Farrell momentarily thinking Reynolds has arrived in Sun Valley and welcoming her with a Come to momma but finding it is Francis whom she loathes and saying Oh Dracula's daughter! to Tremayne having a session with his psychiatrist interrupted by an angry Powell and letting Powell take over his session as Tremayne can bill him for it later. The acting is good. Anyone who thinks of Moore only as Hank Kimble on GREEN ACRES should see his rather thoughtful Virgil who gets an emotional slapintheface from Reynolds that makes him rethink himself carefully. All in all it is far better than one would have thought  given the one blunder in the screenplay that I mentioned.".

	schema:headline " Couldn't be Made Today";
	schema:reviewBody "Witty romantic comedy with a superior cast.  Contains some of the sloppiness one would expect from RKO under Hughes. Powell's character has supposed to possess one of the first writing Oscars yet he is only 35 26 years after the first Academy Awards.  Spotting Reynolds using Oscar as a nutcracker Powell drops lit cigarette on carpeted floor.  Reynolds offer Powell scrambled eggs Powell and Reynolds are then seen eating eggs over easy. However even Hughes' RKO can't ruin wonderful performances from Powell Reynolds and a fine supporting cast.  I rate this movie very highly because underneath the frothy comedy is some very uneasy themes which would garner such a movie an R rating today assuming it could be made. Though by SUSAN the 22 year old Reynolds was a real Hollywood veteran she'd made SINGIN IN THE RAIN two years earlier she plays a 17 year old which she continued to do for at least the next three years witness TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR Powell's at ten years too old for the part making the MayDecember romance issue REALLY stick out. This movie is a coming of age film for the characters portrayed by Powell Reynolds and the character Maude Powell's manhungry writing assistant Always wondered if Rose Marie's character on DICK VAN DYKE was modeled on this character.  Powell's Mark and Reynolds' Susan walk a slender tightrope which IS the fatherdaughter  daughterwife romantic conflict.  Mark is a lifelong bachelor apparently unable to commit unsure what he really wants. Susan is a young romantic certain of what she wants ready to commit. The movie has a good romantic score and a great ballad Hold My Hand. One shudders at what Hollywood would do with such a story these days.  These days they usually kill one of the members of such a match even when the female is in hear twenties.  Make the girl 17 such as here and I doubt any studio would release it. MEMO TO HOLLYWOOD  Justice William O. Douglas and Charlie Chaplin both had child brides.  Sometimes these things work. No one would believe Mark could keep his hands off Susan since the moral restrictions so prevalent up to 1960 no longer exist. Food for thought...".

	onyx:emotionText "Witty romantic comedy with a superior cast.  Contains some of the sloppiness one would expect from RKO under Hughes. Powell's character has supposed to possess one of the first writing Oscars yet he is only 35 26 years after the first Academy Awards.  Spotting Reynolds using Oscar as a nutcracker Powell drops lit cigarette on carpeted floor.  Reynolds offer Powell scrambled eggs Powell and Reynolds are then seen eating eggs over easy. However even Hughes' RKO can't ruin wonderful performances from Powell Reynolds and a fine supporting cast.  I rate this movie very highly because underneath the frothy comedy is some very uneasy themes which would garner such a movie an R rating today assuming it could be made. Though by SUSAN the 22 year old Reynolds was a real Hollywood veteran she'd made SINGIN IN THE RAIN two years earlier she plays a 17 year old which she continued to do for at least the next three years witness TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR Powell's at ten years too old for the part making the MayDecember romance issue REALLY stick out. This movie is a coming of age film for the characters portrayed by Powell Reynolds and the character Maude Powell's manhungry writing assistant Always wondered if Rose Marie's character on DICK VAN DYKE was modeled on this character.  Powell's Mark and Reynolds' Susan walk a slender tightrope which IS the fatherdaughter  daughterwife romantic conflict.  Mark is a lifelong bachelor apparently unable to commit unsure what he really wants. Susan is a young romantic certain of what she wants ready to commit. The movie has a good romantic score and a great ballad Hold My Hand. One shudders at what Hollywood would do with such a story these days.  These days they usually kill one of the members of such a match even when the female is in hear twenties.  Make the girl 17 such as here and I doubt any studio would release it. MEMO TO HOLLYWOOD  Justice William O. Douglas and Charlie Chaplin both had child brides.  Sometimes these things work. No one would believe Mark could keep his hands off Susan since the moral restrictions so prevalent up to 1960 no longer exist. Food for thought...";

	schema:headline " On paper it sounds creepy but on screen it works";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the kind of odd thing that RKO would put together on its downhill slide in the 50's that sometimes would work and sometimes would not. This time it does seem to work although an ick factor seems to be hanging around just off camera that doesn't ever quite completely present itself. At least part of the enjoyment is seeing two veterans of the 30's Warner Brothers musical comedies together playing mature roles twenty years after the fact  Dick Powell as screenwriterinarut Mark Christopher and Glenda Farrell as his secretary Maude who likes to stay inebriated but is quite the philosopher and friend during her sober moments. She still has all of the bite and fun she had when she was Torchy Blaine.The ick factor I talked about before is the marriage in name only of middleaged Mark to 17 year old Susan Landis Debbie Reynolds who is left on Mark's doorstep by the police of all people because one of the detectives thinks Susan would be good research for a serious script by Mark and plus the detective doesn't want to put her in jail on Christmas Eve. The detective promises to return for her in two days. The marriage occurs because Susan will be booked on vagrancy without a visible means of support so off they go to Vegas with Mark looking at this whole thing as a good deed to keep a basically good kid out of jail. However Susan the romantic wants it to be something more. After the wedding Mark deposits Susan back in his Hollywood apartment while he goes off to an isolated spot  without Susan  to try and redeem the script he's been writing.Susan and writer's block aren't Mark's only problems. He also has a rich girlfriend Anne Francis whom he seems to want to quit almost as much as the job at the studio he had writing fluff pieces but that paid well. It's hard to leave something behind that's comfortable and familiar for the unknown even if it's slowly strangling you.The funniest part of the movie is watching Susan after she's legally married and living apart from Mark trying to figured out how to win her man back. She tries everything from watching home movies of Mark's girlfriend and trying to imitate her moves and expressions to basting a turkey in an evening dress waiting for Mark to arrive for dinner to memorizing how to make various mixed drinks. Then you have to wonder how much of this is love and how much of this is a teenage girl's natural curiosity about sex. Since Debbie Reynolds is just five years older than the part she's playing she gives the role of Susan the realism of someone who is young enough to have recent memories of their teen years but is old enough to see the humor in them. This thing works because it is the 50's because it is Susan with all of the romantic and aggressive sexual impulses rather than Mark and because of the excellent supporting players. The one thing that doesn't quite work here is Dick Powell as a 35 year old. He seems like he's playing a man quite a bit older and more beat down than one of 35  Dick Powell was actually 50 at the time and perhaps Mark is lying  to himself and to Susan  when he says that's how old he is.This isn't a masterpiece but it is a cute romantic comedy that works.".

Powell who was about 50 at the time still looks great and her falling in love with this man is truly believable. He is reluctant to let her go to the juvenile hall and tells his lawyer he could marry her. She overhears the plot and tells him no. He runs after her and takes her to Vegas for a quickie marriage. He goes to the mountains so as not to consummate the marriage and get an annulment later. He leaves her with his best friend and by error his lawyer thinks she is pregnant. But by who? He hasn't even been there. He is furious and confronts the friend and asks her to sign the papers. It is only after she tells him that she loves pickles and strawberries for breakfast does he realize his mistake. It is a glorious romp with Powell so confused and Debbie so persistent that you will love the ride. Highly recommended piece of holiday candy.".

When they finally get around to it it's handled well but only too briefly. During the whole film you can't but notice the really obvious age difference. Dick Powell was 50 and Debbie Reynolds 22. He was old enough to be her father. He was old enough to be Anne Francis' father who was 26 at the time. The story is actually pretty good. The downside is that it's really just a comedy but occasionally it takes itself too seriously.The cast was excellent. It was great to see Glenda Farrell in a more mature part. I love her brassy style. Dick Powell was pretty good too in as someone else noted his last film. Red Skelton was a surprise. He pops up for the blink of an eye and then disappears. Anne Francis was a knockout as always. She dominated every scene and some of her lines had real zing. Thanks to TCM for running her out of circulation movies. The difference with Debbie Reynolds couldn't be more pronounced at all levels but I guess that was the point.Then there's the dream sequence one of the coolest fantasy segments I've seen in a long time. Francis appears as a spider woman spinning her web around Powell while the childwoman Reynolds attempts to keep that from happening. Again the difference between them couldn't be more pronounced. The tall curvaceous Francis was like a cool drink on a hot summer day. Reynolds was no match. She couldn't hope to compete but gave it a good try anyway. Too spunky for my taste.Bottom line it's worth watching for the actors more than anything else. You shouldn't take the story too seriously and the lines sometimes get in the way when they're just plain silly. But hey Anne Francis is in it that alone is worth a look.".

I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many coworkers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in....My response is always Well now you can".

	schema:reviewBody "Even if you're a huge Sandler fan please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy!  I bought this movie for 7.99 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked judging by the Rrating and scantilyclad women on the cover.  Well there are quite a few scantilyclad women but none get naked.  I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days.  I can be wrong.  This is like watching one of his home movies.  He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we the audience are left to dry.  This is hardly a movie!  Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is nobudget movie that's right not a lowbudget movie a NObudget movie.  So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters.  There is no steady plot it's like an extended sketch comedy showbut a crude and badly written one.  That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience.  And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line Take my wife please and the audience is on the floor?  I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here.  Sure Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in Billy Madison the midget in Happy Gilmore's Happy Place but the comedy works.  This is a strictly amateurish work and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in filmyou still won't be interested.  You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in Mixed Nuts.  Of course the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle.  Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance Billy Zane Titanic has a supporting role and the great Burt Young from the Rocky movies has a significant role.  This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99cent rental section of your local video storeand rightfully so. My score  3 out of 10".

His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character. The majority of the film's jokes come from Sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin Sandler's career. Pass this one up at the video store I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering that Adam Sandler was young and inexperienced I guess you can't fault him too much for appearing in this terrible film. The amazing thing however is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a standup comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as wellyet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.The film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character actually as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countriesbut often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally the ladies have no charisma or personalitiesthey are just eye candyjust bodies to jiggle past the screen.So we have semisexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoidsthis is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name Shecky Moskowitz. Wow that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh and if you are wondering I did really enjoy many of his films such as REIGN ON ME WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER. I just marvel however at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.Giving a film a 1 for me is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis Ed Wood Al Adamson Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score as it is unlikable cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb.".

The groundbreaking show featured hip clothing for the time as well as lots of music playing hits or otherwise when there was no dialogue. Today we don't have that in films or T.V. but in the last great decade it was everywhere. I've wondered if there ever was a true 90's movie?And God Created Woman continues this trend. This film was made during the hip trend of the late 80's when people gave up their feathered mullets and ugly tanktops and started wearing the suits hats and skinny ties that were in style. The ladies would wear acidwash jeans and whatnot.This story is a different version of the original Bardot film that made Roger Vadim a star. In this one Rebecca De Mornay plays Robin Shea a convict who wants to make it big as a rock 'n roll star. However she is doing time for something and she has to wait for her parole. The story that unfolds is the kind of unbelievable pap that came out in the 50's but is set in the 80's. It's just a fairy tale. The story is too mundane to even explain because you've seen it before.I will say that the acting is mediocre at best. Only Vincent Spano who plays a decent guy who ends up in cahoots with De Mornay delivers a good performance. Frank Langella sleepwalks his way through his role as a prospective candidate for the governship of New Mexico who also gets involved with De Mornay. De Mornay herself is very cute but plays a rogue who nobody would approve of. Everyone else is just a cardboard extra. The soundtrack is decent all movies came out with a soundtrack it seemed. All in all not good but better than the crap coming out today I guess.".

The moment is quickly ruined by a music sequence or however else Vadim over idealises his leading lady. It turns out this scene indicates DeMornay's desire to escape from prison and pursue her realistic dream of being a famous rock and roll star. The whole experience starts getting humorous when DeMornay is sent back to prison and arranges to marry a young carpenter to beat parole on the advice of Frank Langella a candidate running for governor of New Mexico that ran into DeMornay during her failed escape from prison. Despite the obvious predictability of the love triangle that film will pursue the film is redeemed from plenty of comedic moments thanks to the strong performances from DeMornay and a whole cast of unknown actors. It turns out irresponsible screw ups are a great source of comedy. However plenty of embarrassing moments continue to show up in the film including a cringe worthy disrobing of some random actress who rocked up to work in granny panties and a nauseating navel gazing Langella. It is pretty depressing seeing how easily the men in this film can be led just because someone is attractive regardless what a terrible human being said person is. I think the film is meant to be a farce it's all very light hearted with some tacky New Romantic 80s pop thrown in.".

It turns out he's visiting the prison and he tells her to sneak back in. She runs into carpenter Billy Moran Vincent Spano who helps her and has sex with her. She calls up Tiernan who tells her to get marry for a better chance at parole. She offers 5k to Moran to marry her. She gets parole and moves in with him who lives with his son Timmy and his brother Peter. The usual relationship struggles.This is notable for director Roger Vadim revisiting his iconic creation.

She calls up Tiernan who tells her to get marry for a better chance at parole. She offers 5k to Moran to marry her. She gets parole and moves in with him who lives with his son Timmy and his brother Peter. The usual relationship struggles.This is notable for director Roger Vadim revisiting his iconic creation.

A lot of user reviews on this movie are saying its basically crap.. Um.. NO!!Im a HUGE Frank Langella Fan.. and I remember my first reaction.. it was the same as my second reaction watching it last night. more on it below  The basic story in the movie is Rebecca DeMornay's character Robin Shay marries a man she met while breaking in to prison.. Just to get out of Prison again.. She starts an unlikely friendship between the Governor tobe James Teirnan  played by Langella 3  So the marriage is not going too great and they both cheat... Rebecca's character with Frank Langella's character. She starts up a band with her brother inlaw and other guys and after being caught having sex with her husband on camera.. she needed to get on Tiernan's good side so she played at his fundraiser and basically made him win.Let me tell you why this movie was so amazing and will forever be in my top 5 movies EVER! 2 words. FRANK LANGELLA!I knew this movie was gonna be good even when I saw the trailer.. Im not joking.. this is ONE of the sexiest roles he has EVER played.. All throughout the movie the viewers can see that Tiernan wants Shay by a simple hug phone call.. Then my favourite scene EVER in the movie was the seduction scene.It starts out with them playing pool and drinking.. as the game progresses he leans in to kiss her she pulls back.. When she tells him  One more game the winner says due the loser dies she lays on the table.. he makes his way to her  spreads her legs picks her up as they are inches away from kissing.. he says your on. I could've died right there. After the pool game is over he loses so he asks her what you want?! she then replies  get down on your knees !! she spreads her legs he takes off her belt ever so intensely.. kissing her stomach licking her belly button.. and just starts... OH MY GOD!! The next scene with them shows Tiernan in a hot tub.. they are kissing and I know what she was doing with her hand lol It then shows him on top of her kissing her body.. After they had finished he politely asks her to stay the night and she rejects him ..  if I were her I wouldn't have rejected him   not even now. YUM lolEvery smirk smile pleasurable face he made was amazing.. My reaction to those scenes is the same every time sometimes i think i need an oxygen tank not because of the go to obvious answer but because i was surprised and happy also hes soo manly. I'd actually need to stop the movie just to calm down lolcase and point this movie deserves more than a 1010 rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anders Thomas Jensen has with his earlier films De grnne slagtere and Blinkende lygter convinced the audience of his scriptwriting talents especially his distinct sense of dark humour. Adams bler clearly a more ambitious project is now gaining him recognition as a director with a vision. Apart from merely being amusing and intriguing as a comedy the film succeeds in communicating a meaningful message to the audience while being deep and sufficiently complex in its values. Indeed the film's central theme questions our central notion of good and evil without giving definite conclusions whether there really exist absolute values is eventually left unanswered. Which is better of the two the blindly devoted and fanatically optimistic priest Ivan or the nihilistic neoNazi Adam? Jensen attempts to twist the basic setting by making Ivan appear rather unsympathetic while he helps people as a priest he doesn't seem to do it because of them but rather because of his faith alone. It is often Adam who notices this not failing to observe almost objecting to the weaknesses of Ivan's behaviour and yes it is the coldhearted evil Adam who seems to care more and more as the story goes on.It is difficult to sum up the whole film with only a couple of words. Mixing biblical allegories especially the story of Job the Fall being also an essential part of the film yet not actually in the plot itself with modern drama and dark comedy Adams bler does not fit into traditional categories. As a comedy it doesn't straightforwardly tell what to laugh at but the humorous is intertwined with absolutely serious elements. Thus the movie examines the outskirts of comedy and humour it encourages the viewer to ponder whether the events are humorous or not. Even the music doesn't correspond with the comedy genre at all but is constantly foreboding and solemn. It is a versatile film but despite the exceptional blend it succeeds in keeping the story together. And it's a good story.Characters are well built and well played. Ulrich Thomsen gives perhaps his best performance to date as Adam challenged only by his role in Festen and so does Mads Mikkelsen as Ivan.

	onyx:emotionText "Anders Thomas Jensen has with his earlier films De grnne slagtere and Blinkende lygter convinced the audience of his scriptwriting talents especially his distinct sense of dark humour. Adams bler clearly a more ambitious project is now gaining him recognition as a director with a vision. Apart from merely being amusing and intriguing as a comedy the film succeeds in communicating a meaningful message to the audience while being deep and sufficiently complex in its values. Indeed the film's central theme questions our central notion of good and evil without giving definite conclusions whether there really exist absolute values is eventually left unanswered. Which is better of the two the blindly devoted and fanatically optimistic priest Ivan or the nihilistic neoNazi Adam? Jensen attempts to twist the basic setting by making Ivan appear rather unsympathetic while he helps people as a priest he doesn't seem to do it because of them but rather because of his faith alone. It is often Adam who notices this not failing to observe almost objecting to the weaknesses of Ivan's behaviour and yes it is the coldhearted evil Adam who seems to care more and more as the story goes on.It is difficult to sum up the whole film with only a couple of words. Mixing biblical allegories especially the story of Job the Fall being also an essential part of the film yet not actually in the plot itself with modern drama and dark comedy Adams bler does not fit into traditional categories. As a comedy it doesn't straightforwardly tell what to laugh at but the humorous is intertwined with absolutely serious elements. Thus the movie examines the outskirts of comedy and humour it encourages the viewer to ponder whether the events are humorous or not. Even the music doesn't correspond with the comedy genre at all but is constantly foreboding and solemn. It is a versatile film but despite the exceptional blend it succeeds in keeping the story together. And it's a good story.Characters are well built and well played. Ulrich Thomsen gives perhaps his best performance to date as Adam challenged only by his role in Festen and so does Mads Mikkelsen as Ivan. Nicolas Bro Ali Kazim and Paprika Steen must also be commended for their roles. Bro is a kleptomaniac and a drunkard Kazim plays an immigrant Robin Hood gone bad and Paprika Steen delivers a steady performance as an unbalanced future mother considering abortion. Special mention goes to Ole Thestrup as the devilishly comical almost malicious though we are not quite sure Dr. Kolberg who while joking with his patients misfortunes in lovable dialect and showing virtually no respect to any taboos fails to demonstrate signs of empathy or other proper human feelings.

Jensen the writerdirector doesn't milk any scenes for a cheap emotional catharsis rather he carries you along through the characters' personal evolution in the most genuine way possible. FYI the way the subtitles were handled made them extremely easy to read so if you typically shy away from films with subtitles these are more userfriendly.".

The pastor asks our newcomer Adam to set a personal goal as the others have done and he's meant to ease back into society while pursuing it. His goal involves the plentiful apples growing on the church grounds.

Adam is a neoNazi who has been released from prison to enter a work program run by Ivan a country minister. Ivan is exasperatingly optimistic and doesn't seem to be able to acknowledge any real evil in the world. Adam  the personification of hate and evil  seeks to destroy Ivan in any way he can.Adam is added to a motley crew being sheltered  and supposedly reformed  by Ivan. Gunnar is a gluttonous thief who surely is not on the path to reform as he just sits around all day eating whenever he is not stealing from someone at the rectory. Khalid is a Pakistani radical who sees himself as a modernday Robin Hood who hates Denmark and all Danes and wishes to get out of the country.

Adam is given the job of caring for the pride of the garden  an apple tree. Needlesstosay Adam totally shirks his responsibility because he has developed a manic desire to destroy Ivan.Another wry character in this tongueincheek delight of a film is Dr. Kolberg who supposedly takes care of Ivan's health issues. It is disclosed fairly early in the film that Ivan has a brain tumor and has little time to live. Dr. Kolberg is definitely not your gentle loving family doctor. This character is great fun.Adam is played to perfection by Ulrich Thomsen in a beautifully understated fashion. Mads Mikkelsen as Ivan has the looks that fulfilled the idea of a Danish minister and an offthecuff manner in his portrayal that is absorbing.Even with its dark comic nature Adam's Apples is also a fascinating drama and an enlightening look at good evil and the power of faith.".

If i had to use one word to sumup the movie it would be Touching. The least thing i can say is that you will surely enjoy watching it whether you like it's surprising plot twists or moral lessons. This is a movie that everyone needs to see. It will make you laugh when you're not supposed to do. It will make you cry when you shouldn't feel like doing so. It is one of the few movies that are getting better the more often i watch them. But still i cannot completely categorize it.

If i had to use one word to sumup the movie it would be Touching. The least thing i can say is that you will surely enjoy watching it whether you like it's surprising plot twists or moral lessons. This is a movie that everyone needs to see. It will make you laugh when you're not supposed to do. It will make you cry when you shouldn't feel like doing so. It is one of the few movies that are getting better the more often i watch them. But still i cannot completely categorize it. All i know is that it should be more famous than it is.1010 my favorite movie";

Together with a series of bizarre situations all portrayed as relatively mundane happenings the film creates an atmosphere quite akin to the books of the great magical realist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As the story becomes liberated from the constraints of realist narratives we as viewers are allowed to laugh in a lighthearted way. We are no longer watching a realist odyssey and consequently there is no such catharsis as for instance with Lars von Trier's Dancer In The Dark rather than that the film provides an opaque screen where we project our own emotions. Since the movie presents bizarre or unreal occurrences in a matteroffact way one finds it difficult to ascribe a clear definite meaning to them. One is thus forced to create one's own meaning or abolish the idea of 'meaning' altogether as it often happens with magical realist texts. Some reviewers admit feeling guilty while laughing in the course of the film. My laughter on the other hand was liberating and quite unstoppable. The movie is a magical realist take on the Book of Job  and a hilarious one at that.".

Thomas bought the movie rights before Orlean wrote the book when it was only an article in The New Yorker. The book details the story of rare orchid hunter John Laroche whose passion for orchids and horticulture made Orlean discover passion and beauty for the first time in her life. Charlie wants to be faithful to the book in his adaptation but despite Laroche himself being an interesting character in his own right Charlie is having difficulty finding enough material in Laroche to fill a movie while equally not having enough to say cinematically about the beauty of orchids. At the same time Charlie is going through other issues in his life. His insecurity as a person doesn't allow him to act upon his feelings for Amelia Kavan who is interested in him as a man.

They make claims such as Kaufman's script was great until the end or Why did Kaufman talk about not wanting to hollywoodize his script and then do it in the end anyway?I don't think most people understand why he did it.Throughout the movie Kaufman's character keeps stressing how much he doesn't want to make a Hollywood film. Hollywoodtype films have sex drugs car chases and most importantly characters who succeed in the end. So at a glance it seems that Kaufman goes against his inner most desires regarding the film because he does hollywoodize it. But that is what I find to be the most clever part of his screenplay. To explain my point try to imagine thiswhat if Kaufman did not hollywoodize his script? If he didn't do it Kaufman would not have added car chases sex and drugs. So in a way if this were the case Kaufman would have succeeded. But you see that is the point. Kaufman DID NOT want his character to succeed in the end. Like he explained throughout the movie I don't want to have a film...where characters succeed in the end. Thus since Kaufman ultimately fails at his attempt to adapt Susan Orlean's book into a screenplay in how he originally intended he delivers a screenplay that is not your normal hollywood film i.e. a film where the protagonist prevails.Basically in order to make his film unhollywood he hollywoodizes it. Can nobody see the genius of this? Anyway I just thought that I could offer everyone my take on the movie so that you all may perceive Kaufman's ending in a different light.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999 screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's nonfiction novel The Orchid Thief for the screen. However it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze who had also directed Being John Malkovich returned to direct Adaptation the quirky twisting selfreferential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film '8' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman the lonely insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt The Orchid Thief written by Susan Orlean who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche played by Chris Cooper a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother Donald also played by Nicolas Cage who is Charlie's exact opposite reckless carefree overconfident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story more dramatic flashbacks take place we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation a brief history of the grim activity of orchidhunting and in one particularly impressive sequence we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.Though purportedly based on a true story the events of the film are highly fictionalised and the story always treads a fine line with reality with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real in the context of the film or merely a creation of Charlie's or even Donald's imagination. Charlie Kaufman the truelife writer not the character often receives most of the accolades for the film but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute Adaptation on screen. His approach to filmmaking is always original and daring never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clichs of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird twisted fascinating 'Being John Malkovich' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director who started his career directing music videos seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.In addition to a clever story 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest roles of his career Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie whilst writing his adaptation is determined to avoid the usual clichs and construct a film without any conventional plot to write a movie simply about flowers. Donald however blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller entitled 'The 3' in which the serial killer his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent and often absolutely hilarious as both characters giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.Meryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean the journalist for The New Yorker who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche whose tragedyafflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields such as orchidcollecting or fishcollecting each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on to adapt to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.In a nutshell 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script without cramming in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. However after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screenwriting seminar by Robert McKee memorably played by Brian Cox  who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina  is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script but ironically Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!".

Add to that the twin brother Donald Kaufman who's also writing some parts. Or is he...? Does he even exist at all?The most confusing and amusing part is that movieKaufman that's Cage is talking about making this movie. He's telling himself 'we open with a van on the highway' and we've actually seen that part. It goes even beyond that when we hear him talk to his recorder 'Charlie Kaufman is talking to his recorder'. I loved that part.But it's a movie you have to go along with. Kaufman and Jonze try desperately to be clever and they've managed to do so. It's one of the most original movies of the last ten years but I'm sure it's not for all tastes. If you like Being John Malkovich you should probably give it a go though.My score 810.".

I passed on without much thought considering it a disappointment and leaving my critique for those who cared to read it.It remains the single comment to have generated the most feedback for me. More than The Passion of the Christ and more than yes even my upsetting review of 2003's Peter Pan which seemed to anger the small diehard fanbase for the film that lurks on these message boards  by the way I've had to clarify this sentence by adding for the film because someone PM'd me yesterday accusing me of implying I have a fanbase on IMDb...no I am referring to the film's fanbase so please hold off on the accusations. I digress. In summary I gave Adaptation a negative rating and to my surprise perhaps because I avoided totally slamming the film the fans responded to me with kind words rather than harsh ones conceivably they too had initially taken a dislike to the film? I made a daring move. I bought Adaptation on DVD for ten bucks thinking I've got nothing to lose. Plus the front cover looked cool anyway.I watched it again after taking into mind several themes and selfreferential layers I had failed to visualize before and was blown away by the originality and genius of the movie.My hugest complaint regarding Adaptation originally was its absurd ending  I felt it was out of place silly and totally anticlimactic. Little did I realize this was the point  to be a parody of the typical Hollywood blockbuster.There are so many underlying jokes gags and selfreferences that the film grows better  like Back to the Future  on each new viewing. You're always finding new stuff.I found new respect for Nicolas Cage as an actor after my second viewing of this. I have always liked Cage despite the criticism he receives for being a onesided actor here he proves he's capable of creating two very different human beings out of the same mold. Brilliant Oscarworthy stuff.All in all I got it wrong the first time. Adaptation isn't a film that starts out clever and descends into a messy and stupid finish. Well actually it is. But that's the point. I didn't get it before. Now I do.If you disliked this film my advice? Watch it again. It knows a bit more about itself than you probably do. And read up on the message boards here a bit to get a clearer grasp of what's going on if you're totally clueless.P.S.

By my viewing that's a fairly accurate descriptionif you add neurotic. Anyhow Kaufman is a talented screenwriter who after writing what is his script of a lifetime' Being John Malkovich he takes on a project that is over his headadapting Susan Orlean's Meryl Streep book The Orchid Thief' into an amazing film about flowers that will stun and amaze all.The plot diverges here. One path follows Kaufman along the road to the inevitable breakdown of writer's block that forces him to jump from idea to idea in vain attempt to write a screenplay until he commits the cardinal sin of screenwritingwriting himself into the script. This is not helped in the least by his hack brother Donald Nicholas Cage successfully working on his own script a complete antithesis of his own.The other road follows Orlean as she goes about writing her book three years earlier. The book is about a dentally challenged Floridian orchid thief John Laroche Chris Cooper who is personable enough to cause Orlean to fall for him his drugs and his outsidethelaw lifestyle.As you might well imagine this is not your usual Fridaynight flick. The complexity of three separate yet interwoven plots Laroche the thief Orlean writing about the thief and Kaufman writing about the writer writing about the thief is stunning and the end for those who will get it I did not at first will blow you away once it hits youI'll give you a bit of help in knowing why the ending works later on. Oh and Charlie but not Donald Kaufman Susan Orlean and John Laroche are all real people which will make the film infinitely easier to understand.Nicholas Cage is amazing. To have to carry out the performances of two different characters is certainly a feat but to do it with such widely disparate characters like the Kaufmans is really nothing less than wondrous. Not to be outdone Meryl Streep is superb especially in the third act of the movie when her character becomes a more physical one. As for Cooper well I don't want to insult the guy but he comes across as a redneck hick and a shyster which is exactly what the script demanded.All glory praise and honor for these fine actors would be for naught had it not been for director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman see that name before?. What they have done is simply amazing and is a tribute to their brilliance. Visually the film does not stand out much except for the fastaction evolution sequences that are worth their while. In short kudos to the entire staff.I promised earlier to give you some help in figuring out why the ending worksbefore I thought of this nugget of info instead of studying antiderivatives the ending had me confused and slightly angry. The key to the ending is in the opening credits in the line Written by Charlie and Donald Kaufman'. Good luck in comprehending the ending. I give this film my first 10 of the year.".

One of the best and definitive films of the 21st Century.Nicolas Cage has two parts in this film Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman twin brothers. Both screen writers. Charlie is writing a screenplay based on a book called The Orchid Thief a real book. But nothing happens in it. He is finding it hard to stay true to the book when there's no events in the book. Writer's block. Meanwhile Donald is storming through his screenplay which is about a serial killer with split personalities  a theme regularly used in cinema today. This is a take on how and why there are so many teen horrors with crappy ideas while films that would appeal to a smaller audience are harder to conjure. During the course of Adaptation. we see Charlie's screenplay The Orchid Thief showing as it would if it became a film featuring the author Susan Orlean Meryl Streep and the books protagonist John Laroche Chris Cooper.Charlie Kaufman the character is one of the most relatable characters in cinema for me. He too is looking for inspiration something to help achieve his dreams but he can't seem to find it. He waits for something to come and change his life for the good but never takes the opportunity. He worries about the most insignificant things that aren't lifechanging. But the difference to me and Kaufman is that he finds the way. In the end he has learnt his lesson and learnt how to live life. I am going to take the same advice. His narration gives us a very detailed guide of his feelings and thoughts.Nic Cage gives a redeeming performance and one of the best of his career as both Charlie and Donald. They are very different personalitywise Charlie being nervous and frustrated while Donald is almost too upbeat about everything. His chemistry with himself is incredible its hard to believe they are the same. Chris Cooper delivers an Oscar winning performance and it sure was worthy. Very fun character taking away his seriousness whenever he should be serious. Meryl Streep is also flawless giving a performance which she shows her moods appropriate to the scene.Spike Jonze gives us a very interesting directional view. With a lot of tiein's with Being John Malkovich his previous film to show us his own little world where anything can happen. There are also a lot of tiein's with the film itself in which Kaufman comes up with an idea for the script in the film when it actually happens in this film while his ideas are for The Orchid Thief. And of course there is the strange factor in which Charlie Kaufman has included himself in his screenplay and in the film the character Charlie Kaufman has included himself in his own screenplay. It is truly hard to believe how Kaufman comes up with this stuff.This may lack the dark style of Being John Malkovich but they are in the same world. Don't miss this moving comedy and hilarious drama. I can't help but get lost in its wonder.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Adaptation 2002I adapted. I evolved. My second take on this movie was a turnaround from the first when I thought it was needlessly complicated and selfabsorbed. After all the lead character is the screenwriter and he's so full of himself and his selfpitying diary entries he has an identical twin to double the narcissism. I remembered enjoying it but thinking it wheedling and grad school ultraclever too.But that's not it at all. This is a movie that is all about plot construction but not about being inside the plot in the normal viewerfilmmaker way. For me I couldn't just watch to see what was going to happen next. Things happen there is a true climax of an ending but it's how they happen that matters. The layering of time frames is paralleled by the layering of realitiesuntil you realize that it's all real and that the supposed movie being written is and isn't the movie we are watching. Or if it is totally and we see it's genesis on screen it is still a screenplay about something real. Or not once you see that the book The Orchid Thief which is a real book by Susan Orlean is not Adaptation at all but just a thread for Kaufman to weave these different personalities and plots together. Fiction or fact who cares? Well that's part of the film's cunningthere's even a cameo of John Malkovich at the start and a shot of that famous Being John Malkovich set of the half sized floor 7  in an office building. And for the record there is a Ghost Orchid that grows in the Everglades Polyrrhiza lindenii and yes you can now buy it legally from growers with greenhouses. But Charles Kaufman the very real screenwriter Being John Malkovich of course and Synecdoche New York is played by an actor Nicholas Cage with Cage's usual nervous ticks and uneasiness. Perfect for this role.But does it all work? On the brain yes. It's fascinating and engrossing the work of a screenwriter showing off his chops. Is there suspense? Not really even though it involves thieves and guns and romance. More telling do we care about the characters? Nope again. Not for me. I'm curious about these peopleMeryl Streep as the writer of the book and Chris Cooper as the orchid thief are both right onbut not worried about their survival in love or in life. Still I had to see every minute because I wanted to see how these very disparate characters were used to construct the construction to force a point.To say the movie isn't original or well done is foolish. The director? The redoubtable Spike Jonze who seems to have let Kaufman lead the way so the filming per se is excellent without being notable. You can't quite tell he's a television commercial director but once you find that out it makes sense and the movie is broken into short pieces not unlike your average t.v. experience.To say Adaptation isn't to your taste is of course very reasonable. But if you can watch it the way I did the second time open to its inner meanderings and the jumping from layer to layer open that is to the working of the narrative plot stripped bare you'll be glued.".

	onyx:emotionText "Adaptation 2002I adapted. I evolved. My second take on this movie was a turnaround from the first when I thought it was needlessly complicated and selfabsorbed. After all the lead character is the screenwriter and he's so full of himself and his selfpitying diary entries he has an identical twin to double the narcissism. I remembered enjoying it but thinking it wheedling and grad school ultraclever too.But that's not it at all. This is a movie that is all about plot construction but not about being inside the plot in the normal viewerfilmmaker way. For me I couldn't just watch to see what was going to happen next. Things happen there is a true climax of an ending but it's how they happen that matters. The layering of time frames is paralleled by the layering of realitiesuntil you realize that it's all real and that the supposed movie being written is and isn't the movie we are watching. Or if it is totally and we see it's genesis on screen it is still a screenplay about something real. Or not once you see that the book The Orchid Thief which is a real book by Susan Orlean is not Adaptation at all but just a thread for Kaufman to weave these different personalities and plots together. Fiction or fact who cares? Well that's part of the film's cunningthere's even a cameo of John Malkovich at the start and a shot of that famous Being John Malkovich set of the half sized floor 7  in an office building.

I haven't liked Cage this much since Raising Arizona and I actually wanted to bang Streep at one point in the film.By the way this film does feature two of the most realistic and violent car crashes I've seen in a movie theater which is why I wasn't smirking the whole time.  Great effect but damn if I'll be driving with out wearing my seatbelt for the next 50 years.Anyway time for spoilers... I'll head down a bit but don't say I didn't warn you.Okay still here?  Too bad here we go.I want to read this script.  I've got a group of guys I went to High School with and we're all into something film related at this point.  One wants to be a directorwriter the other an editor and there's a character actor in there as well.  I like to consider myself a writer but let's face it I'm dumb.  Anyway I dubbed myself the Jerry Bruckheimer of the group because I like big fancy action scenes and crap like that.I'm Donald Kaufman.On the print I saw and I'm not sure if anyone else's did this because I've only seen the film once mind you but when Charlie calls Donald to ask him to come to New York it looks like the film stock or filter completely changes.  That's where Donald starts writing the movie in my opinion. Sure Charlie gets in little bits of him here and there but from that point on it's Donald.The spying the drugs the car chase the romp in the swamp gunplay the turning of Cooper and Streep's characters into villains when they're anything but... Hell it turned into a nightmarish Hardy Boys Adventure. I could almost read the phrase SUDDENLY! An alligator attacks Laroche!. Ah.  Sure it's a bit pompous but hey that last 30 odd minutes is one big joke on piss poor writers like myself.Here's hoping Kaufman's next movie is THE THREE some could argue that the end result of this movie is The Three but come on Who wouldn't enjoy that idiotic story?".

The contrast drove the movie.  Do we all want to be interesting creatures of Hollywood then?

Chris Cooper's performance as John LaRoche was something I'd never seen before on the screen.  That's always a reason to make a movie.

	schema:reviewBody "In Modernism reality used to validate media. In Postmodernism media validates reality.  Brad Holland In real life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to write a screenplay based on journalist Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief. This novel and the 1994 New Yorker magazine article upon which it was based told the story of an orchid thief called John Laroche his arrest for poaching a rare orchid and the subsequent relationship he develops with Susan Orlean.Unable to adapt The Orchid Thief and struggling to compress the novel down to a filmable form Kaufman eventually gave up and instead decided to write a script based on how much trouble he was having adapting the book. In the film based on this script now titled Adaptation and directed by Spike Jonze Larouch is played by Chris Cooper Orlean is played by Meryl Streep and actor Nicholas Cage plays a slightly more neurotic version of the neurotic Charlie Kaufman. Overcome by selfloathing and existential angst CageKaufman is not only constantly berating himself for being bald fat socially inept and incompetent but constantly moaning about how difficult adapting Orlean's book is.Why is the book so difficult to adapt? Because CageKaufman says it is real. The book's dramatic arcs aren't resolved there is no central theme and like real life its character's don't learn anything grow or change. Yes the novel contains sizable patches of poetic musing and beautiful existential ruminations but while these are of high literary quality Kaufman believes they cannot be translated to film.And so what Kaufman and his Nicholas Cage avatar decide they need is a central theme. A common thread to hold everything together. His answer postmodern selfreference. In other words the theme of the film is the act of writing the film.And that's where the title of the film comes in. Adaptation refers not only to the act of adapting a screenplay from a novel but a sort of evolutionary adaptation where organisms humans and artists constantly bend to survive. And so the film is one big Darwinian family tree life adapting into article article adapting into novel novel adapting into screenplay screenplay adapting into movie. And along this artistic evolutionary process there are external forces that mutate for good and bad the thread of the original idea.Because the adaptation of one story into a next is too smug and simplistic for Kaufman his character states this himself in the film he tries to envelope other characters into this theme. And so the entire cast of the film is adapting to their surroundings switching jobs turning their backs to previous lives careers or roles and learning to restart and readapt to new situations. To emphasise this theme Kaufman has one character listening to a tape of Darwin's On the Origins of Species the sequel to which not mentioned in the film was Darwin's Fertilisation of Orchids a book which explored the complex relationship between insects and plants and the way they slowly adapt to one another.Unexpectedly Jonze keeps a tight reign on Kaufman's wild imagination. The film is zany but because it is filmed in a rather lowkey style never degenerates into quirky surrealism and easy irony. Gradually however we become aware that the scenes between Cooper and Streep are easily the movie's most engaging and insightful and the observations attributed to or taken from Orlean's book are more provocative than any of the metaironic musings generated by Kaufman. Elsewhere Jonze provides the audience with glimpses of Orlean's book via narration as Cage obsessively reads through it and even has Kaufman's character commenting on how brilliant Orlean's writing is. The effect is such that the film celebrates the book whilst admitting that nothing it does can convey or compete with its insights. This results in a rather schizoid film half of the film great possessing the insights of a talented writer and journalist the other half drowned in Kaufman's postmodern metagymnastics and gloomy selfloathing. In other words Orlean is sensitive and perceptive about human behaviour whilst Kaufman is mockingly irreverent.How to end such a schizoid film? Kaufman in real life has no idea. And so he has his Cage avatar wrestle with this problem and then seek advice from a screen writing expert. The eventual solution Kaufman invents a twin brother named Donald who's identical to him physically but 100 his opposite intellectually. Easygoing unpretentious and entirely void of originality Donald decides he wants to be a screenwriter too and the lion's share of the film's comedy arises from Cage's derision of his brother's ideas. And so Donald quickly becomes the kind of easy target the director Robert Altman served up at the end of The Player. Kaufman moulds him into a symbol for everything derivative and dumb about mainstream filmmaking  a love for serial killers multiple personality plot lines sex gunfights murder drugs car chases etc  but his real function is to inject nihilism into the actual form of the film. Donald and his cosmically random death is the catalyst which terminates the entire story the film selfconsciously using a cop out ending in which Orlean and Cooper become villains who kill everyone and dramatically end the narrative.This last act of the film thus serves three functions it's a dumb and derivative parody which hypocritically mocks that which it embraces it's a selfreferential deus ex machina used to arbitrarily end the film and more importantly it's an admittance that Orlean's book is so real and true that it can not begin on film let alone end which is itself a sort of artistic defeatism.7.910  Excellent at times but also insufferably postmodern vapid and with little understanding of real artists real people and the artistic process itself. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adaptation is an offthewall film with a startling second half. Overall the film is darkly comic but viewers get an unexpected dose of movie action and violence before everything is said and done.It's fair to say that there is a fair amount of violence in the film and even when you know it's coming you're still caught off guard.  Spike Jonze is merciless in this regard.  Some of the scenes are incredibly graphic in fact.There is a certain adolescent male tone to the film the violence  sexual fantasy  masturbation.  This is partially due to characterization and partially due to the director's own aesthetic and perspective.  It's not a bad thing necessarily either.  It just feels as if an unassuming white male kid who grew up thinking a lot about girls and watching movies where stuff blowed up made this film...  See it and you'll know what I'm saying.The script is crazy.  Absolutely zany.  Akin to Being John Malkovich really.  Fortunately this well gives opportunity for Nic Cage Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper to really be free with their art.Cage has a difficult role portraying two very different identical twin brothers.  Cage is at the emotional core of the film.  If his performance doesn't resonate the film doesn't work.  I thought Cage was excellent. And that the script really gives him some wonderful challenging material to work with.  His first scene with Tilda Swinton looking gorgeous! is excellent.Meryl Streep...well what can be said.  She's fantastic.  She exudes a tiredness and connectedness and hopelessness and sadness evolving the character brilliantly over the course of the film.Similarly Chris Cooper brings a humanity to the role of the Orchad Thief really grounding the narrative and making it all believable.  Again he's given a brilliant opening scene and he works wonders with it. Throughout he is believably arrogant lonely vulnerable and just plain real. Cooper's performance is as rich as any other I've seen this year truly truly sublime.Adaptation is certainly not for everyone.  If you're looking for something starkly different and simmering with originality give this film a try though.  Amidst some cloying selfreferential claptrap there are actually some really freshing film moments.".

It just feels as if an unassuming white male kid who grew up thinking a lot about girls and watching movies where stuff blowed up made this film...  See it and you'll know what I'm saying.The script is crazy.  Absolutely zany.  Akin to Being John Malkovich really.  Fortunately this well gives opportunity for Nic Cage Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper to really be free with their art.Cage has a difficult role portraying two very different identical twin brothers.  Cage is at the emotional core of the film.  If his performance doesn't resonate the film doesn't work.  I thought Cage was excellent. And that the script really gives him some wonderful challenging material to work with.  His first scene with Tilda Swinton looking gorgeous! is excellent.Meryl Streep...well what can be said.  She's fantastic.  She exudes a tiredness and connectedness and hopelessness and sadness evolving the character brilliantly over the course of the film.Similarly Chris Cooper brings a humanity to the role of the Orchad Thief really grounding the narrative and making it all believable.  Again he's given a brilliant opening scene and he works wonders with it. Throughout he is believably arrogant lonely vulnerable and just plain real. Cooper's performance is as rich as any other I've seen this year truly truly sublime.Adaptation is certainly not for everyone.  If you're looking for something starkly different and simmering with originality give this film a try though.  Amidst some cloying selfreferential claptrap there are actually some really freshing film moments.";

	schema:reviewBody "Following his success as screenwriter for 'Being John Malcovich' Charlie Kaufman is given the job of adapting Susan Orlean's book 'The Orchid Thief' which she expanded from a piece in The New Yorker that she wrote on the obsessive orchid hunter John Laroche. While Charlie struggles to adapt the book into a workable film his twin brother Donald writes a successful script around serial killers. The more Charlie struggles to get a story from the book the more the stories and his life start to intertwine.I wanted to see this film because I had enjoyed BJM and was interested to see what Jonze did next. I came to it with a vague knowledge of the plot but nowhere near enough o have expectations. For the majority of the film the different style and presentation kept me deeply interested. The way the different stories occurred in different times and places worked a lot better than I would have expected it to. The plot gets increasingly difficult to follow and you'll get as much as you want from it. For those just looking for a simple story then you'll have a nice neat resolution if you want more then more is there for you as you try to work out what part of the film is real and what part isn't.I came away with mixed feelings. I felt that the ending was not as clever as it thought it was and didn't give a good ending for those who weren't happy to accept things at face value. I didn't feel let down I just felt that the last section of the film stepped down a gear rather than up. I know that this is the point that Jonze was making perhaps by allowing Donald's derided ending come to live and be the replacement for Charlie's original aim. But it didn't totally do it for me. Up till this section I was hooked and felt that the various stories all worked to form a mix of drama and comedy. However the end does a disservice to it's characters.Cage shows that the recent crp he has been in doesn't mean he can't act just that he doesn't. He really brings his two characters to life and plays them so well that it is easy to forget that it is the same person in both roles. Cooper is wonderful and deserved his Oscar for support. Streep as much as I dislike her was very good and brought that difficult character out  although I did feel she was the one most betrayed by the film's end.Overall this was an interesting film that worked in most areas. It's difference and it's inventiveness were such that I wanted to keep watching. However I and I know others will disagree felt that this uniqueness was not well served by the end of the film. I understand that it was not meant to exist in the same way as the majority of the film but I still felt that the ending didn't meet the standard set by the rest of the film.".

It's unfortunate for me to admit but nothing in this movie really sticks out as critique worthy. Some might want me to point out the confusing plot however I didn't find it confusing at all. I've seen more plot twists in a halfhour television show. I mean sure the whole idea of taking a writer who is having writer's block write a script about himself writing a script about himself writing a script might confuse some people I never got lost in the multiple layers of reality.The characters in this while based somewhat on real life were entertaining I feel like the story hinged too much on the people involved and not enough on what was happening. Aside from the masturbation drugs and sex these characters are little more than cardboard cut outs of stereotypical characters we see in everything else! exception John Laroche. Character 1 Charlie Kaufman  Selfloathing screenwriter with writer's block commissioned to write a script over a book that doesn't have a story. ENTER Character 2 Donald Kaufman  The Outgoing reckless bum TWIN BROTHER of Charlie. While I can appreciate the fact that Donald isn't real and was fabricated by the REAL Charlie Kaufman to help move the plot along in HIS script it's sloppy and not creative in the least.ENTER Character 3 Susan Orlean  Dissatisfied wife writer pulled into the life of a much more interesting person  thus falling in love with...Character 4 John Laroche  ...tall guy skinny as a stick pale eyes slouchshouldered sharply handsome despite the fact he's missing all his front teeth.  the Only interesting and original character based on a REAL person.I mean really Characters 13 can be swapped out with any character from any other bland ComedyDrama film. At first viewing yes I loved the movie but after watching it again... and again... and again... I found that while some might find the movie as very creative I found it extremely pretentious in the fact that it builds itself up on the basis of writing a selfreferential script about a selfreferential script. Narcissistic? Maybe. Annoying? With out a doubt.Add to that the extremely slow pace of this movie and you have Adaptation. By the middle of the movie you feel worn out and sick of seeing Nicholas Cage's face this being said by a fan of Nick Cage. But seriously the movie couldn't move any slower taking time to point out all the things that AREN'T happening. BUT THEN we get to the end where all of the sudden Susan and John are doing drugs and having sex and trying to kill Charlie and shoot Don and wreck the car into a park ranger flinging Don out killing him Prompting Charlie to sing Happy Together ending with Charlie writing a script about himself trying to write the script!In the end we get what is called by manyafilmcritic as High Art and Clever. While all I saw was a writer's attempt at writing a script over a movie but FAILING and writing about himself instead. Sorry folks but I genuinely hated this movie. And would strongly recommend everyone who hasn't seen it to go buyrent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind instead ESotSM being equally pretentious and depressing but having Jim Carry who somehow makes you laugh WHILE you cry.In a summary I thought the movie was crap.".

In many ways I think Adaptation feels like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch stretched to 2 hours.I understand the inside jokes the ironic commentary on the Industry the satire the sarcasm etc etc etc. I understand which parts of the film must be fantasy which parts may be fantasy etc etc.  But there was just nothing there I cared about and I don't think any statement on the film business or writing being made had any substance to it.  The whole thing felt thin and tired.  It's not deep enough to be taken seriously not overthetop enough to be considered zany fun and doesn't have the emotional power to touch our souls. It doesn't even mix these elements.  It's like a big cold pile of halfeaten mashed potatoes sitting on a dirty plate.I must admit I admire Charlie Kaufman for having the chutzpah to present this script in lieu of the project he was hired to write and in getting a producer to pay him for it.  But the entire premise seems little more than a schoolboyish trick of trying to get away with failing to write a paper by writing a paper about why you couldn't do the assigned paper  and hoping it will prove a sufficently amusing ruse to charm your teacher into not failing you. Mr. Kaufman seems to be trying to build a career on cute gimmicks.  Sadly this being Hollywood  and America  he will probably get away with it for years to come.  Both withBeing John Malkovich and with Adaptation the audiences seem to spend so much time being impressed by a mildly interesting premise that they don't bother to worry  or even think  about whether it's a premise that supports or warrants an entire feature film.  The only real joke here is one that can only be enjoyed by Mr. Kaufman who's gotten an Academy Award nomination for what should probably have been treated as a breach of contract. The uselessness of the film notwithstanding Chris Cooper gives a great performance and Meryl Steep does a very good job.  Nicholas Cage overplays both of his parts and frankly creates a character that I think is completely unsympathetic in other words he does his usual work.  Does anyone really care by the end what happens to him or to his brother?  In the last 15 minutes of the movie my thinking was I think what should happen next is whatever will get this movie ended the quickest.   In terms of awards  Best Scam.

	schema:headline " Oops! Be careful. Don't step in the art!";
	schema:reviewBody "So in this movie Adaptation we learn that it's all artistic to be selfreferential and stuff like that.  There is that screenwriter Charlie who's trying to adapt a novel written by some lady whose photograph he likes to masturbate to but he really doesn't spend too much time talking about her novel at all and that's really bold creative and visionary.  I wish I could be creative but I don't think my brain works that way.  Charlie's brain comes from a brain factory.I remember when I was in grade school I had to do this report on Howard Hughes but instead of writing about Howard Hughes I wrote down on a piece of paper about how I went to the library and couldn't find anything about Howard Hughes and my teacher gave me an F which shows how stupid she is. I was selfreferential and artistic and I was all you know exploring and chronicling the creative process of writing a paper about Howard Hughes and that unimaginative brute stunted my creativity by giving me an F.  She said I didn't do the assignment.  I'm glad that the production company that hired Charlie to adapt that lady's book didn't stunt his growth just because he didn't do his assignment.  In fact if I were that lady who wrote the book instead of seeing a movie about my book I think I'd much rather see a movie about some bald fat loser whackingoff to my picture and then portraying me as a murderous crack whore.  That would be art.You can tell that Charlie's a true art guy because all of them art guys use what they call literary devices.  Like that time where Charlie employed that literary device called irony.  Remember that?  It was awesome.  In the movie Charlie Kaufman has a split personality.  His alter ego is his twin brother Andy Kaufman who wrestles women and writes a screenplay The Three about some guy who has three distinct personalities.  While Charlie is selfindulgently poking fun at formulaic thrillers like The Three it's all ironic and stuff that audience members deep down are thinking Wow I really wish I were watching The Three instead of this steaming pile of art.Oh yeah!  And then there's that one part where Kaufman doesn't have nearly the talent ability or craftsmanship to adapt that lady's book so he slaps that fake ending on it. And this is the genius part!  He slaps that fake ending on it  all the while pretending to lampoon the fabled vulgar formulaic Hollywood ending  but what he's really doing is covering up for the fact that he doesn't possess the skill to pull off the adaptation. Bravo Charles!  Bravo!  So now all the elitist critics can watch this incoherent mess of a movie fling four stars at it smugly chuckle at the great unwashed movie going masses and congratulate themselves at being so incredibly insightful and sophisticated as to decipher the subtle subtext.In conclusion let me paraphrase Charlie Kaufman himself  Adaptation is selfindulgent.  It's narcissistic.  It's solipsistic.  It's pathetic. Kaufman is pathetic.  He's fat and pathetic.  The reason this screenplay is selfreferential is that he was too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book.  Because he's pathetic.  Because he has no idea how to write. Because he can't make flowers fascinating.  Because he sucks.".

That's a term I have coined to describe all the parallel levels that have become part of the film vocabulary among them selfreference reflection selfaware irony and timeshifting. I love these films. They are always about ideas and many are incredibly sophisticated in concept even though the story an incidental component in such projects may be uninteresting. There are an amazing number of films with some sort of folding  in my nearly 1000 IMDB comments I have found about a third that use these tricks.The most obvious are films that are about their own making like The Muppet Movie' Beyond the Clouds' and The Player.' But here we have something new I think. In this case the folding is not a technique in the film it is the star of the film. Several types of folding are used here time overlaps selfreference ironic distance nested narratives a metamovie about a movie about a book about a magazine article about a botanical scam where the nesting is scrambled. Along the way we have not only a surrogate for the writer and the writer he is writing about but a imaginary twin who comments on the writing process.I really enjoyed this as an intellectual exercise the clever barrage of tricks was impressive. But it is an elaborate but empty shell. Nic Cage has always been an actor that is incapable of spanning levels like Penn or Depp or Brando or quite a few of our actresses today. Streep is a master at this sort of thing in fact set the gold standard for folded acting with The French Lieutenant's Woman.' But she is asked to be as flat as Cage is. Cooper is fantastic of course but is only a fantastic cartoon.I found it unsatisfying when elevated to the level of Tarantinolike selfreferential humor all except for one bit the folding in of the masturbatory fantasies at the same level as everything else. Just think about this there's a powerful force acting both ways between the creator and the created between the writer and character. Here at the same level is the VERY SAME equivalence with fantastic sexual compliance. That one part with the redheaded waitress Alice behind the orchid show was shocking  shocking because of this equivalence. Not even Lynch does this.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I watched this movie I thought this is either pretentious garbage or pure genius. After letting it sink in for a few days I thought about it and certain pieces started fitting together. I decided to give it a second watch and afterwards I was like oh of course its genius.I think a lot of people who criticize this film don't understand what the film is going for. I'll try not to spoil anything but I left a disclaimer since I'll be roughly outlining the plot. A common criticism I see is that the film tries to reject the Hollywood screen writing clichs but chickens out at the end for a dumb actionpacked climax. Here's the thing The film uses the 3act structure in an ironic way. The film is about the writing of the film. Early on in the film Charlie Kaufman the character not the real person is trying to stay faithful to the source material he's given to adapt. The source material is The Orchid Thief a nonlinear book that doesn't really follow a typical 3act structure. When he experiences writer's block he asks his twin brother who went to a screen writing seminar for help. He even goes to the screen writing seminar himself. Every piece of advice he gets makes the script more formulated and thus so does the film. It should be fairly obvious once we see Susan Orlean the character not the real person snorting plant drugs and fornicating with John Laroche the character that fiction has taken over. That's also why Charlie and Donald follow her to Florida and crazy stuff involving guns and an alligator ensues. The film's ending works on multiple levels. It can be enjoyed by the average moviegoer as a dumb fun climax but more discerning viewers will be in on the joke.One thing I want to bring up before I wrap up is Nicolas Cage's performance as the fictional Charlie Kaufman. At first I thought oh come on there's no way anyone is that insecure and submissive but then I saw videos of interviews with the real Charlie Kaufman and was like oh wow Nick Cage nailed it. Its not an exact recreation but it definitely works as a fictional portrayal.There's more details I'll leave for you to discover on your own. All you have to know is this is a very clever film and serves as a great satire of Hollywood tropes. Personally I think this movie is perfect and there's nothing I would change that I could imagine making the film objectively better. Charlie Kaufman is one of the most fascinating screenwriters working in Hollywood today and I'd say all of his films are worth a watch!".

Congratulations to Charlie Kaufman. this movie is hardly about a book. Of course the book recites some vital themes of the story. but essentially the book is just fuel for Charlie Kaufman's ingenious prank. Charlie didn't cleverly insert himself into the film. the movie is ABOUT him. the movie is about his struggle to create a movie that is just about a flower with no Hollywood clichs like car chases sex drugs murder and especially split personalities. Charlie wants originality. Insulting his brother Donald's screenplay for just being a cheap thriller Charlie falls into a depression because Donald's ideas are receipted more warmly than his own. After giving in and inviting Donald to help Charlie with his own screenplay the film advances to contain the following 1 a woman becomes a DRUG addict 2 a man gives her drugs so she will have SEX with him 3 The man and woman are caught by Charlie and decide to MURDER him 4 they then partake in a CAR CHASE 5 Charlie Kaufman doesn't have a brother Donald and this is supposed to be based on his real life therefore Donald really represents his SPLIT PERSONALITYISN'T THAT ALL HILARIOUS???? I can't believe I didn't get it before. He betrays everything he initially hated in movies... this movie isn't about an orchid thief its about Charlie Kaufman's indecision about whether he should stick to his originality or succumb to the silliness of Hollywood.

It seems that after the glorious 60s the Svoiet block was all about quite despair personal tragedies and the intellectual's angst in the face of a failure to secure more freedom in those countries. The GDR was no different and Addio piccola mia belongs for me in that crowd of melancholy and somewhat depressing films filmed on filmstock with desaturated colors reminiscent of something like Ilya Averbakh's Monologue 1973 or all of Tarkovsky's 70s work. A bit experimental and a BIG part 'naturalist this is a cinema of contemplation while trying to retain some of the playfulness and inventiveness that has come in the decade before. Handheld camera is the style of choice and actors muttering their lines looking away from the camera a highly stylized direct cinema touch and professional actors being mixed with amateurs or purposefully being used like ones.Addio piccola mia is certainly an interesting film my first by Lothar Warneke a story about the last three years of German icon Georg Bchner a poet who died of typhus at the age of 23 and who is here used somewhat to reflect upon the times in the GDR in the late 70s. He is a revolutionary who wants to change society through an uprise of the masses the poor peasants who are his only hope for a true revolution. Yet after the defeat of Napoleon in the early 19th century Europe is in a situation of reconstruction and forced stability with a lot of similarities to the cold war period. Everything seems in deadlock a perpetuate hell where nothing can happen. At the end there is no prospect of freedom none of hope only death. A bleak way of looking at history considering the fact that the GDR saw itself as a society that had brought about the longsought freedom that had been denied to the people throughout the previous centuries and all films in the GDR were funded and produced by the state and had to get its approval. It would be interesting to know how the film was received in its day especially in the GDR. Not a bad film but this is only for people who don't mind having a meandering one hour plot stretched to two hours with a lot of selfdoubt and anguish going on. Very much a film of its time.Ah yes saw it at the cinema but bad projection or whatever the cause led to it being shown in the wrong aspect ratio and the print was only in decent shape so the 35mm experience was really nothing to write home about. Oh and there are some stunning floating handheld and vibrating Malicklike closeup shots using only natural light of course of the faces of two lovers that will make the heart of most cineastes beat faster.".

Not just the beautiful imagery not just those scenes that had people fainting in the theatres but because I empathised a lot with the characters and the symbolism of their environment and their actions was very much in tune with my sensibilities. OK so I'm strange .Much as I enjoyed watching it I won't try and argue that watching THE ISLE is a 'pleasant' experience  not one to leave you with a smile so I was prepared for something a little bit serious and grim with ADDRESS UNKNOWN.It is not a little bit serious and grim at all... it is completely serious and amazingly grim.Kim KiDuk is less interested in exploring the somewhat global issues of human feelings here but instead wants to explore the feelings of a nation  Korea still living in the shadow of the Korean war. The characters here come across as a little apersonal it's ok I just invented it because they are embodiments of the country's experience... the division the loss of autonomy the dehumanisation that people feel caught up in the conflicts between North and South and between Capitalism and Communism. Obviously to suggest that this was a universal Korean experience would be unreasonable though Kim KiDuk is not interested in exploring balancing factors in this particular movie. People suffer. And suffer. And suffer. And then they suffer for a while. He is relentless in his examination of the pain that he clearly feels for himself and for his country.It must be said that I know almost nothing about Korean history though I am learning a lot as I type! or of contemporary Korean society so I don't know how common the feelings that Kim Ki Duk expresses here are or how realistic his assessment of Korea's post war condition is. It all feels very believable very convincing... but certainly none of the Korean people I have met are quite as utterly miserable as they must be if ADDRESS UNKNOWN were an accurate depiction of their lives.I think there is no doubt that for at least some people and some communities the feelings that Kim Ki Duk brings to the fore in the movie represent real feelings and real situations. But I think that it must be assumed that it is not an evenhanded assessment of the situation that he was quite certain what he wanted to say and permitted no deviation from it. In a way this is the movie's undoing... it is so relentless in its pursuit that it becomes too easy to get detached from it to treat it as political allegory rather than a tale of human hardship. A little more warmth a little bit of humour maybe just one or two moments where at least one character was slightly happy... and I would have been much more able to bond with them and their tragedies and miseries would have been that much more poignant as a result.A fairly small matter and to a degree this observation may simply be an observation that I am not Korean. The movie is a very personal look at the feelings and circumstances of a nation and having had no comparable experience myself it is obvious that I'm going to struggle to fully relate.If I couldn't empathise with the characters though I could at least sympathise with them. The characters themselves were good characters and the performances were mostly very good. Notable exceptions are the American soldiers in the movie whose English dialogue and delivery is really quite embarrassingly bad  The movie is very light on dialogue  little that is important is expressed through words because it doesn't need to be. Always a good thing in a movie.It is the younger characters of the movie that are centre stage those who were born years after the Korean war ended but are still suffering its consequences. It's always refreshing to see young actors deliver mature performances and this is one such example.THE ISLE probably impacted me mostly because of the visuals  the beautifully photographed and haunting environment in which the movie took place. ADDRESS UNKNOWN is not nearly as pretty which can partly be based on location but also the fact that the style is a lot more realistic gritty even as opposed to THE ISLE's abstractness. It is still well filmed though.I wrote of THE ISLE after seeing itif you want to take away the beauty of his film you have to be willing to pay the price of the horrorADDRESS UNKNOWN is a less successful movie for me because once you get past it's horror instead of beauty you find there's just a bit more horror . OK it's not as bad as that... but the tone is quite unremittingly bleak. I don't know whether to recommend the movie or not. I liked it but I'm not sure how many others will. Definitely not a movie to put on to take your mind off a troublesome day anyway!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is gritty and bleak realism at its best. We are in a countryside village on the border to NorthKorea were poverty and war both the Korean war and the continuation of the cold war takes its toll on the villagers. Prospects are none but some think of America as one and therefore learns English. This also provides some of the small pieces of comedy in the movie for example when some youngsters try to translate from a hustler magazine or when two bullies are tough with speaking English with strong Korean accent Koreans have trouble pronouncing f for instance.. Some other comedy is the US army battalion running and crawling everywhere and the war veteran crazy for medals always bragging about killing 3 commies.Anyway this very grim and bleak realism is obviously made as a political commentary. I don't blame any of them they are victims of their circumstances. I sympathize with every one of them. Kim KiDuk don't blame anyone either the Americans are portrayed as human not as heroes nor devils but the theme of globalization and colonization still lies implied in the movie. Actually its full of commentary. I wont get into it here.I know there's a big difference between countryside Korea and big city Korea but even though I cant say if its real or not I believe this to be quite realistic. The utter consequences the movie depicts of course is fiction and made to emphasize the horror and drama this is a movie after all.This was not very well received in Korea and understandably so it takes up problems that are very actual today and brings up a painful past. To get rid of these problems it is very important however that someone like Kim KiDuk makes these kind of movies and for people to see them. So go see it!! But its not a pleasant watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is gritty and bleak realism at its best. We are in a countryside village on the border to NorthKorea were poverty and war both the Korean war and the continuation of the cold war takes its toll on the villagers. Prospects are none but some think of America as one and therefore learns English. This also provides some of the small pieces of comedy in the movie for example when some youngsters try to translate from a hustler magazine or when two bullies are tough with speaking English with strong Korean accent Koreans have trouble pronouncing f for instance.. Some other comedy is the US army battalion running and crawling everywhere and the war veteran crazy for medals always bragging about killing 3 commies.Anyway this very grim and bleak realism is obviously made as a political commentary. I don't blame any of them they are victims of their circumstances. I sympathize with every one of them. Kim KiDuk don't blame anyone either the Americans are portrayed as human not as heroes nor devils but the theme of globalization and colonization still lies implied in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Kim Kiduk's film has been a while making its appearance at least in the UK and after viewing it in some ways one can see why. As unflinching and as memorable as the other works which have made him out as perhaps Korea's finest filmmaker  The Isle Bad Guy 2001 3Iron 2004 included  Address Unknown aka Suchwiin bulmyeong is as uncompromising in its view of humanity as any of them and with many of the director's characteristically disturbing moments intact.Set in and around a US air force base in Korea 17 years after the end of the Korean conflict and mainly focusing on the travails and tribulations of the residents of a nearby village Address Unknown was the director says a way to explore and represent the dehumanising effect of war. It's also as others have noticed about other things too language family relationships the debasement of tradition and violence amongst them. There is no real central point to the film although arguably the relationship between the American flyer and EunOK Minjang Ban gives it its main drama. Korean cinema frequently has at its heart the pain caused by the 1950s' war and the painful division of the country into two halves thereafter Here the psychic trauma created is symbolised by the base and the pain resulting is acted out in varying degrees by those who live and work in its shadow.In Kim's unnamed village the principal business appears to be the butchering of dogs for food  a particularly brutal affair though the film does claim no animals were mistreated during the filming  by one Dog Eye Jaehyung Jo also notable in Bad Guy and The Isle. Dog Eye despises teenaged ChangGuk Donkun Yang the son of an absent American soldier for being of mixed descent. Letters to his missing father sent from his mother are being returned 'address unknown'. For his part ChangGuk makes his solitary friend in JiHum Youngmin Kim also in the same director's much more contemplative Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring 2003. He's a sensitive withdrawn artist bullied by his war veteran father. Meanwhile JiHum has a crush on EunOK. With her eye damaged by a childhood accident she in turn has a relationship with an unstable drug dealing American flyer Mitch Malum who promises her a corrective operation on the promises of becoming his girl...The bleakness of the film one both of landscape and the heart reminded this viewer of the Chinese film Blind Shaft aka Man Jing made the same year. But the latter is more about the degradation wrought by political economics whereas the malaise at the centre of Kim's work is more pathological. It is also more relentlessly grim and less cynical than that tale of couple of serial killers at work in Chinese coal mines to such an extent that the viewer at times wonders if anyone will be left alive by the end. This narrative ruthlessness as critics have noticed ultimately undermines some of the impact the film might otherwise have had.Another flaw is the performance of the main American actor Malum's acting has been for some a distraction although I found it weak if passable. Korean directors sometimes make unfortunate casting decisions for their English speaking parts one thinks of the problems which attend the otherwise excellent J.S.A. No doubt the home audience would not care about or notice such shortcomings so it seems pointless to chide Kim too much over this weakness especially as elsewhere the cast are generally excellent.Ultimately what makes Address Unknown so striking is Kim's imagery and the choice of actions by his characters so spiritually and emotionally rootless. Seen in this light the writerdirector's title is especially apt both referring literally to the official stamp on front of envelopes returning to the mother as well as to the anonymous village of his stories. Like Bad Guy and The Isle the current film also contains individuals who exist on the edge of human relations although here it is not just persecuted lovers. To a certain extent all of his characters have lost their way either represented living rootlessly in an old army bus being casually inhumane to animals or each other or simply by valuing preferment  suggested by army medals relics and pensions even just good looks over genuine human connection. And when times are so out of joint some striking images are the result the death of a major character head buried in a frozen paddy field a man hung by dogs the cutout paper eye an especially treasureable Daliesquire moment on the face of EunOK the killing of the dogs over a dirty puddle and so on. In fact there's a touch of surreality about the film that continues right until the end with the soldiers crawling in the field. Kim's achievement is in unifying so convincingly and without any monotony a multicharactered narrative that includes such extreme concerns as disfigurement minor bestiality and murder. If you fancy such a strong and austere cinematic brew then you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Address Unknown is about the occupants of a small town situated next to an American military base in the Korean countryside. WriterDirector Kim goes beyond a mere indictment of American presence. He displays brother against brother North vs. South and calls into question the responses to it.This one is probably for Kim KiDuk completists only. It is a remarkable film in its relentless presentation of pain. Every single scene in this 2 hour film involves pain emotional or physical.An American soldier pays for the surgery so a young Korean girl can regain the sight in her impotent freakylooking right eye and then wants her to be his sweetheart in return winkwink. When she shows a little interest in the Korean boy who liked her just the way she was before the surgery the American becomes incredulous and tries to hurt her but before he can she pokes her own eye out to erase her debt to the soldier. Meanwhile the Korean boy who liked her just the way she was schemes to kill the two Korean boys who have been stealing his money and beating him up. When the girl looks freaky again and goes to express her love to the Korean boy she finds him in jail for shooting the American soldier in the genitals with a bow and arrow.That's only one of the subplots. I've seen a lot of films about pain and despair but none that have been so oppressively constant in their execution. This is a great film by one of the great contemorary directors. But you need to be ready for it or you may be repulsed. It's not slasher film gross at all. The really dirty stuff like hanging dogs from a tree and beating them to death with a baseball bat is done off camera. Thank God.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very well made movie and beautifully acted but an American viewer will definitely take offense to it especially if they are or have been a US serviceman. I have been searching for a good Korean movie or TV show that would give insights as to how the South Koreans feel about the American presence in their country but surprisingly that topic is almost never brought up in Korean made entertainment. I read the cover of Address Unknown in the video store and thought this would be a good movie about the Americans in South Korea. It is a good movie but I was offended. The movie focused of several stereotypes that I found appalling I will try to write this review without giving away too much movie in details but be aware there are spoilers in this review.The movie's main characters are a horribly poor mentally disturbed Korean woman and her mixed racial son that was the issue of an African American airman. In the viewer's first introduction to this couple we the viewer see the son attempt to brutalize his mother. The message was obvious The Korean mothers of children of American servicemen live desperate lives and their mixed racial children resent them.Having spent 6 years in Japan in the US navy and being the father of 2 Japanese American Children you can probably understand why I would be offended by this notion.Matters may have been different in the 60s and 70s but I can say from personal experience that every child of an Asian mother and American serviceman that I know has benefited greatly from being truly bilingual and have lived well in their respective countries I have been searching for information on the actorrap singer Dongkun Yang to see if he actually is half African American but if he's not he still spoke English beautifully in the movie. The relationship between the mother and her biracial son takes a terrible turn when the son slicing off his mother's breast tattoo that depicts her former American serviceman lover's name. The mother throughout the movie takes pride in her son and her past love with the American serviceman and to me these were the only touching aspects of the movie. To see the son attack his mother in this way really made my heart sink and I could not understand what point the director was trying to make other to characterize biracial children negatively.The breast tattoo topic comes up again when an AWOL American soldier attempt to carve his name into the breast of his Korean lover so that she will never forget him after he is gone. I have been searching on the web and I cannot find any account of such an occurrence happening in the long USKorean relations involving a serviceman carving his name into a Korean woman or girl against her will. Where that stereotype of an American wanting to tattoo a Korean woman came from I have no idea though it does sound a lot like what KKK members are reported to have done in the States. In any case I thought it was a very unfair portrayal or Americans and it reminded me a lot of the myth of Vietnamese women who hid razor blades in their vaginas might have happened but I highly doubt it and there is no report of it actually having happening.Early in the film we see this same serviceman offer that same Korean girl a chance at eye surgery in trade for her becoming his sweetheart. Anyone who knows anything about the US military knows that such an exchange is absurd because a serviceman could only get surgery for a Korean woman if she was his wife. The message that that exchange attempts to give which becomes more clear later is that Korean women and Koreans in general are forced to yield to everything Americans demand no matter how demeaning because Americans feel that the Koreans owe them so much after all the Americans have done for them. Later the girl blinds her surgically repaired eye giving the message that her deranged American lover's gift was not welcomed after all.I hope that Koreans who have watched or plan to watch Address Unknown will not assume that all American servicemen are deranged because were not or that we intend to make outrageous demands of them after all of the gifts that we have given them because we do not.The tone of Address Unknown borders on antiAmerican propaganda which is really a shame because this movie is very well made.I hope someday there will be a less grim movie made about the post war KoreanAmerican experience because I know from personal experience that most interpersonal KoreanAmerican relationships are not all bad though in the 60s and 70s relationships between Koreans and Americans were probably a lot more strained.".

How does a bullet in the eye get fixed with what looks like soy sauce? Since when did a traditional Korean family allow a teenage daughter to bonk her U.S. soldier boyfriend in the family home? And where did the director drag up those American actors? Friday night in Itaewon? Boy oh boy they were bad. The boyfriend was bad out of control and saying truly scary things. He blamed it all on the Korean mountains that were closing in on him. Hello? Calling Planet Earth? On top of that in a movie set in the 1970s no period pop music. Unforgivable. A real dog.".

It is the most heartless moment in a cruel and vacuous movie. The cruelty is everywhere and stops the audience caring about anyone or anything. Except the dogs. Couple of questions. How does a bullet in the eye get fixed with what looks like soy sauce? Since when did a traditional Korean family allow a teenage daughter to bonk her U.S. soldier boyfriend in the family home? And where did the director drag up those American actors? Friday night in Itaewon? Boy oh boy they were bad. The boyfriend was bad out of control and saying truly scary things. He blamed it all on the Korean mountains that were closing in on him. Hello? Calling Planet Earth? On top of that in a movie set in the 1970s no period pop music. Unforgivable. A real dog.";

The problem I saw in this movie was there are so many stories that after 80 or 90 minutes the film becomes tedious and artificial. Every single story has a dramatic end. There are so many screams cryings and dramas that it begins to be artificial. Although I know in war is impossible to have a big smile in the face in this case is a drama after drama within a whole drama. Thus the movie loses its effectiveness. I think the movie must show more clearly the main story and use two or three stories as maximum to support it. I have seen better movies of Kim Ki Duk that's why I rate this one with a 6.".

For the most part South Korean dramas are made for the art house audience the same one that goes gaga over The Hours and the like. That is to say if you like misery piled on top of misery sandwiched in between more misery so you can feel intelligent then this film and others of its ilk is your cup of tea. I have seen a lot of artsy film from South Korea and enjoyed many of them. Sopyonje a film that has relatively few moments of joy ranks as my favorite film of al time. This movie though is just tedius and bored. It shouldn't surprise any viewer that American soldiers come across as worst than Satan in this movie because the writerdirector has probably NEVER MET a real American in his life. Judging by the American dialogue and characters here this seems to be the case. Then again I'm sure American films don't do justice to Korean characters but that's neither here nor there. In any case Address Unknown is a useless movie that provides nothing to the world at large.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer I'm a fan of Kim Kiduk. I liked 3Iron Time The Bow The Isle and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring. The Coast Guard was just okay but I thought Bad Guy was vile and repulsive. That said this film is hands down Kim's worst.Kim Kiduk directs this dreadful drama which showcases a bunch of grumpy people acting stupid amidst a lunatic squad of American soldiers. The sheer artificiality of each scene in this 117minute debacle is unparalleled by any other work I can remember experiencing. Almost every line of dialogue and every character action is handled with a silliness that needs to be seen to be believed. Thus a large percentage of events come off as unintentionally comical. I now cite the following evidence 1 A dude gets depressed then kills himself by riding a scooter off of a very very small hill thus burying half his body in mud.2 A group of poorly acted Americans curse angrily at each other during a pickup basketball game. The viewer will note that the tussle begins for no apparent reason. The soldiers then overreact in the most artificial ways imaginable. In addition the most insightful dialogue is nothing more than an endless series of 4letter words.3 The most outrageous Crate American actor in the movie and that's saying something! contributes about half a dozen cameos of sidesplitting idiocy throughout the film providing the only true entertainment. The actor's name is Mitch Malum  and yes even his name is funny. In one awful cinematic moment Mitch slaps his Korean girlfriend in an effort to show her how he feels then randomly confesses that he takes LSD to get away from the mountains of Korea. Unfortunately the real reason he slapped her was because she wouldn't take a hit of LSD. So the question remains how did he make the jump from LSD to mountains to romantic feelings? It makes no logical sense whatsoever.4 Later on Mitch Malum I love saying that scares off a Korean kid only to then mistakenly hit his head on a doorframe. Kim Kiduk apparently didn't feel like shooting a retake of that scene and with good ole Mitch at the helm could you really blame him? 5 Afterward Mitch is training with his comrades and randomly decides to quit in the middle of a training sequence. His remarkable insightfulness contributes lines of incoherent nothingness. Picturing Mitch acting hysterically with a crooked helmet on his head just gets me.6 Eventually Mitch's bad temper provokes an arrow shot to his groin! His response to this after a brief uncomfortable grunt is to shoot his pistol in the air a few times walk into the middle of the street wait for a group of Korean cops and citizens to walk up to him shoot the remaining bullets of his gun into the air limp gingerly into the field kneel down act hysterically then attempt to shoot himself with the very pistol HE JUST EMPTIED! I literally had to stop the film for 15 minutes as I gasped for air in gutwrenching laughter. Now add a handful of other inadvertently humorous moments to the ones above as well as the following stupid moments 1 Dogs are beaten and killed constantly throughout the film not for real thankfully.2 A highschool girl gets a cute little puppy slips into a nightgown and forces it to eat out between her legs! Like I mentioned earlier I like Kim Kiduk but he should be humiliated to be associated with such a horrible film like Address Unknown. This is truly a pathetic display of filmmaking that earns a special place as one of the most unintentionally riotous endeavors in motion picture history.One other reviewer's comment is entitled Not one to watch if you want cheering up. I couldn't disagree more vehemently. This was the funniest film I've seen in years. Highly recommended as comedy. Stay far away if you're looking for drama though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Undoubtedly one of the most perfect brilliant comedies ever this movie is extremely fun and revels in its dark clever humour. What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper charming likable impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless evercalculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social superior. The dialogue indeed pretty much all of the humour is a shining example of British humour at its best. It is subtle clever dark and full of irony and satire. It is pure brilliant entertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much better than this.".

Imagine his fury and dismay when they say no. He sets about getting revenge as well as winning the heart of the mercenary woman he loves through murdering each of the eight d'Ascoyne family members that stand between him and a title riches and everything that he feels he deserves.Wearing the Ealing black comedy streak on its sleeve and gleefully black Kind Hearts and Coronets has got to be one of the funniest films about murder to be made. Much of this owes kudos to Alec Guinness' fantastic performance a true tourdeforce in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne to the dull and dim Reverend d'Ascoyne with commendable diversity changing his tone stature facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things which Guinness then continued to deliver.That said Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne he murders poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another because we know it will have hilarious consequences and the plot never holds back. However his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on postwar Britain where the gold digging played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood women were everywhere and to some people rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.For those who don't want to watch a film for the history lesson no fear  Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now the oneliners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer's ultracapable hands a warmhearted satire has been crafted. You really can't get much better or much intelligent than this.".

In watching one is once more all too sadly aware of the difference in quality between British films of this era and today there can't have been in recent times a screenplay as cleverly comic economical and incisive as this is. The level of wit is high and perfectly suitable for a black comedy such as this. Certain lines and scenes linger agreeably in the memory the part where Price in his droll narration slips into verse is wonderful as is the fight he has with a lowerclass rival I'm not going to drawn into a scuffle with you!The element of class satire is strong and while one is shown the lethargy and complacency of the upper classes through the amusing parade of Alec Guinness' characters Price's corrupt plans are never condemned as such. His character vigorous and witty and the clever tool of narration which in its tone draws in the viewer almost as a confidant. Similarly but to an even more effective degree than in Whisky Galore! 1948 and The League of Gentlemen 1959 the viewer is made sympathetic to wrongdoings. The stunningly executed plot and dialogue are finely put across indeed by all of the actors. In the main role Price refines and defines the cad Mancini perfectly it really is a great performance making the character more than memorable. Alec Guinness is great in his 8 roles making a distinctive actorly mark in all of them. It says a lot that in a career as formidable as Guinness' in TV film and theatre his contribution to this film particularly stands out. The two ladies are impeccably played by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood who contrast quite perfectly Hobson as rich and straitlaced if certainly beautiful and Greenwood as the distinctively seductive childhood friend. Price's juggling of his two women is wonderfully arch and amusing. The film's ending should be noted as quite ingenious and wonderfully in keeping with the film's overall wit.In the context even of Ealing a studio adept at clever comedies this is an extraspecial film. Along with the films of this era of Powell and Pressburger and Carol Reed this film makes one nostalgic for the days when British film was both distinctively British and universal in its qualities. Wonderfully funny and compelling this film is one of my few favourites of all and overwhelmingly recommended.Rating ".

	schema:reviewBody "As I've said on all my Ealing movie reviews I watched these cause the plots looked interesting but I'm still unsure on how to judge the movies. I'm not one to dismiss them as 'old' and therefore 'boring' at the same time I don't just jump on the bandwagon saying they're classics just because they've got that reputation and a lot of people without even judging for themselves assume they're great.To quote to further my point  A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. Mark Twain So watching this with an open mind I really enjoyed it. Yes you have to realise it's not a modern movie so the kind of themes and scenes presented are different from the packaged elements of modern Hollywood but that makes postwar British cinema very refreshing viewing. I think the use of the term 'comedy' is misleading because it most likely refers to it in the classic literary sense from Shakespeare and Greek theatre probably in the early 20th century people were a bit better read than today so these terms would still have meaning to them which refers to a story with happy ending and farcial plot and wit rather than obvious jokes like in the modern sense but even these movies have some funny scenes. Also the humour and premise is black comedy and subtle so look for something modern if you need laughoutloud movies.'Kind Hearts and Coronets' When I first came across this the plot looked so unique I knew I just had to see it at least once although I've rewatched it many times since. I do find Guinness's 8 roles are overhyped because most of them have few lines and the distinctions between a few of them are nonexistent though it's still a novelty and a brave act to pull off in a movie. For me Mazzini's 'bad guy' characterisation is the most appealing element of the movie with a characterisation that makes even a criminal charming and someone to empathise with a little and for me some visual appeal. The unique premises of who we see him murder next and the wit and black humour makes it a treasure of a film that I'm glad was made and is still available and enjoyed. One of my most beloved films for definite. Definitely worth one watch just to see something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best and most loved of the Ealing Comedies is also the darkest. Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters. That said it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini the charming urbane serial killer who really steals the show.The film opens in prison with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that his last night he is completing his memoirs which act as a framing device for the rest of the film as well as allowing for a dry witty narration from Mazzini himself.Kind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laughoutloud comedy but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords being tried by his peers.I suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII after the Beverage reforms and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly Louis is presented with such sympathy and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.You could regard it as a form of social commentary but frankly why bother? It's just glorious fun and despite a certain English postwar feel surprisingly modern and anarchic  there can be few films even today which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty for instance when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying furthermore I am not naturally callous.Of course everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force  playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne presumable unready for the fate that awaits him the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors  Denis Price Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.This remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful heartwarming tale of multiple murder. 9  10".

There is however an essential darkness at the heart of the movie the cold blooded and calculating murder of all those who stand between Dennis Price and his possible succession to a title. That this is treated in so light and civilised a way is the triumph of the film. The screenplay and performances complement each other perfectly and are a credit to all those involved. I cannot think of a weak link in the film. The casting was beautifully judged down to the most minor character. The leads are though just about perfect. For my money it is the best of Dennis Price's film work though his Jeeves on television in the 60's was good too. Guinness was splendid and well supported by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood. I have probably seen the film more than a dozen times in the past thirty years. Each time it offers something fresh and new. Quite simply one of the best.".

I did not realize until later that Alec Guinness had done an equally masterful job about a decade earlier with this movie.Although not quite my favorite Ealing film starring him it is certainly among my favorites. It is the story of a serial killer who you find yourself rooting for to get away with the crimes! Unlike some sicko the main character has some understandable motivation for killing off several extended family members in order to obtain the family fortune. And when he kills several of these people you find yourself wanting him to kill them as well! Now that takes amazing writing and acting to pull that off!! So see this charming little comedy. It has come on Turner Classic Movies several times lately but if you can find the video rent it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Though it had been producing films since the 1930s it wasn't until 1949 that Ealing Studios finally commenced its golden period. In was in this year that they released the first batch of their most entertaining comedies including Alexander Mackendrick's 'Whisky Galore! 1949' Henry Cornelius' 'Passport to Pimlico 1940' Charles Frend's 'A Run for Your Money 1949' a littleknown gem of which I'm very fond and of course Robert Hamer's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets 1949' which launched Alec Guinness into a successful career with the studio. Easily one of the darkest comedies of its era Hamer's film was loosely adapted from the novel Israel Rank by Roy Horniman  among other changes the main character was renamed from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini to avoid any perceived antiSemitism so soon after World War Two. The title itself was derived from an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson which reads in part Kind hearts are more than coronets and simple faith than Norman blood. The films of Ealing Studios can often be characterised as goodnatured downtoearth comedy offerings lighthearted in tone and always steering towards the attainment of community betterment characters typically conclude the film having learned a valuable lesson and the ending is usually most ideal for all concerned. Later films such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob 1951' and especially 'The Ladykillers 1955' returned to the murky themes of Hamer's film but they couldn't avoid reinforcing the ageold adage that crime doesn't pay whereas this comedy leaves ample room for the possibility of our killer escaping scotfree however for audiences across the Atlantic the Production Code dictated that this ambiguity be removed. Likely influenced by Charles Chaplin's 'Monsieur Verdoux 1947'  a comedy of murders  Hamer unwaveringly filled his film to the brim with dark themes dry wit and bitter irony finding a hilariously suave and classy serial killer in actor Dennis Price whose unflinching murderous plight attains a twisted sense of empathy through the maltreatment of his mother's memory at the hands of the D'Ascoyne family.I've often remarked that Alec Guinness never plays the same role twice his character changing unrecognisably from picture to picture. In the case of this film he virtually changes from scene to scene portraying all eight heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont with uproarious charisma and versatility. It helps that most of Guinness' creations merely targets for the conniving Louis Mazzini are wholly unlikable or frustratingly senile though there's certainly a pang of regret when the amiable photography hobbyist is murdered and the manner in which The Duke is dispatched is shocking in its sheer coldbloodedness. Perhaps a single complaint is that the murders of Lady Agatha and the General were skipped over much too quickly and I would have enjoyed a more indepth examination of the mechanics of the crime. The final act of the film is swathed in a healthy dose of irony as Mazzini is arrested and charged for the one murder he didn't commit his fate sealed and then rescued by his jilted mistress Sibella Joan Greenwood who alone guesses the truth about what he has done.".

This tension is continually highlighted by the plot. An example of this is the scene where Louis Mazzini is sitting drinking tea with Edith D'Ascoyne in the garden and calmly continues their conversation as smoke begins to appear behind her in the distance from the hut where her husband is being incinerated.The other chief delight for me is the language. Every word of the dialogue and narration is precise conveying neither more nor less that it ought. The examples given on the Memorable Quotes section are by no means all that could have been chosen. Lines like those can of course only be delivered by actors who are completely familiar with the English language at its most refined and who have the composure to speak them as they were meant to be spoken. It is a joy to watch and listen to them.I have watched this film many times and it never loses its freshness.

	schema:reviewBody "Immediately after WW2 Ealing Studios produced a number of black comedies several starring Alec Guiness who was just starting to be noticed as an actor. One of the last in the series The Ladykillers was foolishly remade by the Coen Brothers starring Tom Hanks and it stank. The original films had a dark humor moral ambiguity ingenious plots and great dialog. The best in the series was Kind Hearts and Coronets  made almost at the start of the cycle.The stars are Dennis Price as Mazzini Jr. whose deceased mother was a member of the D'Ascoyne film before being disowned for marrying an Italian opera singer. Alec Guiness plays the eight surviving D'Ascoyne's including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne whose deaths could lead Mazzini to becoming Duke of Chalfont castle. Kind Hearts is a wonderfully black comedy about how Mazzini disposes of his relatives one by one in order to avenge his mother and become rich in the process. The greatest thing to note is the witty upperclass dialog. Dennis Price has the right mixture of believability and sleaziness while Guiness gives a tourdeforce of colorful performances.Kind Hearts is a very good introduction to Ealing comedies. Other good entries would be The Lavender Hill Mob more cockney humor The Ladykillers which was actually funny unlike the remake and The Man in the White Suit. All three star Alec Guiness. Then there are those without Guiness like Passport to Pimlico and Whisky Galore!".

	schema:reviewBody "Kind Hearts and Corrents is in a sense an extrapolation of Jane Austin's satire of the English aristocracy. Where Austin gives the reader a sarcastic insight into their ways of life Kind Hearts and Correnets kills the English aristocracy off as if to symbolise their slow demise within modernity. But as this film illustrates the aristocracy has methods of survival via its never ending line of descendants ready to take on hereditary titles. Ironically the survival of the dukedom in this film is due to the actual banished heir to that title murdering his relatives who stand in his way. If you like this is an illustration of how there will always be an aristocracy of sorts in the form of rulers in all types of societies as illustrated in George Orwell's Animal Farm. This is because as the famous psychologist Erich Fromm says as a conservative society we have a 'fear of freedom' and depend on being subordinates of rulers like children to their parents. In Kind Hearts and Correnets we see an example of this when the duke performs his paternalistic duty for his dependant proletariat.The irony is that the lead actor Dennis Price in Kind Hearts and Corerenets is a descendant of minor aristocracy himself deprived of his title due to the paternalistic line being directed away from him. In this case he plays the part of the denounced heir superbly. Meanwhile Valery Hobson shines out as a beautiful elegant lady which could be less to do with acting skills and more about playing herself.As for Sir Alec Guiness it goes without saying that he steals the film with his range of acting talents here some of them showcased in all the characters he plays.In the case of the screenplay it is wittily directed well paced entertaining and never for a second boring. This permits a distraction for the viewer and the overlooking of the minor flaw of how there were no accusations pointed towards the lead character which are to the viewer easily detectable given that he was present at most of the murders of his arosticratic relatives.Overall an ageless classic.".

Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script that is funny dark and has bite. The story slips smoothly between dastardly deaths in the guise of a selfsatisfied memoir and is gripping while moving along at a good pace and the direction is secure. But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's more than a touch of Oscar Wilde in this film. There is irony and elegant decadence both in the visuals and in the script. The narrator Louis Mazzini Price has murdered several people who stand between him and the title to which he feels entitled. Invited to go on a hunt with one of his victimstobe he agrees to stroll along but refuses to carry a shotgun because he is opposed to blood sports. The protagonist is supercilious snotty and a complete egotist who is happy that one of his benefactors dies a natural death since it makes it unnecessary to kill him. It's so uncomfortable to murder someone with whom one has not had disagreements.What also strikes me is the resemblance to Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita both in its structure and execution. Of course the movie lacks all of Nabokov's poetry Light of my life. Fire of my loins but so does everything else ever written.Yet there are some isomorphic qualities in Kind Hearts and Coronets aside from the elegant irony and the snobbishness of the narrator. Humbert Humbert is guilty not just of killing Quilty but of ruining the youth of an adolescent girl and he comments on his own perversity with the kind of distant amusement that Price's narrator does. Price's own debaucheries amuses him. At a wedding he congratulates the groom whose virginal bride he seduced the evening before You're a lucky man. Take my word for it. And like Humbert he feels nothing but contempt for people with suburban ways. He's fastidious in his wardrobe and grooming. And if Humbert's love for Lolita was real it was rarely expressed without being undercut by irony. I was a pentapod monster. Similarly Price has one real engine driving him  a genuine desire to revenge the humiliation and death of his beloved mother  although it's only brought up seriously once or twice. Both Price as Mazzini and Humbert Humbert are always showing off and quoting poetry. Price's final quote How happy could I be with either Were t' other dear charmer away! is from Gay's The Beggar's Opera. The movie is extremely funny. The acting is superb all around with Guiness being the splashiest performer in his five roles. But Price could not be improved upon. The way he manhandles his drunken rival Lionel throwing him to the floor then brushing his hands as if they'd been dirtied. And his improvised sample of the Matabele language colloquial rendering of course.The director has all of this down just pat. It's a very British movie. The understatement is almost overstated. Only two of the murdered people die on screen  one peacefully. I cannot see an American remake of this without a lot of on screen blood and violence which in my humble opinion would drain the story of much of its humor.I will give just one example of what I mean out of many possible. One of the men standing between Price and his title of Duke of Chalfont is played by Guiness as an amateur photography enthusiast who keeps a stash of sherry and whiskey in his windowless woodshed in which he develops his prints. Guiness also hides some whiskey there his wife being a prig. Price substitutes an explosive for the kerosene in the lamp of the darkroom. Later Price Guiness and Guiness's wife Hobson are having tea and Guiness decides to rush off to the woodshed to develop some film leaving Price and Hobson carrying on a civilized conversation. About one hundred yards behind the couple is a stone wall behind which is the shed. Some time passes while Price and Hobson trade decorous Victorian observations on photography and so forth. During this exchange we hear a slight thud. A few moments later a wisp of white smoke appears from behind the stone wall roughly in the vicinity of the woodshed. The smoke increases and becomes a billow at which point Price comments that someone must be burning leaves in the garden. Try as I might I can't imagine a modern remake of this particular scene without a long suspenseful and explicit demonstration of Guiness going into the shed striking a match lighting the lamp and having it explode in his face. There would follow an exterior shot of the shed being blown apart by a fireball the stones flying through the air the shrieks of Hobson and Price at their tea. It would simply be a different movie and not nearly as good.Man this is funny. See it quick before they remake it and ruin it as they did recently with Ealing's The Ladykillers.".

It is one of those old Black and Whites which at first glance you think is going to be another typical piece of 1940s British cinema. This opinion could not be further from the truth. In the 1940s the majority of British Film released was heavy Drama and Wartime films things like Kind Hearts were entirely neglected. So I feel it is a nice break from your average piece of 40s film. There are so many little things about this film which combine to make it one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The naration of the lead is brilliant and without it I feel the film would lose marks. I love the calm collected and often hilarious way in which he goes through his story and all the terrible things he has done. The picture is totally charming the cinematography and direction seems to capture the feel of what is supposed to be going on perfectly. I love the fact that the director often manages to give the film a look of charming and happy innocene whilst the protagonist is in the process of some terrible deed. One particular scene sprigns to mind as the scene in which Henry D'Ascoyne dies. I love how our Hero sits calmy in the idyllic English countryside with his murder victims wife calmly taking afternoon tea and when he sees smoke from the explosion he makes some comment about burning leaves. Brilliant.The trial in the House Of Lords is one of my favourite scenes from the film I again love the collectedness of the protagonist as he sits through his trial. I also really enjoy seeing the House of Lords being used as it should be not ruined by these awful modernists. The film is awesome. The story is great a man low down in the sucssesion trying to become Duke. What more could you want? It's a comedy so I didn't expect well defined characthers and a finely tuned story so was surprised to get one.The ending of the film is possibly one of the greatest and funniest film endings I have ever seen. It seems to be a recurring theme recently that we never find out what happens at the very end... All in all910".

Still the idea of that hungry plant had haunted me for three decades while many other must see movies came and went. Thanks to stupid luck I stumbled upon a copy of the film and I have to say that I was not disappointed.This is a jokey send up of the pulp thrillers from the turn of the twentieth century. It takes one of its greatest heroes Nick Carter and plays with everything that makes the pulps so much fun. Here Carter is called into action and using a variety of wild inventions he takes on a villain that is very much of the boo hiss Snidley Whiplash mustache twirling variety. Its just a fun movie done in the style of stories that haven't been in vogue in a century. No big belly laughs but lots of chuckles and plenty of smiles.If you want to see a good little film thats probably all but forgotten now you'll need to search it out. Its not going to be the be all and end all but its a neat little gem to add to you list of film treasures.".

As it didn't get dark enough until about 22.30 there was time for a drink or two beforehand and we all sat in the square under the stars. The film was a laugh from beginning to end.The most outrageous stunts and swordplay to make Errol Flynn look like an amateur. A special treat of course was to see images of the very buildings around us the church the market hall and quite a few of the locals who appeared as extras pop up on the screen. The whole film was tongueincheek swashbuckling D'Artagnan type nonsense. Fencing on rooftops jumping out of windows kissing the girls fighting ten men at once.

	schema:reviewBody "His face was his fortune is one description of Lino Ventura the former wrestler turned actor. In movies like The Sicilian Clan and Adieu Poulet he played a tough cop as well as any actor on either side of the Atlantic. In Adieu Poulet as Verjeat the cop on a mission Ventura's character has almost everyone lined up against him a cop killer a political big shot in Rouen who has connections to the national government in Paris and of course Verjeat's superiors who consider him a loose cannon. Adieu Poulet already shows the decline in the French film industry from only a few years earlier when French films were regularly shown in art house theaters in the United States. The production values of this movie are almost nonexistent the budget of this film must have been a tenth of The Sicilian Clan made six years earlier and financed by 20th Century Fox's French movie distribution company. That movie opened in the USA at the Sutton on 57th Street in NYC in 1970 and got a fairly wide release. Adieu Poulet was released in the USA in 1979 playing at the 68th Street Playhouse where New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby gave the movie a bad review. Then oblivion for Adieu Poulet.I was able to see the movie with subtitles only because eight years ago CUNYTV used to show French movies on its cable channel subtitles courtesy of Julia McPhail. Adieu Poulet's tale involves crooked politicians the goons they hire to stamp out their opposition and even the operator of a whorehouse who says she has connections so Verjeat had better lay off her after an old customer drops dead in a bed with a built in vibrator. You know the subject of whores politicians distancing themselves from the deaths of civil servants and coverups of corruption are as timely now in New York City as over 30 years ago in Rouen.Just look at the coverup of the deaths of the two firefighters at the Deutsche Bank building fire in downtown Manhattan where Fire Commissioner Scoppetta who never spent a minute working as a firefighter is protecting himself and his boss Mayor Bloomberg by demoting FDNY brass convenient scapegoats for a fire at a building demolition project apparently being handled by a firm with organized crime ties. At least in Adieu Poulet the crooked politicians know that the solution to the Verjeat problem is a promotion not a demotion. In NYC whether it is reports by firefighters of massive explosions at the WTC buildings on 911 or the giant arson fire at the abandoned Brooklyn rope factory warehouse whose owner already had cleared out another building he owned with an arson fire or the 75 million demolition fee paid to demolish the Deutsche Bank building silence is golden.But the tough cops played by Lino Ventura are fictional characters. In the real world in New York City arson investigators spend their time not investigating crime but chauffeuring Fire Commissioner Scoppetta to meetings. At least Lardatte the scheming politician in Adieu Poulet is not a double dipper like Scoppetta who collects a big NYC government pension on top of his even bigger FDNY Commissioner salary and is only good at lying and covering up arson fires by connected real estate developers. Only in New York not Rouen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gianfranco Parolini's Adios Sabata ranks as one of the top 10 Spaghetti westerns of all time. Its' scenic photography clever dialogue marvelously choreographed gunfights fantastic music and harsh rugged scenery make this outlandish Yul Brynner horse opera worth watching. No it has nothing to do with the Lee Van Cleef movies oaters Sabata 1969 and Return of Sabata 1971. The original title for this exhilarating Yul Brynner shoot'em up was Indio Black.

Indeed where Lee Van Cleef's Sabata is elegant and welldressed Indio adopts the garb of a cavalry scout. He wears a fringed buckskin outfit. Unlike Sabata who relied primarily on a derringer Indio wields a sawedoff leveraction repeating carbine with a sideways ammunition magazine. He reserves the last chamber in the magazine to a cheroot.

Parolini lacks the baroque visual artistry of Sergio Leone. However he knew how to tell a good story and he could arrange interesting setpieces. Parolini coauthored the screenplay with Renato Izzo who had penned Kill and Pray and A Man Called Amen.Yul Brynner plays a sympathetic sharpshooting American soldieroffortune in black.

Indeed he has commissioned a portrait of himself apparently for himself since he has nobody living with him. Skimmel has no qualms about killing and makes an excellent villain. He detests informers uses their information and then kills them. Halfway between Sabata and Skimmel is Ballantine. This soldieroffortune Dean Reed of God Made Them... I Kill Them is an opportunists who throws his lot in with Sabata. Actually he has no qualms about getting whatever there is for himself and nobody else. Three Crosses of Death lenser Sandro Mancori captures the arid Spanish landscape in all its eternal grandeur and the vistas are beautiful. Mancori and Parolini hail from the school of filmmaking that relied heavily on zoom shots. Indio Black has more than its share of zoomout shots and zoomin shots. Indio Black is a hugely entertaining late 1860s epic that boasts the usual ritualistic duels and gunfights intrigue situations and surprises.The action opens at a Catholic mission in the wilderness as the priest Father Mike addresses a young Mexican village boy Juanito Luciano Casamonica of Tepepa laments the descent of mankind into savagery. There is too much violence in the world. Juanito reminds him that the Murdock brothers who stole everything from them and they deserve punishment. Ever gentle Father Mike replies You must try to forgive. Not sink into revenge. Colonel Skimmel a manacled bewhiskered autocrat in a crisp uniform. He likes to demonstrate his marksmanship with a rifle. Skimmel's favorite practice is to turn loose prisoners below on the drill grounds and let them see if they can outrun him without being shot down. Colonel Skimmel never misses. Meanwhile in Texas the Murdock brothers show up at the County Hunter Agency and shoot it out with Sabata. Mind you they don't stand a chance against Sabata. Sabata wipes them out without getting a scratch. Parolini does an excellent job orchestrating this opening shootout. The three Murdocks ride into the station. One drives a wagon with a coffin on it. We're all set for you to go out in style the oldest Murdock brother boasts. A weather vane whirls around in front of the station and the duelists warm up with each. Before they open fire on each other Sabata and old man Murdock provide a sample of their deadly marksmanship. They start the vane spinning with their bullets and they are told that once the vane comes to a stop they can blast away at each other. Even after Sabata has killed them he fires more shots at them. A Murdock hanging on a corral fence falls when Sabata's bullets smash into the railing. Sabata shoots the coffin lid so it falls shut on another dead Murdock. After the gunfight Seor Ocao Franco Fantasia of The Lion of St. Mark approaches Sabata about helping them. Sabata agrees to help them and gives the money to Juanito to take back to Father Mike. Basically our hero has agreed to find out when the gold leaves the fort at Guadalupe. He is also supposed to tell the revolutionaries which road the gold travels and he will make arrangements with the men who will sell the revolution firearms. Ocao informs his ally Escudo Pedro Sanchez of Any Gun Can Play about Sabata but Escudo hates that the revolution must depend on a foreign soldieroffortune. Colonel Skimmel has cooked up some schemes about smuggling a horde of gold out of the fort at Guadalupe. Writer  director Parolini does an excellent job of setting up and paying off several situations. The opening gunfight is exemplary. Colonel Skimmel's model of a sailing vessel perched atop a dresser is wired to the highest drawer so that when an unsuspecting fool opens the drawer the movement trips the small canon sticking out of the side of the ship. If you love Spaghetti westerns you owe it to yourself to watch Adios Sabata.".

Its' scenic photography clever dialogue marvelously choreographed gunfights fantastic music and harsh rugged scenery make this outlandish Yul Brynner horse opera worth watching. No it has nothing to do with the Lee Van Cleef movies oaters Sabata 1969 and Return of Sabata 1971. The original title for this exhilarating Yul Brynner shoot'em up was Indio Black.

Its enough to drive you crazy if you let it. I didn't since a good many of the spaghetti westerns I've seen make even less sense then this one.If you like Westerns this is one to see. Its perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. I'm still not sure if I think of Brenner's character as Sabata but it doesn't matter since no matter what he's called he's a kick ass hero with a smart ass mouth. What more could you want?".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly this is not a sequel to 1970's Sabata Ehi amico... c' Sabata hai chiuso! although it can be considered a follow up of sorts. Lee Van Cleef did not reprise the role until 1971's Return of Sabata. Adis Sabata was originally about a character called Indio Black and completely unrelated to the previous Sabata story  Indio I believe was meant to be nothing more than a bandit. The name was changed to cash in on the success of Sabata  though this film could be considered a true Sabata entry as a couple of stars return Pedro Sanchez Gianni Rizzo and the screenwriters and director are the same. Gianfranco Parolini Frank Kramer perhaps out does the previous film here keeping everything tighter  Sabata was a little too jokey although still excellent and one of the truly great Italian westerns whereas this is blatantly tongue in cheek. I feel the music is better in this film never intrusive and always fitting a triumph for Bruno Nicolai despite the fact that it is incredibly reminiscent of Morricone.As Sabata Brynner is a kind of antihero counterpart to Chris from The Magnificent Seven he even dresses out all in black here too. Grard Herter is great as the Austrian Colonel Skimmel at the time of Emperor Maximillian's Mexico  a kind of borderline camp Bond villain type complete with monacle and perfectly trimmed moustache. Oh and yes he is a dead shot with a rifle. In Sabata Franco Ressel's Stengel had his shootout's behind man shaped shields to live at the peak of danger or some such nonsense as his playtoy Herter's Skimmel has an even better one  a drawer beneath a model ship that when opened fires each cannon on the model directly into whoever opens the drawer. Like The Good the Bad and the Ugly which this film contains some surprisingly subtle references to the plot centres around a shipment of gold Sabata Escudo Sanchez and Ballantine Dean Reed want the wagon load of gold but it is also coveted by Maximillian's rebels. The scenes with the gold and the gold dust being poured outspilled is nicely complimented by Nicolai's incidental music which really does bring out the joy of the characters.I personally think it's a shame that Brynner and the others weren't brought back for another Sabata film because he plays the role much straighter than Van Cleef did and really does come across as a tough guy here who doesn't need to rely on his gun. Adis Sabata is a classic in it's own right and doesn't need to be viewed with the other Sabata entries. It's only downside is that after surpassing the superb original it left most people disappointed with the later Return of Sabata.Are these subtle hints to Leone's 1966 masterpiece? Sanchez Me I'd make a hiding place noone would find  stick it in the ground maybe in a cemetery... Reed the last line Hey fellas  are you gonna help me pick up the gold or not you sons of...! music takes over".

If you like soundtracks for these types of films then it's well worth picking up.  I know I'll be on the lookout for it.Lots of explosions and gunfire in this one as Brynner  Co. battle the Austrians under Maximillian in Mexico circa 1867 and steal their gold. There's nothing boring about it and it's facepaced with a few tricks such as the model of the ship in Colonel Skimmel's study that shoots real live ammo everytime someone opens the drawer below it.  I also like Brynner's sawedoff rifle with the clip that loads from the side.  He keeps a cigar in the last chamber and lights it up after every gun battle.  Very tongueincheek.I liked it.

Why they thought that a western with a big star like Yul Brynner wouldn't be popular enough on it's own and tried to cash in on the Sabata name is beyond me but studios and distributors did a lot of stupid things to film titles back then especially with the international releases so it's par for the course.Yul Brynner is interesting as the protagonist in this film. Too bad he didn't appear in any other spaghetti westerns. He's no Lee Van Cleef but he does have a style of his own. His accent makes him sound like Arnold Schwartzeneggar in some parts. Gerard Herter is great as the wicked Nazilike Austrian Colonel. I wasn't very impressed with any of the other actors in the movie. Dean Reed was especially awful and his character Ballantyne was very irritating. I kept hoping he would get killed throughout the whole movie but that damned Indio Black kept saving him.The music score is OK but not as good as most of Bruno Nicolai's other work and there are very long stretches of the film with no music at all where it probably could use some.The movie drags a little from the middle to the end. There's lots of action but it just doesn't have the pizazz or suspense of the really great spaghetti westerns. It would probably be better if it was shorter. Some movies like Sergio Leone's westerns for example are able to go on for 2 or 3 hours and not have a dull moment but this movie isn't one of them. It could have been 15 or 20 minutes shorter.Overall the production quality is good and the story is OK though it's nothing original. This one is worth watching but probably for spaghetti western fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "The manic westerns of Gianfranco Parolini are like surreal comic books with outrageous editing and angles bizarre weaponry confusing language episodic plots where every scene has a punchline and ridiculous costumes. His films have a sense of tongue in cheek fun that comes through clearly thirty years later. It appears that the circus was his model unpretentious entertainment pure and simple.

	schema:reviewBody "Although originally not intended as a sequel to the Sabatofilms the theme song tries real hard to help us memorizing the protagonist's name. It's a cool song nevertheless but the singer repeats the name Sabato at least 30 times in only 3 minutes and there aren't much other lyrics... Anyways Adios Sabato is a pretty awesome spaghettiwestern with many great plot lines entire truckloads of exciting action sequences and an unusually high amount of truly ingenious gimmicks. One western legend replaces the other as no one less than Yul Brynner takes over the titular role from Lee Van Cleef who sadly couldn't make it back to Italy in time to reprise his role. The opening scenes show Sabato dueling fellow gunslingers for money but he soon joins a group of Mexican rebels in their everlasting quest against sadistic Austrian army troops. When Sabato and his outrageously eccentric Mexican friends steal a chest full of gold they have to gunfight their way back to freedom. There's not a minute going by without director Gianfranco Paroline adding some kind of exhilarating twist or impressively staged actionstunt. Whenever they're not hunting for gold the heroes as well as the supermean villains pass their time playing violent shooting games whether it's recruiting the most courageous new warrior or simply aiming at poor Mexican prisoners for the sake of amusement. Yul Brynner's character is in many ways reminiscent to Chris Adams the heroic cowboy leader of The Magnificent Seven. Sabato or Indio Black if you insist is a silent but extremely authoritative figure and it's actually his Mexican companions who are the more enthusiast fighters. One of them creatively kills his opponents by footkicking metal bulletlike projectiles at them and another one Gitano always offers his victims a nifty flamencodance before wasting them. Colonel Skimmel the Austrian bervillain has an inventive collection murderous toys as well most notably a miniature model ship of which the little canons fire off actual bullets whenever an unwelcome intruder opens the wrong drawer. Like I said Adios Sabato is stuffed with remarkably cool gimmicks that all help making the film delightfully comical and almost cartoonish even. As always Bruno Nicolai provides a wondrous musical score with catchy tunes and whistles. Nicolai was a brilliant Italian composer on par with Riz Ortolani and actually not too far behind on Ennio Morricone. Imaginative camerawork and splendid editing also contribute in making Adios Sabato another absolute winner in the terrific genre of spaghettiwesterns.".

It's not as good as the first Van Cleef film but better than the second. The coolest thing about this movie is seeing Yul Brynner in a wicked '70s set up complete with black costume open shirt and the like. Brynner's name is Indio Black in the original Sabata in the version attempting to tie it in to the Van Cleef series.Once again the plot centres around a gold shipment and efforts by rival parties to get their hands on it. Brynner sort of moves in and out of the story and takes care of a bunch of soldiers and henchmen along the way. The Mexican revolutionaries are posited as the 'good' characters in this film perhaps the Italians identified with them better given that this was shot in Spain. Care is taken to make the main bad guy an Austrian rather than American. The film is well shot and written and proves an entertaining example of the spaghetti western genre.".

For example Franco Nero's Django was very successful so practically every Italian film producer brought out a Django film but with a different leading manand a completely different plot! Here cashing in on the Sabata craze small as it was a nonSabata film starring Yul Brynner is suddenly a Sabata film thanks to dubbing! In fact originally Brynner's character was called 'Indigo Black'. I checked and there were seven Sabata filmsonly two which are REAL Sabata films with Lee Van Cleef. The rest like Adios Sabata are just ripoffs. So is this a BAD ripoff or a decent and watchable ripoff? Read on to see...The plot of this film is close to that of a real Sabata film in that although he looks mean and shoots people by the score this incarnation finds him doing this in order to help the Mexican Civil War of 1867. Now that doesn't mean he won't take a percentage for himself as well! A percentage of what you may ask....GOLD. It seems an evil but very stylish Austrian colonel is shipping goldgold which could be used by the revolutionaries to buy weapons. However Sabata isn't alone in this questhe's taking along a fat guy two VERY strange acrobats and a prettyboy named Ballentinewho you KNOW is up to no good.As far as Italian westerns go this theme is VERY commonthough most of the time the hero is helping the antiDiaz forces of the Mexican Civil War of the 1910s. This one is set much earlier and has to do with getting rid of the imposed leader Maximillian. Regardless this one is reasonably entertaining full of insanely good shots and has a touch of humor. Worth seeing but not a particularly novel film...except when it comes to one of the acrobats. His skill is handling a very large ball bearing kind of like a hacky sackwhich he then hurls with his foot at people with deadly accuracy! Ha...worth seeing just to see this guy in action. ball bearing guyThe same spirit of intellectual dishonesty was also rampant in Asian films after the death of Bruce Lee. Many supposedly new and recently discovered Lee films flooded the marketstarring folks such as Bruce Li or consisting of home movies of Lee or outtakes from his films interspersed with a double wearing sunglasses!

It's such a clear case of imperialism.But Yul isn't a total good guy and he teams up with three partners to steal a shipment of gold from the occupiers and give it to the Juaristas ostensibly.

And they've got another along an American played by the only American actor in Adios Sabata Dean Reed who has an agenda all his own who keeps a positively explosive diary.As most of us know even those who get their history from films the Emperor Maximilian was an Austrian but who was put on the newly created Mexican throne by the French and sustained by the French army. But here we have Austrian occupiers including an Austrian commander who also has a private agenda. I'm betting the producers were thinking that German types make so much better villains than the French.Sabata's distinguishing characteristic was a rife that he had a long holster for and drew like a revolver. This rife had a unique horizontal magazine from where the bullets came. But the last chamber always had a cigar which Yul would light up after a killing well done.I'm not a fan of spaghetti westerns and don't usually give them good reviews. It's the American genre and should be done by Americans. This one is no exception. But I will say that Yul Brynner's cynical look throughout the film is quite priceless.".

It kept me glued throughout the whole film. Brilliant music score acting is a bit wooden but although Yul Brynner is in this one you'll be sure that he'll get the job done..!".

He is helped by a con man named Valentine even though Valentine isn't exactly trying to help anyone but himself.First of all this wasn't meant to be a sequel to Sabata  it is called Indio Black you know what you are a son of a ... It had different characters and was actually a lot different but they ultimately changed a few things and made it a sequel or at least promoted it as one. Cleef had took on a role in The Magnificent Seven sequel made famous by Bryner and Bryner took on this role made famous by Cleef.There is a lot of changes here. About the only thing the same is the black clothes but Bryners suit is way different and his style is different. He does carry the little pistol with bullets in the butt but he also carries a Winchestor with a nice magazine always with a bullet short for his cigar.Frank Kramer is back doing his beautiful direction and also with his cowriting partner Renato Izzo. The composer is different and I like it better even though it doesn't sound completely original it's almost clich but I liked it.Acting wise of course Bryner replaces Cleef but all the rest of the characters are someone different if they made it back at all. Pedro Sanchez is a different guy as is Gianni Rizzo and a few others. Alley cat was replaced by a similar character in here only now a dancing Mexican fills the shoes.This movie was less original had slower parts and just not nearly as fun or exciting as the first  I give it 510 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the strangest westerns ever made and that includes the various incarnations of the spaghetti variety. And it isn't all bad. Yul Brynner is at the top of his game and that is saying something. But everything around him is so bizarre that it's almost like walking into an episode of The Prisoner with nothing looking quite right and nobody taking things quite seriously enough. The difference is that there it's not supposed to look like it makes sense. Here unfortunately it is supposed to  I think.Anyway Yul plays your standardissue cool unshakable unbeatable gunfighter naturally clad all in black the kind that pops up with great regularity in bad movies. But he is such a fine actor that he adds a knowing look here a smirk there to show an intelligence usually missing in these kind of heroes. He even plays classical piano  Clint Eastwood never did THAT.But he isn't given much to play off. Dean Reed who? plays the closest thing to a buddy he has here a completely outofplace traitor to the infamous Mexican Maximilian government and to everyone else. As is always always always the case in these films about the Maximilian days it all comes down to the government's gold and who gets it. I won't spoil the ending but if you've seen any other film about the Maximilian days you already know who will get the gold that everybody is after. More evidence of a poor script....The plot itself is pretty much beside the point though. Even Yul good as he is is really just window dressing. The really striking thing about this film is the villains. Maximilian and his henchmen are always portrayed so originally in films about the period. In the fine Veracruz they were portrayed as medieval French knights. In Undefeated basically overdressed locals. Here they are Austrians yes you read that right Austrians wearing bowler hats yes big old bowlers in the hot sun and three piece suits no I'm really not kidding. Come on where else are you going to see grimy revolutionaries in handtohand combat with downtown bankers? Seriously! And Blofeld I mean Colonel Skimmer is busy adjusting his monocle ! while pulling the strings and using prisoners for his target practice.Worth it for the surreal nature of the bad guys the glaringly obvious references to better spaghetti westerns the visuals the music the ubiquitous musical watch the reference to burying the gold in a cemetery and of course unforgettable Yul.".

One of them even says 'I'll be back!' Yul Bryner plays Sabata this time round a bounty killer with a good heart and no concept of money. The money he makes from shoot outs goes to the local monastery they don't approve! so when he's roped into killing one of the local Austrian senior officers he's all for it until he realises that this is your usual double crossing gold stealing plot.All is not lost. Even though this plot is played out like some Western frontier mine we still get a few quirks to keep our attention like Sal Borgese's mute bandit character. He doesn't say much but he has two musket balls that he drops into special pockets in his shoes that he then fires at people's heads. He also has a friend who dances while the head bandit guy prepares to kill someone.There's also an insanely high body count even for a film like this where most of Mexico is killed in a barrage of dynamite and bullets and of course there's the tenuous relationship between Yul and the other good guy that results in gold swapping hands various times which leads to an ending which drags on slightly for those who have witnessed it several times by this point.".

But I don't think anyone will care one way or another because what we have here is a coooooooool spaghetti western! It obviously had a decent budget because the look of the movie is spot on from the sets to the very colorful backdrops. And the production also had the money to hire Yul Brynner who makes for a very good antihero cool under pressure and tough but always striving to do the right thing. Most importantly he gets into a lot of action and the action sequences are exciting and have a high body count. And boy does the movie have a lot of style from some crazy camerawork to unforgettable moments like the flamenco of death! Are there any flaws in this movie? Well if pressed I would admit that there is one real flaw I think the movie is a little too long. If it had been about fifteen or so minutes shorter I think it would have moved much better. But better to be cool stylish and long rather than be shorter and without passion or bite.".

Yul Brynner is capably smooth as Sabata and we loved Gianni Rizzo's delightfully rotund villain. Also worthy of note is Sal Borghese who has certainly an unusual method of dispatching opposition. All told what we have here is an entertaining expensively produced western aided by a fine Bruno Nicolai music score which would be impossible for a late coming patrons to distinguish from Morricone with lots of shooting shouting dynamiting and destruction all filmed on natural locales. Director Gianfranco Parolini likes to get a bit too close to the action for my taste and the color photography tends to be a but grainy but these are minor irritations.".

An insanely fun western that will keep you entertained with its plethora of actionpacked overthetop gunfights and battles. Brynner plays the stereotypical cowboy lead character but the plot isn't stereotypical at all. The story takes place in Mexico where a revolution is brewing against the Austrians. You know you want to see a movie featuring cowboys vs. Austrian soldiers!

This review will only be on Adios sabata but be sure to check my other reviews for the rest of the 3 films.Now onto the movie. Man. It's hard to do this film justice! This movie is truly a hidden gem in the western archive of movies and is extremely underrated. If I ruled the country I would have the movie poster slapped on every wall i could get my hands on. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FILM.The plot line goes like this A gunfighter a bunch of triggerhappy Mexicans and a 2 faced gringo start raiding waggon loads of gold off a Austrian colonel. He doesn't take kindly to this so he tries to exterminate them with the full might of the Austrian army.The plot line is a lot deeper than the first with interesting plot twists and characters. The characters are really diverse and no character is the same. There is Sabata who seeks justice and gold at the same time. There is a honourable Mexican who executes people he doesn't like. Before his selfproclaimed executions one of the Mexicans dance on the table and when he stops dancing he shoots. Then there is also septembre who fires small grey metal balls from his shoes I don't know who made this but they are bonkers!. Finally there is an artist who has a bad memory. All the characters were well made and Had some good scenes of dialogue. The action is fantastic. In fact it's the main part of the film! There is constant shootoutsShootouts in a barn shootouts in a deserted castle in the middle of nowhere shootouts at a saloon lets just say if you love action you would be crazy to miss this fantastic action extravaganza. The battle at the end is simply fantastic. We've got Gatling guns blazing bombs exploding and Austrian solders flying everywhere. It's loud fun and exhilarating. Even if you don't like story of the whole film or if you don't like the fact Lee van clef isn't in it at least watch it for the battle!Sabata this time around is played by The Magnificent Seven's Yel Brynner. Many western fans don't like the film or dismiss it entirely just because Lee van Cleff isn't in it thus making it rubbish. The film isn't even intended to be a Sabata film and it isn't one over in Spain. Istead the main character is called Indeo black. It got the name Adios sabata when it hit America. The company wanted to cashin on Sabata which was popular at the time so they could pocket some more money. To me it doesn't matter who sabata is played by as long as he is Sabata. The ironic thing is the reason Lee Van Clef couldn't do the role is because he was staring in a sequel to one of Yel's movies The magnificent seven ride!This is probably one of the best westerns ever made and one of my favourite films of all time.If you want some fun laughs and good old entertainment pay sabata a visit.".

	schema:reviewBody "The director writer and producer are all the same and we have several supporting players returning but Brynner supplants Van Cleef as The Man With The Gunsight Eyes. Does it work? Well yes to a point. ADIOS SABATA is like the other movies in this series a densely plotted somewhat tongueincheek western yarn. In each of the Sabata films I promise you you will lose track of who is plotting against whom and with which ne'erdowells on his side. There will also be moments of wry humor along with acrobatic stunt work. And stuff will blow up and people will be improbably shot from a long distance away.All of that happens in ADIOS but it happens with Brynner at the helm so the charisma factor is lessened by a notch or two. Where Van Cleef had steeleyed machismo and a barbed tongue ol' Yul provides an exotic gypsystyle appeal all flowing frills and phallic rifle. For real this Sabata looks like a backup dancer in a Vegas revue with his allblack outfit and openshirt styling. As for the senseofhumor aspect of the character Brynner's unusual accent tends to give those sardonic Sabata oneliners a bit of a Schwarzenegger feel but still yet he's charming so it works.Brynner like LVC has a great supporting cast to back him up. Returning from the first film in different roles are the stolid Gianni Rizzo and the boisterous Pedro Sanchez. American expat Dean Reed is present as a handsome sleazy sidekick Gerard Herter portrays a cruel Colonel and the wonderful Sal Borgese shines as Sabata's mute musicboxobsessed cohort. All are excellent with Borgese and Sanchez really notable for fine work.Gianfranco ParoliniFrank Kramer who handled the direction of all three Sabata flicks is equally capable of staging big booming explosions and a subtle eyebrow tilt I'd say he's more adept at the latter. He gets a lot from a knowing glance curious peek or simple crossing of legs putting each actor's business to great use in moving the story.At 1 hour 44 minutes ADIOS SABATA gets a little long with its protracted showdown and search for gold. That said the pic is an ablyproduced entertaining Spaghetti Western good of its type and recommended to fans of its star and genre enthusiasts. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer  director Gianfranco Parolini's crisp follow up two years later was simply just another crack but Lee Van Cleef wouldn't return. Instead we get Yul Brynner decked in black as our man the bounty hunter Sabata who's quick with a gun. As much as I liked Van Cleef in the title role a curt Brynner stuck with me more. As it's hard to take your eyes off the man. While the cold edge was there the humane side still showed without really letting you in. This made his shady character a lot more mysterious. Although Van Cleef would return to the Sabata role in Parolini's next sequel Return of Sabata.Hired gunslinger Sabata takes on a job to steal a wagon of gold from the Austrian army to help the fighting Mexican revolutionaries but the job doesn't entirely go to plan. The narrative had some recurring themes that feel like they have been lifted right out of the original source. Despite the familiar staples the pessimistic plot is never too straightforward with its scheming humour and there's a new gimmick or two anyone up for stone marbles. The surprises are foreseeable but its operatic style consists of flair and danger in a much more expansive manner. The shootouts involving Mexicans and gunrunners are mechanically staged but there are some jarringly artistic shots local flavour from the locations and sharp camerawork along with the bombastic music score. The way the camera presented some scenes if would have you believing that maybe this was shot in 3D. That would have been interesting if so. The performances are spot on and fruitful in characterisations as Parolini reuses some the actors from the original in different roles. Dean Reed works off Brynner quite well which reminded me of the pairing of Van Cleef and Berger in Sabata. Too bad I found the latter to be better implemented though. Ignazio Spalla gives an animated turn as one of the Mexican revolutionaries and Gerard Herter is imposing as the gleefully sadistic Austrian Colonel Skimmel.Conventional but capable Italian western.I play solo.".

Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidani's movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like Django of Sartana to the titles. I the particular case of Gi La Testa... Hombre of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone's Gi La Testa aka. Duck You Sucker and added 'Hombre'. The movie can be found under various titles Fistful Of Death Western Story... I personally bought it under the name Adios Companeros which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari which is also entitled Adios Companeros in the German language version.The plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan Jeff Cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy Jack Betts and Ironhead Gordon Mitchell.The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is kindly stated not very convincing. Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as 'Butch Cassidy'. Bmovie legend Gordon Mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasn't a very good actor I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of Fidani's movies such as the rather crappy Django And Sartana... Showdown in the West.There is one funny and original thing about Gi La Testa... Hombre  the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest. One scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good moment in this. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography. Overall only watchable for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good S.W. plenty of action  shootouts  thrills and fistplay . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Giuliano Gemma against the heartless Peter Cross  his son Massimo Righi and his underlings as Nello Pazzafini . It deals with a cowboy named Brent Landers Giuliano Gemma is deceived by Gil Clawson Nello Pazzafini and after taking place a shotdown in which dies a man called Stan Clevenger Germano Longo . Tricked into buying stolen cattle  Brent on the run for a killing he didn't commit . Landers attempts to clear his name and he narrowly breaks out being lynched . Brent goes to New Mexico where he hopes encounter a person who can exculpate him . While on his way along the desert Las Mesas he finds a wounded woman Ida Gally or Evelyn Stewart who has been abducted  tortured  tied in front of sun  sets her free and then takes his vengeance . They arrive in a little town called Sage Crossing where rules a wealthy owner called Clayton Ranchester Peter Cross or Pierre Cressoy and his son Massimo Rhigi . Still wanted he hunts down the actual cattle rustlers and he befriends the town doctor Roberto Camardiel and the sheriff Jesus Puente . Agreeable ChorizoSpaghetti Western coproduced by Spain Italy and France and follows the American models more than Sergio Leone style . This Western is a superior outing because it displays thrills  emotion  shoot'em up  brawls  intrigue  riding pursuits and many other things . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shots or stunts every few minutes . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge  as a gunfighter looks for a man in a border little town and seeks vendetta against the woman's torturers . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare  but what makes this movie stand out is its style . The starring called Brent is stunningly played by Giuliano Gemma . Giuliano is very fine  he ravages the screen  he jumps  bounds and leaps  hit and run . Gemma as a brave and twofisted gunslinger is terrific  subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghettis . Gemma  along with Anthony Steffen and Gianni Garco  results to be one of the greatest stars of the Spaghetti genre .Gemma in his beginning worked as stuntman  practiced many sports in his life boxing gymnastics such as is well proved at the movie . Then the director Duccio Tessari gave him the first role as protagonist in the film  The Titani and the first spaghetti western films where he often worked under the name of Montgomery Wood  playing Western as A pistol for Ringo The return of Ringo and others as Adios Gringo Arizona Colt The price of power  Day of anger and later California. However his first big opportunity came with the important Italian director Luchino Visconti in El Gatopardo this was followed by important roles in Angelica  Tenebre  Young Lions and The master touch. Then he played his most significant roles in Il Deserto Dei Tartari and Il Prefetto Di Ferro .In the movie appears usual support actors as Spanish  Roberto Camardiel  Frank Braa  Antonio Iranzo  Jesus Puente as Italian players as Pierre Cressoy  Massimo Righi Jeff Cameron as a hoodlum  Germano Longo and of course  Nello Pazzafini . It's a coproduction SpanishItalian and shot on location in Manzanares Del Real  La Pedriza and Colmenar Viejo Madrid  Spain . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction  excellent production design  and atmospheric cinematography by Francisco Sempere  he creates a magnificent scenario on the interior ranch and barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun . The music original by Benedetto Ghiglia composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted and splendid leitmotif  it's full of enjoyable sounds and emotive score  including enjoyable songs at the beginning and the end.The flick was professionally directed by Giorgo Stegani or George Finley  though with no originality . This Italian writer  filmmaker so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . He wrote several Western and intriguing films . He's is an expert writer of Giallo and Western as Blood of a silver dollar and  Beyond the law  and occasionally Western director as Adios Gringo  Beyond the law  and Gentleman Jo. Rating  6 . Acceptable and passable Western that will appeal to Spahetti fans because being filled with action  thrills  intrigue and crossfire".

It wastes no time getting to business the dire situation for the hero is set up in the movie's first six minutes! And the remaining eighty seven or so minutes are extremely captivating. This spaghetti western has a particular hard edge from the many killings fist fights and the humiliation and ordeal the movie's leading female character is forced to go through. Also the movie really puts the pressure on the hero making his list of problems increase as the movie progresses from one scene to another. I was frequently wondering if the hero would ever clear his name! The action sequences though a bit sporadic are very well done  you really feel the punches and the bullet wounds. The icing on the cake is a nice musical score. If there is any problem with the movie it would have to be the title  why it is in Spanish when the movie takes place in the United States and with no Mexicans around is a mystery. But that's a minor quibble. Check this movie out!".

When his sister falls hitting her head on a stone and drowns in the lake David is unable to save her. Blaming himself for her death David becomes a Phd in Paranormal studies. Years later after a successful career of exposing fraudulent mediums David is recalled to his former home by an old woman who writes to say the home she works in is haunted.David is met at the station by Christina Beckinsale a bewitchingly beautiful woman who drives extremely dangerously and thinks nothing of stripping her clothes off and swimming in the nude in front of Dr. Ash though she has just met him. When one of her brothers also swims nude David is still more surprised.The older brother is barely tolerant of David and wants him to do his job as rapidly as possible and not get involved with his sister. David talks to the elderly woman referred to as Nanny learning of the tragic death of Christina's parents. During his attempts to understand what is going on David has several very frightening moments. The Special effects are outstanding by the way.While making his investigation David comes across a shocking family secret and sees the ghost of what may be his own sister near the lake. He then has several more strange experiences which cause him to doubt his sanity. The only person who seems to understand his confusion is the elderly doctor who is the family physician. David visits the old man at his home in the village which helps him realize he is not insane but still leaves him with unanswered questions.The shocking conclusion will completely twist everything you think you know about ghosts and reality. This film may be the seminal influence in a new era of ghost stories on film which was lately added to by the talented director Alejandro Amenabar who gave us THE OTHERS starring Nicole Kidman. If you like ghost stories HAUNTED is a must see.".

David talks to the elderly woman referred to as Nanny learning of the tragic death of Christina's parents. During his attempts to understand what is going on David has several very frightening moments. The Special effects are outstanding by the way.While making his investigation David comes across a shocking family secret and sees the ghost of what may be his own sister near the lake. He then has several more strange experiences which cause him to doubt his sanity. The only person who seems to understand his confusion is the elderly doctor who is the family physician. David visits the old man at his home in the village which helps him realize he is not insane but still leaves him with unanswered questions.The shocking conclusion will completely twist everything you think you know about ghosts and reality. This film may be the seminal influence in a new era of ghost stories on film which was lately added to by the talented director Alejandro Amenabar who gave us THE OTHERS starring Nicole Kidman. If you like ghost stories HAUNTED is a must see.";

	schema:headline " One of the BestUnknown Ghost Stories Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1905 in Sussex England the young boy David loses his twin sister while playing with her nearby a lake. The girl falls and drowns in the lake and David feels guilty for her death. The grieving family returns to USA and twentythree years later David Ash Aidan Quinn comes back to England to be the professor of psychology in the University of Camberley. The skeptical David is specialized in psychic phenomena and exposition of false mediums and frauds and wrote a successful book about this subject. After a countless number of calls from an elder lady called Miss Webb Anna Massey claiming to be haunted by ghosts David is informed that the lady lives in Edbrook and he decides to accept her invitation to visit her. When he arrives in Edbrook's train station the beautiful young woman Christina Mariell Kate Beckinsale is waiting for him. She drives him to her remote mansion where she lives with her two brothers and their former nanny Miss Webb. After being introduced to the family David finds the behavior of Miss Webb very weird and disturbed but decides to investigate the existence of any psychic phenomena in the place. Meanwhile Christina and him fall in love for each other. Their romance and his investigation come to surprising revelations. I do not understand why Haunted has not become a successful movie. This awesome story slightly recalls The Innocents and is better than The Others The Sixth Sense or El Espinazo del Diablo having romance sexual situation drama and horror in right doses. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful of the cinema and may be compared to Somewhere in Time. Kate Beckinsale with twentytwo years old is astonishing and the scenes with her naked body would be enough to make this movie worthwhile. But the chemistry between Aidan Quinn and her is marvelous the mysterious story is magnificently well tight and in the end nothing is like it seems to be. Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time on VHS since the DVD has not been released in Brazil and I found it again one of the best ghost stories I have ever seen. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Iluses Perigosas Dangerous IlusionsObs On 12 Oct 2007 I saw this awesome movie again now on DVD.".

Haunted is one of the finest movies i've seen in many years and it's really a shame that not many people have seen it.The cast is superb with each character standing out even those with just a couple lines the fortune teller who reads David and Christina's palms is a good example. The stars Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale are in excellent form but Anthony Andrews steals the show in this one. He plays the character of Robert the jealous and controlling big brother. There is a brilliant shot of his pale depressed face surrounded by mocking darkness that perfectly defines the torturedsoul of the character. Anthony Andrews has such a strong masculine English voice that makes him wonderful for all sorts of different roles. Just as entertaining is the younger brother Simon played by Alex Lowe who is an obnoxious prankster with a playful soul. The late great John Gielgud is also memorable in this movie for his portrayal of a kind but mysterious doctor. Lewis Gilbert's direction is absolutely flawless and i definately look forward to seeing his other films. Haunted is such an attractive movie everything looks so heavenly and enticing. In the daytime Edbrook is such a charming place a wonderful place to spend your childhood but when night creeps up it shows a perfect gothic presence. Haunted is probably the best ghost story i've ever experienced. It's unpredictable charming touching frightening and constantly entertaining. Perhaps my favorite scene is when David tries to trap a possible ghost outside of the Mariell mansion and from out of nowhere a cloud of dust spins in fascination. Soon after a distorted ghost that sobs uncontrollably is conjured that floats away beckoning David to follow it to the angry lake. This is one of the many truly magical moments found in this oneofkind film. The sound effects are just as impressive as the visuals the sounds of the howling wind and crashing rain are terrific. Also the score is heartbreakingly lovely.Even if you don't like horror movies you need to give this one a shot because it has so much to offer. There is no gore so squeamishstomach people should have a pleasant time with this one.  Rent or buy Lewis Gilbert's Haunted now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     out of 5You had your chance to leave David".

Surprisingly for a mistery movie this doesnt loose its appeal even when we are watching it for the second time. Even when we already know how its going to end.The first time we see it its great and we spend the whole movie trying to guess what is going to happen next even if the ending might be a bit easy to guess from a certain point in the movie if we pay atention to some details.Anyway this is an excelent movie the atmosphere is perfect. Very intriguing and misterious but at the same time set in very normal locations. Normaly ghost movies are associated to lots of scenes in the dark but this movie is a very bright movie with most of its story set in very iluminated places contrary to the classic ghost storytelling. But at the same time even during normal scenes whe can feel that there is something wrong in the air and this is what makes this movie so atmospheric. It realy feels like the whole movie is haunted. We can watch it again and again and keep finding new small details that we missed the first time.But what ghost story would be without scares and chills. Well there are a couple of scary moments in here also and some very good chilling sequences. Most of them is actualy in our minds because ther arent many special effects in but thats the way a good ghost story should be presented. The atmosphere in this is so good that if the few flashy special effects that are present were removed it wouldnt make a diference. But fear not this is not a Spielberg effects film the atmosphere is what counts here. And it has loads of it.Overall this is at least a very diferent ghost story and originaly presented. Dont skip this movie if you like ghost stories.Excelent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of  Haunted is probably a slightly better movie than I'm giving it credit for but after having seen so many similarly themed supernatural dramas the past few years this one just didn't have the impact on me it could have had if I'd seen it back in '95. So take that into account for both my rating and my review.Set mostly in the English countryside in the early 1900s Aidan Quinn stars as David Ash a professor who spends his time debunking the supernatural. His latest investigation takes him to a country manor occupied by three siblings two brothers and a sister played by the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale and their housekeeper who claims the estate is haunted.Initially the strangest oddities Ash notices is the pseudoincestuous way the siblings act around each other the older brother paints the sister Christina in the nude and she and the younger brother often go skinnydipping in the lake together. Still Ash finds himself falling for the lovely Christina even as he ponders the history of the manor its occupants and the secret behind this haunting.By most standards Haunted is not a bad movie. In fact it's got plenty of merit. The cinematography and locations are beautiful the pacing is rather brisk despite the fact very little actually happens onscreen and Kate Beckinsale is so breathtakingly gorgeous it's hard to believe a person could be so naturally luminous. I would wager anyone new to the genre would probably enjoy the movie quite a bit.But as someone expecting something innovative or original the film just didn't do it for me. From the beginning the climactic twist is blatantly obvious and unlike the later films this twist inspired it's not structured in such a manner that you'd gain a new appreciation of the film by reobserving the hints.While I gather that the film is partly a romantic drama the tone and atmosphere are a little too light such that when the film does attempt its scares they never fully work this is the kind of horror movie that'd work well for those who generally don't like horror. It surely doesn't help that few of the characters even seem concerned the manor might be haunted.But as a romantic drama the film is a moderate success. Aidan Quinn makes a likable enough protagonist and Kate Beckinsale is not only a physically wondrous presence I would have been inclined to bump the rating up if her nude scenes had been genuine she's immensely charming and appealing as well. There's enough solid chemistry between the two to sustain a large portion of the film. But even this story stumbles pretty badly once it intersects with the haunted manor plot both leading to an unsatisfying ending. Come to think of it even if I had seen the film in its initial release the twist might have worked as a genuine surprise but it really harms the film more than it helps so perhaps it makes little difference the twist is so obvious.I have little regret of the time and money I spent to watch the film it's still going to be required viewing for Beckinsale fans like myself who'll watch her in just about anything. But with so many superior entries in the genre the film otherwise wouldn't be worth mentioning without her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone has seen one or more ghost movies and some of them are good some of them are bad... But this is far the most superb I've ever seen! First of all the atmosphere was correctly hit by the director. There are few films that can depict an era in the right way. I think noone could represent the 1920's Sussex better although I'm not English and can not say this without being there in that place. About the music just in some words I would give for it an OSCAR! Well I can also just praise the writer for the plot. It is really mysterious and till the last 10 minutes I still didn't know surely that the Mariels were... But it's useless to tell more about it IT'S EXCELLENT IN ANY WAYS I SUGGEST YOU TO WATCH IT!!!".

One day he is called to visit a house inhabited by a troubled old lady who reports she's being harassed by three young people she used to take care of as children. The story takes place in the 1920s and is full of atmosphere. The house has a life of its own and plays an important role throughout the movie. It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again because it has an excellent plot great acting and a beautiful soundtrack. It's a gripping movie with an enthralling story to tell and the director does it successfully.It turns out it's not only about ghosts and haunted houses it's about the power of love and its determination and struggle to cross the boundaries of life and death in search of eternity.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of years old this now but still worth a mention.  Originally A very spooky James Herbert book the film doesn't quite hit the mark in the same way but it's still worth a look especially if you haven't read the book. Dashing surrogate Yank Psychologist Quinn returns to native England in the thirties with two aims to pursue an academic career and the expose all who make others believe in a spirit world. He investigates the case of a mad old woman whose house is supposedly haunted by her daughter and husband. Her three adult grandchildren are also in tow including the alluring Christina Kate Beckinsdale  alluring enough to tempt at least one of her brothers and the new visitor.

Quinn is somewhat wooden and its left to Kate Beckinsale to add zest and glamor which she does effectively with several nude scenes and some moments of steamy sex. Lewis Gilbert directs without enthusiasm though at times can we see traces of his earlier and better screen work. Finally the plot which has a major twist at the ending is full of red herrings and pot holes which makes it less than believable.

I can't see why the the film was reset to the twenties. Again in the book Ash is a flawed character  seedy alcoholic and guilt ridden not a dashing professional. As eluded to elsewhere the incest angle between brother and sister was quite an invention of the film and may have been included as an excuse to portray much female nudity both real and canvas born. Many of the details of the book that show Ash's increasing horror that the family are phantoms such as a one sided conversation on a tape recorder and the bed he shared with Christina obviously having been slept in by only him are brushed over. A whole episode in the book where Ash does debunk some hoaxers in a supposedly haunted church is missed out too.Admittedly as a stand alone ghost movie it is not bad but it cannot be called a close adaption of the book.".

Receiving an invitation from the Mariell family to investigate supernatural activity at their family home Edbrook House David accepts and quickly finds his life flipped upside downIt's from the old fashioned school of horror a period piece of some worth but not one for anyone looking to be scared out of their wits. Actually the novel by the late great James Herbert was becalmed when judged by his superb standards so it really will help any potential first time viewer to go into this expecting a more ethereal chiller than anything else.There's an air of romanticism constantly hanging in the air and with Gilbert nodding towards the likes of The Haunting for his scares and Don't Look Now for the meditation on grief angle it's a film of mixed blessings. Also nice to see very good period design for the 1920s setting while Roberts' photography skilfully brings beauty to the English countryside and murkier tones for the inner workings of Edbrook House.Cast are fine with Quinn and a perky Beckinsale creating good sensual chemistry and Andrews and Lowe are suitably odd as the clearly off kilter Mariell brothers. Massey however is not challenged by her role and Gilegud is only really filing in for an easy money cameo. It gets away from itself a little in the final stretch where it's not helped by some shoddy effects work but there's good value to be had in the picture. With grief guilt redemption and incest bubbling away thematically and the spectral visage of David's dead sister haunting the edges of the frame film never lacks for literate effort or a sense of unease. The book is much better mind. 710".

Staying in student accomadation with my friend and this movie happened to come on late night television he demanded that we watch it he had bought the beer so I said yes.At first glance this movie starts a bit slow with Aidan Quinn's character David reminising bout the death of his sister 20 years before which he blames himself for. David returns from the first World War and gets a job lecturing in Cambridge plus he also acts on debunking fake paranormal activity.Its on the strength of this that he is contacted by a Nanny of a manor house in English countryside asking for him to come to the house to prove that she is not crazy.  David heads to the manor home and when he gets their he is entrahlled by the beauty of ChristineKate Beckinsale daughter of the manor house and her two rather eccentric brothers.  David then starts to ask questions....A number of things in this movie deserve the two thumbs up from me. Firstly the locations.  The 1920's setting is perfect for this movie lending the proceedings a certain reminisanct quality and a magical sense of things gone by.  The locations are beautiful ranging from the manor house to the surrounding countryside every thing the camera touches leaves you speechlessI live in Scotland were we are surrounded by beautiful countryside and his movie at this effect on me.  Secondly the acting. Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale both are brilliant in their roles as protagonist and love interest and its easy to see why Ms Beckinsale to close to cracking Hollywood.  The brothers lend a slightly sinister air to what would just be a standard love story.  Thirdly the tight direction.  Lewis Gilbert keep things taut and tends to use quick cuts to emphasise the action and long shots which in my opinion highlights the inner struggle of David. Also John Geilgiud appears in a strong supporting role as the village doctor putting in a  typical good performance.I only have a few quibbles concerning this fantastic movie.  Firstly the movie seems a bit slow to start with but then builds up about half an hour into it. Also I felt that nudity wasn't really required in this movie there was no need for breast shots who cares? Similary one of the subplots seems to fall by the wayside towards the end with David showing disgust one moment but forgetting about the incident shortly later.Overall i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to all movie fans who then can look towards Bruce Willis and Nicole Kidman movies of similar ilk and still say 'original'.".

Though set ostensibly in postCivil War America this isn't an America recognisable from myth cinema TV etc.  The film has an air of timeless fable about it while dealing specifically with Western mythology.Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnecting stories all dealing with the traditional Western clash of the primitive and civilisation.  The former seems to have the upper hand.  The vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken ripe for allegories of the mind. The only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised.The basic story intercuts three stories.  In one an aimless deserter Pike having lost his trading partner steals a miraculous horse Eagle's Wing socalled because of its grace and speed.  In the second an Indian White Bull owner of this horse waylays a stagecoach  and kidnaps one of its female occupants.  In the third the Spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous plundering spree.Although a revisionist Western the treatment of the Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike his character is never explained forever inscrutable denied a voice except for an excruciating snatch of song.  When he's not a strange Other he's a symbol whose role isn't entirely worked out  at one point a savage brute at another he epitomises nature and freedom.But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation.  In many ways the film resembles 2001  A SPACE ODYSSEY especially its opening sequence.  Part of the film's power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light.  Indian culture and Catholicism is linked by superstition ritual greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic.  White Bull is demonised by both Pike and the abductee as a 'bastard' unwittingly revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonising whites who infantilised the natives becoming themselves 'necessary' fathers.Unlike a traditional Western concerned with making history civilisation and progress this film is a double detective story interrogating the past tracks remains.What gives this film its remarkable uniqueness I think is despite Maltin's racism its Britishness.  The climactic standoff is more like an Arthurian joust.  The film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE and something few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential doubling and quest motifs are more European myth than American resembling another British Harvey Keitel movie THE DUELLISTS.Most astonishing is the use of nature.  Most Westerns use landscape as an aweinspiring backdrop there is little sense of actually living in the West.  In many ways EAGLE'S WING is like a Powell and Pressberger film with nature a powerful pantheistic character in its own right  alive dangerous hostile beautiful.  There is a sublime scene reminiscent of A CANTERBURY TALE when jewellery left as a trap by White Bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind there is a haunting tingling magical thrilling effect more reminiscent of the Arabian Nights than a horse opera. Heartstopping.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not likely you'll catch a Western like this again good guys and bad guys have little meaning here. Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston are pitted against each other as an exfoot soldier versus a Kiowa warrior and the mismatch is palpable throughout. There's a great innovative scene where White Bull Waterston emerges from a waterhole to ambush Pike Sheen in the tradition of your best horror film surprises. That's one of the highlights in a story that ofttimes meanders back and forth with little action. At one point Waterston is featured in a great Iron Eyes Cody profile that attests to his regal bearing which director Anthony Harvey uses to tease a possible romantic involvement between the Indian and his captive blonde beauty Caroline Langrish. That story line goes nowhere but draws on more than a single exchange of amorous glances between the two.Martin Sheen gets to inject some humor into the cat and mouse game with some of the few lines of dialog the film actually uses for his part White Bull remains entirely silent throughout. It complements his mysterious nature and the ruse with the tricked out dagger that takes out the thieving Mexican was a nice touch. Sheen does a remarkable job convulsing from that arrow to the leg from White Bull so much so that you feel his pain.In the set up for the horseback duel finale one expects a decisive outcome without knowing who'll win but again your standard Western conventions don't bear out. White Bull acknowledges Pike's temerity and allows him to live and his thundering dust cloud ride into the sunset sets both men free. The ending though managed to elicit an unintended chuckle just like Vincent Price does in the closing sequence of The Fly when Judith and Pike separately plead their case to the heavens  Please help me.".

	schema:reviewBody "An unusual revisionist western well worth watching. Despite a slow start the film builds  with scarcely any dialogue and no subtitles  an increasingly involving and intense almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the Western desert. The growth of the lead characters is worth waiting for and the strong central cast bring a real sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the allimportant horse. How interesting that this was made by a British director. I hope he's smiling now I get the impression the film was largely ignored by contemporaries but time works its usual alchemy and hidden gold shines out as it inevitably must. One note jarred for me the revisionism is only carried so far. Sam Waterston as an Indian?  granted he plays his part with real emotion and intensity but really couldn't one American Indian actor be found to do the job? But his scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy which contrasts nicely with the immense landscape around them.Forget big bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past men with big chins and swirling music this one is all about a primeval struggle between protagonists who stripped of all the trappings of 'ordinary' life come to understand what is worth fighting for.

	schema:reviewBody "On first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten. However viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate postCivil War America one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one. And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The Native American or the AWOL soldier? The story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation. As has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you're ever likely to see again. The film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it. The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film released in the same year as Sheen's other great performance as Willard in 'Apocalypse Now' hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again. More's the pity. A comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them  not least that both films chart a man's journey into his soul in order to find redemption. Whereas Willard is redeemed I will leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is eventually. The ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned. Altogether this is an extraordinary film.".

He is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance even a compassion when he is in a position of power  observing the wilting white man bent on revenge as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. As such his character seems complex but congruous to the harsh lands he lived in  which were threatened by these intruders he is not heartless in his dealings with.The magnificent horse he rides is a critical link  it is interesting to note how this Indian handles it compared with the Martin Sheencharacter who has it in his possession  power for a time.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1979 Eagle's Wing is an English Western about a white trapper Martin Sheen circa 1830 who steals a white mustang named Eagle's Wing from a laconic Kiowa Native Sam Waterston. The Native then pursues him to get his horse back. Harvey Keitel Stphane Audran and Caroline Langrishe are also on hand.This is a unique professionallymade Western. The tone is thoroughly realistic Waterston is impressive as the Native the women are goodlooking and the Mexican locations are magnificent albeit thoroughly desolate. Unfortunately the story isn't very absorbing. But the film's interesting in some ways and certainly worthy of your Western collection.The movie runs 111 minutes.GRADE C".

Martin Sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge Waterston White Bull for a gorgeous white horse. Other subplots are really unnecessary. I don't understand the part played by Caroline Langrishe as the poor girl who White Bull kidnaps...I don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful Indian man! It's a lot of fun though especially if you're a Waterston fan. Man he looks GOOD in this one!!! Harvey Keitel's role isn't even worth mentioning to tell the truth! But rent it and enjoy! Actually I do believe that if the music score was better it would've been a more dramatic film...the music is so bad it's distracting. Still  there's Mr. Waterston!".

After I left the cinema I was most convinced that Admiral is worth almost unanimous public acclaim for this film is an attempt to investigate probably the most complicated and still painful period in the history of Russia. And show this period through the destiny of Admiral Kolchak. According to the Khabenskys words he was to show not a dictator but a man in love who has also duties before his country but cannot deny his feelings. That is why Admiral though being a historic movie is actually neither about war nor politics. It is a great and beautiful love story. After Admiral I was curious to learn more about the Civil War and the figure of Kolchak. Of course it is studied at school but in fact what is written in the school textbooks is a total mess of facts and dates. But now the reading is more interesting as I can imagine this distant historic statesmen and thus I get a clearer picture of the Civil War in Siberia. Admiral Kolchaks life was full of everything one can wish to himself he discovered new lands in the Arctic Ocean and named them he knew what it is like to win great battles he was loved by faithful and brave women he led enormous armies and gave aspiration to so many people. He was the symbol of honorable struggle. I would say that even dry historic books about Kolchak are as exciting as novels. So his screened biography is also breathtaking. Admiral is probably the best modern Russian film.".

She was a married woman with a son he had wife and son too. Anna was younger than Admiral in 19 years but love does not have borders and they both understood it. He wasn't the handsomest of men and besides he was a soldier and patriot dedicated to the army and to the country. But she was the real princess young clever and gorgeous. They seemed to be just ordinary people but their amazing love story and tragic destiny made them legends. Admiral is that type of movies that you watch on one breath and when it ends you don't need to speak with your friends and share your thoughts about the film. It is something extraordinary that you keep deep inside your heart. You are nearly crying as if it was your own life and your sufferings. This is the power of that movie. First of all you will be impressed with the actors' transformation. Konstantyn Habensky as Admiral Kolchak is exactly the man from that epoch. Fearless brave and strong person with so many contradictions that finally led him to his death. Habensky has previously worked with Elizaveta Boyarskaya in Irony of Fate 2 but in this picture they are more natural and real as a duet. Historical dramas are for sure one of the most hardest genre. The duty of actors is to make audience believe that you are that Man or that Woman from specific century and era. In Admiral Elizaaveta Boyarskaya did a fantastic job. She did a hundred times better than she did in Irony of Fate Maybe it's because Irony was just a sequel of the famous Soviet film. But Anna in Admiral is definitely her role that she played with fidelity and grace. I also want to say few words about the music. The original score is fantastic. And the title song Anna which was a poem written by Anna Timireva and dedicated to Kolchak sounds so touching. Just listen to it and you will understand how strong this woman were. Singer Victoria Dayneko performed it perfectly and her voice is amazing. Admiral was killed in February 7 1920. Anna Timireva spent most of her life in prisons and camps. She died in 1975. As she said she had been with Admiral only for two years. But she never stopped loving him even after his death.".

A respectable budget and modern technology allows this film to portray a realism that even Soviet cinema at its prime couldn't match. Everything from battle scenes to tea parties is very much alive. At the same time cheap Hollywoodisms are avoided so if you're looking for a steamy sex scene you'll be disappointed.The 124 minute version of this film suffers from being a bit rushed with the romantic story taking center stage which obscures other deep elements of the story.

	schema:headline " Not a love story.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film was interesting and watchable but lacked focus regarding the central characters and the love story which a film like this seems to require.If one compares it to the similar film Dr Zhivago David Lean was able to articulate the political events in a convincing and intelligent manner and at the same time provide us with a moving love story as the central focus of the movie. Cameron's 1997 Titanic succeeded in a similar way.But the Admiral lacks the narrative structure of Zhivago and Titanic and seems to jump around haphazzardly between history patriotism heroism and love never giving us a chance to see how the love developed. We are simply not brought close enough to the real lives of the characters nor are we really presented with believable characters who we can relate to. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that is is based on a true story and they didn't want to invent too much like Cameron did in Titanic. But then why the stereotyped heroics? In the first battlescene Admiral Kolchak is a fearless brazen Russian completely nonchalant as his ship was bombarded with shells and the bodies of his own crew members were reduced to bloody pulps. He merely thrusts his chin out and calmly fires the ships small powder gun at the bridge of the attacking vessel disabling it. This and further heroics is entertaining heroic stuff but not very plausible or realistic. The film picks up when the revolution begins and from then on holds us with suspense and excitement. The historical murders by the Bolshiviks are brought home with grisly detail. Computer graphic effects are used subtly in this film but to great effect. Konstantin Khabenskiy who plays Kolchak enthralls us and the final scenes on the TransSiberian train to Irkutsk and his eventual betrayal are memorable.Definitely a film worth watching but it shouldn't be called a love story because the drama is focused on the tragic and brutal events perpetrated by the Bolsheviks and long suffering march by kolchak's army. In the end it's the story of a good man who fought hard and bravely for his country only to be murdered by his own countryman. Good to see that Russia can make films like this now and that it is beginning to show a different perspective on the events of the revolution.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I was not the only moviegoer who was reluctant to go and see this film. For too long time Russians have been fed with another history of Great October Revolution and now the trend is to try and show it in complete reverse. But this appears to be absolutely irrelevant to anyone who wasn't born in the USSR. And then the main storyline is love and civil war appears to be just a background but an essential background as the title character Kolchak is the head of the White Guard Army faithfully fighting for ideas and beliefs of falling Russian Empire. The story is very well served focusing not on the fall of Empire and what followed that fall but on the personality of Kolchak himself. He is a human with his own vices and weaknesses a man who had a lot of affairs but only one true love. The opening sea battle gives a taste of unwanted pathos to the story. Being trapped by enemies on severely damaged ship with half of the crew either dead or invalid thencaptain Kolchak singlehandedly manages to cause irreparable damage to German Karl Friedrich ship and win the battle which looks a bit surreal. What follows is Kolchak's rise and Russian Empire's fall intertwined with a strong feeling between him and his friend's wife Anna. The story is inaccurate in terms of historical authenticity but nevertheless impressive and epic. The title character of Kolchak is brilliantly portrayed by Konstantin Knabensky who finally gained the maturity needed and a slight tinge of pathos which never goes away throughout the entire movie. The role of Kolchak's ally and friend general Kappel is also well portrayed by Sergei Bezrukov who seems to overact in most of his roles but this time hits the nail right in. Another notable character is Sonya Kolchak's wife played by Anna Kovalchuk. This stoic woman endured her husband's numerous adulteries with infinite grace and patience finally losing him to the femme fatal Anna Timireva but never stopping to love him. The character of Anna herself was meant to be the highlight of the movie an image of a wealthy married woman who gives up everything to follow her true love through war and misery but instead appeared to be a flat insignificant and very badly played by Elizaveta Boyarskaya role. She is simply not credible and far from portraying this complex character pushing only with her natural beauty instead. She doesn't care whether she loves Kolchak doesn't care if he is dead or alive  she just moves and talks respectively to the storyline. That's why the love story itself fails to be delivered on screen and leave the audience with any message. Having said that it doesn't mean that the movie is bad at all it just lacks this emotional grip on the audience in terms of love story but it delivers the story of one man who attempted to change the history and the history itself behind that man.".

Almost a new version of Titanic... hahaha.I'm not Russian but you don't need to be one in order to see the one sided shallowness of the story. I'm pretty sure that some people on high positions and with deep pockets had quite a comfy life before the revolution however there wouldn't have been one if everyone else enjoyed such lushness. We are served with a blackwhite pattern of and enlightened Tsarist Russia and rotten revolutionaries who can't read and kill women. The truth is somewhere in the middle as ever and if you look for that nice balance of history and film you won't find it in Admiral.This beyond any doubt was a costly project. The frame is pretty good scenery is on the level costumes are authentic locations are proper yet all that just isn't enough to cover the partial and shallow script. The 3 points go to the technical outcome. It's nice to look and but that's it really.".

I'm pretty sure that some people on high positions and with deep pockets had quite a comfy life before the revolution however there wouldn't have been one if everyone else enjoyed such lushness. We are served with a blackwhite pattern of and enlightened Tsarist Russia and rotten revolutionaries who can't read and kill women. The truth is somewhere in the middle as ever and if you look for that nice balance of history and film you won't find it in Admiral.This beyond any doubt was a costly project. The frame is pretty good scenery is on the level costumes are authentic locations are proper yet all that just isn't enough to cover the partial and shallow script. The 3 points go to the technical outcome. It's nice to look and but that's it really.";

I know the Soviet Union ended more than 20 years ago but I was still surprised to see such a reverent movie about one of the leaders of the Russian whites. For example the scene where Kolchak takes command of his army with the blessing of the Russian Orthodox Church is told with soaring musing and without any hint of irony. Story of his romance with the wife of one of his fellow officers adds very little in fact probably detracts from the film. In summary a generally well made film and with a relatively generous budget but a bit too reverent and solemn toward its subject.".

Shame.For example the lovers never get intimate. It is as if they are constantly waiting for the camera crew to leave. There is no passion between them. This made various key plot elements hard to buy.Also we never get a good sense of why the Admiral is fighting for the dying regime. From what I have read on the net he was a passionate antiBolshevik but we don't get that sense in the movie. Why does he put everything on the line after the monarchy falls? Why doesn't he just leave? Why do the soldiers loyal to him keep fighting? What does he want to do with Russia if he can beat the Reds? We get no clue no explanation no plan no rationale not even a trace of human emotion grounding the resistance. What we see is someone in a uniform going through the motions. He appears to be a good actor too so if I had to point my finger on someone I would blame the failure on the screenwriter and the director.But perhaps that's actually how the war happened which could explain why he lost against the Reds.In the end the movie fails on both counts It is not a believable love triangle drama and it is not a compelling history movie. Unless you already care deeply about the historical figures in the movie you wont find yourself moved.I don't recommend it to any audience.".

All that Vice Admiral Alexander Kolchak Konstantin Khabenskiy wants to do is find who is his truelove is his wife Sofia Kolchak Anna Kovalchuk  fame poet Anna Timiryova Elizaveta Boyarskaya back home. However the call of war is calling his name once more as he has to make another choice choose to lead of the anticommunist White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War for the love of his country or abandoned his noble cause for the chance for a normal life with his love ones. Without spoiling the movie too much the film remind me so much of 1965's Doctor Zhivago in storystructure having flashbacks tell most of the story. However unlike Doctor Zhivago this movie's lacks the epic scope in the cinematography department. As much as I love war scenes in this war film there is this eerily unrealistic that come with some of the sequences. A good example of this come with the navy battles during the opening. Not only are most of those scenes historic inaccuracy like the sinking of SMS Friedrich Carl in November 1915 when it sunk for real two years earlier but the computeranimation ships don't look like they're really there. It looks a bit fakelooking. It was bit over the top to see that ship blows apart and sinks within seconds with a clear big loss of lives by Russian mines. When actually the Friedrich Carl was stayed afloat for several hours enough for the light cruiser SMS Augsburg to arrive to the scene and rescue most of the crew and only 8 crew members were lost. Nevertheless that fault the war scenes in the ground scenes were still intense and wellshot. I like how they didn't sugarcoat the violence. It's bloody gory and very gruesome. I just wish the CGI effect were done a little better. Directed by Andrey Kravchuk the romantic sequences are kinda below standards too as the movie rarely gives anytime for the relationship between Kolchak and Timiryova to deliver. The two barely show any chemistry for each other. Another thing the film fails to tell is a little background like how Kolchak honestly became an Admiral. I'm not saying the film has to show the events of his life during the RussoJapanese War but a small mention would do. After all Kolchak's life during that war was very interesting and intense. Another thing the movie doesn't show is how Kolchak became the leader of the White Movement after his meeting in Petrograd. You would think the movie would show his relationship with France the United States and the United Kingdom more and how he almost got sent to Mesopotamia. That or show his time exile overseas in Japan. Even his polar explorer career wasn't mention or expose much. It would make a lot more sense if the movie mention that the reason why he choose to come back to Siberia to fight back against the reds is because he knew that area best. However the film doesn't even do that. Nor does it expose the many of deaths by citizens cause both from the Reds and the Whites during this time. Yes the whites did attack towns as well. While there is a lot of debate if Kolchak in truelife was a natural patriotic hero for liberty or an autocratic man seeking power. It's just nice to see that after decades of being vilified by the Soviet government Kolchak is now just now seem as a controversial historic figure in postSoviet Russia. He's not good nor bad. I just wouldn't say Konstantin Khabenskiy is good as a romantic lead but as a commander he has the voice to pull it off. He comes off kinda stern but also somewhat heartwarming at parts. Elizaveta Boyarskaya as Anna Timiryova is a beautiful however her character lacks depth so her acting doesn't shine besides loving the Kolchak character in most of her key scenes. I would love to see more of her acting in other ways like showing Anna's career as poet and a nurse. The movie doesn't even show any of her poems at all. Nor does the movie talk or show Anna Timiryova's young son the fame avant garde artist Vladimir Timirev who was around Kolchak are the time. Despite that the movie is pretty good. I like how the title uses the old Russian orthography that was abandoned after the October Socialist Revolution of 1917. That was pretty cool. The movie is indeed in Russian but DVD does have English subtitles. Overall Despite some faults Admiral is still a movie worth seeing. It's kinda rare to see a Russian movie about the White Movement. So check it out!".

The actors managed to convey the mood and emotions of each of the characters. The audience felt both fear and love and regret and stress. Something touched a nerve. Cried. Although maybe it's me just such a sentimental but you do not like it  End bit predictable. Somewhere in the middle of the film had the feeling that at the end of Kolchak Shot. And so it happened. The last 3 minutes of the film dull stale from Titanic which is not particularly great. In general I believe that a few years and our cinema will udelyvaet Hollywood with its consumer goods. Here. Decent picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "EVERYTHING ON THIS REVIEW IS A SPOILEROh yes you BELIEVE the bad comments! This movie has a horrid script hands down. You know the premise A mother loses her son and one day everyone begins to forget about the kid pics videos and everything disappears. Her psychiatrist tells her that she's nuts and must go to a mental institution. She escapes and is later arrested but the NSA no less wants to take care of her so you know there's SOMETHING ELSE. And what is that else? Aliens are abducting children to conduct experiments and the government is collaborating with them for the space guys are too powerful to oppose. Wanna know how powerful they are? Powerful enough to see and hear everything that happens at any time anywhere on earth. They can also change newspapers and records make all trace of any person disappear and create memories in people's minds. THAT is how powerful they are.Yet with all their power all the physical evidence we see of them is people getting vacuumed into the air. Wherever you are in the planet they can suck you just like that. But if aliens cand do all that WHY the hell do they need to use the NSA or any other earthly power for that matter? Isn't it plainly stupid to chase Julianne Moore the entire movie when they know all the time exactly where she is and they can vacuum her when they feel like it? Not that she and her fellow parent are very adept at hiding Though they are constantly chased they never worry about changing their appearances a single time.

Well it's because... er... because she's very stubborn! No kidding that's all the explanation we get! Every other parent in the world can be a lousy forgetful bastard but not Julianne she could never do that! So that's the end of the experiment the bond can't be broken right? Wrong! The alien is getting nervous because if she doesn't forget the experiment will be a failure Pardon me?! The point of an experiment is to OBSERVE results not to provoke them! If you want to achieve concrete results then it's a project not an experiment! Can't the writer even tell this simple difference? Anyway he erases Julianne's first memory from her baby so that's it! But no it's useless she remembers again! So the alien guy is vacuumed as a punishment. Serves him right!In the end the cold heartless aliens become suddenly benign and decide to give everyone's children back just like that in return for ruining their experiment?. The little ones don't remember a thing and go on happily with their lives just ignore the fact that more than a year has passed in the rest of the world!. Even more no one remembers anything at all just Julianne she's stubborn! But who cares about the terrible truth she's discovered she's got her son back after all would they also return the photo albums? smile and enjoy! And that's about it.

	onyx:emotionText "EVERYTHING ON THIS REVIEW IS A SPOILEROh yes you BELIEVE the bad comments! This movie has a horrid script hands down. You know the premise A mother loses her son and one day everyone begins to forget about the kid pics videos and everything disappears. Her psychiatrist tells her that she's nuts and must go to a mental institution. She escapes and is later arrested but the NSA no less wants to take care of her so you know there's SOMETHING ELSE. And what is that else? Aliens are abducting children to conduct experiments and the government is collaborating with them for the space guys are too powerful to oppose. Wanna know how powerful they are? Powerful enough to see and hear everything that happens at any time anywhere on earth. They can also change newspapers and records make all trace of any person disappear and create memories in people's minds. THAT is how powerful they are.Yet with all their power all the physical evidence we see of them is people getting vacuumed into the air. Wherever you are in the planet they can suck you just like that. But if aliens cand do all that WHY the hell do they need to use the NSA or any other earthly power for that matter? Isn't it plainly stupid to chase Julianne Moore the entire movie when they know all the time exactly where she is and they can vacuum her when they feel like it? Not that she and her fellow parent are very adept at hiding Though they are constantly chased they never worry about changing their appearances a single time. She goes to her husband's workplace which should be heavily guarded in a completely careless way and also goes to the other parent apartment after they become fugitives though no cop shows are they incompetent or what?. Speaking of the apartment aliens can modificate newspapers minds and whatever necessary but can't erase a child's paintings from the walls.

	schema:reviewBody "My comment to my wife after watching the film was if aliens came to earth and wanted to know what was meant by the term 'Hollywood Ending' then they would just have to watch this film to find out.As previously mentioned the first half of the movie is interesting. The often used premise of what is reality and the thought that that which you hold as real runs counter to what everything and everyone else around you feels. In many ways it's much like Jacobs Ladder in that respect.The second half really however degrades into what feels like a made for TV SciFi channel one hour series. The ending is truly awful and makes absolutely no sense. I think my wife summed it up best when she said the ending didn't fit the movie whatsoever but I liked it anyway because it made me feel good. Yup I likened the ending to something you'd see in a Star Trek episode going along interestingly enough and then the perfect pat ending sprouts up in the last 5 minutes and makes everyone feel good to be human. I didn't mind the open endedness of the ending so much as the total sense of non congruency once the pieces are laid out in front of you. It's like getting to the end of the puzzle and instead of having missing pieces which you can at least fill in in your head you have pieces left over from two other seemingly related but different puzzles.The acting was serviceable with Julianne Moore turning in a Riplyesque performance whether this is good or bad depends on your perspective but Gary Sinise basically walks through the movie while bearing an eerie resemblance to Steve Jobs in the beginning. The other actors move the plot along but nothing worth saying anything more about.Oh this movie has one of the best jump in your seat auto scenes ever!".

OK so now it's not crazy mom but elaborate gov't cover up complete with convert sidekick and omnipotent NSA agents.

Theatrical ending think Sigorney Aliens I HAD A SON AND HIS NAME IS SAM!!! confrontation with Alien who reveals he's on the hook for his test which he gets pink slipped for...orAlternate ending think i dunno some thing like warm milk and stale cookies I ...had...a...son...  etc etc. explanation by Alien who reveals that this test is over and...out of the goodness of their alien hearts give back the kids the parents the memories and probably any thing else they have used in 14 months so that she can get back to her life and be the only one any the wiser.What bugs me that any one of the three stories could have played out but never was given a chance. Even the two versions of the ending could easily have been joined and made a stronger finish as it was. Julianne Moore was at her best when we all thought she was delusional but as this driverless carriage wandered from concept to concept she just got weaker. Gary Sinise was great we knew he was in on it but wished they built him up more so when his smoke and mirrors were gone it would have impacted Julianne's character better.Sorry but it felt like a film directed by a civil servant committee guided by tax lawyers.".

Here goes This movie is a rather bizarre SciFi flick in which aliens are performing experiments on humans apparently to see what makes them tick. The humans most of them anyway don't know they are the guinea pigs.

	schema:reviewBody "The Forgettable by Doy AriolaPoor Julianne Moore. Everyone thinks she's out of her mind. She thinks she has a son who died in a plane crash and nobody  not even her husband  believes her. Her shrink Gary Sinise tells Moore that it's her mind playing games. But she knows otherwise. She's in a gaggame show. And if she becomes Nancy Drew long enough the prize is her son.The Wire's Dominic West plays the disconnected drunk who can't seem to place a finger whether or not he has a daughter. That is until Moore pays him a visit and starts ripping out the wallpaper to show him that something's amiss! Dominic West then becomes Moore's Hardy Boy. Better yet he becomes the Scully to her Mulder.Sleeping With the Enemy director Joseph Ruben weaves a yarn that looks and feels like an XFiles episode with some Days Of Our Lives thrown in for good measure. This movie has nothing really original going for it let alone a plot that makes you care about the characters. Maybe this is because everyone's either grim or amnesiac!The Forgotten has the trappings of a psychological thriller. Establishing the idea that the main character as delusional and amnesiac may be curious. We've seen that before in Gothika. But in effect the result sounds more like a ratings stunt for a soap opera than a movie premise.To those who have seen the trailer we are more curious about that scene where that guy from Oz gets sucked up into the ceiling. I guess you can say that characters being sucked up into the ceiling can be original. After watching it one senses a similar effect after reading a National Enquirer article. You feel the producers of the movie is just being weird for weirdness' sake.In all stories characters are reduced to pawns to progress the story. However Ruben and his writers may have taken this a little too literally! It was actually morbid fun to see a criminally underused Alfre Woodard being sucked up into the sky like a puppet being unceremoniously removed from the play. This not only makes the story ludicrously implausible and so easy for audiences to scoff off. That stunt made my suspension of disbelief  that's been hanging on a tenuous thread for quite some time  to snap.Julianne Moore is as always a dependable actress who can carry a movie. The first thirty minutes is an example of this. It delves on her supposed mental state and how the people around her are reacting to it. While she's quite evocative everything else is awfully blah. The scenes are pure melodrama. Something that's good enough but pretty forgettable.What's more Julianne Moore seems to start looking like herself in most of her movies. For a moment there I thought she was Agent Starling!Halfway through the director thankfully enough changes gears. He segues to a series of chase sequences between the main characters against the Gmen who wants to capture them. But you're not pulled into the story. It goes on and on up until Woodard and Sinise's characters usher the movie to the twist. At that time my mind was already wandering and dinner had more allure to me than these characters' adventure.There would have been many opportunities to make the hohum plot into something new. But Ruben isn't interested to redeem himself. Trying to be PG13 safe seemed more important than rousing the audience. It's like he was making this as a primetime TV movie. Maybe that's why this movie failed to interest me the lost opportunities.Though I will not spoil the ending be forewarned that this movie embodies what most movies of this year are guilty of i.e. a clunky plot that justifies an anemic climax. Mind you everything's explained in a neat package in the end. But if you're one who's willing to invest your attention to the entire thing don't expect fireworks. You probably would have appreciated an ambiguous XFiles type of revelation and it dawns on you that you might feel cheated out of the ending. But let's just say that The Forgotten portrays aliens as really bad psychoanalysts.I recommend that you sit this one out and wait for the movie on cable. If not for the cast The Forgotten may as well be an episode of XFiles or supernatural TV movie of the month. Two movies of its ilk  Richard Gere's The Mothman Prophecy's and Halle Berry's Gothika's  have more spooks per minute and thereby more entertaining. So catch those instead.By the way if you want to see Moore on a similar genre with a story that's more satisfying check out Todd Haynes' Safe.".

First she forgets where she parked her car. Later she swears she was just drinking a cup of coffee but her psychiatrist says she wasn't. Soon this snowballs and her memory of her son is even challenged. First her husband then her psychiatrist then friends say she never had a son. As if that's not bad enough she ends up in trouble with the police. Is Telly going crazy or is something more sinister afoot? I'm a sucker for stories that throw the main character into some extremely alienating situation where they have to spend most of there time trying to figure out what's going on. Films such as Vertigo 1958 The Matrix 1999 Cube 1997 Saw 2004heck even that television show John Doe 2002are all gems for me. So I was a prime candidate for loving The Forgotten.Gerald Di Pego's script is stimulating for switching the usual device of amnesia aroundinstead of a protagonist who can't figure out who they are or how they got somewhere we have a protagonist who swears they know exactly who they and who their family and friends are it's just that the relevant other characters can not seem to remember.The crux of the film is an evertightening tension as Telly first works to gain allies then works with them to solve the mystery. Director Joseph Rubin is excellent with straightforward thrillermystery material and shows off extra chops with some of the most memorable shock scenes I've come across in a long time. There is an amazingly paced car crash that is sure to jolt most viewers. There is another incident with a car and a person that wonderfully puts the viewer off balance while giving them a clue to the mystery. Some characters are absconded in a bizarre and disturbing way. Rubin also takes clichd thriller climax material and gives it a fun new spin as he plays with character's powers and reality.It might throw some viewers off that The Forgotten is just as much a scifi film as a thriller. It firmly veers into XFiles territorymuch more strongly than you'd ever expect from the first half of the film. This is yet another great example of why it's better to approach films with zero preconceptionsexpectations if possible. There is also a romance subplot that always remains visible but relatively far below the surface. On these more conspicuous levels The Forgotten is an excellent enthralling yarn as long as viewers have a taste for fantasy.Equally interesting though are the more subtextual readings of the film. Di Pego and Rubin have poignant things to say about the nature of memory and its effects on beliefs and behavior. The past doesn't exist substantially it isn't alive. Only attentiveness and present intentionality can keep the past alive. It can disappear in a wisp perhaps never to be regained the moment that attentiveness and intentionality are gone. Ultimately the film suggests a balance between obsessively keeping the past alive which can void the present and even precipitate other dangers this is even stronger in the alternate ending available on the DVD and fatalistically taking the fact that the past doesn't exist substantially as a cue to completely neglect it. In the dnouement of The Forgotten such a balance is rewarded and leads to hope for the present and future while maintaining a reasoned embrace of the past.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Forgotten is a film that has provoked quite a number of comments to this forum. Never saw it in its commercial run but we caught it on cable a few nights ago. The film as directed by Joseph Ruben and based on Gerard Di Pego's screen treatment has the feeling of a long SciFi channel offering or maybe an extended X Files episode.The exposition and prologue to the story are excellent. We watch as a disconsolate mother Telly Paretta deals with the possible death of her son Sam who she last saw boarding a flight in the company of other children on his way to camp. There are indications that an accident occurred judging by newspapers clippings Telly has in her hands. She has kept Sam's room as it was when he was alive.Terry on the other hand is being told by her psychiatrist that she is delusional. Sam never existed Sam is a product of her imagination. Yet Telly never lets go. She continues her search for the young son but suddenly she is being persecuted by secret service men who want to put a stop to whatever she claims. Telly pays a visit to Ash who is a father whose daughter was also in the ill fated flight but she finds a drunk man slowly killing himself with alcohol. Telly discovers a wall in his apartment that has been wall papered over but it's clear the daughter painted the walls underneath the paper at one time.Thus begins the quest in which Telly and Ash embark in their search for the truth. Little do they know what they have gotten into. The director takes us on a ride that at times makes a lot of sense but then we start questioning what we are seeing. The film is by no means a bad one it's just the resolution that seems not to make much sense at all unless we buy the twists and turns that Mr. Di Pego has concocted for us.Joanne Moore makes an interesting choice for Telly. Ms. Moore one of our best actress working in films today is a beautiful presence that makes a credible woman that will not stop until she finds out what happened to her young son. Dominic West as Ash is also up to task. Both actors do great work together. The solid supporting cast is also interesting Gary Sinise Alfre Woodard Anthony Edwards and the excellent Linus Roache who alas doesn't have anything to do in the film with the exception of appearing out of nowhere every now and then.This is a film for SciFi fans. They certainly will find more in it than the average viewer. The direction by Mr. Ruben is inspired and the different Brooklyn and New York area locations make a good background to the story. James Horner's music score is eerie and compliments the film as well as the cinematography by Anastas Michos.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie deserves a little defending. It's not a classic but I can't believe how many people are not looking at what we are presented with. I'm afraid I make no attempt to avoid spoilers so be warned.In the first 20 minutes of the movie we are set up with an interesting story of a woman who is paramnesic who creates her own memories from fantasies. But as she gets better she is losing those false memories and to her it feels as if she is forgetting or as if someone is stealing away her memories.It is not spelled out completely but we know she's wrong a lot. She thinks she remembers parking her car where it isn't she thinks she remembers putting a pen in her bag that isn't there. Reality is clearly a problem. And then she's confronted with what her condition is and faced with institutionalisation because she can't come to terms with it.Thereafter she has a complete break with reality and she enters into a complete fantasy world involving 'Ash' who correlates her story 'Ash Correl' a chimera called 'Sheemer' her quest after thin air and a company called 'Quest Air' all created in the style of the Xfiles parroting TV.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie deserves a little defending. It's not a classic but I can't believe how many people are not looking at what we are presented with. I'm afraid I make no attempt to avoid spoilers so be warned.In the first 20 minutes of the movie we are set up with an interesting story of a woman who is paramnesic who creates her own memories from fantasies. But as she gets better she is losing those false memories and to her it feels as if she is forgetting or as if someone is stealing away her memories.It is not spelled out completely but we know she's wrong a lot. She thinks she remembers parking her car where it isn't she thinks she remembers putting a pen in her bag that isn't there. Reality is clearly a problem. And then she's confronted with what her condition is and faced with institutionalisation because she can't come to terms with it.Thereafter she has a complete break with reality and she enters into a complete fantasy world involving 'Ash' who correlates her story 'Ash Correl' a chimera called 'Sheemer' her quest after thin air and a company called 'Quest Air' all created in the style of the Xfiles parroting TV.

	schema:reviewBody "Deception plays an integral part in the films of director Joseph Ruben. In his 1984 sciencefiction saga Dreamscape Ruben put Dennis Quaid and Kate Capshaw through the paces as psychics trying to help clinical patients wrestling with dream demons in their nightmares. The devious title character in Ruben's clever 1987 serial killer thriller The Stepfather deluded young women in their 20s with children into marrying him so he could hack them to pieces and head off to his next victims. Ruben's 1991 whiteknuckler Sleeping with the Enemy cast Julia Roberts as a battered heroine who deceived her abusive spouse and fled to forge a new identity. Home Alone's Macaulay Culkin pulled fiendish stunts in the The Good Son 1993 as an evil child who fooled everybody into believing in his innate virtue. N.Y. Transit cops Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson in The Money Train 1995 deceived everybody about their part in a police subway robbery. Not surprisingly Ruben's latest epic The Forgotten 12 out of  proves no exception about the recurring theme of deception. This deliberatelypaced psychological puzzler starring Julianne Moore Gary Sinise and Alfre Woodard about missing children and perturbed parents will grip you up to the halfway mark as it draws you slowly but surely into a mystifying predicament involving a delusional mother struggling to preserve the memories of her recently deceased son. Sadly however when scenarist Gerald Di Pego of Phenomenon fame and Ruben reveal what actually happened to her child this atmospheric but anemic nailbiter degenerates into a laughable crossbetween of an inferior XFiles episode and the 1998 Australian scifi chiller Dark City where curious aliens conducted experiments with humans to determine what made humans humane.Manhattan children's book editor Telly Paretta Julianne Moore of The Big Lebowski clings tenaciously to sweet memories of her nineyear old son Sam Christopher Kovaleski of Mind The Gap who perished in a plane crash on the way to summer camp. Fourteen months have elapsed since Sam's tragic demise but Telly still affectionately remembers him. She visits his bedroom often to hold his baseball glove pore over family photos scrapbook peruse the newspaper clippings about Sam's death and stare at videos of him. One day Telly cannot find some of Sam's memorabilia. Initially she accuses her longsuffering husband Jim Paretta Anthony Edwards of Top Gun of removing Sam from family photos. Why is he trying to destroy her tangible memories of Sam? Patiently Jim tells Telly that she suffered a miscarriage and they never had a son. Meanwhile her psychiatrist Dr. Jack Munce Gary Sinise of Forrest Gump reminds Telly that she never had a son. Obstinately Telly refuses to believe her therapist. Munce explains that paramensia afflicts her. Essentially people with paramensia invent entire alternate lives with imagined friends imagined families and imagined children. Before long Telly wonders if she really has gone off the deep end. She encounters the father of one of Sam's friends. Exhockey star Ash Correll Dominic West of Mona Lisa Smile boozes it up regularly these days and hangs out strangely enough on a kids swingset in a Brooklyn neighborhood park. When Telly quizzes him about his daughter Lauren newcomer Kathryn Faughnan he denies that he ever had a daughter. Eventually Telly convinces Ash that he really had a daughter but by then Ash has called the cops. As the NYPD leads Telly away agents from the National Security Agency arrive and take custody of Telly. Suddenly Ash reappears and helps Telly escape and the two of them hit the road on the run. When Telly suggests to Ash that somebody called they may have abducted their children a shocked Ash blurts out with a straight face I'm having a National Enquirer moment. Director Joseph Ruben does the best that he can to gloss over the preposterous twists and turns in Gerald Di Pego slipshod screenplay that lurches unevenly from stark realism to raving lunacy. Ruben plays it straight as long as possible until the dialogue gives everything away and credibility collapses in a shambles. Ruben keeps the action moving along at a breathless pace building up the suspense but he cannot maintain the same momentum after the third act revelation blows the lid off the mystery. Indeed the auto accident in The Forgotten is about as violent as this PG13 rated mindwarping psychomelodrama gets. Strong evocative performances especially from Julianne Moore Gary Sinise Anthony Edwards and Dominic West lend The Forgotten what little dramatic intensity it has before we know the truth. Talk about a supreme letdown! Forget about watching The Forgotten.".

The story grabs you from the start and what I like is that nothing is revealed too soon. The movie pulls you along and keeps things nice and subtle until BAM it hits you with an uppercut. The pace smooths out and then WHAM a right hook to the jaw. Pretty much the same method my mom used to employ to keep me on my toes.The big mystery surrounds Telly's son. She clearly remembers him and she has a difficult time dealing with his apparent death. About a year ago he boarded a plane that was bound for camp but the plane was never heard from again. Soon all evidence of her son's existence begins to disappear. His image has vanished from a picture photo albums are now empty and a home video shows nothing but static.Is somebody trying to mess with Telly's memory? Is her husband Edwards in on it? What is her shrink's involvement? Is she crazy or is it everybody else around her who's lost it? Has Anthony Edwards started to regret leaving ER yet? Or am I confusing him with Julianna Margulies?When Telly meets up with Ash Correll West she realizes that he's forgotten about his daughter who was also on the plane with her son. It's at this point she's convinced that she isn't crazy so she seeks to find out exactly what is going on. I love how the characters don't know who they can trust and neither does the audience. Even characters who are attempting to help must be looked at with suspicion. You are to question everybody at all times!The acting is very solid. You won't find my name in any Julianne Moore fan clubs although I was once a member of the Bon Jovi Secret Society but I have to admit she does a very good job here. And I'd never seen Dominic West before because I typically avoid snoozers such as Mona Lisa Smile like Richard Simmons avoids women but I thought he was great. Both characters react in situations exactly like you want them to. They're two distraught parents trying to find out what happened to their children and they're willing to do what it takes. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that.I definitely recommend you see this at the theater because there are two jump scenes that quite simply have to be seen on the big screen and heard with the best sound system possible. I'm talking two of the better jump scenes I've seen in a while. Stephanie doesn't jump much even at times when I'm hoppin' like a giddy school girl but she was even jolted out of her seat. Well she didn't literally go flying out of her seat like a circus freak but you know what I mean. One of the scenes caused her to jump and clench my arm. Poor thing hurt her hand on my bicep though.Comparisons to The XFiles and The Twilight Zone are accurate but don't listen to the movie snobs claiming it feels like a mediocre episode of one of the two. Keep in mind this isn't the kind of thriller that will have you trying to figure out the plot for days afterward. It's not gonna make you think like Memento and it's not gonna shock you or disturb you like The Butterfly Effect. It's simply gonna keep you guessing and entertained.THE GIST The Forgotten is a solid thriller that delivers a good mystery and some of the best jump scenes I've seen in a while. If you wanna cause yourself heartache and nitpick over some minor plot holes then go ahead and be a little curmudgeon. But what's the point? Allow yourself to be entertained for an hour and a half. It won't hurt. This is a very good date movie but guys do a few reps beforehand because your gal might be grabbing your arm quite a bit and it's best if that's not an embarrassing situation for you.".

The scenes of people flying in and out of the air is really cool in terms of special effects but the reason for it once you find out is kind of a cop out and very far fetch. The whole conspiracy angle that it tries to play also does not fit the context of the story and ends up confusing more than adding to the story.

It's unbelievable that three talented actors could even choose to do a film of this quality. Correction. It's not the quality it's the lack thereof I should be noting.Anna Magdalena is a 'romantic tale' it says on the back in which a piano tuner Takeshi Kaneshiro bumps into a serial womaniser Aaron Kwok who is a nohoper in his aspirations to become a novelist. The 'piano tuner' decides to offer the 'novelist' a hand by putting him up for a few days. Meanwhile a new resident Kelly Chen moves into their apartment block with piano and all only that she shows little talent. A 'love triangle' forms.Well maybe even the clichd love triangle cannot be an attribute here as I've seen more chemistry in a bottle of air. The three characters seem as loveless as a defaced stone wall and the film rarely ever delves further than skin deep. The storyline is virtually nonexistent and where there is one there is too much irrelevance to keep the flow running. In particular the film tries the old tactic of showing the unique quirks of the characters but in no way do they fit in with the story nor add anything to what we want to discover.There is nothing in this film that salvages it from me wanting to call it rubbish. It is simply pitiful. I am a big fan of Kaneshiro and Chen and I did like to a certain extent their outing in Lavender but Anna Magdalena would be a film I wouldn't want to remember them for. One to leave on the shop shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I went to Argentina in 2002 it was a total culture shock in so many senses. Staying in Buenos Airies there was no visible suggestion of Argentina being a 'developing country'  B.A. holds all the sophistication of 20th century Europe  and in some cases better preserved than it is in Europe. The architecture is visually stunning  walking along any of the main streets I was impressed with the elegance of this modern city that maintained traditional sophistication  not only in the beautiful buildings themselves but in restaurants etiquette and the arts. Going to the ballet you could hear a pin drop which is hardly the case in many Latin American countries. The citizens are educated sophisticated and with refined manners. When you see scenes of rioting on television it takes a while to understand  Argentinians did not riot because they are lawless  they rioted against the lawlessness of the government the institutions the banks the imposed social order that had robbed them of their savings their livelihood the small businesses they had built up the investments they had made to protect for their children's' future and their own old age.How such a chaotic situation occurred in such a civilised country is a dilemma that is unique to Argentina. They have lost everything and without a single bullet being fired without a war without even sometimes knowing the faces of the people that stole their personal and their country's wealth. I had taken some local currency with me for my own trip there but had ignorantly thought I could simply use a credit card or change currency as needed. What a shock. The banks were suddenly closed for a week. A law was passed in the short time I was there I was informed that made changing currency illegal. Moreover most of the cash machines were now empty. The shops were full of the most fabulous bargains. Antique and bricabrac stores looked as if they had the entire contents of several stately homes which they were selling off for peanuts. Noone had any actual money. More than once the banks had frozen people's savings and replaced their money with vouchers that were worth very little.This is a situation that is so hard to understand that a documentary film such as this was sorely needed to cover all the myriad facts.A bloody military regime was succeeded by an apparent democracy but successive leaders betrayed their ideals and with the aid of banks and unscrupulous foreign investors sold off Argentina's resources or privatised them to themselves with minimal checks and at a fraction of their real worth. Foreign banks kept their Argentinian subsidiaries 'private' so as not to be responsible for their debts. Private debts and corporate debts were absorbed into the national debt which increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund. Members of the government of all parties heads of banks and the Supreme Court all conspired on an ongoing basis with heavy subsidies i.e. bribes to keep the corrupt official in power and outside the rule of law. The greatness and meticulousness of the film is not however quite matched by the structure. At two hours long the pacing is such that only students and persons already very interested in the problems of Argentina will remain glued to the screen. Although it is important for Argentinians to have their history documented clearly it would be helpful for foreigners to be more aware of the situation especially when much of the problem is the result of collusion by powerful governments such as that of the United States. Like many Latin American countries Argentina has suffered pillaging first militarily by Spain and Europe and secondly bureaucratically and financially by the U.S.A. and foreign big business interests. Unlike many Latin American countries Argentina has also been repeatedly pillaged by its own leaders. It is the only country in the world that has lost its major natural gas and oil resources without a struggle. One of the reasons we should learn from Argentina is because 'Democracy' is frequently placed on a pedestal by countries and their people such as U.S. and Britain. The latter are countries that have evolved democracy. Democracy installed before a country has grown towards it as a nation can result in government by bureaucrats  only corrupt or corruptible politicians  of any party  can get elected so democracy is a farce. Once in power they have at their disposal techniques and networks for their own enrichment that are beyond the comprehension of much the general populace who realise too late that they have been fooled. Already in the USA we have seen a president elected by phoney ballots in Britain we have seen a government overhauled so that most decisionmaking is taken in private meetings. Democracy may be preferable to most systems of government but it still depends on the integrity of individuals and the ability of such individuals to be heard and elected. A corrupt democracy may be worse than a benign dictatorship a communist agrarian system may work for a country for a period where the common good needs to be placed on a higher priority than civil liberties. Democracy is a wonderful institution but there are many reasons for supporting it  some of them benign and some of them purely selfish. A study of this film could help persons interested in social anthropology to build a safer future for all of us. We need to be able to work through the flimflam of government economic policies  if we cannot trust the integrity of our leaders then it is no good taking long range policies on good words and trust  as the millions of overnight destitute in Argentina have discovered to their cost.".

The view given to the audience by the movie accurately reflects the opinions and feelings of many Argentinians. As of Spring 2004 when I was in Buenos Aires and watched the movie in theaters many older couples were yelling at the political figures speaking in the movie. Often the director places comments from trusted officials that later prove to be complete lies taken in backsight. Great images can also be seen throughout the movie. Don't miss Menem with a belly dancer and the underlying angst and sarcasm felt by the people of Argentina.

The official thievery portrayed is poignant in its effects on everyday Argentinean life across all classes but offers no explanation as to why this country repeatedly trusts or elects demagogues who are lousy soldiers the Junta who dragged the country into the Falklands disaster and into the public debt load or lousy managers Menem and De la Rua. Seriousness of the topic should not have excluded an occasional bit of humor  surely all this official strutting all these implausible interview comments would have provided ample opportunities.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Perfect cast in an Evil Intention Plot ThrillerWith Double Vision multitalented director Chen Kuofu pierces the evil of the unexpected whereby he has taken a typical corny Hollywood story line infused it with millenniaold Chinese mystical beliefs and placed it in the sweat soaked politically charged atmosphere of 21st century Taiwan.This thriller is about a troubled police detective Huang Huoto Tony Leung Ka Fai whose is about to suffer from a severe mental breakdown as his life is falling apart. The reason for this is as payback for blowing the whistle on corruption in the force. He's then relegated to a donothing job as a Foreign Affairs Officer. His fellow policemen colleagues have turned on him and his wife Chingfan Rene Liu is filing for divorce. Then suddenly three grisly murders shake up the department. The victims are unrelated but the coroner Yang Kuei Mei finds a mysterious black fungus in their brains along with evidence that they had all died in a hallucinatory state. Clearly there is a serial killer on the loose but the first in Taiwan's history whereby the police are unequipped to handle the case. With the public on the verge of panic the high command of the Republic grudgingly calls on the United States for assistance. The FBI comes into the picture and sends its top expert Kevin Richter David Morse to help Huang to wrestle these mysterious cases. The suspenseful ride is now on..... sit tight!Besides its suspense and thrills that you would find in this movie the perfect cast of Double Vision is also worth a mention. Tony Leung who shot to international stardom in the boxoffice hit The Lover plays a demanding role as well as the main foundation bearer of the movie. His role is certainly worth a nomination in the Best Actor category in the coming Film Awards in Taiwan and Hong Kong. As for the graceful azureeyed David Morse who is in his debut Asian Film plays a FBI agent who is sympathetic as well as a lovable character. As for the supporting cast each and everyone is also a heavyweight in the Taiwanese film industry like Rene Liu Lung Sihung Leon Dai Li Ren and Yang Kuei Mei. Therefore it is a perfect cast in an almost perfect movie.Working with Oscarwinning production and costume designer Tim Yip of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fame and Arthur Wong one of Hong Kong's great cinematographers director Chen Kuofu takes danger and suspense to a new level of dimension. In fact just making the film is a venture into a new territory. Double Vision is a very brave effort indeed for a Asian production. It would also open a few eyes of the Hollywood producers on Chen's credibility as well as catapult him to the ranks in the likes of Ang Lee or John Woo.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's one of these films that must of gone unnoticed in it's two week running. This would have to be one of the most overlooked films of 2002. We have two great male leads for starters who play good off each other. Taiwanese cop Leung always impressive becomes obsessed with this case involving bizarre instances and deaths if stylish some in graphic detail that all lead to some fungus which has made it's way into the brain of the victims. Morse strong here again in these roles plays a FBI serial killer profiler who teams up with Leung where he almost becomes more concerned with the destruction of Leung's family than this mind wracking case. It involved a standoff that went horribly wrong involving a family member from which Leung's little daughter has gone mute. It's good too that we have the family angle and more lighter happier moments with Leung's family and Morse who puts him in place regarding his lovely wife child. This film will cause you to use your noggen even more so towards it's bleak end. Double Vision has some very violent scenes I warn you one involving a priest being disemboweled as a few quite graphic be headings in a temple. This violence quite caught me by surprise. This is a supernatural violent and imaginative thriller of a higher order and damn well engrossing. If you're a supernatural horror freak or not as not ever hearing of this one hunt it down. I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised.".

	schema:headline " Slick serial killer horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Stylish hybrid of serial killer and supernatural horror flicks is well shot and fairly slick with mostly good acting and some mild suspense.  Tony Leung Karfei is soulful and very effective as the troubled police officer who is partnered up with FBI agent David Morse.  While usually a fine actor Morse seems out of synch with the rest of the castwhich seems appropriate for his character at least initially since he is the unwanted lone American lending his expertise to resentful Chinese police.  Unfortunately as is usually the case with English language characters in Hong Kong movies his dialogue sucks and the director doesn't seem to have a clue of how to direct his nonChinese cast member.  The murders are kind of ridiculous colorful but impossible unless the supernatural is involved making the movie's early attempts to provide a scientific basis for the deaths seem like a ludicrous waste of time.  Still Double Vision is fairly creepy and effective for most of it's length building to a shockingly violent confrontation in a Taoist Temple that was constructed within the walls of normal looking office building.  The scene is good but would have been even more effective without several obvious and not very good computer effects that are both unnecessary and distracting.  Why do a decapitation with a computer effect and make it look like something out of a Playstation game when old fashioned makeup effects look so much better?  Unfortunately after this scene Double Vision goes completely off the rails going on for an unnecessary twenty minutes more filled with trippy effects and seemingly endless scenes that make no sense.  All in all this one's more than worth a look but it could have been a lot better.".

	onyx:emotionText "Stylish hybrid of serial killer and supernatural horror flicks is well shot and fairly slick with mostly good acting and some mild suspense.  Tony Leung Karfei is soulful and very effective as the troubled police officer who is partnered up with FBI agent David Morse.  While usually a fine actor Morse seems out of synch with the rest of the castwhich seems appropriate for his character at least initially since he is the unwanted lone American lending his expertise to resentful Chinese police.  Unfortunately as is usually the case with English language characters in Hong Kong movies his dialogue sucks and the director doesn't seem to have a clue of how to direct his nonChinese cast member.  The murders are kind of ridiculous colorful but impossible unless the supernatural is involved making the movie's early attempts to provide a scientific basis for the deaths seem like a ludicrous waste of time.  Still Double Vision is fairly creepy and effective for most of it's length building to a shockingly violent confrontation in a Taoist Temple that was constructed within the walls of normal looking office building.  The scene is good but would have been even more effective without several obvious and not very good computer effects that are both unnecessary and distracting.  Why do a decapitation with a computer effect and make it look like something out of a Playstation game when old fashioned makeup effects look so much better?  Unfortunately after this scene Double Vision goes completely off the rails going on for an unnecessary twenty minutes more filled with trippy effects and seemingly endless scenes that make no sense.  All in all this one's more than worth a look but it could have been a lot better.";

	schema:reviewBody "Double Vision is a horror movie from Taiwan that may be The Next Big Thing amongst Asian film lovers. It stars Tony Leung KaFai as an intense troubled Taiwanese detective and David Morse as an FBI agent sent to assist the Taiwanese cops in the investigation of a serial killer since America produces more of those than any other country the FBI are considered to be the world's experts.It doesn't take much to discover that there's something very strange about the killings. The first victim is a business man found frozen to death in his office on a hot day when the air conditioning was off. The second a politician's wife is found burnt to death in her home  which shows no signs of fire damage.The Taiwanese cops are convinced the case is simply insolvable as it is clearly the work of devils or demons. David Morse sceptic that he is is quite convinced the deaths are the work of human hands.Playing out rather like a multinational episode of the xfiles the film is infused with Taiwanese Taoism and the notion that there is more to the world than the ordinary human eye can see. Well what good horror movie isn't?Tony Leung gives a fantastic performance as the intense haunted cop and David Morse fares better than most Western actors do in Asian productions. The film is very slick with high production values and great cinematography from Hong Kong legend Arthur Wong. It doesn't all make a lot of sense if you try to think about it too much but that's just an aspect of horror movies I guess I will get used to one day. Scares are not constant but are effective.The script mixes together a large number of elements and in particular contains far more political content than usually makes it into horror movies. Although clearly made with the international market in mind it is very much focused on Taiwanese culture and history.Although the film tries to be smart and perhaps by horror standards is the presence of several lapses of logic frustrated me quite a bit. I never seem to get it but I always wish a horror movie would actually make logical sense. I guess this is usually compromised for I didn't see that coming type scares and twists and so it is in DOUBLE VISION. This is the primary reason why I'm not a horror movie fan and was never going to love DV. For those that enjoyed THE RING and its ilk I'm sure DOUBLE VISION will be perfectly satisfying. It's certainly a glossy production that attempts to cover a lot of ground sometimes with success.".

Not horror in gory or bloody but as in disturbing and just creepy.There are really two story arcs which increasingly intertwine the mystery killings and the personal life of Tony Leung's character who made the mistake of being an honest cop and has ended up with nothing but trouble for it having family trouble and being transferred to the foreign division basically exiled from the regular police.Two seemingly inexplicable and possibly supernatural killings take place then a third involves a foreigner. This is where Leung really enters the case when an FBI Profiler David Morse is brought in to help and as a foreign division officer Leung liaisons with him.The two slowly unravel the mystery of the killings and slowly bond in part because both are outsiders to the the rest of the police. Morse a foreigner and Leung exiled for his past deeds and his own troubled past.I really can't get into the plot without giving spoilers but it is largely based on Taoism which at least for western audiences is pretty fresh. Some may make a comparison to the movie Seven but I really don't think that's fair as only 1 killing in this is really ritualistic. I really can't think of anything like this movie I really found myself glued to the set intrigued by the mystery and not knowing what was coming next.Leung amazed me in Infernal Affairs and he does just as good a job here. I've always thought Morse was an underrated actor since he mostly is a character actor and indeed with a lead role he turns in a great performance. The rest of the cast also turns in great performances though those two are the only ones I recognize.My only real complaint is the the ending or parts just before the ending are a bit confusing and somewhat muddled. But I suspect that was the point.The movie really looks great. The cinematography does a great job of capturing the mood and the sound is also quite fitting. All around a really classy movie.".

The nine gates of hell has always held my interest and few films have taken advantage of the possibilities that celluloid offers.Needless to say I saw this with very high hopes and thus my opinion may seem somewhat opinionated.Let me just say that the movie is not scary... leave the concluding scenes which didn't make much sense anyway. No jump in your seat thrills no creepy buildup and hardly any characters that were actually scary. But this is not necessarily bad for some movies let me emphasize 'SOME MOVIES' as it can help segue the genre into a totally different and unexpected one. This script tries to do that but fails miserably. What we have here is a hybrid of a detective and horror story or maybe the worse parts of both.Characters are one dimensional most characters are expendable and hardly matter and try however hard I wanted but I could not feel sympathy for any characters. And amazingly enough the main character who spoke very little English and when he did it sounded very heavily accented but apparently he must have been fluent in English... after all he spews big words in lines which left the actor seeming confused.Most of the scenes were utterly miserable and unnecessary and after the movie I wondered if the screenplay was made by an amature screenwriter.Take my advice Do yourself a favor and skip this one.".

The nine gates of hell has always held my interest and few films have taken advantage of the possibilities that celluloid offers.Needless to say I saw this with very high hopes and thus my opinion may seem somewhat opinionated.Let me just say that the movie is not scary... leave the concluding scenes which didn't make much sense anyway. No jump in your seat thrills no creepy buildup and hardly any characters that were actually scary. But this is not necessarily bad for some movies let me emphasize 'SOME MOVIES' as it can help segue the genre into a totally different and unexpected one. This script tries to do that but fails miserably. What we have here is a hybrid of a detective and horror story or maybe the worse parts of both.Characters are one dimensional most characters are expendable and hardly matter and try however hard I wanted but I could not feel sympathy for any characters. And amazingly enough the main character who spoke very little English and when he did it sounded very heavily accented but apparently he must have been fluent in English... after all he spews big words in lines which left the actor seeming confused.Most of the scenes were utterly miserable and unnecessary and after the movie I wondered if the screenplay was made by an amature screenwriter.Take my advice Do yourself a favor and skip this one.";

They're both good actors so it's very disappointing that the movie decides to focus more on Leung's background melodrama than the supernatural elements of the story. I mean they plugged this movie as a horror so I didn't really need to know about his exposing corruption on the police force his crazy criminal cousin or his apparent lack of a sex drive. And when the few horror scenes do come on they sometimes wander into FXed out fantasy sequences that don't work. Rene Liu won best supporting actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards for this movie and I've no idea why. She's not unconvincing but it's not much of a role. Sometimes I think the Hong Kongers judge acting by different standards  many of their past winners have been quite inexplicable.".

How and why this guy is assisting them is sorta unexplained but okay. The first half of the movie builds up the suspense pretty well but the rest of it gets kind of clunky and includes a lot of CG clipshows and gore segway that relies on music unnecessary and yet somehow predictable plot twists full of tepid villains or lazy pacing.I do like the Taoist mysticism they try to throw into the whole thing but it ends up being a lot less cool or scary than Ghostbusters by the end. The mysticism isn't explained in very much detail which I suspect is to deliberately cover up its lack of depth. There are a few points where the movie is a launchpad for typical conversations about mysticismreligious belief vs. science. snore Tony Leung's main role is pretty clich'd at least as far as western cop dramas go. Some event from his past haunts him isolates him from colleagues his family blah blah blah. David Morse is okay but there's no real point to him being there. We also get almost zero character development out of him. And the script's attempts to get oneliners or sarcastic quips from his character are pretty poor.Seriously if you hadn't seen these characters already a million times before in better movies you'd be pretty damn confused by their stories and motivations. The flashbacks and home movies and whatever else you see here they're so random they're given almost no introduction so you have no idea what you're seeing or why it's relevant to the story.So it's a typical crosscultural copdrama which mixes with light mysticism and horror instead of comedy or martial arts and with somewhat choppy editing and pacing. Don't get me wrong I really loved getting to see Taiwan and all the Taoist symbolism and whathaveyou. It just wasn't implemented that well. It's like the movie couldn't decide on what to be. Oh and the ending is poorly thought out too.The '80s flick Black Rain with Michael Douglas does the serious crosscultural copdrama thing much better. That one has finer ambiance a cheesy soundtrack with charming characters as well as a better look into the customs of Japanese law enforcement and organized crime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sun Valley Serenade is remembered today for being one of the two films that Glenn Miller and his Orchestra were featured in the other one being Orchestra Wives for 20th Century Fox. Miller was the number one swing band in the country and his presence in the film was more important than stars Sonia Henie and John Payne.Payne's a pianistvocalist with the Miller Band and his romancing of singer Lynn Bari gets the band a gig in Sun Valley during the ski season. Which is doubly fine for Payne because he likes all kinds of winter sports indoor and outdoor.But then an old publicity stunt that manager Milton Berle pulled some months earlier comes back to haunt them. He had the band sponsor a refugee from one of the occupied countries of Europe and Chester Clute from Immigration arrives with the receipt while all this full blown courtship of Bari is going on. So the band goes to Ellis Island to meet their sponsored urchin but instead it turns out to be a rather big girl who also likes winter sports Sonia Henie.The band thinks to park her with Berle's aunt in New Jersey but Sonia hears about Sun Valley and that sounds too much like home to suit her. And she's got a great advantage in that Bari isn't interested in skiing nor does she want to learn. Give you a guess who Payne winds up with.Of course this whole fluffy plot is just an excuse to hang some skating sequences and some music by the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Harry Warren and Mack Gordon contributed a fine score. In fact Sun Valley Serenade was nominated for an Oscar for black and white cinematography and musical scoring.It also received a nomination for Best Song one of the best known that the Glenn Miller Orchestra was known for Chattanooga Choo Choo. John Payne gets to vocalize another great song I Know Why And So Do You which sold a few platters back in the day.I don't know if Payne could play a piano in real life but even if he was faking it for the film he got a rare chance to jam with Glenn Miller as he was doing In The Mood probably his best known hit song. I'd have paid Darryl Zanuck to do that myself.The Miller Band's presence made a lot of folks forget this was a Sonia Henie film. Darryl Zanuck paid dear to sign Henie and she was first billed in all of her films. Her skating sequences or good but I'm betting she didn't like being upstaged.Nearly all the big bands in their era which was roughly 19351945 got into one film or another. Some got into better films than others and Miller's band did well by their two films before Glenn Miller went into the army and to his untimely disappearance over the English Channel.Not to forget that the Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge got to do specialty numbers. With all the talent in this film you can't possibly go wrong giving it a look.".

It was also great to see John Payne playing the light comedic leading man. Of course the music of Glenn Miller would be the highlight of any movie. The version of I Know Why and So Do You contained in the film is quite different from the versions you hear on Glenn Miller compilations and in my opinion is much better. This version is also the one used in the 90's film Memphis Belle. Add great skating sequences musical interludes and wonderful locations and you have a funfilled way to spend an afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this film as a kid and being impressed that it was one of the most fun movies not directed primarily at children. Finally I got a video copy and play it every Christmas season. If a musical romantic comedy is what you are in the mood for this is one of the best from a time when these were churned out in sizable numbers serving to entertain the GIs far from home as well as the home crowd. How could you miss with such talents as Sonja Henie the Glenn Miller Orchestra John Payne Lynn Bari Milton Berle the Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge. Most of the action and some of the filming takes place at the Sun Valley ski resort in Idaho developed only a few years before this film was made. I've seen clips of a few other films including Sonjathe reigning ice queen of the times and this is by far her most entertaining performance. While Berle is trying to romance her she definitely has her eye on a reluctant John Payne who becomes engaged to the band's singer played by perennial loser Lynn Bari. Payne was often paired with Betty Grable or Alice Faye in their 20th Century Fox musical romantic comedies of this era. Fox again paired Payne and Sonja in the film Iceland. I haven't seen it but apparently there was too much ice skating and too little development of the romance. It fell flat compared to the present film.Of course the Glenn Miller orchestra added much to this film. They performed several of their classic numbers. In addition several new songs were composed for this film by the prolific tunesmith Harry Warren and his then lyricist Mack Gordon. Their collaboration produced such memorable songs in this film as It Happened in Sun Valley I Know Why Chattanooga Choo Choo and At Last. Unfortunately the vocal version of the latter was cut apparently to shorten the film but Sonja and her retinue skated to the tune near the end of the film. The vocal version was resurrected in the second Fox film featuring the Miller orchestra Orchestra Wives which also introduced the WarrenGordon song Serenade in Blue. Chattanooga Choo Choo would go on to become the first certified Gold Record with more than 1 million sold in the first year.. Ironically when the Miller orchestra first practiced this song they generally were not impressed with its potential. Surprisingly at the Harry Warren web site where browsers can choose to hear renditions of many of his songs spanning from the 1920s to the 1950s the most requested song is At Last which I would rate as 10 at most.The comedy content of this film was carried by several of the principles. This was supposed to be the forte of Berle however his chief talent seemed to be smoking cigars. I would have much preferred Bob Hope or Jack Oakie for example. That would have made it just about a perfect film. Miller was rather stiff off the bandstand not surprisingly. Like the Cheshire Cat Sonja kept popping up unexpectedly scheming how to land her chosen man before he became unavailable. Her frequent Cheshire Catlike smile belied her need to act fast. The chemistry between Sonja and Payne appeared to be very good her impishness serving to loosen up his typical serious demeanor.317 update  Now available at YouTube along with Orchestra Wives".

	schema:reviewBody "Sun Valley Serenade is a quite a fun  pleasant movie starring one of the most famous big bands of all time the Glenn Miller Orchestra! Glenn Miller may not have been a great actor and jazz history informs us that he was not the greatest trombonist. But the presence of Miller and his band as Phil Corey and the Dartmouth Troubadours performing a fair number of old favorites is what provides this film with a lot of its charm. The primary love interest in this movie involves the figureskating Norwegian refugee Karen Benson Sonja Henie and the Troubadours' pianistvocalist Ted Scott John Payne who happens to be Karen's sponsor. But Ted is pressured to make a choice between Karen and the band's female vocalist Vivian Dawn Lynn Bari and it is not easy for him. He is quite nervous about having a loving relationship with the cheerful young refugee for whom he is responsible. No matter how hard Ted tries to fend her off Karen is so much in love with him and is so sure he would make a perfect husband for her that she is willing to try every trick imaginable in order to win his heart. By the end of the film Ted realizes how stuffy Vivian is and how wonderful it would be to have Karen for a wife.My favorite highlights from Sun Valley Serenade include the following. Ever the prankster Karen engages in some outrageous skiing hijinks in order to infuriate Ted causing a lengthy chase. The band's smartaleck brownnosing manager Jerome K. Nifty Allen Milton Berle tries his hand at skiing and with a witty musical accompaniment fails miserably Calling Dr. Kildare prepare for surgery!. While stranded inside a cabin Karen and Ted share a tender moment as they dance together while Ted sings to her the beautiful ballad I Know Why and So Do You. The band's rehearsing of Chattanooga Choo Choo featuring the great vocal stylings of Tex Beneke  the Modernaires as well as the fabulous footwork of the Nicholas Brothers is very swinging indeed! Before Vivian joins the Dartmouth Troubadours she does a miserable audition of It Happened in Sun Valley with her own band which proves to be a fine accompaniment for her until the second chorus she walks off the band and continues her audition with the Troubadours and after their short rendition of the classic Moonlight Serenade Vivian chimes in with I Know Why and So Do You. Sun Valley Serenade is a fine showcase for Glenn Miller and His Orchestra as well as for the figureskating talent of Sonja Henie. I highly recommend this film for all admirers of big band music and love stories with mischievous twists.".

A good supporting cast and faultless production values makes this movie one to remember.";

Karen immediately falls in love with Ted who already has a steady lady the tempermental Vivian Dawn who is the star vocalist for the band.  Vivian is played by Lynn Bari who had a long career playing arch highsociety types and blowsy other women. It's no contest who will end up together at the end but there are so many things that elevate this movie above your average 40's musical.  Perhaps the best thing is the presence of the Glenn Miller Orchestra not Benny Goodman as another review states.  Every song they deliver fits into the flow of the movie and every song is a knockout.  The classic In the Mood the gorgeous I Know Why and So Do You THE most romantic song ever and the stupendous Chattanooga Choo Choo performed by Tex Beneke and the Modernaires the number also features the supreme dancing and singing talents of the Nicholas Brothers and the lovely Dorothy Dandridge.  Throw in the presences of Milton Berle and the wacky Joan Davis the beautiful snow and ski sequences and the marvelous black ice ballet at the end and you've got one of the best Hollywood musicals from the 40's indeed from any decade!".

Her scenes with John Payne where she deliberately has them stranded for an overnight stay in a cabin due to her fake skiing accidentare good for laughs. Payne actually pulls off a couple of slapstick stunts while attempting to sleep across two chairsdefinitely one of his best romantic comedy roles. With all of the skating skiing and great Miller music this one can't miss. Once you see it you'll understand why it was such a huge hit in the early '40s. Glenn Miller fans will be grateful for all the screen time he is given. Lynn Bari plays it straight as the jealous woman trying to keep Sonja away from Payne and her singing is obviously dubbedbut her song 'I Know Why' is given a great treatment with the Miller band.

	schema:reviewBody "This was my first Sonja Henie movie which was reissued in support of House on 92nd St and what a great piece of entertainment that was! Of course we had been saturated with the great WW2 bands courtesy of AFRSAFN including Miller's and it was great to see them all and those popular tunes against such an attractive background. I Know Why still remains my favourite recording with Chattanooga Choo Choo and Moonlight Serenade. However hard as I triedI really could not accept the 30 year old strapping blonde  dimpled Sonja as an innocent little refugee and neither did Lynn Bari who was Hollywood's definitive gorgeous bitch. It wasn't her singing voice any more than in the later equally enjoyable Margie but it didn't matter  who cared? I never quite took to Joan Davis  she seemed too much like Martha RayeCass DaileyEve ArdenZazu Pitts. The back projection for the hill skating sequences was too obvious but I would love to know how they managed to get that immaculate black mirrored effect to the huge rink. Much like those impossible dance floors in some of the AstaireRogers spectaculars. The Nicholas Bros were nothing less than sensational  an unknown young Dorothy Dandridge did well in her early brief appearance. Glenn Miller on the other hand may have played a cool slush pump but he was no actor! And there were always the real Modernaires. And all this without a hint of smut or sex. Best line  when Lynn Bari in the night club sequence in a fit of jealousy rounds on Henie and calls her a hillbilly and the latter with an expression of total bewilderment retorts Hillbilly? WellI thought so.Both Joan Davis  Milton Berle made it to early 50s TV  the latter becoming known as Mr TV from his prolonged popularity  brashness. He even made it into the early 90s in one of his last guest bits for one of Fran Drescher's hilarious The Nanny episodes as a shyster lawyer.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was my first Sonja Henie movie which was reissued in support of House on 92nd St and what a great piece of entertainment that was! Of course we had been saturated with the great WW2 bands courtesy of AFRSAFN including Miller's and it was great to see them all and those popular tunes against such an attractive background. I Know Why still remains my favourite recording with Chattanooga Choo Choo and Moonlight Serenade. However hard as I triedI really could not accept the 30 year old strapping blonde  dimpled Sonja as an innocent little refugee and neither did Lynn Bari who was Hollywood's definitive gorgeous bitch. It wasn't her singing voice any more than in the later equally enjoyable Margie but it didn't matter  who cared? I never quite took to Joan Davis  she seemed too much like Martha RayeCass DaileyEve ArdenZazu Pitts. The back projection for the hill skating sequences was too obvious but I would love to know how they managed to get that immaculate black mirrored effect to the huge rink. Much like those impossible dance floors in some of the AstaireRogers spectaculars. The Nicholas Bros were nothing less than sensational  an unknown young Dorothy Dandridge did well in her early brief appearance. Glenn Miller on the other hand may have played a cool slush pump but he was no actor! And there were always the real Modernaires. And all this without a hint of smut or sex. Best line  when Lynn Bari in the night club sequence in a fit of jealousy rounds on Henie and calls her a hillbilly and the latter with an expression of total bewilderment retorts Hillbilly? WellI thought so.Both Joan Davis  Milton Berle made it to early 50s TV  the latter becoming known as Mr TV from his prolonged popularity  brashness. He even made it into the early 90s in one of his last guest bits for one of Fran Drescher's hilarious The Nanny episodes as a shyster lawyer.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Norwegian refugee schemes to catch the man she loves  a swing band pianist. Maybe a little SUN VALLEY SERENADE will do the trick...Sonja Henie was Norway's ice queen when she won Olympic gold medals in 1928 1932  1936. After going professional she began a celebrated movie career at 20th Century Fox in 1936 with her American film debut ONE IN A MILLION. Beautiful  talented as well as being a natural in front of the cameras she carved out her own special niche during Hollywood's Golden Age. Although Miss Henie's ice routines may look antiquated by comparison to modern champions there was nothing antique about her dazzling smile or sparkling personality. In this regard some of today's snowflake princesses could still learn a great deal from her.As her career progressed it became increasingly difficult for Fox to find decent stories for Miss Henie and the excuses for the lavish ice dancing numbers were often implausible. No matter. Audiences did not flock to her films to watch Sonja recite Shakespeare. The movies were meant to be pure escapist fantasy plain  simple.SUN VALLEY SERENADE is no exception and its story is often quite silly. Also Sonja is not given nearly enough skating time to really satisfy her fans. However Sonja's costars do offer some compensation.First among these should be the incomparable Glenn Miller who appears with his band. Although his character is left pretty much a cipher his marvelous music more than adequately speaks for itself. Gentle  softspoken he nevertheless provides the strongest competition yet in any of her films to capturing the viewers' attention away from Henie.The Miller Band performs In The Mood' and the absolute definitive version of Chattanooga Choo Choo' which is further enhanced with performances by the fancyjumping Nicholas Brothers Harold  Fayard and the beautiful Dorothy Dandridge. Fans of the Swing Era should recognize several of Glenn's band members including saxophonist Tex Beneke all of whom appear uncredited.John Payne plays Sonja's love interest and she goes to great lengths to get him including the willingness to compromise her moral character. Fortunately the plot doesn't take her that far. Lovely Lynn Bari is the vocalist also interested in Payne and the script does her something of a disservice letting her appear sweet  charming until its time to clear the decks for Henie at which point Miss Bari's character becomes a jealous virago. Perhaps in films such as this it isn't wise to delve too far into the nuances of characterization...Milton Berle plays the band's loudmouthed publicity agent. Comedienne Joan Davis who had already enlivened a couple of Henie's films makes three appearances so brief as to be little more than a cameo.Ultimately though this is Sonja's show. She glides effortlessly into the viewer's heart while balancing on a thin edge of silver suspended over frozen water.".

My already high expectations were not disappointed. It is always great pleasure to see that European cinema constantly produces such almost unknown masterpieces especially today when it has become increasingly harder in 2004 when this film was made or afterward to stick to the European style.The plot is tough not copying Almodovar an Austrian version of  La Mala Educacion both Spain and Austria being traditionally Catholic countries the various scandals rumors and  sometimes unjust allegations surrounding this powerful institution provide a rich almost endless material for movies with various approaches of the matter.Unlike Almodovar's film this one goes much further in analyzing the multi layered connection between church and secular society and the part these connections play in order to defend its respectable image at all cost.But just like in Almodovar's film a young man is dubiously silenced and others even more endangered as he tries to unveil the abuse he was constantly subjected to while studying in a Catholic school in this one none else than the soninlaw of the  fictional but most likely not too far from real characters director of the Salzburg theater is mysteriously killed just when he intended to make some uncomfortable confessions from his past which could incriminate some important church officials.The film starts off with two memorable landmarks of Salzburg first a cliff with a breathtaking view overlooking the town from whom the victim is actually thrown and which will play also an important part towards the film's climax reference to Hitchcock's  Vertigo and secondly the famous Salzburg theater festival as the film begins just at the point where that year's edition is marred almost overshadowed by the murder in the director's family.This is the moment when the strange antisocial but honest detective with a shady background Brenner sets in to unveil the truth. He is a former cop thrown out from active service for undisclosed matters and presently acting on his own constantly experiencing extreme poverty and social exclusion. It is almost unbelievable to see that Salzburg a city depicted as quiet and lawabiding can have so many homeless people and poor sections when it actually seems to small and wealthy to idyllic to have anyhting else but middleclass if not richer inhabitants just like Austria.He soon discovers that the influential theater director is not interested to solve the case however his daughter eager to find the truth about her husband's death urges Brenner to lead an investigation. As Brenner examines the Catholic school where the victim once studies he soon discovers a complicated network of both heterosexual and homosexual child molesters constantly provided by this institution with freshmeat of both genders. Some clients are influential especially one prominent opera singer which looks like a hetero version of Rudolph Mooshammer and even has a taste for rented sex and bizarre fetishes just like the famous fashion designer.But as the investigation goes on the Church officials and other mighty figures become worried about the outlandish detective and try to kill him on numerous occasions. Nevertheless after he is unjustly accused of having killed the roommate with whom he shared a sordid lodging and just like in Almodovar's film the church works extremely efficiently in faking clues everything pointing at Brenner he manages to escape narrowly from the same death like the one that started the plot and from the top of the same cliff. After he kills some employees of that infamous school in selfdefense further investigations are ceased and he has to leave the town temporally. Furthermore the victim's widow is not eager for justice anymore accepting the same guilty silence around her either forced by her strict father or realizing that she's can not fight the system. She is actually one of the most complex characters in the film torn between her spoiled need for a sheltered life and her desire to look for justice at the expense of respectability.Subnsequently the film's title reveals its doublethink or doublespeak meaning it hints both at the silence required in strict schools during classes but also the mendacity dominating society's most respectable institutions and most privileged circles.It's captivating too see that besides it's typically Austrian dark humor e.g. a real nonfictional village called petting used here as a pun just like the film's title how actual the issue can be. That is in many cases not just the dishonest corrupt official but also honest people in traditionally Catholic countries try to cover up such scandals the latter category so well manipulated that they truly believe in the church's innocence.Haunting and worth seeing but also meditating about.".

	schema:headline " The second Brenner is on course to greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Silentium an Austrian Germanlanguage film from 2004 so it is already over 10 years old. It is the second of so far four films from the Brenner series directed by Wolfgang Murnberger and starring Josef Hader who also wrote on the script here. I must say I did not like the first film but I really loved the third thanks to Bierbichler mostly. This one we have here fits in nicely. It was made between them in terms of time and it also fits right in terms of quality. It was a good watch but nothing great I would say. The humor was working on several occasions and the case Brenner was investigating was also interesting as it involved him going up against a scrupulous priest and his two murderous henchmen. This is really not at all about guessing who the bad guys are. Actually you see two of them in the very first scene and it's immediately obvious to who fills the role of the main antagonist this time.Silentium runs for almost 2 hours and manages that it almost never drags. The early scene with Brenner losing his job as a mall detective when a woman accuses him of touching her inappropriately despite being actually a thief tells a lot about the comedy in here. We laugh at Brenner on some occasions but we don't really need to feel sorry about it. Dark humor is common in Austrian movies and this one here fits in nicely under that category. To me personally Brenner in his nonpolice moments always reminds me a bit of Louis C.K in his hit series Louie. The approach to comedy feels similar sometimes. The cast is pretty good too. Schwarz is on board again as colead to Brenner and Krl gives a good portrayal too. Jrgen Tarrach Georg Friedrich and the late Christoph Schlingensief don't have that much screen time but they give small yet memorable performances which i enjoyed. Especially Tarrach an opera singer with a very unique method of training his vocal chords is completely hilarious. There is violence in here also sometimes very graphic scenes so it's not for the easily offended. But everybody who doesn't mind that and likes their crime movies with an ounce of comedy will have a good time watching here. Just like myself. I give Silentium a thumbsup.".

And in the end a lot of that humour was lost in the film. The film still had the amusing situation and black comedy of the book even if the plot had been slightly rewritten and some of the narrator's comments were included but it was funny more in a sort of slapstick way whereas the book is witty.".

It gives the feature a video release shot on film a nice timeless feel as the director intended.Simplicity is the key with runaway thrillseekers Evan Stone and Ava Vincent blowing into town in his red sports car killing the local gas stationconvenience store attendant for no reason after lifting a few bucks from his cash register. Since it's a nonsex bit role the gas jockey is played by the crew's electrician Ric Rodney.Though Vincent is more than a handful Stone also dallies with local waitress Jessica Drake who gets star billing and is the selling point for the video. I was surprised that Vincent who IMDb insists on calling by her more real name Jewel has the larger role. That's pretty much the entire plot of a concise feature that in the preporn days would have made a compelling 1hour anthology drama on TV I'm thinking of my fave the Altmandriected Bus Stop episode memorably starring Fabian.Dillion Day is wellcast as the local sheriff in this tiny cast with Julie Meadows thrown into the mix in the final reels almost as an afterthought as an FBI agent so that another sex scene can bring the video up to porn quota. Even so fans of the latterday walltowall sex persuasion will likely be disappointed by Raven's tilting of the balance to more acting less sex in this opus. Speaking of acting I could see why Stone won an industry acting award for his Brandoinspired but more subtle performance as the leatherjacketed killer.I liked the ending which went completely against the clichs of various genres by having the thrill killers go out in an OFFSCREEN Butch  Sundance blaze of glory no blood no guts just inevitability. This set up the proper mood of helplessness for protagonist Drake left behind seemingly sans exit in her 1horse town.".

I have just watched Jail Bait his attempt to make a serious filmnoir and I really laughed along its 72 minutes running time. The first points that call the attention in Jail Bait are the ham actors and actresses and the awful lines. The cast seems to be amateurish and the screenplay seems to be written by a stupid teenager so ridiculous and silly the dialogs and situations are. The next point to attract me was the beauty and elegance of Theodora Thurman in the character of the lover of the gangster Vic Brady. Another point is that it is always night along the story. The annoying music score is probably one of the worse I have ever listened in a movie. The funniest parts in my point of view are the arrival of Lt. Bob Lawrence to Dr. Boris Gregor's house from the outside the lights are turnedoff but when Marilyn Gregor opens the door the lights are on the death of Don Gregor is simply hilarious and what about the surgery of Vic Brady in a sofa? This movie certainly is predictable laughable absurd funny but it is also absolutely cult. My vote is four.Title Brazil Jail Bait  A Face do Crime Jail Bait  The Face of the Crime".

Bob Lawrence to Dr. Boris Gregor's house from the outside the lights are turnedoff but when Marilyn Gregor opens the door the lights are on the death of Don Gregor is simply hilarious and what about the surgery of Vic Brady in a sofa? This movie certainly is predictable laughable absurd funny but it is also absolutely cult. My vote is four.Title Brazil Jail Bait  A Face do Crime Jail Bait  The Face of the Crime";

A lot of people like to go on about how Ed Wood is the worst director of all time but how can this be when he's made movies that so many people have enjoyed?

	schema:reviewBody "In Jail Bait Ed Wood applies his boundless enthusiasm and limited talent to the crime movie genre. From a technical viewpoint it's actually one of his less unsound features although that cuts down somewhat on the unintentional laughs that it provides. The story is actually pretty solid and could have served as the basis for a pretty good filmnoir. Most of its weaknesses are in the acting pacing and dialogue plus the occasional zany outofplace detail.The story uses a basically familiar setup but adds a couple of extra components to it. Lyle Talbot and Steve Reeves play a pair of policemen investigating the misdeeds of a young man whose father is a highly respected doctor. The doctor and his daughter meanwhile try to protect the son both from the police and from the career criminal who has led him astray. For the most part the story is conventional but believable with a rather clever ending.Most of the rest of the production does not come up to the level of the story. The everloyal Talbot gives his typically earnest performance trying to make the dialogue sound as good as possible while enduring some amusingly awkward interactions with the stilted Reeves. The rest of the cast is generally nondescript and sometimes noticeably out of their depth.The dialogue contains some of the expected unintentional laughs and the characters often overexert themselves on unnecessary exposition or on pointing out details that were already completely obvious. The pacing likewise is inconsistent from scene to scene although with fewer of the kinds of direction and editing slipups that generally characterize Wood's features.No one could ever deny that Wood loved making movies and he made sincere efforts to make them as well as he could which is what has kept his movies so watchable despite their shortcomings. Jail Bait attempts to emulate the classics of its genre but it is severely limited by the lack of talent and other resources.".

Obviously his family becomes worried about him. Another one of those rich kid gone bad stories. Basically all the acting in this movie is bad except for some detective. Delores Fuller stars as the kid's brother and she had a pretty bad performance at least she's good looking though But still the bad acting adds to the unintentional humor you will find with this. Also Timothy Farrell stars as partner in crime Vic Brady and his performance is the funniest especially after he says lines like let's unwraps the Christmas presents and see the presents inside. Tim would later star in a terrible movie The Violent Years another rich kid gone bad story Other lines include plastic surgery can be strenuous and very very complicating and carrying a gun can be dangerous business miss. Other humor in this film are included in the scenes themselves. When you see the two thieves robbing a safe you will see a picture of a gingerbread man on the wall for absolutely no reason. In addition you'll also see a stupid dance sequence I saw the director's cut You should also watch out for this annoying guitar theme that is played throughout the entire movie.My overall opinion though is that this is an entertaining movie because it was so bad not to mention the obvious ending It really didn't bore me as much as other trash flicks. It also should be watched since the director Ed Wood is only known for Plan 9 Glen or Glenda etc. You should really check this out if you're in the mood for something different.".

All that needs to be said about the acting dialog sets and the annoying music has already been covered on these boards so I won't repeat it. I'll just say that I wonder how Lyle Talbot who had a pretty decent career in films in the 1930s and early 40s ever sank to this level. He was a face that appeared all over moviedom for years and was a good actor in support of some of the big stars of the day. Times must have been very very hard for him to stoop to this. We know why Bela Lugosi worked with Wood but maybe Talbot did it on a bet.....or not. It's always sad to see competent actors who once had careers end up in this manner.If you have never seen an Ed Wood film put this one on your must see list..........really all of his films are must sees if you are a fan of so bad that they are good movies.

It's practically a manual on how NOT to make a noir despite a generous dose of hardboiled  yet godawful  dialogue particularly in the scenes depicting the gangster's constant bickering with his moll the film has absolutely no sense of atmosphere a headacheinducing and inappropriate score an irrelevant musical number in blackface to boot! and some of the worst most amateurish acting you're ever likely to see! Perhaps the main culprit in this regard is elderly Herbert Rawlinson who amazingly kept working on such rubbish when he was dying of lung cancer and in fact kicked the bucket a day after production wrapped! as an eminent surgeon who has to contend with a delinquent son the latter gets embroiled in armed robbery and murder and is subsequently killed by his associate after the surgeon persuades him to give himself up to the Police. However the gangster blackmails the old man into doing a makeshift job of plastic surgery in order to avoid capture  but in perhaps the most uproarious scene of the entire film the doctor discovers his son's corpse in the gangster's kitchen without so much as a reaction and decides to turn the tables on him. While not unpredictable I must say that the twist ending works...but unfortunately the TV reception got screwed up during the last few minutes of the film so I missed out on some of the details! By the way the younger of two cops who tail Rawlison's son throughout the film is none other than future peplum icon Steve Reeves in his film debut  and he looks as uncomfortable in a suit and tie as Chuck Heston!!".

On the surface the plot seems reasonable enough. The adult son of a respected plastic surgeon falls into a life of crime and winds up killing a former cop while pulling off a payroll heist with his mentor small time hood Vic Brady Timothy Farrell. Virtually everything else is window dressing for shabby sets grammar school stage play acting and cheap dialog.But Oh what dialog! My favorite examples Brady kills Don Gregor his girlfriend moll Loretta Theodora Thurman exclaims  Maybe you shouldn't have done that! Or how about when Loretta has her moment of doubt about Brady and threatens to leave. Brady  I didn't set you up in all this luxury just to have you walk out on me. LUXURY!!! A living room with a chair and couch!! The picture even takes it's name from a line from Don Gregor's sister Marilyn Dolores Fuller admonishing her brother about his association with Brady  You know that gun is jail bait!On top of that did you ever expect to see the future Hercules in this flick? Almost unrecognizable without a beard and loin cloth Steve Reeves teases the audience with a quick upper torso shot while putting on a shirt which made me think what was he doing with his shirt off in the police chief's office?  he was already at work! See what I mean? Oh and don't let me forget the scene where Miss Willis ID's Brady and Gregor as the two who held up the theater and killed the night watchman. Inspector Johns Lyle Talbot has only two pictures of possible suspects to show her and they're the right ones!!! Amazing!But man oh man you just had to see it coming! When Brady blackmails Doc Gregor for a facial doover you just HAD to know how it would all come out. That ending was the 'Twilight Zone' on acid especially if you kept a sharp eye on BradyGregor's facial scars. The first time the bandages come off the scar on his forehead runs diagonal from the top of his nose to well above the eye. However when he's shot by the pool the scar runs laterally across the middle of his forehead. The perfect ending to an Ed Wood masterpiece!Through it all you had just the perfect musical accompaniment what with the strumming Mexican guitar background. You know in thinking about it the only thing that could have made this picture more bizarre would have been the inclusion of a night club comedy routine done in black face. Oh... wait a minute!".

The perfect ending to an Ed Wood masterpiece!Through it all you had just the perfect musical accompaniment what with the strumming Mexican guitar background. You know in thinking about it the only thing that could have made this picture more bizarre would have been the inclusion of a night club comedy routine done in black face. Oh... wait a minute!";

Although Don's father is a prestigious plastic surgeon Don Jr. has renounced this respectable profession in favor of a life of crime. He's pretty incorrigible if he's got a gun in his hand so after Marilyn drives him home he gets a revolver from a hollowed out book to replace the one the cops confiscated and goes out to meet his henchman Vic Brady Timothy Farrell at a downtown watering hole.

Unfortunately the holdup goes wrong Don kills a security guardretired cop and Vic tags a fleeing secretary but doesn't kill her. The cops arrive but Don and Vic shake them after a languid car chase that maybe because Ed Wood forgot to get a shooting permit and didn't want anyone to know he was making a movie obeys all traffic laws. They're safe for the time being but the secretary they failed to kill is a living witness so word gets out soon enough that Don is a cop killer. Choked by remorse Don visits his father's office and Doctor Gregor convinces him to surrender to the authorities. But Vic catches Don there takes him back to Vic's hideout and after a brief altercation shoots him dead. Vic and his girlfriend Loretta Theodora Thurman trick Doctor Gregor the plastic surgeon into giving Vic a new face to escape the law using for leverage a claim that they are holding Don hostage. When Doctor Gregor discovers that Don is already dead he gets revenge by surreptitiously giving Vic Don's face. The police identify Vic as Don the cop killer and kill him after a quick and bloodless shootout. Justice having been done we can all shake our heads ruefully and go home.An essentially unremarkable copsandrobbers potboiler Jail Bait is pretty good evidence that Ed Wood gets far too much credit for making bad films. Though Wood's dialogue delivers the occasional trademark nonsequiturwhen a police inspector Lyle Talbot explains to Marilyn that carrying a gun can be dangerous business she rejoins that building a skyscraper can be dangerous business too thus demonstrating that she's missed his point entirelyby and large this movie is marginally competent. I wouldn't make such a point out of this except that Ed Wood's badness is the key component of his continued notoriety I guess I'm suggesting that anyone who's seen a movie as wretched as Paranoia or Blood Sisters to name two of about four billion examples should be unimpressed by Wood's supposed ineptitude.The movie is most interesting when it's suggesting that our free wills and capacity to make decisions abandon us in the face of relatively banal stimuliin this case the condition of holding a gun in his hand is enough to make Don take leave of his senses and start shooting everyone in sight. Several times he insists that I never thought it would come to this just as the dope smokers of Reefer Madness seem to watch on helplessly as their own lives go up in bubbly gurgling lungsmoke just because they couldn't see the longterm peril in a puff of marijuana. Doctor Gregor provides the obligatory Freudian theory for Don's miscreantismturns out Dad spoiled Don as a child and the little fellow also suffered from an absent mother God rest her soulbut this is largely an afterthought. The more Doctor Gregor and Marilyn sacrifice themselves for Don the more we realize his upbringing was just fine he simply can't think straight when he has a pistol in his hand. When Doc and Marilyn are preparing to meet with Vic for the first time the movie seems to consider pursuing this idea seriouslyMarilyn wanting only to protect Don drops another in an apparently interminable supply of handguns into her pursebut once there the gun never resurfaces so the movie never makes good on its promise to transform Marilyn into a murderous fiend once she decides to pack heat.Don't be fooled by the taglineunderage girls are not the jail bait of this movie's title.

Before we analyze whether this movie is great or just really good let's mention Herbert Rawlinson who plays the Plastic Surgeon Dr. Gregor. He does a good job here. He is in the 1954 movie looking quite healthy. He died in 1953 of lung cancer. He was born in 1885. He was 68 but he looked more like 58. Not only was this movie released after his death but there were some movies released in 1966 13 years after his death in which he was credited with an acting role. Check his page here at IMDb and you will see one of the longest lists of movie credits ever to exist anywhere.With him in this film we see a young sexy Steve Reeves showing his tummy in one shirtless scene. Steve does an OK job with little dialog. It is obvious in his scenes he is too good looking to be just a minor player. He of course became much better known just shortly after this movie was released when he appeared in his Hercules movies as the top dog.The sets are decorated by what would now seem to be 99 Cent Store motif. The opening credits mention who supplied the Knitwear Ladies' Suits Dresses Lingerie and the locations which included the Monterey Theatre in Monterey Park Ca. and The Hunter Inn in Temple City Ca. Today's product placement units would be hard pressed to do a better job.The plot line is excellent. The acting is not good but fun to watch. This movie beats anything Hollywood is now offering. The focus here is on the criminal and his desire to beat the rap and also the cop who is going to bring the offender to justice. The police drive 1954 Nash sedans. There is also a Rambler convertible and a 1951 Chevy that are featured.The swimming pool scene at the end could be used to lead into a second feature of Sunset Blvd. which seems to start where this one ends. It would have been fun to have watched Steve Reeves at this age playing in Sunset Blvd. opposite Gloria Swanson. Not that Bill Holden wasn't good just that Steve looked like a boytoy at the time and it would have been a daring casting choice.Ed Wood understood what was needed in a movie. He did not waste a lot of money just to get his scenes. He had the cooperation of several police departments in Southern California when he made this. They are also credited and my guess is they are actually used in many scenes as extras and one liner actors.If you want great sound and color and big names this ain't it. If you want to have a movie that has a little historical significance try this one. It is safe for all ages if you don't mind lots of gunfire.Tom Willett".

Two weeks later Brady's bandages come off and he's horrified to find whose face is underneath.Jail Bait Ed Wood's attempt at gangster film noir is unintentionally silly ludicrous and terribly enjoyable. And despite what Wade Williams says on the back of the DVD the script is far from clever. Other highlights include an embarrassing racist Vaudeville actsome versions replace this scene with a striptease show because it's apparently less offensive to degrade women as it is to degrade blacks laughably inappropriate Spanish guitar score and Dolores Fuller who is possibly the worst actress in history.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Wood is mostly known for his complete ineptness behind and in front of the camera in such bad film classics as Glen or Glenda Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. However Wood's brief foray into film noir Jail Bait is notable for a few reasons.  The first and foremost of which is that it was the first screen appearance of the legendary muscle man Steve Reeves who was later immortalized in the Hercules pictures. Jail Bait is a somewhat misleading title as it is a phrase that usually refers to women who are trouble more specifically underaged women who are trouble.  In this film that simply isn't the case  the jail bait is more the main character's fascination with the underworld. The Rhino Video release of this film is labeled the director's cut because it features a short burlesque striptease segment in the place of the original segment which featured a comedian in blackface.  Unfortunately the edit is so poorly executed that it becomes painfully obvious that this director's cut was most likely made by the owner of the copyright. The film is just as inept as most of Ed Wood's films though it is a little more intriguing as it is set in a less fictional environment and features attempts late in the running time at plot twists.  Plus lovely international model Theadora Thurman plays the femme fatale though she's a terrible actress. A necessary rental for Ed Wood or bad movie fans and possibly an educational video on how NOT to do film noir.".

The usual slapdash direction horrible writing the cheapest musical score in history and lousy acting all occur in this oneso productionwise it's about what you'd expect from this master of schlock. However unlike his masterpiece PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE this one is bad but not all that watchable. PLAN 9 is one of those films so campy and bad that it's fun to watch with friends. This film frankly is just a waste of time unless you have a perverse need to torment yourself like I do! Despite the title of the movie the film is NOT about underage girls but concerns a stupid young man who chooses a life of crime. The only sexy moments in this insipid film occur during a striptease scene featuring an incredibly wellbuilt and bouncy brunette. She is quite striking but leaves a lot of her clothes on in a scene that was randomly inserted into the film and had nothing to do with the plot! It was just a moment of cheap titillation and at least it helped me stay awake during this awful film. The acting of everyone in the film was excremental except for screen veteran Lyle Talbotwho must have acted in this and PLAN 9 because a family member was being held hostage by Wood. The young man who was the star of the film was a particularly atrocious actor and had no discernible talent. Also having a difficult time reading his lines was Steve Reeves later to play 'Hercules' in some lowbudget Italian films. Not only wasn't he particularly good but he also took off his shirt at a completely inappropriate moment just to show off his Adonislike chest! On the positive side the idea of how to end the film was a bit creative but because of bad pacing and acting what should have been a pleasant surprise and ironic moment instead just looked forced.All in all this is a horrid film. Not as bad as some films of the 1950s but only a very very select few!!!! Watch at your own risk.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Khubsoorat is a fantastic and simple family entertainment. It is well written well acted and directed and is thoroughly funny and exciting. I enjoyed every moment of it including the songs the story the characters and everything else it dealt with. Khubsoorat presents the brighter side of Hindi cinema which is not melodramatic which is more restrained and easygoing. The charm of this little gem comes from its depiction of simple everyday issues but it also manages to make a genuine impact on the viewer. It portrays upperclass urban families beautifully it is realistic throughout and the acting is natural. The everamazing Rekha presents a different side of her personality. She lets go of her enigmatic sexappeal and switches her exotic beauty with a tomboyish endearingly naive look of a smart and witty girlnextdoor. The result is effective  her comic timing is brilliant and the zest she adds into her character makes Manju Dayal very memorable. Ashok Kumar is as always wonderful gracious and likable all through as the kindhearted father Dina Pathak is impressive as the overly strict mother and Rakesh Roshan and Shashikala support well. I must note my favourite sequences towards the climax when Ashok Kumar's character falls ill and Manju worryingly looks after him. The scene in which he wakes up and realises she was there taking care of him was very moving. All in all whoever you are do watch Khubsoorat it will make you feel much better. A pleasurable watch indeed!".

I must note my favourite sequences towards the climax when Ashok Kumar's character falls ill and Manju worryingly looks after him. The scene in which he wakes up and realises she was there taking care of him was very moving. All in all whoever you are do watch Khubsoorat it will make you feel much better. A pleasurable watch indeed!";

	schema:reviewBody "Lions for Lambs is a current issue film that deals with several relevant topics. The central plot revolves around essentially three settings that don't directly affect each other through action. They do however affect each other through course of action presented in debate. Cruise plays Jasper Irving a GOP senator with a new plan of action for the war on terror. Streep is a veteran reporter who is interviewing him. Simultaneously Redford is a college professor who has called a student into his office. A conflict in Afghanistan is taking place which is linked to the aforementioned plot lines.Lions for Lambs surprised me with it's balance. I'm an open Republican and felt that this movie was not a clich attack against the power that be. The Cruise character could have been given irrefutable hatred material. He could have been caught in a scandal. He could have alienated others with religious furor. Instead he is real and forms educated arguments. He seems rational and passionate he can also make a turn to present himself to the public. I don't see this as an attack but one of the many skills politicians need to succeed. With all they go through and the decisions they have they don't want the mocking that crying before the camera would carry. The left is represented by Redford's professor and Streep's reporter. Both are treated with rationale conviction. Neither has a clear antiGOP agenda. Both of these characters even go as far as to acknowledge the error in the ways of their side. If there is a message to the film it is that we are being sheltered from reality. It was clear to this viewer that Redford is stating that we are placing focus on the minuscule while matters of true importance are treated as second rate. Surely this is something we all can agree on in Lions for Lambs and this comes into fruition as the film evolves.Aside from the political commentary which it makes no dance around this a dialog heavy film. Characters are pinned against their situations which cause them to restrain from a course of action both physically and metaphorically. The conversations are engaging but it would be arguably more favorable to allow the characters interaction. A few additional technical merits could have gone a long way. For example the CGI of the Chinook helicopter was not up to par a memorable score and unique cinematography are also absent. The screenplay is inherently foiled by remarkable coincidence but there was no way around that. At a scant 88 minutes Lions for Lambs is quick to get to the point but it is over too fast. These miscues keep it from perfection. Served as they are Lions for Lambs is thinking person's film that comes highly recommended.".

A conflict in Afghanistan is taking place which is linked to the aforementioned plot lines.Lions for Lambs surprised me with it's balance. I'm an open Republican and felt that this movie was not a clich attack against the power that be. The Cruise character could have been given irrefutable hatred material. He could have been caught in a scandal. He could have alienated others with religious furor. Instead he is real and forms educated arguments. He seems rational and passionate he can also make a turn to present himself to the public. I don't see this as an attack but one of the many skills politicians need to succeed. With all they go through and the decisions they have they don't want the mocking that crying before the camera would carry. The left is represented by Redford's professor and Streep's reporter. Both are treated with rationale conviction. Neither has a clear antiGOP agenda. Both of these characters even go as far as to acknowledge the error in the ways of their side. If there is a message to the film it is that we are being sheltered from reality. It was clear to this viewer that Redford is stating that we are placing focus on the minuscule while matters of true importance are treated as second rate. Surely this is something we all can agree on in Lions for Lambs and this comes into fruition as the film evolves.Aside from the political commentary which it makes no dance around this a dialog heavy film. Characters are pinned against their situations which cause them to restrain from a course of action both physically and metaphorically. The conversations are engaging but it would be arguably more favorable to allow the characters interaction. A few additional technical merits could have gone a long way. For example the CGI of the Chinook helicopter was not up to par a memorable score and unique cinematography are also absent. The screenplay is inherently foiled by remarkable coincidence but there was no way around that. At a scant 88 minutes Lions for Lambs is quick to get to the point but it is over too fast. These miscues keep it from perfection. Served as they are Lions for Lambs is thinking person's film that comes highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie with contrasting feelings because I read a few reviews in advance. Many of them blamed it for being too didactic thus lacking the basic qualities a movie should have. Many others praised it in a very ideological way thus raising in me the fear it was a piece of propaganda. Well after I spent the 80 minutes watching the movie I thought not even 60 had elapsed and my attention and empathy didn't ever fail for a single minute. There is no doubt that a movie so extensively based upon dialog is very unusual but this turns out to be one of its most valuable asset and proves the great value of the script. It is not an action movie in any of the conventional ways yet I followed it with the attention the suspense and expectations feelings that usually an action movie raises. I think that indeed it is a sort of intelligence action movie  as such it stands out over the best stuff that visual media performances are usually producing today. The second point I most appreciated has been its ability in portraying the main characters' different viewpoints in a very complex way as it must be there were no all round villains nor all round heroes. Doubtless there is a very much defined view and attitude but it is not supported in a mere ideological way. In fact it has no clearcut simple answers to offer to a damningly complex situation full of contradictions as it actually is. It is full of subtleties in dialog not less than in body languages and settings. It is often moving without ever slipping into cheap rhetoric. It's a movie that in a way should be seen and reseen and reflected and discussed upon to wake up people from all sorts of addictive indifference as well as of addictive I'm right they're wrong self complacency. Last but not least in my opinion this movie is a good instance of what is needed to roll back antiAmerican feelings that have been spread out due to the American government policies and behavior in the last decade. May I offer my apologies for my English to the readers that will have had the patience to go through my comment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm quite reluctant to criticize this movie because I basically agree with every sentiment it expresses. I just wish it could express them with more grace style and subtlety. The movie makes some very valid points about the American political system patriotism the so called War on Terror the lack of engagement of youth and the comatose subordination of the American media. Most of which I agree with. And yet it left me utterly cold and disengaged. To summarise briefly the movie consists of essentially 3 scenes a senator's office in DC representing the establishment a college professor's office in California representing the liberal element and a mountain top in Afghanistan representing active engagement. In Afghanistan two unfortunate brave recruits are lying injured and waiting for rescue. The scenes take place in real time in other words it's all supposed to be happening in parallel. The senator Jasper Irving Tom Cruise in his impressive office is disclosing an exclusive on a new Afghan military Push to a veteran reporter Meryl Streep the college professor Malley Robert Redford as a political scientist is trying to engage the interest of a cynical bright young student who has given up studying because it's all so pointless and the two buddy soldiers have just fallen  or jumped  from a damaged helicopter which came under attack in the Afghan mountains as it took part in the Push. The senator is trying to justify the military action mostly to promote his own career while Streep's reporter is wrestling with her conscience. She is supposed to meekly lap up this scoop she is being given and report it uncritically as a good patriotic American  and one whose career is on the downhill run coasting towards oblivion in a world obsessed with triviality and junk. When she wonders did the media roll over and become the poodle of the government? In the meantime in California Professor Malley engages in a battle of words with his clever cynical and privileged student Todd telling him of two equally bright but financially challenged minority students who left college the previous year to join the army so as to experience for themselves the sharp end of the War on Terror. The movie is at pains to question the War on Terror and the people who facilitate it without dissing the poor grunts on the ground. It makes the point  and it's a valid one  that many of the people who protested the Vietnam War a generation before had actually fought in it because they were forced to by the Draft. With no universal draft to dodge why should the 21st century's selfobsessed kids be interested in a war being fought a dozen time zones away especially when they are fed a constant diet of escapist pap by the media? At least the two buddies now dying in Afghanistan were trying to actively engage with the issue. It certainly wasn't the performances which were at fault. They were mostly excellent. I especially loved Tom Cruise as the senator he was so perfectly insincerely sincere. It's easy to forget what a good actor he actually is when so much of what we see of him is..well.escapist media pap. I will never tire of watching Meryl Streep whom I have worshipped for 30 years Robert Redford was Robert Redford does he ever play anyone else? The guys who played the two soldiers were convincing and as for Andrew Garfield who played Todd I see dozens of him every day here in California he had the character to a T. So why do I feel so negative about this movie? Because it's really not a movie at all. This is stage play looking for a theatre. I am certain if I'd seen this at my local Rep. with a good cast and some inventive and lively direction I'd have walked out of the theatre feeling I'd seen something excellent and thought provoking. I can see the set in my head the stage divided into 3 zones lit in turn as we cut from scene to scene the trapped soldiers at the very front close to the audience where we can see their agony as they wait for death. It would make riveting and tense theatre in the right hands and could be very moving. And in the context of live performance it would be much more politically relevant and could even seem quite daring. But as a movie it just turned me off I felt battered to insensibility there wasn't an ounce of subtlety to it far too wordy worthy and preachy. And if Redford as director is trying to get his message over to the youth of America this is not the way to do it. This is preaching to the converted. Disengaged kids are not going to turn out in droves to see Meryl Streep and Robert Redford on a Friday night. I'm sorry but they are just not. And as for the Afghan mountain set with its atrocious lighting fake snow lame pyrotechnics and polystyrene boulders it reminded me of early Star Trek episodes where the rocks bounced off the actors. You can get away with minimalist representational sets in the theatre. In fact they are positively encouraged so we can concentrate on the performances. But live theatre and a movie are two different animals and here it just had me groaning at the cheapness. My husband loved it. Hmmmm.".

I'm Polish studying in US I appreciate good cinema and by this I mean intelligent movies that do more than just trick youcheat you into having a particular craftedstaged emotion. My comment was reported as abuse for reasons I don't understand. I have seen this movie I didn't like it and I didn't write this as a political rant. Quite honestly as culture gets more and more dumbed down and bubble gum like so do the socalled thought provoking movies. Compare this with any of the communismperiod Wajda work and you will see real multilayer moviemaking . This week I was able to get into the sneak preview of Tom Cruise's latest movie Lions for lambs. Now I can enjoy a good antiwar movie even if I don't agree with its' message. But this wasn't Platoon or the Deer hunter It didn't even have one tenth of the complexity of Munich. This movie felt like pure propaganda not provoking you to think but telling the viewer what to think. It didn't really bother with much of a plot and in my opinion was really insulting viewer's intelligence with how much it felt to spell out war is bad and Republicans lie. Running approx. 120 minutes it even conformed to the format of shock value propaganda movie. If anything it felt like those Donald Duck antiNazi cartoons Disney put out in the 1940's. It's not that I think a movie can't criticize this government I support the war in Iraq but I see and understand that someone might have a different view. This movie's only point is that no rationally thinking person would ever support the war in Iraq or Afghanistan and people do so only because they're duped by silver tongued Republicans. Tom Cruise plays the GOP spin doctor trying to sell the new Afghan strategy to a CNN caliber reporter Meryl Streep. This is the movie's weakest point. The characters mostly talk we have a reporter and a republican engaged professor and a lazy student trying to get him to care about things surrounding him and we have a story about young promising students who decide to enroll go to war and die. People with opposing views talk about patriotism and conservative characters are either exposed as liars or naive and dismissed. There is nothing wrong with talking but this picture I found to be very preachy. This movie can't seem to comprehend that there is no right and wrong in politics. We already know what people's opinions are anyway so there's nothing new to discover. The movie's only point is that Republicans lie and they know they are lying the Democrtats are on the side and good and light but are too lazy and preoccupied with making news about over the top celebritiesas movie hints with ending with shots of the entertainment headlines on a news network and a question what will you do? to call opponents' bluff and talk about how we're losing in Iraq. The producers believe that no reasonable person can think otherwise.There is not a single notion that this may come from fundamentally different views on the world and that people may have conflicting opinions and that's not unpatriotic or unjustified.The film claims to offer a fair view. It brings up some facts and views but quickly dismisses them if it doesn't fit the major premise. Republicans bad Democrats good. The movie also tries to manipulate by showing Streep driving down DC and seeing graves and the Memorial Monument from the car at the end. There is something really odd about her performance and very theatrical face expressions that felt like she's saying I'm Meryl Streep and I'm acting while the jelly Tom Cruise character looked as if he was about to jump on his sofa prosing his love for Katie Holmes. This is a very political movie but not in a way that's smart and witty. It's blunt and emotionally voidbut".

Robert Redford strikes me as someone who wants to make a difference and the problem is that the audience has become more deaf to reason than ever.Lions for Lambs is more of a filmed essay than a narrative feature and being a Kubrick fan I am all for changing the classic form of Hollywood narrative structure. This is a film based around ideas and exploring them to raise awareness that our own apathy will lead to our undoing as Americans. Let me invoke Batman Begins People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy...etc. So people won't get off their posteriors and respond to the chaos around them perhaps because there seems to be no direct connection to the news or as this film so brilliantly points out we change the channel. This film is a dramatic example of where we're going as a nation and what we're becoming as a people. I doubt anyone will listen but I applaud the filmmakers for at least making an attempt. This film presents the facts pretty much up to the minute from many angles and yes even the Republicans get a sympathetic view of their strategy. Whose fault is it that the economy is in a downward spiral? It's all too easy to point the finger at the Bush administration and leave it at that but what about the media?

V for Vendetta another film centered around powerful ideas that didn't have nearly the impact it should have said People shouldn't be afraid of their governments governments should be afraid of their people.

	schema:reviewBody "LIONS FOR LAMBS 2007 starring Tom Cruise Meryl Streep and Robert Redford directed by Robert RedfordIn Robert Redford's excellent Lions for Lambs Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise playing a liberal journalist and a Republican senator respectively sit in a Washington office and have a conversation for around an hour. There isn't necessarily anything overtly cinematic about these scenes it is just two people sitting in a room talking about the senator's new counterterrorism policy. And yet masterfully there is something incredibly cathartic about their conversation as if these twoa couple of the greatest stars of our generationare saying things that we have all been thinking and yet haven't been said. I could have sat in that theater with rapt attention for hours if I could have been promised that their diatribe would have continued with such intellectual deftness as a breathtaking battle between the two major American ideological forces of our time. Of course this dialogue did not take up the entire film andperhapsit is better than it did not. Reaching for the hyperlink feel of movies like Crash and Babel director Redford imbues the film with two other plot lines one involves Redford himself as a college professor trying to motivate a goneawry but intelligent student and the other dealing with two soldiers both former students of Redford who upon graduation decided to enlist in the Army and were sent to Afghanistan. Redford's section is at least an effective callout to the collegiate generation to stand up and get involved with the future of America but the scenes involving the two soldiers played with minimal exertion by Derek Luke and Michael Pena serve only to put an emotional face on the political conflicts of the film. While those scenes are effective tearjerkers they are also heavyhanded.But again the rest of the film serves only to magnify the brilliance of the scenes involving Cruise and Streep. As Cruise continues to outline his new strategy to ensure victory is Afghanistan Streep bombards him with parallels to Vietnam as he questions her patriotism and how eager the media was to sell the war in Iraq she responds with the painful admission that maybe her ideals had been compromised. All of this is played with an air of winknudge friendliness that is both incredibly intriguing and slightly perturbing. These are two masterclass actors at the top of their game and to watch them engage in such a verbal and political toil is exhilarating. The icing on the cake is a scene at the end of the film where Streep confronts her news producer about what she had gleamed from the interview with the senator. She believes that Cruise is leading the country into a dangerous and deadly situation her producer is eager only to use her reporting as news bites on the network's newscrawler. What she says during this debate is not only an acerbic assassination of the modern corporate news industry but phenomenal acting. I'm not usually an ardent fan of Streep as an actress but here is a role when she is in a level all of her own. She merits any praise and awards consideration that is driven her way.That is a problem for the film though. The performances especially from Streep and Cruise outclass the film itself. While it tries to be a simple getoutanddosomething message picture its highwattage stars light up and steal the screen. The message still gets across but one has to wonder if Redford's full aspirations for the film are at least somewhat overshadowed. Still Lions for Lambs doesn't take sides and allows a spirited debate of the state of American politics. It even allows you to forget all of Tom Cruise's personal issues and allows him to escape his media persona. Any film that can do that merits some serious respect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Awful is too harsh a word for this unappetizing mess but it is certainly a train wreck of a movie. Other adjectives come to mind didactic will be used in about half of professional reviews. Unfortunate is another which is a kind way of saying bad. The film would have us believe that everything we're seeing in three different locations is taking place at the same time and pretty much in real time. That would be clever if plausible but in this cause the conceit seems simply contrived. The claustrophobic nature of the movie maybe half the film has two people on camera at once makes it seem as though it were a play and a badly written one at that. There is a certain something to the fx and it's not a good thing it seems as though several parts were shot in video and then spliced on to the rest. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it were intended but I don't think it is and it's jarring. There are some other implausible parts of the film which I can't mention here but in a film that tries to be tight having the audience go Whoa how did that happen! is not a good thing. Redford is great on camera we like to look at him he has a great voice and his eyes still have that remarkable defining quality that makes this guy The Robert Redford not just another actor. But Cruise is on autopilot which seems to be all he has left anyway. For him it's all smoke and mirrors and there is no there there any more if there ever was. Streep is fine though I don't think she wears this role very well. For those expecting another Devil Wears Prada sort of performance you'll have to wait. This is not that. It's too bad. I don't think this movie will persuade anyone and make no mistake this movie was intended to Sway Public Opinion. But if that's the case the people who imagined this film got it wrong from the outset because the people who would be drawn to seeing this movie are much smarter than the authors think they are and you can't talk down to people more clever than you.".

	schema:headline " A Learning Experience About Yourself Not Liberal Propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "As I'm sure everyone knows this movie is about the war in Iraq. It shows 3 conversations between reporter and politician student and teacher and two soldiers. If you want to understand what has taken place the past couple of years in the U.S. this movie can explain it to you very easily. It is not political propaganda like everyone likes to say it is a lesson about yourself and the decisions you make. It simply states that choosing do something about a situation is better than not doing anything at all. It does state that the war in Iraq is wrong but it does not bash it into your brain that would be propaganda.One great aspect of this movie was the acting. Great performances all around from Tom Cruise to Merry Streep and back around to the the director himself Robert Redford. Tom Cruise played so great he almost convinced me of what he was saying and I am a liberal. He played as if he was a politician himself. He seemed to be committed to the role he was playing and he to me was Oscar worthy. Merryl Streep displayed the problems of the media today. How they are hypocritical and contradict themselves first going along with what the government says without questioning and then criticizing them. This movie shows that all that the news goal now is no longer telling the truth but getting ratings and money any which way they can no matter if what they presents is fact or fiction. I think Merrly Streep role shows how T.V. and money have forced everyone to settle and cave into what everything the government has to say and there indifference to it. I found this to be the most interesting part of the movie. Robert Redford's role showed the problems that are occurring in this generation. He showed that the people from this generation are just willing to settle for what they have sort of like the media instead of taking action in some form or another. Whether it is protesting or even going to Iraq. It also showed that before the U.S. supposedly save the world from terrorism we need need solve the major problems we have here. Like education and making sure future generations won't have to deal with the problems we have today. There was also a conversation between Derek Luke and Michael Pena while they were trapped in the mountains in Afghanistan while trying survive an attack. I think the point of this part of the movie was to show that if we don't do anything to stop violence in the world hardworking intelligent people won't be around.Let me start of by saying once again that this movie is not liberal propaganda. It does though say something about the war in Iraq though. For many of you foreigners out their I hope you don't think that every American is the way you picture us to be. They're some of us here who strongly disagree with the war in Iraq. Some of us can see that corruption is at its highest level in U.S. history. For other Americans who are reading this do your homework and look at what is happening in our country. Look I understand why people are saying that this movie is too preachy and find it boring. For that I have two thongs to say Don't watch the movie or educate yourself better and try not to be fooled by what the government says. One documentary that could really help is Why We Fight. This one is filled with facts so you can't really use the word propaganda with this one. Still what are you Europeans doing about it. All you guys do is talk and criticize America about how it controls everything. Before you criticize my country why don't you look at yours and see what they are doing to help the world become a better place. I hope everyone understands that this movie is pointed at Iraq but it is mostly pointed towards ourselves. I tries to tell us that in any fight war conflict or event you need to try to make a difference even if it does not work out. Trying is the most important part of it. The ends don't justify the means. This points the finger at everyone who complains and does not do anything. It tells you to wake up from the idea that America is always right and never makes mistakes. Do something about it. Isn't that what people are obligated to to support one another and to do what is right. So when you insult this movie you are not insulting the movie cast or the director but yourself and what it is to be a person. When you watch this get past the criticism of Iraq and look at yourself and think what am I doing to make this whole situation better.".

	schema:headline " I may agree but that doesn't excuse poor filmmaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen a number of truly horrible films that are supposedly provocative or tackling the hard issues recently. I watched The Kingdom the other day for example. As it turns out it was written by the same writer of Lions for Lambs Matthew Michael Carnahan. I'm suspecting a trend.Why I didn't like it 1. Bad performances from good actors. Dare I say it? Meryl Streep was terrible. I see better acting daytoday in the intermediate acting class I teach. When you give a good actress a bad part she will fail in it. Her only real contribution to the role was the slightly humorous line she appeared to have coachedimprovised in the TV station. Robert Redford was as dreary and predictable as his part was written. Perhaps he was too tired from directing this terrible personal politics statement to make nuanced decisions. Instead he played this with the nuance and expertise of a young Schwarzenegger. The only solid performance was by Tom Cruise who had the best part in the film. Why is this? Because the writer didn't have to write anything. Carnahan could just Google up some rightwing rhetoric and slap it on the page with minor adjustments that my playwriting 103 students could do in two days.2. The writing was cheesy and illadvised. What I thought was going to be a provoking political thriller was actually a sad pseudofilm pseudohistorical fiction docudrama with very little to say that everyone not just the learned has heard before. Some scenes read as smoothly as a 60s recruitment video or an afterschool special. The whole film had definite elements of it in that it was blatant in its moral statements to the point of Robert Redford walking up to me and saying Don't trust the right wing. War is bad. I agree with that statement but the film the message is conveyed in must be good or at least passable. When the writing seemed so pushed into pseudorealism that I'm sure the studio demanded it created an unfortunate choice for me as an audience member Should I suspend my disbelief so far as to demean myself or should I just be put off that I'm not getting my ten dollars back?3. There is no emotion in the film. The wealthy college student shows apathy the two poor kids show misguided courage and determination the college professor is like a dull version of Olmos in Stand and Deliver but for political science. The young gun Republican is evil the reporter rediscovers her integrity her boss cares about ratings washrinserepeat for 88 minutes. The problem is all of these characters are so stock we encounter these people over and over again in films and in real life. This was such a student film. It'll hopefully get put away on the unreachable top shelf of the local store.4. Disproportionate praise of the troops. Redford obviously wants to support the troops by bringing them home. In the film Americans are heroes who overcome incredible odds and are willing to fight for the freedom and the blah blah blah. I wholeheartedly believe in care and emotional support for troops but the film just drooled over them like gods.Why I liked the film Summer Hernandez Kowalski when you see her onscreen. That's it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen a number of truly horrible films that are supposedly provocative or tackling the hard issues recently. I watched The Kingdom the other day for example. As it turns out it was written by the same writer of Lions for Lambs Matthew Michael Carnahan. I'm suspecting a trend.Why I didn't like it 1. Bad performances from good actors. Dare I say it? Meryl Streep was terrible. I see better acting daytoday in the intermediate acting class I teach. When you give a good actress a bad part she will fail in it. Her only real contribution to the role was the slightly humorous line she appeared to have coachedimprovised in the TV station. Robert Redford was as dreary and predictable as his part was written. Perhaps he was too tired from directing this terrible personal politics statement to make nuanced decisions. Instead he played this with the nuance and expertise of a young Schwarzenegger. The only solid performance was by Tom Cruise who had the best part in the film. Why is this? Because the writer didn't have to write anything. Carnahan could just Google up some rightwing rhetoric and slap it on the page with minor adjustments that my playwriting 103 students could do in two days.2. The writing was cheesy and illadvised.

He is old and looks weak but he carries the movie like a true champion. He makes empty dialog sound meaningful and implausible scenarios seem poignant well almost poignant.Lugosi's I have no home monolog is beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since The Golden Turkey Awards chose Ed Wood as the world's worst director back in the 80s there have been a lot of people who automatically dismiss all Ed Wood movies as garbage. Even Tim Burton's terrific 'Ed Wood' has encouraged this. My opinion is that there are many many worse directors out there because at least Wood's movies were fun and entertaining unlike many of those made by the likes of  Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay directors who are able to work with budgets a 1000 times bigger than Wood I might add! 'Bride Of The Monster' is one of Wood's most underrated movies. It was his second movie to star horror legend Bela Lugosi but unlike the first the truly mind blowing 'Glen Or Glenda' it isn't completely inept. True some of the acting is terrible especially the talentless leading lady Loretta King who is I admit it lousy and Wood regular Paul Marco who has a small supporting role as a cop. But and this is a BIG but Lugosi is terrific. Many fans regard this as his best performance. I wouldn't go that far but it's hard not to get choked up at Lugosi's immortal I have no home speech. 'Bride Of The Monster' is the first Wood film to feature the amazing Tor Johnson. He plays Lugosi's Tibetan servantslave Lobo. All the scenes with Lobo are great fun to watch especially when Lugosi whips him. Apart from Lugosi and Tor this movie is best remembered for the rubber octopus monster. Of course it's a hoot but the rest of the picture isn't anywhere near as bad as many claim and is comparable to say 'The Devil Bat' which Lugosi starred in back in the 1940s. Both movies suffer from their minuscule budgets but both are still worth watching to see Lugosi struggle for greatness. I recommend 'Bride Of The Monster' to all horror fans especially those of Bela Lugosi.".

When we watch an Ed Wood's film we know that it will be a movie full of flaws. But why do we like him so much? Because since Tim Burton promoted this director he became a cult personality. Therefore it is very unfair and almost unacceptable the IMDB User Rating of 2.8 for this movie. There are unbelievable mistakes in framing and edition such as for example about 36 minutes running time we can see the microphone over the heads of Janet and Dr. Vornoff. The performance of the cast is so ridiculous that becomes really funny. The motionless octopus in the lake' is also funny. And what about the screenplay a kind of Frankenstein meeting the Loch Ness monster with hilarious dialogs? This movie is a great entertainment to see the courage of a brave director lover of cinema but without any skill. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Noiva do Monstro' The Bride of the Monster'".

Sure it's cheap the acting is horrible the sets wobble if sneezed upon and the special effects consist of stock footage and a rubber octopus but Bride of the Monster is much MUCH better than Plan 9 From Outer Space. Mad scientist Vornoff a sickly Bela Lugosi has apparently set up shop in the Florida Everglades kidnapping anyone unwise enough to wander too close to his house and his pet octopus and conducting sinister experiments upon them. Vornoff for some odd reason is determined to create a race of super giants with incredible strength. We're never really sure exactly WHY he wants to do this but one can only assume that if one possesses an army of super strong giants one could take over the world and rule it and stuff. That seems to be the goal of every other mad scientist in the unruled world anyway. Into this diabolical plan stumbles loudmouthed newsgirl Loretta King who is determined to get the story on the Lake Marsh Monster. Whether the title of Lake Marsh Monster refers to the octopus Tor Johnson as the fumbling Lobo or Bela's drug problem we're never sure. Take your pick. Anyway Loretta is kept under constant hypnosis by Bela's eyebags and is slated to become The Bride of the Monster! By this point we're all quite ready to see the annoying Loretta fried to a crisp but unfortunately her wimpy boyfriend shows up to save her. The stunning climax is packed full of raging Lobo's rolling boulders lightening bolts gunfire and death by octopus! The story doesn't make much sense but were you really expecting it to when you saw Ed Wood's name listed under the title of director? Still and all it's certainly Wood's most coherent effort and can be entertaining for those of us who stop to look at road accidents.".

Bela Lugosi and Tor Johnson are terribly overacting in this!Also it's too bad about the octopus scene's. It all was terrible fake and the use of archive footage was done horribly.The dialog and characters are the best Wood has ever written. Even though they are far from supreme they work very well in the movie. Wood even manages to come up with some memorable quotes.This movie really doesn't deserve such a low rating and my guess is that more than halve the people who have rated this movie poorly had not even seen this movie but just rated it low because it's an Ed Wood movie. Be fair people! I recognize a bad movie when I see one and this movie most certainly is not bad!Even if you're not familiar with Wood's work but are a fan of classic horror movie's you'll appreciate this movie.

It turns out very early in the movie we're shown that a Dr. Eric Vornoff Bela Lugosi with the help of his hulking assistant Lobo Tor Johnson have been kidnapping people in the woods around Lake Marsh and using them in experiments. The trouble is that Dr. Vornoff's experiments haven't been working out like he planned them to with those who he's experimenting on ending up dead.One afternoon at the local police station a prof.

The Soviet Government feeling that Dr.Vornoff was mad and ran him out of the country. Now it seems that they realized that Dr.Vornoff was on to something big and they want him back so they sent Strowski to the USA to fetch him and bring him home.Dr. Vornoff feeling insulted and condescended too instead tells Strowski to get lost that his plans for an army of atomic supermen is for his own purposes not for any country much less the Soviet Union who threw him out and stripped him of all his honors and accomplishments. It's then when Strowski pulls out a gun and tells Vornoff that his government ordered him to bring him back. Lobo sneaks up on Strowski and grabs him from behind then throws him into a water tank where he's killed by a giant octopus.Meanwhile Janet who's Lt.

George Becwar was more then adequate as the cagey and obsessed prof. Strowski trying to get Dr. Vornoff back home to the USSR to help in their nuclear research. You can say that the movie was awful only because director Ed Wood didn't have the money to make it more extravagant. Ed had to relay on cheap sets and props and in some places in the film add in stock footage.

The weird thing is even though this is a bad movie again you can't hate Ed Wood for it because he put a lot of passion into it. Also this was one of his better films while it could be a bit dull at times and over the top fake with that octopus monster he had a good story that with a bit of patching could have been a really decent scifi flick. But how could I dismiss Ed Wood? This was his baby he and Bela Legosi put so much love into this movie. Bella proves that he still has that strong presence on screen. I'm so glad that he had more screen time than what was written originally it shows such a precious time in his life where when you think he would have fallen still in his typecast of horror movies he could still deliver a great speech with such honor. Bride of the Monster offers silliness and a not so scary monster but nevertheless what else could you want from an Ed Wood movie? It was the 1950's after all and he was just trying to make a name for himself with this script.Dr. Eric Vornoff is experimenting with nuclear power with the help of his mute assistant Lobo. His goal is to eventually create an army of super soldiers that he will use to conquer the earth. Their residence an old mansion is guarded by a giant octopus of Dr. Vornoff's own creation which lives in the surrounding swamp. The Octopus has been responsible for the deaths of local townspeople. Newspaper reporter Janet Lawton investigates further becoming a prisoner of Dr. Vornoff in the process. The police eventually follow led by lieutenant Dick Craig who is also Lawton's boyfriend. Meanwhile an official from Dr. Vornoff's home country Professor Strowksi arrives and tries to persuade him to return to their homeland in hopes that his research will benefit their nation. However Strowski is killed and Lobo unwittingly turns Dr. Vornoff into an atomicpowered superhuman being.I absolutely love the ending with a passion I loved the out of no where explosion that also happened to be a nuclear bomb that somehow didn't effect anyone. The silly effects that were also offered I found it hilarious that Bela Legosi's character couldn't operate his own machine that he built but the minute that his deformed side kick operates it it works for him just fine. The only flaw that I found with this movie is that there are times where it could be a bit dull and felt a little dragged on. With Plan 9 you never got that because as silly as it was it never stopped entertaining you. So like I said while this was Ed Wood's better film it just seemed like we had to wait a while before any fun action scenes. But if you like Ed Wood or goofy movies I definitely would recommend this one it's not as silly as some of his other films but you'll get a great kick out of people wrestling with the octopus. Gotta give those actors credit no CGI back then only a silly doll to play dead with.610".

However Strowski is killed and Lobo unwittingly turns Dr. Vornoff into an atomicpowered superhuman being.I absolutely love the ending with a passion I loved the out of no where explosion that also happened to be a nuclear bomb that somehow didn't effect anyone. The silly effects that were also offered I found it hilarious that Bela Legosi's character couldn't operate his own machine that he built but the minute that his deformed side kick operates it it works for him just fine. The only flaw that I found with this movie is that there are times where it could be a bit dull and felt a little dragged on. With Plan 9 you never got that because as silly as it was it never stopped entertaining you. So like I said while this was Ed Wood's better film it just seemed like we had to wait a while before any fun action scenes. But if you like Ed Wood or goofy movies I definitely would recommend this one it's not as silly as some of his other films but you'll get a great kick out of people wrestling with the octopus. Gotta give those actors credit no CGI back then only a silly doll to play dead with.610";

He stars as an evil mad scientist and he is assisted by his henchman Tor Johnson both of which are ALSO in Plan 9. I really don't remember that much of the plotjust the silliness of the movie and the ending where Lugosi wrestles with a giant rubber octopus or squid. According to Michael Medved the creature was to have been animated but the motor broke.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the place to look. After Glen Or Glenda? failed to attract any offers of bigstudio financing Ed financed this entire film himself and filmed it entirely without oversight. The fact that he was clearly less than competent to do all of these tasks himself utterly failed to dissuade anyone involved from seeing the thing through to completion and the result is that we have this cinematic turkey to laugh at for all time. Wood bless him was so enthusiastic about making films that he never bothered to try and learn his craft or test his ideas to see if they would work in the finished product. As a consequence all of his effects are symbolic and utterly laughable. When he wants a character to manipulate lab equipment he will direct an actor to wildly gesticulate in front of a set that looks like a random collection of dials and lights stuck to a board. Making it all the funnier is that his actors are so clueless to his incompetence or so captivated by his imagination that they deliver a stupefyingly earnest performance.The plot of Bride Of The Monster is as ridiculous as anything else to have been written by Ed Wood but in a sort of charming way it works. The documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood explains in some segments that Wood's bestknown work Plan 9 From Outer Space is widely watched because in addition to the reputation it has as a completely insane film it also has a smattering of legitimately effective scenes or shots. That is definitely the case with Bride Of The Monster. Scenes like Bela Lugosi's I have no home speech or Loretta King's quick chat with the file clerk demonstrate a knack for composition and spacing that would have served Wood quite well if he had been able to reign in his apparent belief in shooting everything in one take even if that take shows the set wobbling. Another quote about Plan 9 that definitely applies here is that no matter what time you watch Bride Of The Monster at it always feels as if you are sitting in front of your television at four in the morning.Lugosi plays a mad scientist named Eric Vornoff who is attempting to create a superstrength zombie through the use of a table some straps a powerful lamp and some kind of electric playtoy. In the swamp around his mansion people have been going missing with alarming regularity prompting a detective to poke his nose into the area's goingson. Contrary to the impression given by Tim Burton's biopic Tony McCoy is not that bad an actor although you will not be surprised to learn he only ever acted in one film and a TV episode after Bride Of The Monster. In fact the acting in this particular film is much better than is usually the case for Wood productions although that is not saying a lot. Loretta King speaks all of her lines as if she is reading from cue cards and Dolores Fuller makes it plainly obvious she would rather be anywhere but on the office set. But the real prize for bad acting comes from George Becwar as Professor Vladimir Strowski who has the apparent objective of taking Vornoff home by any means necessary. Whether Vornoff likes it or not. If one ever needed proof that Bela Lugosi was the most talented person to cross Ed Wood's path this scene is it.Wood's enthusiasm for incorporating stock footage into his films both benefits and hinders him this time. The octopus stock footage is blended with his footage of what is clearly an octopus dummy to an effect that is both hilarious and rather sad. Watching Bela Lugosi battle with an octopus that he is clearly moving himself is enough to make one feel pretty sorry for the old guy. Exactly why producer Donald McCoy felt the need to end the film with a nuclear explosion is anyone's guess but Wood obliges him with stock footage that not only doesn't come close to matching the rest of the film but also raises the question of how our heroes survived. Wood's problem as a director was not so much that he was incompetent or had ambitions too great for his ability. No his real problem was that he was utterly blind to when his stock footage or effects shots simply were not working. A good filmmaker like Verhoeven or Lucas would arrange their shots and editing to either cover their mistakes or let the audience's imagination take over. Wood just showed his blunders warts and all.Amazingly Bride Of The Monster achieved financial success when first released to theatres in 1955. Combined with Wood's documented excessive enthusiasm this does a lot to explain why Wood was so enthusiastic to get another film in production. Although he made two short films between this and Plan 9 it took another two years for him to get what was then a featurelength film wrapped. That's another peculiarity of Wood's productions  none of them reached so much as a ninety minute length. In today's filmmaking world where studios will insert excessive scenes just to get a film up to an unspoken minimum length nobody will ever accuse Wood's of outlasting their welcome. And that is probably one of the saddest things about Wood's story. Even though he never fit into the system in place during the 1950s he would have even more difficulty fitting into the studio system of today. He dared to take on subjects that others considered taboo and wasn't made creatively impotent by focus group meetings.I gave Bride Of The Monster a one out of ten. It is incompetent on every level yet so endearing. Watch it with a group of friends make it a MSTstyle night and you will have a blast.".

In fact the acting in this particular film is much better than is usually the case for Wood productions although that is not saying a lot. Loretta King speaks all of her lines as if she is reading from cue cards and Dolores Fuller makes it plainly obvious she would rather be anywhere but on the office set. But the real prize for bad acting comes from George Becwar as Professor Vladimir Strowski who has the apparent objective of taking Vornoff home by any means necessary. Whether Vornoff likes it or not. If one ever needed proof that Bela Lugosi was the most talented person to cross Ed Wood's path this scene is it.Wood's enthusiasm for incorporating stock footage into his films both benefits and hinders him this time. The octopus stock footage is blended with his footage of what is clearly an octopus dummy to an effect that is both hilarious and rather sad. Watching Bela Lugosi battle with an octopus that he is clearly moving himself is enough to make one feel pretty sorry for the old guy. Exactly why producer Donald McCoy felt the need to end the film with a nuclear explosion is anyone's guess but Wood obliges him with stock footage that not only doesn't come close to matching the rest of the film but also raises the question of how our heroes survived. Wood's problem as a director was not so much that he was incompetent or had ambitions too great for his ability. No his real problem was that he was utterly blind to when his stock footage or effects shots simply were not working. A good filmmaker like Verhoeven or Lucas would arrange their shots and editing to either cover their mistakes or let the audience's imagination take over. Wood just showed his blunders warts and all.Amazingly Bride Of The Monster achieved financial success when first released to theatres in 1955. Combined with Wood's documented excessive enthusiasm this does a lot to explain why Wood was so enthusiastic to get another film in production. Although he made two short films between this and Plan 9 it took another two years for him to get what was then a featurelength film wrapped. That's another peculiarity of Wood's productions  none of them reached so much as a ninety minute length. In today's filmmaking world where studios will insert excessive scenes just to get a film up to an unspoken minimum length nobody will ever accuse Wood's of outlasting their welcome. And that is probably one of the saddest things about Wood's story. Even though he never fit into the system in place during the 1950s he would have even more difficulty fitting into the studio system of today. He dared to take on subjects that others considered taboo and wasn't made creatively impotent by focus group meetings.I gave Bride Of The Monster a one out of ten. It is incompetent on every level yet so endearing. Watch it with a group of friends make it a MSTstyle night and you will have a blast.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Wood Jnr has often been cited as the worst director of all time and his filmsPlan 9 From Outer Space especially also get a similar reputation. I personally think that the distinction is unfair there are certainly better directors than Wood and better made written and acted filmsmovies out there of course but unlike something like anything Friedberg and Seltzer Wood's films are entertaining and kind of like guilty pleasures. Great movies no they're not but when someone says that they are among the worst of all time I'll respectfully disagree on that one. Bride of the Monster does have things wrong the sets are wobbly the special effects especially the octopus are fake the story does drag at times and Loretta King displays no kind of acting talent whatsoever. Paul Murco's small role is also rather embarrassing Even with these Bride of the Monster is still one of Ed Wood Jnr's better movies. Wood is never going to be up there with the greatest directors but not the worst either at least he directed with heart. Lugosi's fight with the octopus is absolutely hilarious and has to be seen with be believed easily one of the memorable scenes of any of Ed Wood's movies. The dialogue has some very funny momentsof what I can remember only the final line really made me groan but the I have no home monologue is really quite poignant. The ending is senseless indeed but a lot of fun and while the story does drag at times and also a little senseless I didn't ever feel my intelligence being insulted to unbearable degreeunlike the SyFyAsylum movies. The acting is not amazing but King was the only one really that came across as really really bad. Tony McCoy is handsome and does manage to give some of his lines credibility and Harvey B.Dunn is very amusing. Tor Johnson is somewhat stiff but looks the part of a monster figure and he does provide some of the movie's most entertaining scenes. But it is really Bela Lugosi's movie in his final role he gives a commanding and heartfelt performance succeeding also in giving moments of banality some genuine meaning. Overall not great but better than I expected it to be. 610 Bethany Cox".

He is trying to create a race of super humans but he keeps killing people as his experiments continue to fail. Ed Wood perennial player Tor Johnson portrays Lobo his assistant. Let's just say the menacing Lobo is a few french fries short of a Happy Meal.Dr. Vornoff is hiding out in an abandoned old house in the woods complete with the mad scientist laboratory and a pond outside complete with a giant rubber octopus.The movie would be a total mess except for Bela Lugosi. He actually gives a wonderful performance especially given the limitations he had to work with i.e. cheapola sets having to wrestle the giant octopus etc. His speech where he says Home? I have no home... shows the shades of the brilliant actor that captivated fans 30 years before when he performed Dracula on Broadway. Despite the terrible material he had to work with Bela rises above everything and shows the true professional he really was. He is frail and looks old but he still retained the essence that made him a star.I feel this movie isn't any worse than many of the cheapie movies that studios were cranking out in the 1950's.

Before they can Vornoff's idiotic servant Lobo Tor Johnson creeps up behind them and sends them running back into the swamp. There Mac and Jake are attacked by Vornoff's monstrous creation that lives there a giant octopus. Lobo manages to retrieve one of the men and take him back to Vornoff's laboratory where Vornoff sticks a siv with three spark plugs stuck to the top on his head. Vornoff then shines a light in his face which proves fatal. Vornoff bemoans yet another failed experiment. Captain of homicide Tom Robbins Harvey B. Dunn calls Lieutenant Dick Craig Tony McCoy into his office to discuss the disappearance of twelve men near Lake Marsh. Lt. Craig says he has nothing to go on when his fianc who works as a journalist Janet Lawton Loretta King walks into Robbins office. Janet feels the police aren't doing everything they can so she decides to do some investigating of her own much to the displeasure of Lt. Craig and Captain Robbins. After some research Janet drives out to Lake Marsh but crashes her car in a violent thunder storm and is kidnapped by Lobo. Back at headquarters Captain Robbins and Lt. Craig talk to the leading authority on Prehistoric monsters Professor Vladimir Strowski George Becwar who convinces them that the legends of a monster surrounding the swamps may be true and along with Lt. Craig and his partner Detective Marty Martin Don Nagel decides to head out to the swamps to check things out.

Once at the swamp Lt. Craig finds Janet's abandoned car with her nowhere to be seen. Will Lt. Craig be able to solve the mystery and rescue his fianc Janet before she becomes Vornoff's latest experiment? Or will he end up octopus food?Written and directed by Edwood D. Wood Jr. I thought this film was nowhere near as bad as it's reputation suggests. In fact I was impressed with it considering all the negative things I had heard. Don't misunderstand me as it certainly isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but as a decent fun silly and entertaining 50's monster film I quite liked it. It moves along at a fair pace and at under 70 minutes it doesn't outstay it's welcome but it did start to drag a little in the middle but it picked up again towards the end. The dialogue although stupid at times isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's simple and basic but coherent. Obviously there are 'bad' bits in the film Vornoff's lab for instance is just a simple set with the stonework and bricks painted onto the walls to give the impression of an old Gothic dungeon. There is the odd continuity error and the special effects for the giant octopus are truly terrible plus the octopus isn't really in it enough just a somewhat measly three times. The black and white photography by Ted Allan and William C. Thompson is simple but clean and crisp at least you can see whats going on all the time which is all I was hoping for. Lugosi puts in a decent performance Johnson is absolutely awful and he can hardly walk straight much less act and Dunn as Robbins is actually quite funny in a couple of scenes particularly when he questions the old woman in the records office. I really don't think this film deserves to be in the bottom 100 I've seen many film much worse than this fairly innocent fun and at times charming little 50's effort from Edward D. Wodd Jr.! Difficult to recommend for casual viewers but definitely worth a watch if you like these types of films.".

That said Bride of the Monster should certainly still please fans of bad psychotronic cinema. And along with Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 From Outer Space would make excellent complementary viewing alongside Tim Burton's masterful biopic Ed Wood.The story is suitably ridiculous and not really worth going into. And it's not 100 obvious what the title actually means. Loretta King's character is clearly supposed to be the bride but there are two completely separate monsters and neither of them particularly appears to be the groom. One of the monsters is played by a stock footage octopus that turns hilariously into an inanimate giant prop in a puddle when attacking various members of the cast. The second monster is played by the one and only Tor Johnson as a character called Lobo who is the sidekick of Bela Lugosi's Dr. Eric Vornoff. Lugosi is a lot of fun in this and despite the film's cruddiness it's not a terrible showcase for him. Ironically his turn in this ultracheap notorious movie has become one of his most iconic. He gets to say his famous 'I have no home' speech that was made famous in Burton's movie and the sight of him whipping Tor into action in his cardboard? laboratory is both funny and highly memorable. In general the acting is not as bad as is typical for a Wood film although Dolores Fuller is as usual gloriously rubbish in her small role as the secretary  her short conversation with Loretta King is truly a nonacting masterclass.It goes without saying that Bride of the Monster is not a film for everyone.

His talent exceeds even those of his US counterparts. Sener Sen is quite the actor as usual. It's always an honor to see him perform. A new face adding balance to the storyline was Okan Yalabik.

When Yavuz Turgul literally enliven the Turkish Cinema with the movie Eskiya The Bandit in 1996 Sener Sen had proved how high caliber actor he is. Now maybe due to too much expectation we're a little bit put off by the flaws in the story line but still enjoyed the movie.If you asked me what saved the movie I would easily say that acting of Sener Sen and Cetin Tekindor Battal. Speaking of acting Cem Ymaz kind of pulled the role and doesn't look odd or incapable but he still has some work to do on this.The weakest point with the movie is the story itself unfortunately. Yavuz Turgul being both the writer and the director obviously wanted to make an emotional movie which always works with Turkish audience but tried to wrap it with police flick clichs. I don't know if he sees that as his own way of directing but after 14 years since Eskiya we see same weak action scenes in Av Mevsimi. And there we can count many scenes that don't fit the bill like the party scene where Cem Yilmaz signs or agony of the apprentice played by Okan Yalabik after each body they confront.But as I said when you are watching a murder and who is the murderer movieyou always questioning the plot naturally. While watching Av Mevsimi we had plenty of why and hows as well as hey give me a break! moments. Battal's fake marriage seems unnecessary and why he cuts the girl into pieces and then drops one hand on his way is an unsolved mystery... By the way this cutoff hand almost put into the camera the very beginning of the movie and it looked so fake that rise eye brows of some skeptic movie goers.So Yavuz Turgul came up with a hard to buy story but has chosen the very best of the cast and high grade camwork resulted an OK movie.Maybe I'm being a bit stingy with 6 points with the movie but let's say this is a well deserved 6 than easy got 7.".

But unfortunately the illogical script and the 'refined' dialogues makes this an utter failure. It was like watching the screenplay being recited something which becomes unbearable after half an hour or something. The dialogues do not sound authentic at all they are more like a translation from English. Just one example will suffice The veteran homicide detective answers a call by the medical examiner saying 'give me some good news' in Turkish a phrase that I have never heard a Turk utter ever. There are so many plot holes and unrealistic scenes like smalltime drug dealers with semiautomatic weapons shooting randomly at police... come onbut what is more frustrating is the lack of character development for a movie that presents itself as a character study rather than a mere thriller.We never really understand why f.e. our main character 'hunter' is indeed called hunter. It is said many times that he is a legend in the homicide department because well he hunts the killers and always catches them. But in this case he really never does anything. He spots a car that they are looking for from 10 meters and recognizes a 500000  worth shotgun after recently seeing it and in the remaining time wanders aimlessly and ask questions that lead to nowhere. The writing is not different for his partner 'deli' either. He actually shows no interest in the case throughout the whole movie even being scolded by his boss the 'hunter' for his lack of interest. But out of the blue this casethe very same case he never seems to take serious becomes to be the last straw in his demise. So there is no point in assessing the cast because no one could really pull of some genuine acting given such pretentious dialogues and ludicrous screenplay. And the final scene where all the plot is dictated by monologues well let me just say that it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewers.".

Besides some certain wrong connotations and wrong ways of acting the movie's overall fluctuating search for a rhythm make me said this. What you expect from a police thriller is tension and curiosity but I've lost both in the middle of the movie. The story of the homicide policemen took its place in the core and I forgot the story of late Pamuk. The good part of the movie was its uniqueness while Turkish cinema followers are not familiar to watch such genre in Turkish Cinema. I hope it'd be a good start and the level goes up every time. For Turgul I hope there will be another masterpiece in two years. For Sener Sen there is not much to say however in the start the preaching part seems so artificial it seems Sen is reading from a prompter but for the rest he's the best. Cem Ylmaz is still striving to become an actor but he's done a good job also especially the sad moments. For the rest of the cast there seems not so brilliant acting to me. In conclusion the movie is worth watching for Sener Sen and for its being unique for Turkish Cinema. And if you want to enjoy it more forget it's a Yavuz Turgul movie than you'll expect less.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an attempt to create a modern Turkish detective movie which also aims to demonstrate a moody atmosphere. There's almost no Turkish detective movie to trace back that would help us to compare so we can assume this movie tries to accommodate an approach. It's not an easy task since our view is hugely affected by Hollywood movies. The movie indicates Turkish lifestyle traditions relationships and death.The very thing you might appreciate about this film is probably acting  but not the acting by minor characters. Cem Yilmaz in particular exhibits the most notable performance in this movie. Other major characters' performances vary from almost good to so so. Minor characters' performances are generally below so so with some exceptions.While the plot is not the strongest aspect of this movie the revealing of the story makes things a little more mediocre. You may even sense the atmosphere is crumbling beyond a point. Nevertheless there are no unnatural absurdities no unnecessary exaggerations and no forced heroes. Some of the nuances and references are amusing or interesting and they're enhancing the experience.The genre is somewhat new for Turkish cinema. What do I mean? First of all expectations should not be high. And second introducing a movie in an unexplored genre makes things interesting makes it a different experience. Yes there are so many better movies from Turkish cinema from Yavuz Turgul or from this genre. But just don't keep your expectancies too high you may actually enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Av Mevsimi Hunting Season is in certain terms as good as a production can get in Turkey great cast great cinematography great sets state of the art technology unfortunately though the great production could not be translated into a good movie. Yavuz Turgul is a masterful screenwriter the best in Turkish cinema history for sure. He knows his mathematics very well. He was time and again proved this since Muhsin Bey. There is no hole in his scripts which is impossible for other Turkish films and scripts that contain more holes than swiss cheese. Mr Turgul has had the self made fortune of collaborating with Sener Sen for over 30 years now! Sener Sen has not appeared in any movie that was not written by Turgul. Hopefully after this his mind will change. Because as masterful as Mr Turgul is with script mathematics he is just as unimaginative and lacks creativity when it comes to tuning that mathematics with great story lines engaging characters and witty developments. Unfortunately he keeps repeating himself and regardless of whether he is writing about an old time bandit eskiya a teacher who has returned to his Istanbul home after years at Anatolia outskirts gnl yaras a Mafioso who still embraces old ethic codes like a samurai kabaday or as with this picture about a forensic chief he is depending on the same main character and similar web of story lines. Every main character Mr Turgul created since Eskiya have been the same and unfortunately he alone has access to Turkey's tour de force actor Sener Sen. The acting and directing in the movie has been the most disappointing aspects of the picture for me at times the acting is raw at times authentic and at other times comical etin Tekindor's delivery of last lines. The Turkish media and critics that is composed of a few monkeys scratching each other's back and never writing anything bad about bad movies made by influential people has of course spoken of this picture too as a 'masterpiece'. Unfortunately it is not! Especially the acting of Cem Ylmaz a loved persona by myself too doesn't get better than any of the characters from Turkish police TV series such as Arka Sokaklar. The storyline never gets interesting or clever. At an age when CSI and similar TV series are putting such emphasis on the storyline Hunting Season manages to be as interesting as an episode of CSI NY and nothing more. Compared to Millennium Trilogy it is a movie for people who have no idea about the genre. The music selection was good but Mr Turgul has for the first time agonized me with his use of music as a mood pusher. The music always makes itself more than apparent! Which is very sad as the use of music has always been one of Mr Turgul's strenghts. Editing and the overly washed light footage are other inconsistent elements of the movie. At times the editing reminds one of Svankmayer's pieces creating an alter persona through blurring of images and movement of the camera close to the face however this as with Tekindor's last scene makes the movie more comical than anything! The worst aspect yet of the movie was the unnecessary voice over! If anyone catches the meaning of that voice over please explain as all it did was push feelings down the throat of the audience in arabesque ways and it didn't even have a finely tuned closure. 5 stars for what Mr Turgul means to Turkish Cinema and regardless of how disappointing he has been still the contribution Cem Ylmaz will have to the same art.".

	schema:headline " Av Mevsimi  An awful and overly long mess";
	schema:reviewBody "Well where to begin? If this film wouldn't have so much flaws. It would be average at best. I mean the cinematography isn't breathtaking or great as some other reviews described. The shots where pretty simple and nothing really original was done to take it to a higher level. The story is pretty standard just because it was thickened a bit with an insight of the personal lives of the main characters doesn't make it a better story on the contrary. From the beginning one could tell that there wasn't much budget to make this film. The film begins with a cheap looking title sequence that is if your used to the wonderful designed Hollywood titles at the beginning of films. Okay this is one thing that can easily be overlooked though. Than the film starts with the finding of an arm that has been cut off. And this arm unfortunately looked too plastic. It just didn't look real. And then when the unnecessary voiceover kicked in I knew it would be a long sit. And I was right. What bothered me the most was that there wasn't any balance in this film. Was it trying to be a black comedy of some sort? A family drama? A crime thriller? It tried to be all of it at the same time and failed miserably. One of the worst mistakes storiesfilms can make is not able to make any choice at all. This was one of those stories. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD For example the character of Cem Yilmaz brought numerous times too much of his comic acting in his role as if the director just let him do what he always does and play some sort of a comical character. This comical effect was made even greater by the suddenness of it. Like at one point the characters being at a stakeout one moment and tension is being build up and another moment the characters are in some sort of a 'Ateam' cowboy shootout. Where the 'bad'guys are spraying Uzi machine guns around. Another moment where one could tell that Cem Yilmaz was definitely miscast was when his character was dying and people in the theater actually started laughing as if he where going to say or do something funny in the process of it. Another thing that really annoyed me was the pace of the film. I mean why did the film had to drag on for an hour more if the plot was already revealed after 90 minutes or so. But no instead of wrapping it up they choose to let it drag and drag as if the ending would be such a surprise. All the insights in the personal lives also seemed unnecessary it just seemed too forced or too much. And the whole rookie part could've better been left out. In the end his character seemed to insignificant. Insignificant also was the voice over which had absolutely no function and made the film even more clich. MORE SPOILERS AHEAD Other things that really bothered were plot holes like Cem Yilmaz' character who goes to his ex with plans of maybe killing her and then when he sits on the couch right in front of her he gently but very clearly pulls out a gun and holds it next to him and she acts as if she doesn't see the gun... YEAH RIGHT. And then all of a sudden when he is about to pull the trigger the electricity is cut off. oh what a coincidence. Or another thing they go to a doctor to get some information and ask the guy a couple of questions. The doctor answers that he absolutely cannot give them any information it's supposedly classified. So then they ask 'okay then give us the address of the previous doctor that can give us all the information we want'. And of course the address is given. Then when they enter the home of the other doctor the guy sits on a couch with his hand under a pillow. Was he sitting there on that exact spot for a week or so waiting for people? And then he pulls out a gun from underneath the pillow and kills himself. Then next to him they find a PC with an application open which has the all the information on it to solve the whole case. Or one more thing a very clear footprint and tire mark side by side at the crime seen which belongs to a billionaire who himself try to get rid of a body. As if he doesn't have people that does his dirty jobs? These things occurred throughout the whole film. The only decent performance was from Sener Sen and Cetin Tekindor. As one would expect. I'm sorry but I absolutely cannot recommend this film to anyone. Especially those who have seen TV shows like Law and Order and CSI. Because even those TV shows are better written. Or better yet just watch Mystic River Zodiac Seven Lovely Bones or even The Chaser if you want to see a film with similar themes but far better executed.".

But that promise is never fulfilled by the weak plot of the movie. We see the crime and we see the clue right in the middle of the movie. That clue ruined me the better experience which movie was promising in the beginning. Cem Yilmaz' acting was good but sometimes felt that he was overacting. Still his versatility stuns us. Sener Sen was great as always in such underwritten role. He plays so easily and creates truly believable character. Okan Yalabik doesn't shine as a rookie cop but still shows some potential.

Then life brings a unexpected twist and he finds himself in prison. From this point on we see transformations of a man who is forced into a new world where he has no control.This movie is a great glimpse of the extreme conditions that the American correctional system can create. It also displays very well how people can get corrupted by power. All the actors in this movie shine and portray perfectly their characters. The story is very well told and by the end of the movie you are left reflecting on how the correctional system has so many flaws and how it drives people to become their worst both as inmates and as guards. However the film also shows that even in these circumstances there are great acts of humanity and compassion.A very good movie definitely worth the watch. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most prison movies are essentially the same story told with different characters. Usually the protagonist is convicted of a crime which he did or did not do is sent to prison and finds that they have to either adapt to their brutal new surroundings or die. Allies are won enemies are made death lurks around the corner. Felon is no different but three things raise it above most others.First is the setting. Filmed at the New Mexico State Penitentiary the movie carries an air of authenticity and gritty realism that movie sets simply can't provide. Next is the casting. Stephen Dorff has always been a very underrated actor and here he provides a wonderful portrayal of a man let down by the legal system and cast adrift in a living nightmare. His descent from upstanding family man to an enraged prison inmate with fire in his eyes and blood on his knuckles is perhaps predictable but Dorff sells the portrayal to the audience completely. However Harold Perrineau and Val Kilmer are the real stars here. The first whom avid fans of the television shows Lost and Oz will already be familiar with offers a great performance as Lieutenant Jackson a happy family orientated man outside of prison but a monster within its walls. Kilmer meanwhile is John Smith the philosophical but potentially dangerous convict who comes to befriend Dorff's Wade during their time together. The third and final ingredient that ensures Felon impresses is the passionate directing by Ric Roman Waugh who also wrote the screenplay based apparently on events at the notorious Californian State Prison. With the help of some incredible editing the movie powers along at a frantic rate and rarely gives the audience time to breathe. If the ending is somewhat contrived you can forgive it because the journey to reach the conclusion was so intense.Highly recommended especially for fans of The Shawshank Redemption The Big House An Innocent Man and Lock Up.".

It reminded me a little of The Shawshank redemption and an Innocent man. It shows how difficult life can be for someone whom lives a hardworking and honest life to enter the prison system filled with career criminals and gang members.This movie encompasses friendships hardships and injustices. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.".

The greatest part is narrated into courtyard prison because of it reflects the violent existence of the inmates with the fightsthreatsmurders and where rules the strongest's law. In the picture there are thrillsviolencedramatension and a little bit of action in the final confrontation. The picture obtained enough success it's a real Sleeper . Stephen Dorff's interpretation is very fine but Val Kilmer is much better he makes a terrific acting as the veteran convict who teaches at naive inmate to taking on the risks and dangers of the gaol  his performance bears remarkable resemblance to Ben Kingsley in An innocent man directed by Peter Yates and that also has certain similarities in the argument. And of course Harold Perrineau as sensationhungry nasty warden is topnotch. Furthermore the picture contains realist cinematography and atmospheric musical score. Ric Roman Waugh directs with genius and masterfully transcending the issue and gives something definitively original. The story will appeal to Prison genre enthusiast and Val Kilmer fans.

Stephen Dorff is also great in the role of a family man that is unfairly imprisoned for protecting his family and dehumanizes and desensitizes to survive in the prison.

Most of it takes place in a US penal institution and i don't know enough about that to reflect on it being correct. It probably differs from state to state and from prison to prison and even from one part of a prison to another but looking at the movies and documentaries about US penal institutions its probably not far of. I wouldn't last a day if i were ever sent into one of those and i really sympathize with any person who is penalized because of an error corruption or some grey area that is judged hard but from what everyone thinks it wasn't that bad. That last thing is what this movie is about and without getting too deep into who is to blame for what i would like to quote Dostojevski  i think who said that 'you can judge any society by its prisoners'.The filmmakers obviously wanted to address this issue since the movie is all about that and ends with 'in 2008 there are 2.3 million people in US prisons'It is appalling to think that a portion of these people are wrongfully committed. probably 10's of thousandsSo as far as the story goes this is really worth a view. Acting is great specially Val Kilmer who i hardly recognized but plays magnificent. I cant think of anything bad to say about this movie. You have to see it.Its very sad that ones life can be ruined just in a second by some coincidence. The movie ends well so we can all sleep good but its a movie. Most people that get in like that never get out partly because they don't know the scene don't know how to fight in that world and if they do they will never be the same again.The American penal system isn't made to put people back in society. On the contrary it criminalizes people.".

Stephen Dorff remember him? stars as an ordinary family guy who accidentally kills a burglar and finds himself in a highsecurity prison.The usual prison clichs abound with a lot of the focus on brutal fisticuffs as inmates battle it out for supremacy. It reminded me a little of Van Damme's IN HELL although while that was a pure action film with superbly staged fights FELON concentrates on the drama between the characters.Overall the film holds together well. Time is taken to get to know the characters not just the prisoners but also those on the outside the brutal guard who takes his problems home with him the wife struggling to make it with a husband in prison. It's a film which avoids stereotyping heroes and villains and does well because of it.One of the real strengths  and this is a surprise  is Val Kilmer in a supporting role as a seasoned lifer. Kilmer turns out to be excellent bringing real gravitas to his role to put it bluntly I've never seen him this good before and watching him inhabit his role is a real pleasure. Dorff too is actually pretty decent making it easy for the viewer to sympathise with his character's plight.FELON certainly isn't a classic film and it's far from the best of the prison movie subgenre but it's one of those movies you catch on TV late at night which leaves a real impression.

	schema:reviewBody "In spite of a talented cast and some strong performances this movie is simply too ambitious in scope and lightweight in execution. Others have drawn parallels to The Shawshank Redemption which to my mind is an insult to the latter. A better stylistic comparison would be a more ambitious film like Crash which succeeds in spite of its wholesale contrivances and manipulative elements because it is an artful and poetic drama. Felon is not. It tries to be gritty and realistic while asking of the audience that they be willingly manipulated at every turn in order to embrace the film's message. A deadly almost amateurish combination.Nothing more aptly underscores how convoluted the film is than the statistic which precedes the closing credits about the number of Americans who are in prison. The film makes so little effort to disabuse viewers of the notion that violent criminals are enemies of society that other than the lead the only sympathetically portrayed prisoner is a mass murderer Val Kilmer who meted out barbarian justice after the murder of his family. What is one to infer from that? Unless one comes to the table armed with the laughably naive sentiment that people are basically good and that prison itself invariably turns people on both sides of the cell into monsters there is no way to navigate this film to the desired conclusion. Yes we get it. A good guy is a victim of circumstances and ends up in prison. He does bad things to survive inside. His incarceration nearly shatters his family. We feel his fear and empathize with his struggles amid the savagery of fellow inmates and sadistic desensitized guards. We're asked to put ourselves in his place ... a standard device for manipulating viewers. There but for the grace of God go I if you will. But it is intellectually dishonest to choose as a vessel for an indictment of a society that believes in punishment a man who was a victim not of that culture but of a countervailing movement on the far left to expand criminal rights. It is riotously funny that the filmmaker should choose a man whose transgression  killing a burglar  invariably elicits quiet applause in real life from the very law and order majority whose mindset the film seeks to indict. And because of that the film is a fraud from the outset in spite of its virtues.This was a rare instance where I actually sought out a film because of the reviews here and felt compelled to submit one myself to express my disappointment. It is not a film that stands on its own. To be moved as many reviewers inarguably were requires that one be willing to dispense with critical thinking be emotionally predisposed to being sympathetic to the message or simply a European as they are a fairly reliable source of approval for anything which is overthetop in showing American culture in an unfavorable light. It is an eminently watchable movie but of the sort one might deem a gem if seen for the first time on cable at 2 am on a Sunday morning as opposed to a film worth going out of one's way for.".

But it is intellectually dishonest to choose as a vessel for an indictment of a society that believes in punishment a man who was a victim not of that culture but of a countervailing movement on the far left to expand criminal rights. It is riotously funny that the filmmaker should choose a man whose transgression  killing a burglar  invariably elicits quiet applause in real life from the very law and order majority whose mindset the film seeks to indict. And because of that the film is a fraud from the outset in spite of its virtues.This was a rare instance where I actually sought out a film because of the reviews here and felt compelled to submit one myself to express my disappointment. It is not a film that stands on its own. To be moved as many reviewers inarguably were requires that one be willing to dispense with critical thinking be emotionally predisposed to being sympathetic to the message or simply a European as they are a fairly reliable source of approval for anything which is overthetop in showing American culture in an unfavorable light. It is an eminently watchable movie but of the sort one might deem a gem if seen for the first time on cable at 2 am on a Sunday morning as opposed to a film worth going out of one's way for.";

	schema:headline " Almost interesting movie about the good guy in prison.";
	schema:reviewBody "After accidentally beating to death a burglar on his lawn the hardworking Wade Porter Stephen Dorff 'Shadowboxer' 'fairdotcom' finds himself convicted to 3 years hard time. To make matters worse Wade on his bus ride to the State Prison gets implicated in the murder of one of the inmates in the bus. After some time in solitary confinement he gets placed in the maximum security section of the prison know as 'The Shoe'. The place is reigned by the evil lt. Jackson played by Harold Perrineau 'OZ' 'Lost'. Hard Time is surely upon the inmates for they are being put to fight each other under the supervision of Jackson and his team who eventually ends all fights by shooting the fighting inmates but only after a fair amount of fighting took place.The movie in itself is not badly done and features some great acting by both Kilmer as the wise and ruthless bunk mate Perrineau and Dorff. But there are some serious issues with the film.In brief the movie is overwrought crammed with the usual prison clichs and too unrealistic for it's own good. The character Jackson is simply too bloodthirsty to buy him as a character and it strains the caricature of the evil prison guard even further. Porter becomes theguytobereckonedwith apparently over night. Where he's just a completely ignorant prison fish in one scene he's already beating up everybody in the next. Felon also suffers from being way too straightforward and lacked heavily in the humor department.That said there are some very convincing scenes and I would recommend this movie to those that are really into the underdog prison type of films such as Lock Up and The Last Castle. Even though those movies are surely not as good as felon it's a better comparison than to compare it to Shawshank Redemption which is like comparing a decent pulp novel to any good work of literature.6.310".

Yes we have in countless emotional dramas and it is supposed to evoke impending tragedy. The family of course is very happy and loving kissing joking and hugging. This is going to end badly!This film is shot with the use of earthquake cam which is a style of camera work that suggests a child has just been given a video camera and is having problems choosing what to let into the frame. Even the first breakfast scene a controlled environment is shot in this halfarsed way. I wonder what the likes of John Ford Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa would have to say about the camera being used so ineptly?The story is very unconvincing. Our hero is white and ends up incarcerated for an accidental homicide while protecting his home and family. Are American Judges so illinformed that they do not read the circumstances of the case? Here our hero would not have been incarcerated in such a way. If our hero was black and poor then I think the situation would have been more convincing.The most interesting theme of this movie is the separatism of race imposed by the inmates themselves but this is never really explored as the prison guards are the real villains. Our hero is never overtly seen to join the ranks of the arian racists...that would be too politically incorrect.Val Kilmer is the saviour of this fantasy movie. His performance is excellent and he again proves what a fine character actor he is. If the portion of the American audience that believes this film to be a brutal representation of reality then it only goes to show how skewed their vision of fact is.".

WHAAAAT???? Is this the final morale? To kill all other's families to defend yours...so that your family is more important that the other's families? If we would thinking like that it will surely be a disaster for everyone. But hey this is exactly what the American government is trying to convince us to do. To think only at our asses or American's asses in this case. We all know how important our families are for us there is no need to remind it at all. I think that to defend my brother or my mother is just like the first Isaac Asimov's law. It is deep coded in me. I will surely give my life for them and i want to believe this is true for every normal person on the planet. But to defend them from who is the real problem here. Because what i've seen by now too many times is that the enemies we are forced like Kilmer's said to face most of the times are not real at all.

	schema:headline " The most decent guy in the movie the burglar.";
	schema:reviewBody "warning spoilersLet's face it in comparison to the other protagonists in this movie the burglar is the one with less sin. He only wanted to steal some money. He broke into a house didn't physically hurt a soul except for a little push to clear the way so he could get the hell outta Dodge. What did the other guys do? Val kilmers character who is portraited as some kind of hero killed entire families as he said himself. With entire families I guess that would include children as well..what a nice guy. People who had done nothing to him except being related to a killer. Dorffs character ran after a fleeing scared small time crook so he could beat the crap out of him. That's vindictive. How can he feel threatened by someone running AWAY from him and out of his house? Not to mention the guard who is in a league of his own. What a sadistic bastard! at least they had a somewhat good black guard by his side otherwise this movie could be accused of racism? I know I'm being cynical and sarcastic but this movie really has a strange philosophy. But I guess that might be the point of it to make you think. But to me you almost feel sympathetic to people you shouldn't feel sympathetic about. So the point of the movie it is okay to use any kind of force including killing as long as you feel threatened or hurt. Val kilmers actions were understandable since hey he had just lost his whole family. The burglars action is not okay since he did it out of free will. No one at least as far as we know forced him to break into Dorffs house. Except maybe circumstances maybe someone had done something bad to him too which would justify his actions as well If circumstances were to excuse people's behavior even the guard would be forgiven since the accident of his son had made him suffer. At times I think this movie has a double morality 1on one side it shows that NO ONE is pure and without sin. And that EVIL actions comes out of suffering pain and unfortunate circumstances. Taking that a step further it would mean that no one is truly evil. 2On the other side it kind of says that there are some truly evil people like the burglar and the sadistic cop that does evil stuff just for the hell of it out of free will. These are the TRULY evil people who deserve to get rid of. The other ones like Dorff and Kilmer are victims that are forced into it. They are not to blame and should be left alone. But if they would have shown scenes when Kilmer slaughtered that family we certainly would get a different opinion about him. This is confusing.. If you give a massmurderer sufficient screening time he appears more sympathetic than a burglar. Since the massmurderers actions aren't filmed but the burglars are. And the massmurderer gets the chance to explain himself. This movie wants to have it both ways. It wants to both get into the psyche of criminals to understand them and also punish bad people. To be a sly Stallone type of movie. That's why it leaves you more confused than satisfied even if that might not have been the point of the movie. If I'd rate something in this movie it would be more about the cinematography than the message since I'm not quite sure what the message is. I think the movie got too repetitive after the prisoners transfer to the yard. It was a cheap boring set and seeing fight after fight with skinny guys beating up 40 pounds heavier opponents got somewhat boring. To me it doesn't deserve an 8. This is more like a 6 or 7 to me.".

	onyx:emotionText "warning spoilersLet's face it in comparison to the other protagonists in this movie the burglar is the one with less sin. He only wanted to steal some money. He broke into a house didn't physically hurt a soul except for a little push to clear the way so he could get the hell outta Dodge. What did the other guys do? Val kilmers character who is portraited as some kind of hero killed entire families as he said himself. With entire families I guess that would include children as well..what a nice guy. People who had done nothing to him except being related to a killer. Dorffs character ran after a fleeing scared small time crook so he could beat the crap out of him. That's vindictive. How can he feel threatened by someone running AWAY from him and out of his house? Not to mention the guard who is in a league of his own. What a sadistic bastard! at least they had a somewhat good black guard by his side otherwise this movie could be accused of racism? I know I'm being cynical and sarcastic but this movie really has a strange philosophy. But I guess that might be the point of it to make you think. But to me you almost feel sympathetic to people you shouldn't feel sympathetic about. So the point of the movie it is okay to use any kind of force including killing as long as you feel threatened or hurt. Val kilmers actions were understandable since hey he had just lost his whole family. The burglars action is not okay since he did it out of free will. No one at least as far as we know forced him to break into Dorffs house. Except maybe circumstances maybe someone had done something bad to him too which would justify his actions as well If circumstances were to excuse people's behavior even the guard would be forgiven since the accident of his son had made him suffer. At times I think this movie has a double morality 1on one side it shows that NO ONE is pure and without sin. And that EVIL actions comes out of suffering pain and unfortunate circumstances. Taking that a step further it would mean that no one is truly evil. 2On the other side it kind of says that there are some truly evil people like the burglar and the sadistic cop that does evil stuff just for the hell of it out of free will. These are the TRULY evil people who deserve to get rid of. The other ones like Dorff and Kilmer are victims that are forced into it. They are not to blame and should be left alone. But if they would have shown scenes when Kilmer slaughtered that family we certainly would get a different opinion about him. This is confusing.. If you give a massmurderer sufficient screening time he appears more sympathetic than a burglar. Since the massmurderers actions aren't filmed but the burglars are. And the massmurderer gets the chance to explain himself. This movie wants to have it both ways. It wants to both get into the psyche of criminals to understand them and also punish bad people. To be a sly Stallone type of movie. That's why it leaves you more confused than satisfied even if that might not have been the point of the movie. If I'd rate something in this movie it would be more about the cinematography than the message since I'm not quite sure what the message is. I think the movie got too repetitive after the prisoners transfer to the yard. It was a cheap boring set and seeing fight after fight with skinny guys beating up 40 pounds heavier opponents got somewhat boring. To me it doesn't deserve an 8. This is more like a 6 or 7 to me.";

The violence seemed fairly realistic increasing the impending sense of fear encompassing the central character. Very watchable. Was probably made for a lower budget than many other films currently in release but it clearly better than 90 of them. Kudos to the filmmakers crew and cast.Definitely recommend it. Val Kilmer does a great job he could've stole a lot of scenes and made his character a far more sharply memorable one but that would've only served to detract from the protagonist's dilemma. Kilmer's handling of his character was near pitch perfect in my opinion. He gave his character an extremely believable depth and solidity and coupled with some great performances from Dorff and the rest of the prison cast created a malignantly sick and implosive atmosphere in the scenes. Well done!".

	schema:headline " Shear poetry from Glenda Jackson!";
	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1970's Glenda Jackson was popular as a result of her performances in light romantic comedies either starring opposite George Segal or Walter Matthau and well respected for her participation in the art house films of the early 1970's mostly directed by Ken Russell. Many of her films are obscure because they only appeal to certain kinds of audiences and as one wag once put it Guess what. I saw a film the other day and Glenda Jackson was not in it! Even fellow British acting legend Maggie Smith got to comment in California Suite about Glenda being nominated for an Oscar pretty much every year. Indeed in the 1970's Glenda was nominated four times for the Academy Award winning twice tying with Ellen Burstyn and Jane Fonda for the most nominated actress of that decade even if she was not box office dynamite. Had Stevie been more promoted when it was released in 1978 she might have gotten a fifth nomination but by the time this got an L.A. release it was 1981 and the film slid by without recognition outside its original New York release several years before.Most of Glenda's dialog is spoken to the audience and how it is done in this biography of poet Stevie Smith truly works. She is touching funny tragic sad commanding honest and real. She speaks out on many topics with such refreshing candidness that she instantly takes you into her heart. The first three quarters of the film deals with her relationship with the aunt she has lived with for years the wonderful Mona Washbourne best known as Mrs. Pearce in My Fair Lady facing a confrontation with an old beau Alec McCowen whom she loves but cannot commit to out of her own fears of intimacy and facing her own mortality as Washbourne gets weaker. Jackson discusses the issues with society commenting on the middle class's snobbery and revealing a touching story of an old man she witnessed being escorted out of a posh tea shop. She then faces her greatest challenge a meeting with Queen Elizabeth which is not without its folly. An anecdote concerning the Queen Mother is very funny especially when considering Jackson's presence on the House of Commons for many years.Stevie Smith was obviously a complex woman yet quite charming in spite of her personal issues that prevented her from seeking relationships with men past the general friendships she made with them. Jackson goes out of her way to make you feel like you know this character inside and out and yet instill her with a bit of mystery. Washbourne too makes you see who her character is with her love of sherry her want of seeing Jackson settle down with a nice man and ultimately as she gets older her neediness and sad advance into old age. The last scene with her is one to reach for a Kleenex. Trevor Howard has a few odds and ends appearances by himself describing his friendship with Stevie and in the last reel actually getting a chance to appear with her. This is a film that on concept might seem like it could bore you to sleep but it is one that is surprisingly magical with a combination of performances writing directing and most important overall humanity making it an absolute must.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the late 1970's Glenda Jackson was popular as a result of her performances in light romantic comedies either starring opposite George Segal or Walter Matthau and well respected for her participation in the art house films of the early 1970's mostly directed by Ken Russell. Many of her films are obscure because they only appeal to certain kinds of audiences and as one wag once put it Guess what. I saw a film the other day and Glenda Jackson was not in it! Even fellow British acting legend Maggie Smith got to comment in California Suite about Glenda being nominated for an Oscar pretty much every year. Indeed in the 1970's Glenda was nominated four times for the Academy Award winning twice tying with Ellen Burstyn and Jane Fonda for the most nominated actress of that decade even if she was not box office dynamite. Had Stevie been more promoted when it was released in 1978 she might have gotten a fifth nomination but by the time this got an L.A. release it was 1981 and the film slid by without recognition outside its original New York release several years before.Most of Glenda's dialog is spoken to the audience and how it is done in this biography of poet Stevie Smith truly works. She is touching funny tragic sad commanding honest and real. She speaks out on many topics with such refreshing candidness that she instantly takes you into her heart. The first three quarters of the film deals with her relationship with the aunt she has lived with for years the wonderful Mona Washbourne best known as Mrs. Pearce in My Fair Lady facing a confrontation with an old beau Alec McCowen whom she loves but cannot commit to out of her own fears of intimacy and facing her own mortality as Washbourne gets weaker. Jackson discusses the issues with society commenting on the middle class's snobbery and revealing a touching story of an old man she witnessed being escorted out of a posh tea shop. She then faces her greatest challenge a meeting with Queen Elizabeth which is not without its folly. An anecdote concerning the Queen Mother is very funny especially when considering Jackson's presence on the House of Commons for many years.Stevie Smith was obviously a complex woman yet quite charming in spite of her personal issues that prevented her from seeking relationships with men past the general friendships she made with them. Jackson goes out of her way to make you feel like you know this character inside and out and yet instill her with a bit of mystery.

More's performance as the lover was overrated  he won a prize at the Venice film festival and made it plain that he and his costar did not get along during filming mainly because he protested Leigh's desire to look her best. Such a desire is all the more understandable given the fact that her last completed film was A Streetcar Named Desire as the faded beauty Blanche and that she had subsequently broken down during the filming of Elephant Walk and been replaced by the much younger Elizabeth Taylor.There were dissenting critical opinions.  Pauline Kael called Leigh's performance here brilliant when later reviewing The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone and finding the Karen Stone performance wanting in contrast.  I beg to differ with Pauline on that point being a Karen Stone enthusiast myself.  In any case The Deep Blue Sea deserves to be seen.  It was produced by Alexander Korda in Britain but distributed by 20th Century Fox in the U.S.A. so maybe there are copyright issues blocking its release on video.Here in America the film would seem a likely staple of the American Movie Classics cable station if for no other reason because it stars the woman who played Scarlett O'Hara.  20th Century Fox CinemaScope films of the same vintage play regularly on the station e.g. How To Marry a Millionaire Three Coins in the Fountain Love Is a ManySplendored Thing Anastasia et al. The critical success of David Mamet's adaptation of The Winslow Boy may stir interest in Rattigan once again  let's hope so.The play itself was and remains a strong acting vehicle especially for the woman who plays Hester.  Faye Dunaway nearly did it in NYC for Roundabout but somehow the star and the theater couldn't come to terms over contract demands and it was revived instead with Blythe Danner aka Ma Paltrow.Let's hope that Vivien Leigh's performance will be available for viewing by movie fans and serious film and theater scholars alike in the near future. After all she is one of the great actresses of the twentieth century cinema and this is one of but eight films she made following Gone With the Wind.An interesting footnote  Arthur Hill appears briefly in this film later when Vivien Leigh won a Tony Award for her performance in the Broadway musical Tovarich Hill won the Tony for his dramatic turn in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.  There is an amusing photograph of Leigh Hill and fellow winners Zero Mostel and Uta Hagen at the awards ceremony circa 1963.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 21st century there are apparently no weak indecisive women like Hester  women who totally subjugate themselves to men.Or if there are we never see them on the screen.Miss V.Leigh seems like a relic from the Victorian erabut in fact in the male  dominated 1950s middle  classes her character was not exactly ploughing a lonely furrow. Married to a judgeshe would have spent most of her time re  arranging the doilies and making cucumber sandwiches for her husband's friends. No question of empowerment for her.Perhaps we shouldin the circumstances have just a little sympathy for herdesperate to grab a little happiness and excitement with her ex  fighter pilot lover. The fact that he isfranklya bit of a trimmershould merely increase that sympathy.As FreddieMr K.More plays against type.He has a superficial charm but there is less in him than meets the eye.Mr More was about to embark on a winning streak engendered by Genevieve and Doctor in the house and many of his fans viewed The deep blue sea in much the same way as Dirk Bogarde's regarded The Doctor's Dilemma  a temporary blip in a long and successful career. Miss Leigh lends her ethereal beauty to the roleand in an age when women were expected to be subservienther self  effacement and naivety would have been looked on as desirable characteristics. She made so few movies that her devoteesnaturally enoughtrend to treasure each one.My personal preferences would be St Martin's Lane and Waterloo Bridge when her startling beauty leapt from the screen herein early middle age she still emits a strange innocenceas if her she can't believe what her heart is making her do.

Miss Leigh lends her ethereal beauty to the roleand in an age when women were expected to be subservienther self  effacement and naivety would have been looked on as desirable characteristics.

Hardly the image of the saucy Scarlett O'Hara which she won her first Oscar with but it did allow her to transition into roles for older women. This one her in The Deep Blue Sea is way too uncomfortably close to her real life.In this film it opens with her attempting suicide and being saved by prying neighbors. Her much younger second husband has left her and in flashbacks we learn what was going on. Vivien had been raised a prim and proper church girl with a country parson for a father. She learned the biblical view of sex that did not leave much room for later research into the field on a more clinical basis. She married the older and more settled Emlyn Williams who is a judge. But as they got older Emlyn got less interested in sex. Enter Kenneth More who was an RAF air ace and now a test pilot. That's real glamor for her and like Anna Karenina another Leigh part she leaves Williams and runs off with More.But More's got issues also he's an alcoholic and deep down he's looking for a mother figure. Since she and Williams had no children Leigh isn't recognizing this nor is she prepared to deal with it.Terrence Ratigan adapted his own play to the screen and rather well since the play only takes place in Leigh's apartment. We get some scenes of London night life in 1955 and with More's job part of the film takes place at an air show. On Broadway the play ran for 132 performances in 195253 and starred Margaret Sullavan.Offering advice and counsel is defrocked psychiatrist Eric Portman who is a neighbor. But as Leigh finds out as does the audience there are no no easy answers.The Deep Blue Sea is not as good a work from Ratigan as The Browning Version or Separate Tables. Still the cast performs well especially Vivien Leigh who made very infrequent screen appearances now.".

Of course when you cut out a frames you also cut the optical soundtrack that runs down the side but even with all these faults one FRAME of this Anatole Litvak version with a screenplay by Rattigan himself is worth the ENTIRE pathetic remake by Terence Davies. Davies' producer had the effrontery to turn up and 'introduce' the screening and displayed a wonderful grasp of show biz by stating that on Broadway the part of Hester  created by Peggy Ashcroft  was played by Margaret O'Sullivan and he compounded his ignorance by identifying O'Sullivan correctly as Jane in the Tarzan films when the actress who actually played Hester on Broadway was Margaret Sullivan and not MAUREEN O'Sullivan. Be that as it may this is THE version to see albeit at the moment that is impossible. It's full of wellknown English actors of the day including Jimmy Hanley wooden as ever Dandy Nichols Alec McCowan Moira Lister plus one Canadian Arthur Hill who didn't really register until he played opposite Uta Hagen in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf. If you've got a moment you may feel like lobbying someone with a view to having this version fully restored and made available on DVD and at the same time having the Davies travesty made into banjo pics.".

The arresting opening scene shows her nosy neighbours no doubt aware of the novelty of her status and circumstances finding her unconscious in her and her lover's cheap flat having attempted suicide with a combination of sleeping pills and gas.The assistance of a neighbouring exdoctor played by Eric Portman who walks around in shades and who we later learn was struck off a year ago for an undisclosed misdemeanour brings her round. Soon on the scene too is her posh ex Emlyn Williams obviously still in love with her and who obviously still cares for her and who tries to win her back. From there in a series of flashbacks we're brought up to date as we see how the triangular situation commenced developed and led up to her course of action. How the three of them go on on from there informs the rest of the movie up to the emotional climax at the end.This is very much the type of drama with characters using words like Whizzo cad and good form that the Angry Young Men of the British theatre world were rebelling against at around this time and not much further around the corner the new wave of realism in British cinema and the Kitchen Sink Dramas of the early 60's. Here then we have yet another examination of upper class mores and a familiar storyline of marital infidelity with as usual as much left out as in no doubt respecting the morals of the day for example that the main catalyst for the affair between Leigh and More is physical attraction just as much as her rejection of the staid high society life she's endured more than enjoyed up until then.With a screenplay adapted from his own play by Terence Rattigan it does look at times like a museum piece with its cutglass accents genteel manners and stereotypical depiction of the working class landlady and out of work actress tenant. It's also difficult to warm to Leigh's poor little rich girl plight and even less so More's waster of a character. Some attempts are made to shed the piece's theatrical roots most obviously with an episode at a skiing resort which adds little to the plot but by the end you can almost see the actors following their cues up until Miss Leigh's time of reckoning at the end.Maybe I just like my porridge a bit thicker and saltier than this but even as it was possible to admire to some extent the stagecraft of the piece and the solidity of the direction and acting ultimately the piece left me rather unsympathetic to the main characters and cold to the film as a whole.".

His dialogue is so intelligent witty and meaty his characterisation so dynamic complex and real and the storytelling so beautifully constructed.'The Deep Blue Sea' may not be among my favourite Rattigan plays 'The Browning Version' 'The Winslow Boy' 'Separate Tables' but it's still wonderful and distinctively Rattigan. The writing is 24carat Rattigan and the story is timeless in its searing emotion and romantic passion. It's very sharply observant and emotionally searing. This rarely viewed and as of now unavailable film version of 'The Deep Blue Sea' is deserving of more exposure.It may not be one of the best representations of Rattigan in general i.e. 1951's 'The Browning Version' 1948's 'The Winslow Boy' and 1958's 'Separate Tables' but it is as good an adaptation of 'The Deep Blue Sea' as can suffice not the best but one of them. It is a shame that it is unavailable on DVD and can as of now only be viewed in a rather poor print on Youtube. If and when available on DVD while it's not perfect it deserves to be it needs to be a restoration. It is a shame that it got a tepid response when released it is understandable in a way that it didn't connect with viewers considering the film competition that year and that it was considered too cold talky and sedate at the time and perhaps the subject was a little inaccessible to some at the time.With that being said 'The Deep Blue Sea' is still well worth the viewing. Mainly for seeing Kenneth More in one of his best performances he is brilliant here Vivien Leigh in an achingly personal performance that sees her as beautiful but not too beautiful and to me she wasn't too cold and the two of them together in a pretty passionate chemistry do disagree respectfully with More himself that it was poor that contrasts well with the suitably passionless one for Hester's marriage as it should be. Plus a sterling distinguished supporting cast with Eric Portman and Emlyn Williams being the standouts. The only exception with the latter is Jimmy Hanley who is a little wooden.Malcolm Arnold's music score is understated but swells passionately at the right moments. The script is thoughtprovoking and observant with the wit and nuances captured well even with changes there is a lot of talk but that is the case with the play itself and Rattigan in general. The story may not be as searing as with the play and may lack its intimacy in places but the characters the meaty way they're written and their stories are handled quite well.Anatole Litvak's direction could have been more expansive other film adaptations of Rattigan's work have done a better job of opening up their respective source material and even extending it and although it is an intimate story the direction is a little too sedate and selfcontained. 'The Deep Blue Sea' has been criticised for substandard production values to me the settings and costumes are lovely to look at and some of the film is atmospherically lit but it is let down by the poor print with the faded and grainy picture quality and less than lavish and at times incomplete looking photography.Overall underviewed film that despite its faults is interesting and worth the watch. 710 Bethany Cox".

U.S. release 20 November 1955. U.K. release 27 September 1955. Australian release 10 May 1956. 8913 feet. 99 minutes.SYNOPSIS Judge's wife falls for feckless flier.COMMENT Aside from The Village Squire and Gentleman's Agreement both 1935 this is the least known and certainly the least revived of Vivien Leigh's starring films. It's true there are reasons The Deep Blue Sea deserves its present obscurity. Chief of these is director Anatole Litvak. Whilst he often blocks out his action effectively on the CinemaScope screen he rarely moves the camera. Not only are there few pans and no tracking shots to speak of even the director's famous signature crane shot is missing.The result is a rather stodgy not to say stagebound film. This impression is magnified by Vivien Leigh's overly theatrical performance which is at odds with the pitch at which other players particularly Kenneth More deliver their lines. As a result the audience never becomes really interested in Hester or absorbed in her problems. Some weak writing by Rattigan doesn't help either. Whilst the dialogue is often too verbose characterization of all but the two principals remains stubbornly superficial.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie on youtube last night and being a Vivien Leigh fan I was enthralled by this movie. The story is of a slightly older lady involved with a somewhat younger man after leaving a morbid marriage to a nice man but one that does not share her passion for life. The movie starts with an attempt at suicide which more was a cry for help and attention. From there by use of superb dialogue and flashbacks we see how the star crossed lovers meet and fall in love from both their perspectives. You can tell that has been adapted from a play but as the movie moves on one is amazed too by how life has changed since the making of this movie how more empowered women are in pursuing what they want. I found Vivien's character dominating every scene and noticed her character is stronger that she knows but her choice in partner was lax he is boorish lazy and a cad but she loves him while her estranged hubby is stable and dull. If I had one complaint it would be with the male lead for a man who was to be younger he looked almost as old as the hubby and the acting was poor I was shocked when I saw he won an award for this but not Miss Leigh. The reason I said art imitating life is that is almost mirrored Miss Leigh and her marriage to Sir Lawrence with her illness and her affair with Peter Finch and how she ended up her companion Jack Merrivale.".

The same street scene on the Thames in London was used over and over and most of the interior shots were dark and depressing. Perhaps this was the intent of the makers. Deep Blue Sea suffers from some of the same problems as Roman Spring of Mrs Stone the characters seem onedimensional without a full range of emotions and little purpose in life. Miss not Ms Leigh aced the parts but there just wasn't much to develop.At any rate diehard Vivien Leigh fans should check this out since it was her third to last film outing.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm no great fan of Neil Simon but this neat adaption of his popular stage success BAREFOOT IN THE PARK brings a smile to my faceand it probably will yours too. The story is quite simple newlyweds Robert Redford and Jane Fonda have moved into a New York apartment building peopled by eccentrics... and their own tiny apartment has hole in the skylight no heat and you have walk up five flights to get there. Redford a rather stodgy conservative takes a dim view of the whole thing Fonda who has an excessively happygolucky disposition thinks everything is great fun. Needless to say they're soon going at it hammer and tongs.This is a very contrived sitcomish plot but the cast carries it well. Although Redford has remained a great star for forty years his films have been very hit or miss here he is well cast and he plays expertly. During this period of her career Fonda was very much the perky girlnextdoor with a slight sexkitten spin and she too is fun to watch. But the real winners here are Charles Boyer as their eccentric neighbor and particularly Mildred Natwick as Fonda's mother. Natwick excelled at playing disconcerted matrons and this is perhaps the best of the many fine memorable variations of the type she offered during her long and very enjoyable career. BAREFOOT IN THE PARK won't go down in history as a great film nor will change your point of view. But it is tremendously good fun a film I've enjoyed every time time I've seen itand that is a good many. Recommended you'll enjoy it.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

But this one stands out as being genuinely funny and well made. I love all the funny little details like the tuna fish cans Robert Redford's comment about a big cat with a can opener Jane Fonda's mother Jane Fonda doing a Cambodian fertility dance etc. It is all just too classic for words.

It proves that flowery romantic prose isn't what makes a great love story bold heroes and damsels in distress don't make a good love story. No what makes a good love story are two people who from start to finish makes the audience go Oh God in heaven please let them work it out!The brilliant dialogue of Mr. Simon the charm of Mr. Boyer and the majestic backdrop of New York City make this a mustsee for anyone who loves 1 comedy 2 love stories or 3 Robert Redford because after this he never really made another movie that was at all comparable.

Robert Redford underplays charmingly as Paul Bratter upandcoming lawyer and allround stickinthemud Jane Fonda is his new bride Corie sexy funloving and relentlessly cute to the borderline of annoyance. When you find her schtick getting a little hard to take concentrate instead on veteran character actors Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick who lend spirit and class to their comedic roles.Perhaps the direction by Gene Saks is a tad stagebound he directed the Broadway version and the cinematography a bit muddy but Neal Hefti contributes another sprightly score that does a lot to compensate. Overall an undemanding undeniable pleasure.".

When you find her schtick getting a little hard to take concentrate instead on veteran character actors Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick who lend spirit and class to their comedic roles.Perhaps the direction by Gene Saks is a tad stagebound he directed the Broadway version and the cinematography a bit muddy but Neal Hefti contributes another sprightly score that does a lot to compensate. Overall an undemanding undeniable pleasure.";

	schema:reviewBody "As my girlfriend noted before I watched for the first time this is like the original 'Dharma  Greg.' She's the free spirit he's the buttondown lawyer struggling to adjust to the new world into which he's just married. After six days of a honeymoon at the Plaza where eyebrows are raised amongst the staff because the young lovers never leave the room conflicts come to a boil at home when she realizes that her new husband isn't such an adventurous fella. Amongst the number of reasons she compiles to determine that they just can't make it after all he declines an invitation to take off his shoes in February to walk barefoot in the park.Of course with your knowledge of romantic comedies about marital discord you know generally how it all ends. How the conflict is resolved beginning with some advice from Mother may seem realistic and true to some. Others raised on selfempowered heroines may think it's a trite sellout.There's no question that young Redford fits the bill as Handsome  Charming but it's a little hard to believe in him as a character who's supposed to be a stick in the mud. Fonda at this point had carved out a niche for herself in Wild Untamed Belle roles and she's fine again in that role here. But I must admit it was hard to watch without thinking about Holly Golightly and imagining a sophisticated presence like Audrey Hepburn in the part instead. The script also calls for the Mother to comment that she's never seen another couple who looked so much in love but I really didn't see it. The couple seems at complete odds from their first evening at home. I can't think of a scene that illustrates why the two fell in love in the first place except that they're both so young  sexy.It's worth watching for the snappy dialogue the work by Charles Boyer  Mildred Natwick as Mr. Velasco  the Mother the chance to admire Redford  Fonda in their youth and as a nice Neil Simon period piece. But it would be no crime for someone to attempt a better updated remake. It could be done and you probably can already picture it.".

I am glad that as good a writer is so successful. The cream does rise to the top  once in a million years. Seeing this movie should be mandatory for any couple considering divorce. It shows how silly fights are. Too bad it didn't save Simon's own marriage.Boyer is priceless as an eccentric bohemian. Everyone is inspired by the script and delivers his or his best performance.

I am glad that as good a writer is so successful. The cream does rise to the top  once in a million years. Seeing this movie should be mandatory for any couple considering divorce. It shows how silly fights are. Too bad it didn't save Simon's own marriage.Boyer is priceless as an eccentric bohemian. Everyone is inspired by the script and delivers his or his best performance. Simon makes happiness seem possible because he knows where it's hiding.";

I couldn't help but think of 'Klute' while this part was going on. The feeling up that Boyer does to Jane wouldn't be tolerated in movies of today but it's a little comforting to know that we were once so naive. He seems delighted that he makes her a little nervous since he's too old to cut the mustard.Simon of course is a comic genius but his misogynism really shows forth in this movie. There's no trace of reality here which is more the difference between then and now than the sets or the great vistas of New York City. Somewhat unlike Woody allen's New York City the backdrop is kept just that but it's still gorgeous.I'll finish seeing it because I bought the damn thing and I do appreciate the good lines.

	schema:headline " Unconventionality is not a good reason for risking frostbite";
	schema:reviewBody "During the sixties seventies and eighties Neil Simon was one of America's most successful playwrights and a number of films were based on his plays during this period. A number of these were directed by Gene Saks originally a theatrical director who brought many of Simon's plays to the Broadway stage. Barefoot in the Park deals with the early days of the marriage of a young married couple Paul and Corie Bratter who after their honeymoon move into aflat in Greenwich Village. The flat is tiny cramped cold leaky and on the fifth floor of a building without a lift but it is all they can afford even though Paul is a lawyer with a major New York practice. There is a subplot about Corie's efforts to engineer a romance between her mother Ethel and their eccentric neighbour Victor but most of the storyline deals with the difficulties caused to their marriage by the contrast between their personalities. Corie is spontaneous and free spirited whereas Paul is sober and conservative. His wife frequently refers to him as a stuffed shirt. As another reviewer has pointed out there are similarities with the nineties television sitcom Dharma and Greg although here Corie's free spirits are presented as a personality trait rather than as an expression of political radicalism or New Age spirituality. The film'stitle refers to Paul's reluctance to accept Corie's suggestion that they should run barefoot through Washington Square Park which is close to their flat. The theme of the clash between conventional and unconventional ways of living and thinking was of course a common one in the literature and the cinema of the sixties two other films on a similar theme from around this time are The Graduate and The Sterile Cuckoo. Barefoot in the Park however is not in anything like the same class as those two excellent movies. There are I think a number of reasons for this. I have never seen Simon's original play in the theatre so have no idea how it would work on stage. Performances of his works are not common on this side of the Atlantic. It does not however work very well on the screen at least not in this adaptation. This was Saks's first film and like a number of theatrical directors moving into the cinema still seems to be thinking in theatrical terms. Most of the action takes place in a single location the Bratters' flat or in other similarly constrained indoor settings such as Victor's flat or a local restaurant. There is no attempt to open the action up or to take advantage of the greater freedoms offered by the cinematic medium and the whole film seems very static and stagebound. The film stars Robert Redford andJane Fonda both rising young stars in 1967 they had also starred together in The Chase the previous year and were later to do so again in The Electric Horseman. In this film however their styles of acting do not really blend well together. Fonda's acting is somewhat exaggerated and theatrical as indeed is that of Mildred Natwick as Ethel and Charles Boyer as Victor whereas Redford's is much more naturalistic and cinematic even though Redford had created the role of Paul in the original Broadwayshow whereas Fonda had not appeared in that production. As a result Corie never comes across as a very sympathetic character Fonda's rather showy acting making her seem ludicrously overemotional the sort of woman who is either berating her husband for failing to kiss her with sufficient ardour or screaming at him that she wants a divorce just a few days into their marriage. Her suggestion about running barefoot in the park seems less like freespiritedness than like pure stupidity given that the action takes place in a cold and snowy February. The desire to be unconventional is not a good reason for risking frostbite. When Paul under the influence of alcohol does start to behave in a more spontaneous manner Corie is predictably horrified and demands that he revert to his old stuffedshirt self. Saks was to achieve more success with some of his later Simon adaptations for the screen such as The Odd Couple or Brighton Beach Memoirs but Barefoot in the Park is a disappointment. The script is never witty enough to compensate for the uninteresting plot and the unsympathetic characters. Boyer's Victor can be just as annoying as Fonda's Corie. Fortyodd years ago this film might have seemed like something original but today it seems like one of those comedies which have failed to stand the test of time. For a film supposedly celebrating the joys of unconventionality it comes across as very dull and conventional. 410".

There is no attempt to open the action up or to take advantage of the greater freedoms offered by the cinematic medium and the whole film seems very static and stagebound. The film stars Robert Redford andJane Fonda both rising young stars in 1967 they had also starred together in The Chase the previous year and were later to do so again in The Electric Horseman. In this film however their styles of acting do not really blend well together. Fonda's acting is somewhat exaggerated and theatrical as indeed is that of Mildred Natwick as Ethel and Charles Boyer as Victor whereas Redford's is much more naturalistic and cinematic even though Redford had created the role of Paul in the original Broadwayshow whereas Fonda had not appeared in that production. As a result Corie never comes across as a very sympathetic character Fonda's rather showy acting making her seem ludicrously overemotional the sort of woman who is either berating her husband for failing to kiss her with sufficient ardour or screaming at him that she wants a divorce just a few days into their marriage. Her suggestion about running barefoot in the park seems less like freespiritedness than like pure stupidity given that the action takes place in a cold and snowy February. The desire to be unconventional is not a good reason for risking frostbite. When Paul under the influence of alcohol does start to behave in a more spontaneous manner Corie is predictably horrified and demands that he revert to his old stuffedshirt self. Saks was to achieve more success with some of his later Simon adaptations for the screen such as The Odd Couple or Brighton Beach Memoirs but Barefoot in the Park is a disappointment. The script is never witty enough to compensate for the uninteresting plot and the unsympathetic characters. Boyer's Victor can be just as annoying as Fonda's Corie. Fortyodd years ago this film might have seemed like something original but today it seems like one of those comedies which have failed to stand the test of time. For a film supposedly celebrating the joys of unconventionality it comes across as very dull and conventional. 410";

I assume they changed the name to The Cavern just in case WIthIns reputation had preceded it.After paying the cable rental for this movie I considered saving my household garbage for a month and mailing it to the writerdirector. He had his garbage delivered to my home so I thought it only fair that I return the favor.The movie opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they picked Kazakhstan maybe the writer is a fan of the Ali G Show. But they should have just started inside the cave because the outside was obviously not Kazakhstan. It was the first clue that I was going to hate the movie.The movie has no redeeming qualities save one it's consistent. Everything is terrible. The writing the directing the acting the cinematographyevery aspect of this film is just bad. And I like bad films goofy films Bhorror films . . . but this was just plain bad. And stupid. And hackneyed. And predictable. And boring.To get a feel for the film go into your laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Put a flashlight turned on into your dryer and start it tumbling. Now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs. That's it.For a complete reenactment have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room play dead on the floor. Toss Karo syrup on them. Turn the lights back on stop the dryer. Now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing.FINADDENDUM Reading through the other comments many find it remarkable this movie was made on a low budget. That's not remarkable. Making a crap movie on a HUGE budget is remarkable Waterworld. Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable like Blair Witch which I thoroughly enjoyed. Making a crap movie on a low budget isn't a bit surprising and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because I can't imagine anybody would hand them a pile of cash after watching this.Is the low budget an excuse for a terrible film? No and it's certainly no reason to watch it. Would you eat a dogdung sandwich just because it was cheap to make?The IMDb rating for this film over time will be interesting to watch. It should trend farther downward but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can outpace the movie makers' ability to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars.".

Film also requires light to work. Perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen. I know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time.For that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth.A last note to the director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake CGI campfire. I honestly can't for the life of me think of one.Now on to the screenwriter. Try to make at least one character likable. I'd prefer two or more but one decent person I can root for or care about might help. Also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story.If you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it. And try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Not only is this the worst horror film I've seen its one of the worst films period. The majority of the film is an abysmal assault on the senses but the ugly repugnant ending is what really seals the deal.This is a special kind of movie in its badness. Its not so bad its good. Its not so bad it can be riffed on seriously try it and you'll be hard pressed to find anything to make fun of. Like other reviewers have stated its just plain unwatchable. I seriously question the mental wellbeing of anyone who found The Cavern legitimately entertaining.Let's start with the filmmaking and script which are astonishingly poor. The film is set in Kazakhstan even though its referred to as Russia in the movie itself and on the IMDb plot summary. I didn't know the Kazakhstani wilderness looked so much like the California desert. The characters are all bland and uninteresting so we have no reason to care about them. Why would one of the characters go caving on the anniversary of the death of a loved one's death as a result of a caving accident? The lighting is just terrible all the scenes in the cave are lit only with headlamps. This wouldn't be so bad if we could tell what's going on but none of the light reflects off the cave walls since its always shining directly into the camera. The epileptic flash photography sequences don't help either. This makes for a very disorienting experience. My best guess is they were attempting to recreate The Descent a cave film that also used no studio lighting. Here's the difference The Descent was made by competent filmmakers who knew how to utilize the low light levels to create suspense while still showing the audience what was going on. The blinding headlamps coupled with the frantic editing in The Cavern make the narrative almost incomprehensible. There were a couple dumb moments I was able to pick out though. One of the characters suggests they douse their headlamps so the creature won't see them. That would do literally nothing since cavedwelling animals are typically blind and rely entirely on their other senses. Another character suggests they split up. It may be a horror cliche but splitting up is one of the worst things you can do in a situation like that!So far the movie has been really bad. But the ending? You ain't seen nothing yet!In the final scene the two surviving girls wake up naked by an obviously fake CGI fire in the cave wrapped in animal fur blankets. They find a picture from 1980 of what looks like a 10yearold boy. Rather hilariously they eat some cooked meat only to find its the charred remains of one of their friends. A caveman with a burnt face is revealed to be the attacker. In a confusing flashback its revealed that the boy in the picture survived a plane crash and decided to become a caveman. How has this boy who I assume had no survival experience at the time survive more than a week? This raises so many more questions like how does a normal human move giant rocks by himself see in the dark and survive gunshots? The creatures in The Descent had abilities and weaknesses within reason and the fact they evolved in caves was a believable excuse as to why they were so good at moving in the dark. The fact the monster is a normal human is absolutely stupid.But wait it gets worse...Up to this point the film has been insultingly stupid and incompetent but the last 20 seconds is where it goes from abysmal to morally reprehensible. The last 20 seconds is a blast of badly edited shaky cam and screaming. I had no idea what was happening and I assumed he killed them. Then I looked up the plot summary on Wikipedia and it turns out that he killed one and raped the other. I went back through that final scene frame by frame and could vaguely make out that that was indeed what was happening.Here's the problem you can't end your movie midrape! Not only does it make for a deplorable dissatisfying experience that leaves a sour taste in the viewer's mouth but it simply doesn't work artistically. What do most movies have the The Cavern doesn't? The answer is elevation. I have no problem with unhappy or unsatisfying endings. Films like Se7en John Carpenter's The Thing Funny Games and even The Descent may not have happy endings but they all serve an artistic purpose and give the audience something to think about. The ending of The Cavern makes me think if a rape victim saw this the last thing they'd see before the credits is a reminder of what is most likely the most traumatizing experience of their lives with no light at the end of the both physical and metaphorical tunnel. I have no problem with the inclusion of a rape scene as long as there's a point. Honestly the fact that the rape scene is the ending is what bothers me so much. I wouldn't be so mad if there was more after the rape. If for example the scene suddenly cut to black and was followed by a sequence of killing the beast and finding a way out it wouldn't be the greatest thing ever but it would have at least given this dumpster fire some kind of elevating resolution. Some connection between the main characters entering the cave which looks vaguely like a vagina and two of the characters having consensual sex early on in the film with a dweller of the cave having nonconsensual sex may be intended but you can't just end a movie there!I rarely ever give a movie a 0 because to do so implies I can't understand how anyone could get anything positive out of the experience. However The Cavern really is THAT BAD to me.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to pick this DVD up in the shop read the blurb and think that sounds quite good I'll spend 10 and buy it. all I got at the end of it was a 10 coaster. Absolutely awful I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing to say about it. The plot is basically 7 people go into an unexplored cave one of them is a reporter. noone else knows they are there. When they get in the cave they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster. There turns out to be no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either just a rubbish attempt at character building I assume? Anyway The monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life. This for no reason makes him superhuman able to glow see in the dark take bullets breathe underwater be in 2 places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders carry grown men as dead weight etc. In the end scene there are 2 women left alive they wake up naked just covered in some bit of rug or something. They then find a picture of a kid. The Monster then bursts in the door wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull if so that would be the frekin biggest crow I have seen in my life and quite literally goes Raaahhh like a kiddie on Halloween. I was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. The guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave. That is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one cut to end credits. I know the rape scene was designed to be shocking but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film. He could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene.There are so many things that are left unanswered at the end. Aside from all this the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point I almost turned it off. An absolutely terrible film. You might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it it would be money better spent as like some clever person posting above me said once you've watched it you can't un watch it.".

	schema:headline " People are unfairly voting this movie a 10.";
	schema:reviewBody "First let me say that those of you that voted it 10 are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level... something that this movie doesn't deserve. The only movies deserving a 10 IMO are the classics... Godfather Shawshank etc. Look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list. I also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave. Though I would have to agree with them on the surroundings they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole... they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review. That would be like me voting a 10 for the movie From Justin to Kelly because I think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the Florida Keys... though that may be true it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid.I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick something else picks up or makes up for the weakness. Ex.  Bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot andor great camera work and scenery. We started the DVD and it all started out fairly normal. We jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die... after a brief bit of driving and hiking they set up camp for the night. At that moment I keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film. Two main problems I had Bad effects and an even worse story line. The first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires weren't real... you can plainly see the cgi or fake flames that they were all sitting at. For a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what I was in for the next hour.Only minutes later I was shown how poorly written this film was. I don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point but basically we find out that the token Nerd is writing a book about exploring caves etc. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience but hesitates stating I don't want this story in your book. The author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. A direct quote If I tell you the story you will definitely want it in your book. At this point I was fully expecting a nice 5 minute story complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. What I got was a short poorly told and acted statement. I say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don't remember the exact quotes but basically he says We were in a cave the cave flooded a girl died as our friend watched her drown. You may think I am over exaggerating and being really critical but that isn't far off from a direct quote line for line from the movie scene.Over the next 50 minutes or so the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what I would imagine to be like in a cave I could have really done without the really fuzzyhazy look to the film and the camera shaking is just one that I didn't go for. I have really good vision and after watching the main parts of the film I felt like I was legally blind. I was emotionally detached from this movie therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't. Maybe had I been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film I would have at least been scared but I don't remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the action scenes.The last scene was probably one I will never forget and that isn't a good thing. Basically two women are trapped in a room naked. The monster comes in to attackkill the women... he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. A flashback occurs where we find out that the monster was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Cut back to present time and he takes his mask a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt. He glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the caveman's weaknesssoft spot. At that point he stabs and kills one girl then proceeds to rape the other woman rather graphically. After about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her roll the credits movie's over.Honestly if I had to do it all over and I wasted money on renting this movie I could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that I have now.Those of you comparing this to Blair Witch are way off... if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of Blair would realize how revolutionary it was... handing each cast member a script the daynight of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius.If IMDb would let me it would get a negative score... I don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an XFile. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. Not being a caver it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic. There is entirely too much unnecessary PANNICK from supposedly experienced cavers by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves or I hope you all die by the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. A moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters. While you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor. It just wasn't necessary. I suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel. I've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme. You pay for the materials to make the film before you go in but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this film on its low budget.".

I don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things like aliens demons or good acting! They were stupid too Let's go have intimate relations in a cave! With all of our clothes on! Speaking of which the ending somewhat contradicts what Domingo said immediately before he died. This bugged me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a... serious invasion of one girl's privacy.No plot no climax no good acting terrible camerawork. What's left? Oh right. The ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film. Sixth Sense does it explains a lot. Hide and Seek did too. But the Cavern had a lame twist that served as an 'explanation' if you could call it that as it doesn't. Explain. Anything.Don't see it.

Talk about so bad it made me laugh!Firstly I estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length I couldn't tell what was happening or indeed even what I was seeing. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments minutes long where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall people and various other unidentifiable stuff. I spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening but they couldn't follow it any better than me.Then there are the black moments when in an effort to scare us woooooooo everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black  and I don't just mean for a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I guess blank film is one way to keep costs down...I suspect the director had recently read a book on all the mustdo's to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in  about 20 times each.There are three good things about this film 1 It's short at 90 minutes though still an hour and a half too long! 2 All the characters die after all it's impossible to care about any of them. 3 There was one genuinely good scene  when the group are looking up the shaft they came down after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom saw THAT coming a large boulder is pushed across the opening sealing them in. I WASN'T expecting that and it was genuinely chilling.And what's with the early campfire scenes with the shot after shot after shot panning from behind the camp lights. I swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes.And I'm positive that after the first kill the EXACT same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds.All in all a CRAP piece of film making. I'll watch almost anything but this is close to where I'd draw the line.".

	schema:reviewBody "Monday October 02 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese takeout turned off the lights and pushed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However The Cavern released on DVD this October was most certainly a let down. It seemed promising meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present a cannot be omitted sex scene and the all too familiar prespook when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy. Then finally when it got down to the nitty gritty I was ready for some real gore action. The director I admit was keen. Of course you would have to be to fill in an entire 81 minutes with people running back and forth in a space about 10ft wide. It all begins when some college bound cavers get together for yet another cave dive. They all seem like seasoned pros very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience. This time they bring a newby along some annoying photographer too blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the full dangers of cave diving. As they descend deep into what they call Hell Pit they soon realize that they are not alone in the chasm of death. I will politely leave out any spoilers if you are naive enough to not heed my advice and avoid wasting your time. Although the atmosphere and background music was spooky and there was sure a lot of blood and gore when the moments approached to witness some actual dismemberment it was more like watching porn without the full frontal. The camera work was purposefully dark and sketchy. I guess the director used it for effect. I suppose the thing I like most about the movie were the moving characters. They deserved Acadamy Awards for those touching bickering scenes. I almost shed a tear when they finally got it... A tear for joy! If you like dry horror soft porn and you hated Braveheart. Then this is the right movie for your next Saturday night.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was refreshing to finally see a movie where the inside of a cave is portrayed realistically! I am an excaver spelunker and for them to get the shots they did using the little light that comes from lanterns in a cave was amazing without using backlight that was obvious. It drives me nuts to see cave movies where large areas of the cave are lit enough to see using mere flashlights and headlamps. At best you get a spot that you can pan around even with the best of lamps. With all the humidity you need a focused beam not a wide angle. With a wide angle you can see about four feet. Regarding previous comments there were no lens flare effects! Caves are humid. They swallow up light and what you see in this movie is exactly what it is like in a cave. Amazingly black. It can be terrifying in a cave. Even in cramped areas the angles of the surfaces do not reflect light directly but rather dissipate it even when wet.That being said I don't think they had room to get any better action shots than they did. The movie brought to me a true nostalgic sense of the cave environment with a wonderful twist of terror. Yes there was a lot of screaming. I guess people do that when they're afraid! The monster is cheesy but it is explained in the end and makes sense. The end could have been fleshed out better but all in all it was a fun ride while it lasted.I would recommend this rental for anyone who wants to understand what it is like to go caving without the benefit of stage lighting. Watch it in the dark too. When I rented it it was called Cavern.".

The ending was really dumb and made me wish I would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early. Pretty good acting considering there wasn't much to go with. If you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting even for a caveand bad camera work even for a cave... then you'll really like this movie. By the way if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so how could he have forgotten how to speak and built up so much anger?? Wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later?".

The historically inaccurate script caused him deep embarrassment. In his history of Rome Caesar and Christ 1944 Durant had already printed the real story.Outside of that this 70mm color epic is as one reviewer put it eye Candy. As usual for these types of productions the behindthecamera professionals did a splendid job. The movie is breathtaking. Just sit back and enjoy the cinematography especially of the luscious Sophia Loren. The script isn't halfbad Christopher Plummer works very hard on the character of Commodus even though he is too old in the beginning Commodus was only 19 when he became Emperor.The producer built an exact replica of the Roman Forum in Spain and it is spectacular it was afterwards used by historians for research purposes.I will single out one actor Finlay Currie. From Ivanhoe to Quo Vadis BenHur to this film he always landed a wonderful commanding and lovely presence to the epictype of film.

Some of the marching scenes were a bit lengthy for my tastes but the soldiers the horses the armor the swords and spears all of it were very authentic and impressive.  Second as the armies look more realistic so do the sets.  We do not see the coliseum in this film but we do see the palaces pools forts and throne rooms.  Very exciting.  Third and perhaps most importantly this film has superior acting.  Christopher Plummer is probably the best thing here  his Commodus is at once more dastardly and more likeable than that of Gladiator again this means more realistic.  James Mason is also in top form here for once he does not play a slippery philanderer.There is something flawed about this film that I can't quite put my finger on.  It does not reach the heights of other 50s and 60s epics such as The Ten Commandments or BenHur.  Still it is a dramatic and at times moving film.  It does convey the gravity some might say tragedy of the Empire's fall and the pax romana that never was.".

That isn't the case at all time has been kind to Mann's epic showing it to be one of the better more intelligent sword and sandal epics to have surfaced in cinema history. Massive in scope and production values it harks back to a time when epic actually meant just that. A huge cast list is supplemented by thousands of extras all cloaked by real scenery and expertly crafted sets with not a CGI sequence in sight. Scripting is literate where three separate writers combine to tell a tale of political intrigue violence romance glory and greed the ultimate spun narrative of a system collapsing from within. While the action is superbly marshalled by Mann as it flits in and out of the dialogue driven story. Be it the snow laden campaign against the Germanic Barbarians or an exciting chariot duel Mann shows himself to be adroit in the art of scene construction.It's not all perfect the length at over three hours asks much of the casual observer the production for sure is grand but some of the longer character exchanges could easily have been trimmed.

Guinness classy Mason likewise and a terrific Plummer grand egomaniacal villainyhimself stepping in when Richard Harris bailed dominate proceedings while Tiomkin's Academy Award nominated score is stirring and itself epic in production.An essential film for the historical epic fan The Fall of the Roman Empire is a lesson in adult sword and sandalry. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The inspiration and source material for GLADIATOR in case you hadn't noticed. This particular historical romp coming very late in the epic cycle in the 60's was a masterpiece of script direction and set construction. You may have thought the Colosseum in GLADIATOR was impressive  digitised though it was but compare it to the jawdropping scenes in Commodus' Rome  and they BUILT those!  Ridley Scott used LESS than 50 people in his Colosseum scenes  every ONE of the thousands of Roman citizens you see are there! To film this today with the same realism would cost 600800000 perhaps one billion plus! Other scenes such as the funeral of Aurelius are simply spinaltap if you have the slightest understanding of what you are seeing. Most people didn't  leaving the theater even in the 60's feeling they'd just sat through a history seminar rather than an entertaining movie. I suppose it comes down to WHAT exactly entertains you?  Master director Martin Scorcese an extremely literate man himself singled this movie out as one to study for those interested in the history of American Film...I wonder why?Curiously the role of Marcus Aurelius was the highlight acting wise of both THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE and GLADIATOR. Sir Alec Guinness gave us a totally masterful and benevolent emperor here in just the same way that the late Richard Harris dominated GLADIATOR during his onscreen moments. The film was one to LISTEN to to reflect on...not too munch popcorn and watch the big men fly! James Mason as Timonides gave one of his most enduring and touching roles....he was actually injured during that scene with the lance and was unable to film for a few days.Comments that Boyd was wooden and Plummer over the top irritate me also. Livius was a noble man of integrity  that's how Boyd portrayed him these weren't times for offthecuff humor. Similarly evidence exists that Commodus himself was not the thinking man's choice of emperor  cruel vengeful and way leftfield of normal! Plummer brought all this out rather well I thought. It doesn't matter a whole lot to me OR Anthony Mann I suppose what YOU thought about it!  Sophia Loren? Not your average legally blonde Romanic bimbo either.  The epitome of poise and elegance...way too wooden for the new millennium!I believe the FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is right up there with BEN HUR and Stanley Kubrick's SPARTACUS. Most any intelligent and perceptive person would agree! I would happily have watched it for 280 minutes!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw another reviewer remark that he regretted the fact that films like this are not made today. In today's dollars the salaries of all the name actors who appeared in The Fall of the Roman Empire might retire the debt of some third world country. Then again I think that was part of the message this film was trying to convey.All roads lead to Rome was certainly a popular saying way back in the day. The legions by 180 have conquered a big chunk of Europe and a lot of Asia Minor but it's becoming too big to police. Emperor Marcus Aurelius has it in mind that there must be a better way of securing peace than having a big Roman military industrial complex on the empire payroll. Answer make the outlying provinces all Roman citizens and equalize the distribution of economic goods. Back then all those Roman roads gradually became one way streets.Unfortunately some folks who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo do in Marcus. He's succeeded by his son Commodus and the film is the story of Commodus who has a more traditional political view and those who want to bring about the ideal world that Marcus Aurelius envisioned.In a role that cried out for either Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston we got Stephen Boyd instead. Boyd in a blonde dye job just doesn't come across well as the hero Livius. He's so much better as villains in films like The Bravados BenHur and Shalako.But Commodus may very well have been Christopher Plummer's finest performance on screen. The film is not the real story of Commodus's reign but Plummer does capture the heart and soul of the emperor who ran things from 180 to 192. Holding up the view of a free and equal world are a couple of classic performances by Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius and James Mason as the Greek slave Timonides who counsels Marcus in his changing world view.And any film is worth watching with Sophia Loren's pulchritude on prominent display.I'm no expert in ancient history but this may have been the first time that someone like Marcus Aurelius took a global view of things other than what I can plunder out of my conquests. What's not told in this story is that Christianity is invisible here. Marcus didn't like them at all thought they were way too exclusive in THEIR view of things.Nevertheless The Fall of the Roman Empire and the issues it raises from the ancient world are still being thrashed out today. Hoperfully it will all be resolved in the future.".

	schema:headline " Short review of a long movie";
	schema:reviewBody "FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the last big budgeted Sandal epics of which started in the 1950s QUO VADIS THE ROBE and lasted a good 15 years before dying a quick death. 1964 seems to be the year when the genre died whether in the big Biblical style or the pulpy Sword  Sandal genre. And it's not surprising FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE failed so miserably. It's not a bad movie. It's a meticulously well mounted film based on a dire script. The actual historical events were too complex to cover in one film even in a 3 hour film but the script for FOTRE is so bad that it was almost impossible for anyone to make something palatable out of it.In the first 45 minutes we watch Alec Guiness as Marcus Aurelius dying. That's it. What a dreary and long start. And then for the next 2 hours we see everyone debating the end of Rome. Again fun viewing. I love serious movies but the screenplay and direction was illconceived here who wants to watch an old man dying for the first 45 minutes of a 3 hour film only to be followed by more moaning and groaning? The length of the movie already demanded a lot from viewers and the dour dark tone of the movie was too much for them to sustain interest. After the first deathly dull 45 minutes the film never recovered afterwards.Other things like miscast actors no one and I mean no one seems to be related. Alec is Sophia's father? Sophia and Christopher Plummer are siblings? Stephen Boyd was a befuddled looking actor. Boyd and Sophia have no chemistry whatsoever. There's a certain amount of predictability to everything certainly in regards to the James Mason character and what happens with the Barbarians. If a film is predictable in its direction and it's 3 hours long the film suddenly feels like 5 hours. And as a fan of big scores the music in FOTRE is not memorable at all and this is during one of the best decades for film scores. All these elements create a film that falls resolutely flat. It's unfortunate because the resources were there. The sets in Rome are stunning and there is one good battle scene. The tone certainly at the end is effectively Apocalyptic but it's too little too late. The passion seen at the end should have been present from the start. There's no doubt that Ridley Scott was eh inspired by this film when he made the overrated GLADIATOR. The whole beginning of GLADIATOR is almost a scene by scene copy of the beginning in FOTRE. Though more visually pleasing than the dreary FOTRE GLADIATOR is kid's stuff compared to the Anthony Mann film. The 1964 film respected the intelligence of its audience while the Russell Crowe flick is mere junk food. Oscar winning junk food that is.All in all THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is a somewhat fascinating misfire. It could also be called THE FALL OF THE ROMAN INSPIRED MOVIES. It's sad that this film killed the Sword  Sandal genre back in the 1960s.".

	onyx:emotionText "FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the last big budgeted Sandal epics of which started in the 1950s QUO VADIS THE ROBE and lasted a good 15 years before dying a quick death. 1964 seems to be the year when the genre died whether in the big Biblical style or the pulpy Sword  Sandal genre. And it's not surprising FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE failed so miserably. It's not a bad movie. It's a meticulously well mounted film based on a dire script. The actual historical events were too complex to cover in one film even in a 3 hour film but the script for FOTRE is so bad that it was almost impossible for anyone to make something palatable out of it.In the first 45 minutes we watch Alec Guiness as Marcus Aurelius dying. That's it. What a dreary and long start. And then for the next 2 hours we see everyone debating the end of Rome. Again fun viewing. I love serious movies but the screenplay and direction was illconceived here who wants to watch an old man dying for the first 45 minutes of a 3 hour film only to be followed by more moaning and groaning? The length of the movie already demanded a lot from viewers and the dour dark tone of the movie was too much for them to sustain interest. After the first deathly dull 45 minutes the film never recovered afterwards.Other things like miscast actors no one and I mean no one seems to be related. Alec is Sophia's father? Sophia and Christopher Plummer are siblings? Stephen Boyd was a befuddled looking actor. Boyd and Sophia have no chemistry whatsoever. There's a certain amount of predictability to everything certainly in regards to the James Mason character and what happens with the Barbarians.

	schema:headline " A Fine Civilized and Thoughtful Script Beautifully Mounted";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a long epicscale and thoroughlyabsorbing film. It is better appreciated now than it was when it was first released. The time of this film is the reign of Marcus Aurleius and his son Commodus. Aurelius was the last of the good emperors of Rome who tried to rule wisely and spread the Pax Romana Commodus was so incompetent and halfmad that he ended any chance the empire's Senate might have had to embrace a thoroughgoing regime of civil improvement trade inclusion and agrarian reform. In this huge Samuel Bronston production camera genius and director Anthony Mann and screenwriters Philip Yordan Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina have given us a splendid recreation of the era many exciting scenes and many fine dialogue scenes. The Roman Forum set has never been equaled the fort in Germania is spectacular the Senate the temple the Roman rooms and the outdoor scenes are all splendidly realized. Note needs to be made of the contributions of John Moore and Veniero Colasanti who did both the sets and costumes and Robert Krasker the cinematographer. Dimitri Tiomkin's music is very fine albeit there is as usual too much of it. In the cast plaudits go to James Mason as the philosopher and Christopher Plummer as the mad emperor Not far behind are Stephen Boyd as Livius John Ireland Anthony Quayle Eric Porter Andrew Keir and Sophia Loren as Drusilla. It is interesting to note that Yakima Canutt who did Ben Hur's chariot race was secondunit director for the chariot fight in this spectacular also. The main reason the film has not been appreciated is probably the mistakes made in a few places and the overlong opening sequence. Try watching this brilliant historical film from the point where Alec Guinness a very good Aurelius greets ambassadors from all over the world I suggest the rest of the film holds together very logically from that point on. The climax is a duel between Livius and Commodus with javelins a mass burning of victims and a denouement and ending leading to a great tagline noting that great civilizations perish from within. In this film along with some Hollywood liberties the viewer is privileged to watch a civilization die of the same elements that doomed Britain's empire and every other one beginning with the idea of mystical and infallible leadership. A lively and memorable experience of a film one epic not to be missed.".

	schema:headline " A Great Drama but not a film for everyone.";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of this film is perhaps a little misleading but one who sees it will understand its appropriateness.  When emperor Marcus Aurelius is poisoned his bratty son Commodus siezes the throne and turns Rome into a mess.  The chosen heir Livius and Aurelius' daughter Lucilla try to save the empire but in the end the actions of Commodus begins the long fall of the Roman Empire. Modern movie fans might find this plot strangely familiar.  If so this is because it was shamelessly stolen in the wildly popular but not to mention horrendous movie Gladiator.  One cannot review this film today without considering its influence on Gladiator.  Major plot elements such as Commodus' rise to the throne Lucilla's love for a Roman soldier and Commodus' final demise were later used in Gladiator.  By my rating system which readers of my reviews have found to be horribly biased The Fall of the Roman Empire was far better than its successor.  This comes from a combination of a number of aspects.  These include the literate script the excellent cast and the filmmakers' successful attempt to avoid insulting their viewers' intellegence. The script is written in the form of high drama.  In fact while watching it I forgot about everything else besides the interactions of the characters.  I actually cared about the fates of the characters while I wished that all of the characters in Gladiatior would die...quickly.  The dialogue is great several characters have eloquent speeches which work well here although speeches are usually slow and boring on screen.  Also the script has plenty of material to sustain it for its three hours' run.  It includes plenty of details and trivia which while not neccesary for understanding the plot were interesting for those who had prior knowledge of the subject. An allstar cast played in this epic.  The wonderful actors heightened my enjoyment of the picture.  Stephen Boyd did a great job as the good guy this time around in opposition to his role in BenHur.  Alec Guiness beautifully played the philosopher emperor Marcus Aurelius and I daresay he looked a fair amount like the real man.  It's a shame that his character had to die so early in the film.  James Mason also did a great job as the freedman and Aurelius' loyal friend Timonides.  But by far my favorite performance was that of Christopher Plummer as Commodus the spoiled playboy of an emperor.  He sold me as the childish hedonistic boy who began the empire's demise.  He didn't seem at all tortured and brooding like Joachim Pheonix in Gladiator which wasn't very convincing but he acts like the cruel greedy kid that history remembers. But the most compelling element of the picture was the fact that the filmmakers tried and succeeded not to insult my intellegence.  This was not done in Gladiator as can be seen in my review.  While The Fall of the Roman Empire is similar to Gladiator in many ways it succeeds in this department where its successor fails.  In my review of Gladiator I pointed out two things that the movie ignored entirely the fall of the Roman Empire and Christianity.  In this film both aspects are dealt with.  The first is obvious it's the title of the movie.  The decline of the empire is very obvious throughout the picture as Commodus drives it into the ground with his idiocy.  While this film discusses only the beginning of the fall reference is made to the fact that the fall will be long and painful in a speech by a senator Finlay Currie in the Senate House.  One has to pay special attention to catch the second aspect Christianity.  If you watch the film look the emblem worn by Timonides at the end.  Suddenly a scene in which he is tortured by the barbarians and does not scream begins to make much more sense.  Finally while the speech by Lucilla in Gladiator that we should all return to a happy republic made me angry the ending of The Fall of the Roman Empire was much more realistic and closer to historical fact the praetorians auctioned off the Empire to the highest bidder. There were a few other aspects of the film that I enjoyed to a high degree.  The battle scenes seemed more realistic as they were allout brawls and not highly coreographed killing dances like those in Gladiator. No one fights like a jedi knight here.  The costumes were quite convincing and those silly Roman brushes look less ridiculous each time I see another history epic.  But the most impressive aspect of the film were the awesome sets of the German fortifications and especially the Roman Forum.  The Forum was huge!  Having visited Rome I was amazed at how well they Forum and the Capitoline were reconstructed.  Especially wellused sets were that of the Temple of Jove which in life has been replaced by an art museum and the Curia or Senate house which was rebuilt by Il Duce himself. But as in any film there were some aspects that detracted from it. I thought that overall it was rather clumsy the editing and shooting seemed rough and not altogether refined.  The score at first seemed overdone and obnoxious but by the end of the movie it had grown on me and I was greatly enjoying it.  Lastly it is available only in a lowquality transfer to VHS and it can only be found in specialty video rental stores such as the Boulder Video Station.  Since it's so long it must be put on two tapes.  However the film has no intermission and the first tape stops in the middle of an important scene.  I might buy it if it were available on DVD. In conclusion I believe that The Fall of the Roman Empire was an excellent film for a certain demographic.  It is not a film for everyone but many might find it an interesting and rewarding film to watch.".

The cast is outstanding a movie of the league of Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. Pity that no more movies like that are made nowadays.I still remember some of the words by Commodus after becoming Caesar let it be heard in the four quarters of the Empire that I Commodus now Caesar proclaim Gaius Metelus Livius Pro Consul of the Roman Empire Commander in Chief of all the Roman armies second only to Caesar himselfAn epic indeed.";

Some of the scenes are sluggish but the film is worth seeing despite its length. I noticed obvious echos of BEN HUR  Stephen Boyd's character having an old friendship with another character chariot racing and the souring of the friendship. Tiomkin gets a bit carried away with the soundtrack as he did in many of his film scores but here it seems especially annoying.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie interesting for two reasons 1 I love historical epics 2 It was so surprisingly awful in spots for such a great cast and obviously large budget.There was some good acting here but it seems everyone had some really bad moments in front of the camera. This is probably the first movie I've seen were Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius is just awful. His portrayal of a dying Caesar is lifeless pun intended and flat. His character was totally lacking the charisma one might expect from a great caesar. The scene of him greeting the representatives of the Roman provinces seems to last any eternity seeming to even strain Alec Guinness' attention span.James Mason on the most part was good but even his acting was rather comical in the scene in which he is being torturedtested by the Barbarians in a cave.Christopher Plummer and Stephen Boyd as Commodus and Livius are both unintentionally comical I think in their early scenes together especially in the scenes were they are reunited after an apparently long separation. The scenes were meant to show their long standing friendship since childhood but instead it looks like two 30 year olds acting as 14 year olds. Stephen Boyd is fairly panfaced throughout the movie however Christopher Plummer's performance at least gets more interesting as the movie progresses.The dialog between Sophia Loren as Lucilla and Stephen Boyd was stilted and lacking the real emotion of lovers. At least Plummer was capable of extracting some passion out of Boyd in their scenes together.As far as productiondirectionediting they obviously had plenty of film at their disposal as there frequently were long drawn out scenes of inconsequential marching parades etc or perhaps I'm just use to the MTVage quick cutting. The musical score was almost comical as highly dramatic scenes would be underscored by fairly lighthearted music. And why do all the Barbarians look like they have yellow mops on their heads? And why do they look like cavemen? Overall however somehow this movie held my attention both for the story it had to tell and for how aweinspiringly bad it is for such a grand spectacle.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Americans have always depicted the West in extremely romantic terms  with the horse that runs to his master's whistle. They have never treated the West seriously just as we have never treated ancient Rome seriously. Perhaps the most serious debate on the subject was made by Kubrick in the film Spartacus the other films have always been cardboard fables. It was this superficiality that struck and interested me.  Sergio Leone I wouldn't call Kubrick's Spartacus a serious debate Kubrick disowned the film precisely because it lacks complexity but there is a sense that epics of yesteryear despite their flaws nevertheless possess an intelligence which modern epics lack. Think for example Lean's Lawrence of Arabia Ray's 55 Days in Peking Houston's The Man Who Would be King Kubrick's Spartacus and even lesser films like Viva Zapata Ben Hur and El Cid. Not to mention those unconventional epics by guys like Visconti Welles Leone Kubrick Kurosawa Jancso Ran 2001 A Space Odyssey Satyricon Chimes at Midnight Red and White Kagemusha The Leopard Duck You Sucker etc.Are there any epics today that match this stuff. Troy? Alexander? Kingdom of Heaven? Gladiator? Lord of the Rings? The Last Samurai? Avatar? I don't think so. Despite advances in technology and photography these films are content to latch onto epically stupid and derivative screenplays.Anthony Mann's The Fall Of The Roman Empire is at times a clunky film but it nevertheless possess a certain substance which modern fare and imitative stuff like Gladiator lacks. The film opens with Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his slave Timonides philosophising about pleasure and pain Aurelius eventually confessing that he had a childhood anxiety in which he feared that the sun might never rise. This tone  the feeling that all life exists on that thin boundary between day and night between existence and nonexistence  permeates the entire film.We're then introduced to several other characters. There's Lucilla Sophia Loren the melancholy daughter of the Emperor who both idolises her father and hates her mother's constant schemes plots and infidelities. She also hates the fact that she has to for political reasons marry the King of Armenia in order to secure an ally on Rome's eastern front. Much scheming then follows in which cunning politicians attempt to kill the Emperor and replace him with his more malleable son Commodus.Commodus is a gladiator loving lug who indulges in combat and games of war. He knocks skulls and fights barbarians but is also the friend of Livius the man whom the Emperor has chosen as his successor. After the Emperor is assassinated a mild feud thus develops between Livius and Commodus. The politicians want Commodus to take the throne and he eventually does Livius too kind and humble to stand in his way.Unlike Joaquin Phoenix's version of the same character in Ridley Scott's Gladiator Commodus is not an incestuous creep but an illegitimate child with patricidal fantasies and delusions of grandeur. Narcissistic and tormented he cuts Rome's ties with all its starving colonies and begins to promote his own imperial grandeur. Rome then becomes a sort of extension of Commodus' inferiority complex an unconscious manifestation of his own psyche which inflates and inflates and then comes crashing down fatalistically crumbling the illusion no longer supportable.We then launches into several subplots which attempt to describe the historical causes of the empire's collapse rampant corruption over expansion civilisational clashes inequality trade problems the collapse of civic responsibility etc. These issues aren't handled in anything but the most basic ways but unless one adopts a far more abstract tone perhaps they can't be handled otherwise.The film then delineates the admittance of a barbarian tribe into the folds of Rome. The barbarians are presented to the senate and arguments made for them to be granted land and citizenship. Livius and Timonides argue that Rome must change and be flexible that it should cease conquering and allow tribes to freely join and trade whilst Commodus and his cronies argue in favour for continuing Rome's ruthless hegemony.Nevertheless the barbarians are given their own slice of land and a sort of relaxed multicultural Rome begins to form. Commodus detests this however and casually orders the massacre of Rome's barbarian citizens. Anthony Mann directed this picture so of course when the violence comes its a bit more hard hitting and realistically clumsy than other films of the era.The film ends with Commodus testing his divinity against Livius in a duel. Like the final battle in Gladiator they fight to the death Commodus dying in Livius' arms and Rome's pomp and pageantry along with it.7.510  Though one of the better swordandsandal epics this film really highlights the limitations of its genre. Despite its daringly downbeat screenplay the whole film oozes disillusionment the fetishizing of the film's huge sets is annoying the acting is stiff the production mechanical and the music intrusive. Comparisons to Spartacus and Gladiator are apt though Spartacus 1960 is far more affecting going for broad emotions less politics and more sweep whilst Gladiator is primarily a revenge tale. Incidentally it was David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia which introduced an aesthetic which suddenly made Hollywood epics feel clunky the rise of bloodier epics Zulu 1964 Italian epics Bonnie and Clyde etc and the twin box office failures of Mann's The Fall of the Roman Empire and Ray's 55 Days at Peking that pretty much marked the end of these big Hollywood productions.Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to Ben Hur Spartacus 55 Days at Peking and Lawrence of Arabia. Most of the other epics of the era  Cleopatra The 300 Spartans The Vikings El Cid Robe etc etc  haven't aged too well.".

On the negative side a fright wigged Stephen Boyd as Livius practically begs the audience to chuckle. Likewise Sophia Loren sporting about ten pounds of 1960's Italian Vogue makeup is wasted. She and Boyd are actors that could if given proper direction deliver decent performances. That direction was sadly lacking in this movie. At times when these two are together the movie feels like a Barbra Cartland Bodice ripper with hot declarations of love and long simmering stares at one another. The director obviously had no idea WHAT he wanted to do with the movie. Most egregiously the score was absolutely horrendous. That mishmash of genres and boring symphonic melodies clashed with almost every minute of screen time in which they were utilized. A worse example of a score I cannot imagine.And let us not forget the plot if it can be described as such. Somehow the meandering at cross purposes vague and boring plot managed to stretch 188 minutes into a seeming 188 THOUSAND waiting in vain for something to actually happen. Nothing really ever does.".

She and Boyd are actors that could if given proper direction deliver decent performances. That direction was sadly lacking in this movie. At times when these two are together the movie feels like a Barbra Cartland Bodice ripper with hot declarations of love and long simmering stares at one another. The director obviously had no idea WHAT he wanted to do with the movie. Most egregiously the score was absolutely horrendous. That mishmash of genres and boring symphonic melodies clashed with almost every minute of screen time in which they were utilized. A worse example of a score I cannot imagine.And let us not forget the plot if it can be described as such. Somehow the meandering at cross purposes vague and boring plot managed to stretch 188 minutes into a seeming 188 THOUSAND waiting in vain for something to actually happen. Nothing really ever does.";

HoHum! This film's running time was a staggeringly unbearable 188 minutes! Featuring some truly amazing sets plus 100s of extras horses chariots and plenty of parading around saying Hail Caesar! it took this film's story 45 minutes of senseless gabbing amongst its envious characters to finally get to its very first battle scene. And by that time my interest in all of this utter nonsense had seriously waned to the point of numbed indifference.I found that I couldn't give a sweet damn about any of the characters here including Alec Guinness's Marcus Aurelius who came across to me as being just a much younger version of his ObiWanKenobi character from Star Wars.In this story the egodriven actors either overacted their parts or else they underacted  But never once did any of them come across to me as being real people. Whoever they were portraying in the story may have been considered big  great in their day but their gutless performances rendered each and every one of them as small  petty to the max.Needless to say this Sword  Sandal epic was a boxoffice failure. It only managed to make back but onetenth of its 19 million costs upon its initial release back in 1964.This film's oncewealthy producer Samuel Bronston known for backing such expensive films as 1961's King Of Kings and El Cid went bankrupt as a result of this film and was pretty much never heard from in the movie business ever again.Personally I would never recommend this dreary picture to anyone. If it was skillfully edited down by a least an hour then perhaps its entertainment value could be much more tolerated and appreciated.Trivia note Actress Sophia Loren who played Lucilla was the highest paid cast member receiving an undeserved 1 million for her part.".
