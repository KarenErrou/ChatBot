It had a sophisticated kid feel to it with a really witty script. The three main kids are very fun to watch in action as super spies and their characters work well together. The adult actors are terrific and pull the movie together with their comic timing. The character that played Jeff at Game Ink was really funny also the cab driver. I thought William Davis was really well cast as Max's Uncle. At the end of the show everyone in the audience started clapping and whistling.

However the acting was really bad the character development was nonexistent and the special effects weren't very special for a 2005 movie. It's also entirely unbelievable but I expected that.Basically it just falls flat. It will not go down in history as a great movie nor spinoff into a TV show nor be the next must buy DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "On August 18th 1973 in Texas the youths Erin Jessica Biel her boyfriend Kemper Eric Balfour their friends Andy Mike Vogel and Morgan Jonathan Tucker and the hitchhiker Pepper Erica Leerhsen are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt Andrew Bryniarski where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.I was quite reluctant to see this remake. The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a classic and as I have already written in other reviews I do not see any reason to release remakes of movies mainly classics. However and although unnecessary this remake is very good. The cast leaded by the delicious Jessica Biel have good and convincing performances. The cinematography is great being very nasty in the property of Leatherface. In the end I liked this version and I even dare to recommend it. I believe the fans like me of the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will not be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Massacre da Serra Eltrica The Chainsaw Massacre".

	onyx:emotionText "On August 18th 1973 in Texas the youths Erin Jessica Biel her boyfriend Kemper Eric Balfour their friends Andy Mike Vogel and Morgan Jonathan Tucker and the hitchhiker Pepper Erica Leerhsen are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt Andrew Bryniarski where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.I was quite reluctant to see this remake. The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a classic and as I have already written in other reviews I do not see any reason to release remakes of movies mainly classics. However and although unnecessary this remake is very good. The cast leaded by the delicious Jessica Biel have good and convincing performances. The cinematography is great being very nasty in the property of Leatherface. In the end I liked this version and I even dare to recommend it. I believe the fans like me of the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will not be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Massacre da Serra Eltrica The Chainsaw Massacre";

It did a decent job building tension and there was a darker atmosphere to the location made it seem more nightmarish. Obviously the film had some advantages from a bigger budget and R. Lee Ermey is definitely worth watching. As for the family you had an almost twisted take on 'the dirty south' or in this case southwest people being more bizarre caricatures but with the darker and more atmospheric setting it works. Interstingly it seems to lack the social commentary of the original but that is very common with remakes these days. Though there is extensive use of rather effective foreshadowing in numerous scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNING It has been 30 years since the nation was shocked by the extreme carnage of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Now 30 years later and numerous horrible attempts to recreate it we are presented with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003.  It takes so much effort to create a remake that has the same shock value or scare tactics as the originals.  This is an example that had that success.  Although it was different it had its moments that everyone actually thought as if it were the original.  It is a hip and scary film with a new twist to the teen horror genre.  And as for recent horror films such as Cabin Fever Freddy vs. Jason Wrong Turn and Cold Creek Manor they add virtually nothing new to the genre.  This has the effect that had the theater screaming and talking about for weeks after.  Five estranged hormone driven teens are on a road trip to Dallas Texas for a Lynard Skinnard concert.  On the way they made a quick stop at the neighboring Mexico to buy a load of marijuana.  On their way they pick up a stunned and extremely traumatized hitchhiker.  Disturbing comments and a graphic suicide lead to the gritty violent content and gore that we are faced with. Scenes of graphic torture involve a guy getting his knee sawed off and being hung on a meat hook through the back.  Adding to the torturing it leads to rock salt being placed on the wound and where the knee once was.  The acting is surprisingly fresh and you become involved with the characters and find them greatly unfortunate instead of the way the victims usually die.  Most of time the characters are so dumb that you just want them to die.  In this movie it is a different story.  In the final clips of the film it shows actual footage' of the real mass murderer most commonly known as Leatherface.'  It gives a Blair Witchian style to it.  Disturbing and immensely scary I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to gore andor who scares easily.  I found myself glued to the screen not being able to take my eyes away for one moment.  This is definitely one of the top horror movies I have ever seen and it brings a brand new meaning to the words scary and disturbingly violent.  The killings are so realistic and the gore as well.  I would recommend this movie for any horror fan and anybody that enjoys a good scare. 1010".

I thought Jessica Biel did a great job shedding her WB persona and was totally believable as Erin yes fellas she's hot but I think it's her talent that really counts here. Big screen newcomer Mike Vogel made his pain seem so authentic that my skin crawled! And of course mad props to R. Lee Ermey who did a bang up job portraying the sometimes funny but ultimately disturbing county sheriff. Also worth mentioning was Lauren German as the teenage girl in the opening scene.There was only one thing that disappointed me and that was the persistent presence of Leatherface. For example the scene with him sewing the mask in the basement could have been taken out. I believe the less we see of him the more surreal and frightening he is when he is present.Other than that no real complaints. I thought the script was a fresh adaptation of the original. It wasn't the scariest movie but it was creepy and it did make me jump a couple times! And in response to critics who call the movie too brutal how can we call this movie more brutal than such acclaimed classics as Scarface The Godfather or more recently Kill Bill? I liked all of these movies but I can't agree that one form of violence is more acceptable or appropriate than another.But anyways if you do see TCM be sure to catch it while it's hot. Movies like this are always better when you have the reaction of the audience!".

	schema:reviewBody "I really love to see a horror movie and when a good movie comes along I'm very happy. I feel that a lot of people confuse what the real definition of horror actually is. According to the dictionary horror is defined as an intense painful feeling of repugnance and fear. I feel that this can used to also describe the horror genre of cinema. A horror movie must be intense and have it's audience on the edge of their seats. We have to dislike what happens to the characters to like the movie i.e. we don't want to see one of the main characters die but characters have to die in order for it to be horror. So horror has to be intense scary  having us fear elements within it and gory. Let's face it some people like intense movies that mess with your mind others like movies that make you jump and some people like a good oldfashioned gore fest.Now although I feel Hollywood needs to get new ideas and stop with remaking old movies I was really excited about one of the greatest pieces of horror being remade with today's technology and budget. I had a lot of expectations for this movie and for the most part I was not let down.There are SPOILERS from this point on mixed through out my review First the actual plot was quite good. You were led to actually have a feel for the characters which were decently developed and rounded. You truly feel the anguish and disgust of the characters. The development of the Hewitt family was interesting especially when we discover how large the family actually is and how they occupy the small town. The develop the idea that they have done this many times and are quite good at it. They develop leatherface's character of how he could kill so easily because he is deeply tormented by a troubled past from the mistreatment of his mother who was selfish and his own disfigurement from his disease. Each actor especially R. Lee Ermey did a great job portraying either the victims or the family.Next the direction was also good. I enjoyed the camera angles the colors the art the lighting and the choice of locations. I liked that the original narrator came back. However I did not enjoy the ending. I did like how it went back to the narration I'm talking about the actual end of events. I did not like how they left it so... empty. They didn't explain why they kept the baby why the teenager in the beginning was so excessively bloody I get it and I don't and how she just kind of escaped with no explanation of where she was going or what she was going to do. Other than that the direction was good. Now the intensity of the movie was excellent. The whole movie was an intense ride slowly pulling you in and then going crazy with some twists. To have intensity there must be elements that scare the audience and disgust them not so much gore more situations and circumstances. I felt this movie was scary and disturbing which makes it have great intensity.Finally the gore factor in the movie I felt was somewhat left out. I like psychological horror which this also can be considered but I love gore. I felt that they let me down a little bit through letting your mind show you what happened when I would have much rather just have been showed.There were enough deaths but they weren't bloody nor gory with the exception of two characters the hitchhiker's suicide and the teen on the hook whos leg was cut off and stabbed in the stomach. Although it had a lot of killing there was not enough gore which is essential to a horror movie.As a remake which turns many people off it does I feel an excellent job. It is not better than the original because the original is unique. It shaped much of horror and it was an excellent view of what horror should be. However the story changes and modifications were much needed. There was more gore in the remake considering the original had none. The remake was more frightening and much more realistic and I felt more sympathy for the characters where in the original I never cared much. The original will always be one of my favorite movies but this movie is an excellent choice for a remake. Hopefully this upped the bar for the horror genre so terrible movies are not made anymore. I give this 3 12 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very safe to say that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre1974 was a cultural phenomenon for horror movies and helped change the shape of the entire genre. The movie provided all the essential elements that are vital in horror movies because when it comes down to it these elements come from what the people want to see. We want to see the twisted things in our imaginations and nightmares come to life and what I love about TCM is it is something that could really happen to you. Sure the movie is a little cheesy now and I think Franklin was hilarious but its the direction that counts. To me Leatherface is the greatest killer of all time I like him better than Freddy. I love him because he is very stripped down he's not supernatural and reacts to pain like any normal human would. He has all the essentials such as a very creepy image and psychotic behavior. Nobody can hold a candle to Leatherface.Ok enough of that let me get on to the review of the REAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I will not say anything about the story because I want everyone to see it for themselves while knowing very little about the story. It takes a lot for a movie to impress me when the anticipation level is hitting the sky because I expect so much and usually always get disappointed this happened with Terminator 3. With the new TCM it stays true to the roots that made the first one a hit but this one BLEW me away.Lets start with the cast. Everyone was amazing and fit in perfectly. I had doubts about Jessica Biels at first but now I see her in a brand new light. I could see no ounce of weakness in any of the characters. The moods expressed throughout the movie were flawless and very convincing. The acting plays a huge role because the better the acting the more real the feel is thats when you step into the shoes of the people in the movie and live it out with them. This is what makes and breaks movies and I'm proud to say the cast delivered.The story line has been totally changed. This story is 100 times better than the original I was very impressed. There are far more twists and turns and because the storyline has such a high thrill value it keeps you glued to your seat. Our theater was packed and only 2 people that I know of left for bathroom breaks. I have never seen this happen before with a movie. Anyway the storyline could not have gotten any better. One reviewer said some of the stuff in the movie was predictable that is total BS this movie has so many turns that you have no idea whats going to happen next.Now onto the star of the movie LEATHERFACE. I thought nobody could top Gunnar Hansen from the first TCM but Leatherface in the new one is the best one I have ever seen. He is bigger scarier meaner and crazier than ever. He is the main focus as far as enemies go and I think its great this pretty much paid tribute to him and it shows everyone that he is the guy to be reckoned with. The moment he did the first kill I knew this movie was ON and had a feeling it would top any slasher movie ever made.In closing let me say that when this movie ended A LOT of people started clapping and cheering. I saw no disappointed faces leaving that theater and this was the first movie ever in which my high anticipation was exceeded let alone met. I don't care what ANYONE says the original while still a classic and will always be in our hearts can't even come close to this one. Storyline imagery jump scenes kills twists etc.. this movie has it ALL and leaves a lasting impression strong enough to make you want to go pay 7.50 all over again and again and again until you get sick of it. Michael Bay a lot of people doubted you when you signed on to this but I always defended you and let me say I know you have shut all those people up. Job well done!".

I saw no disappointed faces leaving that theater and this was the first movie ever in which my high anticipation was exceeded let alone met. I don't care what ANYONE says the original while still a classic and will always be in our hearts can't even come close to this one. Storyline imagery jump scenes kills twists etc.. this movie has it ALL and leaves a lasting impression strong enough to make you want to go pay 7.50 all over again and again and again until you get sick of it. Michael Bay a lot of people doubted you when you signed on to this but I always defended you and let me say I know you have shut all those people up. Job well done!";

While the original at times seemed like a documentary this one was a straightup horror movie though without too many of the cliches that make modern horror movies tedious.On it's own this was a very good horror movie. Wellfilmed wellacted suspensful with good characters. The kids in this movie are not all just obnoxious kidsthey get into trouble because of a good deed so I found myself rooting for them even the annoying one or two. The casting of Lee Ermey as the sheriff is icing on the cake he definitely brought the movie up a few notches.While not a classic this remake is worth seeing.".

I have to say too that the acting was very good though I wonder how hard it is to fake fear when you see some of the scenarios the actors were in but even the background actors especially the actor portraying Leatherface and the wonderful R. Lee Ermey as the sheriff are very good and add an element of paranoid fear to the film. The thing that shocked me most was how brutal and graphic the film was the gore being very realistic and used very well. Instead of buckets of blood we get moments of horror that end in a very bright splash of red. And like the first the most brutal killings are shot in a way so that you see what is happening to the victim but yet DON'T see it at the same time. This is not a perfect film. It is too decadently dark and a lot of people will hate the film for that reason and it will be hard to see this as being a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again. But in saying that I admit that that is why the film succeeds so well  they nailed the mood perfectly. They didn't graverob it from the original but created their own. As a horror fan I cannot recommend this film enough. It stands just behind 28 Days Later as the second best horror film in a year that has turned out pretty darned well for the genre. Yes it is a remake and yes the original is better but having said that I also must tell you that this is a very well crafted horror film and a wonderful spook show ride. I dunno if I am happy that it is going to do well at the box office or not it won the box office battle its opening weekend because I don't know what that means for all the other propose remakes. But if nothing else at least they didn't screw this one up.".

	schema:reviewBody "TCM is an adequate horror film in its own right but will play better if you have not seen the original. The makers of the 2003 remake have stripped the original of its dusty dirty intensity and its blacker than black humour and replaced them with a few Hollywood conventions so as not to challenge the audience too much. The problem is that 30 years later the remake is just so much more conventional than the visceral original. The directors do copy some of the original shots but see fit not to try to copy the nasty humour that made the original stand up to repeated viewings. Remember the scene in the original where Sally wakes up tied to a chair surrounded by the nightmare freakshow of a family and screams her very soul out whilst the camera zooms into extreme close up of her tear filled eyes as her tormentors laugh and taunt her? One of the great moments of 70's shock cinema. Well here its a lukewarm rehash where she comes to on the floor with all the horror of waking up with a bit of a hangover. Other pointless changes include trying to normalise some of the originals quirkier moments originally they wanted to find out if their granparents bodies had been dug up by graverobbers in the remake they are on their way to see Lynyrd Skynard. And what happened to wheelchair bound Franklin? Here the nearest thing to a disability is that one of the characters wears glasses. And whats the deal with water? The house in the remake should have floated away the amount of leaky pipes it has. OK its not a BAD film despite using all the old tricks but it seems to me that if you want to see a great film you may as well watch the original and see some really good filmmaking".

	schema:reviewBody "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best remakes aroundSPOLIERS AHEADPlot Five teenagers Erin Jessica Biel Kemper Eric Balof Andy Mike Vogel Morgan Jonathan Tiersten and Pepper Erica Leersen are driving through Texas to a concert when they pick up a deranged hitchhiker who warns them against the route their taking and promptly shoots herself through her mouth. They drive to an ab anded mill to wait for the sheriff R.E. Leermy to come and pick up the body. Weird occurrences happen and as the night progresses the teenagers have to fight to stay alive from the fury known as Leatherface Andrew BynarskiThe Good News This film takes no prisoners and is pretty brutal in dealing with our characters. The family especially the sheriff played brilliantly by R.E. Leermy really enjoys torturing the kids and I personally think that Leatherface here is the scariest of them all. I love the mask here and the movements he makes and his brutality is really amazing. Andrew Bynarski makes a truly impressive Leatherface. Also noteworthy Is Jessica Biel who delivers a raw and emotional performance which rivals Marilyn Burns performance from the original and she could become the next scream queen of this era of horror if she took on a few more roles like this. The rest of the supporting cast is good with no real standouts but nobody impresses themselves either. The film is shot beautifully by Marcus Nispel and at first glance a horror film with dark muted colors all through the running time may seem like a bad choice but it works wonders here and during the second half you get a serious case of claustrophobia. You really believe they are in the middle of nowhere and makes the events that happen that much more urgent. People have attacked the script and called it sloppy and hackneyed but I seriously couldn't find anything wrong. The score helps the film out Marjory and elevates it to a scale which the actors cant. The score never hurts the film and the prime example of this is the dramatic scene where Erin is forced to kill Andy. It's powerful enough with just the actor's expressions and movements but with the score it becomes something truly special. You literally feel the tension and feel like you're there and this is really happening which is the object of every horror movie and this one secedes. Very noteworthy. This film also contains a classic use of suspense. The entire second half is incredibly suspenseful and provides shocks and chills. Watching this film at one in the morning made watching the trailer scene almost unbearable. That scene made me want to turn it off and finish it in broad daylight. The torture is pretty impressive and the gore is smartly done never throwing gallons of blood on the screen at every kill instead making the blood very realistic and nice. The footage in the beginning and end of the movie was also a nice touch. This is definitely one of the better remakes around and does the original justice. The missing dinner scene wasn't a problem and just kept the action at a constant speed. The film never bores you and it has a high re watch ability factor. This could've been a ton worse.The Bad News The only complaint I have is there really needs to be a bigger body count and there needs to be more chainsaw deaths.Conclusion Recommend highly to fans of the original and for all other who have a passion for horror films or are getting started in watching horror movies but if you are a expecting a great big massacre go ahead and still watch it and just know that if you want a massacre you'll have to watch a Friday the 13th. Recommend.Rated R".

	schema:reviewBody "The horrorscifi movie critic Richard Scheib coined the term Backwoods Brutality to describe the slew of lowbudget movies that emerged in the 1970s which had as their main theme the violent and abrupt destruction of middleclass serenity. The concept has occasionally found expression outside of the horror genre Straw Dogs Deliverance but since Wes Craven's Last House on the Left 1972 it has been a mainstay of the horror genre. Even thirty years later the basic idea continues to be remade and reinterpreted. In my view the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 is the most successful exponent of the genre. As it often is in the American variations of this genre the TCM takes the socalled blue statered state dichotomy to a grotesque extreme the backroads of the Deep South is another country and its inhabitants exhibit uncontained contempt for every unsuspecting wayfarer. Its use of tension which is meticulously established in the movie's first 45 minutes and release  the last 45 minutes  is almost elegant in its simplicity. Throughout violence is used in sparing and sudden bursts until the adrenalinefueled final act during which it is mercilessly sustained.With some minor qualifications this description also fits Marcus Nispel's 2003 remake. Here the enlarged budget and technical expertise have worked both for and against the film. On the one hand a variety of new elements have been added to the story. Some like the mysterious little boy or the ending are soso while others like Leatherface's skin mask or the extended family are effective. On the other hand the professionalism and attention to detail demonstrated by Nispel and Daniel Pearl whose cinematography here is magnificent on down to those responsible for filming locations and set detail is consistently impressive.So the basic tensionrelease framework has been lifted from the original but instead of improving on it the filmmakers have saddled it with characters situations drama and violence. We learn from the DVD extras happily that some tender moments were left on the cutting room floor. I give it a 7 because ultimately I think it works as a horror movie on its own terms  in fact I don't think a better American horror movie has been made since 2000  and NispelKosar deserve credit attempting to revise the concept in minor ways for fans of the franchise. On the balance however the original's lowbudget guerillalike realism as well as some of its visceral power has been compromised.Of note finally is the performance of Jessica Biel. Having earned her acting chops on the Christian TV showcheesefest Seventh Heaven Biel has as of late found a niche playing physically tough but likable and intelligent characters. She's quite excellent here as it was for the original TCM's Marilyn Burns Biel's performance is exhilarating and intense  a kind of endurance test. But one easily believes she has the acuity and toughness to survive the ordeal.".

I couldn't stop laughing nervously I guess I was trying to cope with what I had seen. My girlfriend was absolutely terrified. Two girls behind us were literally crying becuase they were so terrified. All around us people were screaming jumping squirming. After the movie everyone was saying that was the scariest movie I have ever seen and that was nuts. I couldn't agree more. This movie really actually truly scared me. It was just so brutal. I felt terrified for the victims I felt afraid of the villian Leatherface was awesome. I loved this movie. It obvioulsy has flaws. The beginning was slow there were like thirty jump scares people walked around exploring stuff alone etc etc. But this movie if judged based on how much it did what it intended to do gets a 10 out of 10. Easy. I thought this remake was going to be easy to stomach I figured it was going to be hollywoodized. I was dead wrong. This movie was insane period.".

This movie really actually truly scared me. It was just so brutal. I felt terrified for the victims I felt afraid of the villian Leatherface was awesome. I loved this movie. It obvioulsy has flaws. The beginning was slow there were like thirty jump scares people walked around exploring stuff alone etc etc. But this movie if judged based on how much it did what it intended to do gets a 10 out of 10. Easy. I thought this remake was going to be easy to stomach I figured it was going to be hollywoodized. I was dead wrong. This movie was insane period.";

Much better then many recent attempts at horror.  Im not saying that this is better then the original or worse because in my opinion the two films were made very differently.  This isnt the exact same movie there are different characters and many scenes are different.  There are lots of similarities and references.  The movie had one of the darkest atmospheres ive ever encountered in a film and was extremely brutal and gorey.  A must see for a fan or the original and its sequels and horror films.  If you like this definitely check out Wrong Turn another recent horror film that i was impressed with.".

I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight with my DTS surround sound speakers and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously no jokes. The horror is nonstop not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style good cinematography welldirected.

But excessive gore? That is harder to pull off. Comically camp horrors such as say Braindead The Evil Dead series and the three TCM sequels get away with gore because theirs is so excessive as to be absurd. But for a serious horror gore has to serve its story not the other way round. Used excessively played too fast and too loose gore is exhibitionist immature and downright boring.The story of TCM the Original 1974 is simple and straightforward some dumb kids pick up a loony hitchhiker visit his loony home meet his loony family and wind up at their loony dinner tablesome of them as dinner. The violence of the story is mostly implied occurring offscreen. There is no gore. Had there been gore TCMtO would have been little more than a snuff film its audience a passive witness. But horror thrives on an active not a passive imagination. By tickling our worst imaginations the lack of gore only reinforces the horror of the film.The problem with TCM the Remake is not that it is gory and it isfar moreso than the original if not the sequels but that its gore does not serve the story instead only underscoring its weaknesses namely a meandering cruelly confusing plot with characters and scenes that are at once too many and too similar. While the original is admittedly episodic the remake is all over the place rushing from scene to repetitive scene bouncing from character to competing character.Just try to digest this indigestible plot A group of kids are rude to each other on a road trip then they are rude to a girl they pick up from the side of the road. Moseying on over to a derelict barbecue joint they are rude to a little old lady. Then it's off to a derelict milljunkyardinstallation art gallerycumsculpture garden to be rude to the banjo kid from Deliverance! They split up rudely and one group ends up at the derelict Family House which with its plantation architecture is creepier than the original's where they are rude to a little old man. After several more scene hops and some judicious dispatching of the cast courtesy our old pal Leatherface who at 260odd pounds should cut down on his red meats I don't know how he keeps up with those kids a lone survivor escapes into the woods to a derelict trailer is restored to the derelict Family House escapes again to a derelict shack hides in a derelict or at any rate USDA unapproved slaughterhouse and finally ends up back at the derelict barbecue joint. All this while the white trash Family here inexplicably surnamed Hewitt behave very rudely to her indeed.Meanwhile there are subplots afoot!baby snatching incest genetic disease police conspiracy. The only thing that's missing is the Illuminati. Oh yeah and the cannibalism. YES IN THIS REMAKE OF TCM THERE IS NO CANNIBALISM. It's still implied what with the meat hooks and the slaughterhouse a nice touch that but unfortunately it just meshes together with the other innumerable hideandgoseek scenes but without the original's critical barbecue pit and dinner table scenes the nastiest bit of the horror is lost.Confused yet? Bored even?I sure was. For as many changes of scenery as TCMtR has all of them look the same. I understand how that might be intentionalthat's part of the horror right? that there's no escape?but how many nearidentical shots of Jessica Biel running and hiding and shivering and sucking in her breath in terror are necessary to tell the story?Some of the plot is left unsatisfactorily unexplained and even more is just plum illogical. For instance immediately before pulling a gun fromof all placesher bloodied crotch and blowing her brains out in the van the girlfromtheroadside tells the kids they're all gonna die. This is what a plucky survivor does when she at long last has a shot to escape her tormentors? Okay then why not do it earlier or why not stop the van and do it outside so she doesn't endanger the kids' lives? Yeah I know she's supposed to be suffering a breakdown but her prediction would not have come true had she herself not set up the domino effect that made it happen.The rest of TCMtR is pure Hollywood contrivance. There is the requisite musical score overkill and the squelchy sound effects remember the creepy constant drill of the generator from the original? that was rad. There is the snappish MTV editing and direction compare to the amateurish documentary look and feel of the original. There is the government antidrugantisex message and good grief it is set to Sweet Home Alabama!! There is also Jessica Biel in a cowboy hat. Jessica Biel in a wet teeshirt. Jessica Biel with her head cradled in R. Lee Ermey's naked crotch. Sheriff Ermey gets to play the best character a Real Texan who yells and swears and scares the bejesus out of those of us terrified of the South and her reputation for vigilante 'justice' and lynching parties.Altogether TCMtR comes across as a wellaboveaverage madeforHBO movieit's not bad really and often it's entertaining ultimately though it sucks on account of sacrificing story to gore. After two solid hours of nonstop jump scenes and bloody murder of heaping on the bodies and the body parts and the body fluids we simply acclimate to the violence. The audience become passive witnesses and the movie becomes predictable unscary and boring.Also there's no cannibalism. AND DID I MENTION THERE'S NO CANNIBALISM?!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the beginning of the return of old school horror. This film however has brought up a lot of controversy due to the fact that it is a remake of one of horror's greatest classics. I am not one that gets very excited about remakes in fact I usually do not like the idea to recreate something that was done nearly perfect the first time. However with this film I was pleasantly surprised and I enjoyed it. Granted I feel Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is far superior film. There are many aspects of the movie I thought were done well and there some I had a bit of problem with.The cinematography was very impressive and I definitely feel that the director achieved a good dark and helllike setting in Texas. The acting was also very believable. One aspect that I did enjoy was that the script was a bit different from Hooper's. In my opinion this almost always helps viewing a remake of a film. I want the director to change some of the script. If I wanted to see the exact same film again I would just view the original. The adding of the twisted sheriff created a great deal of terror. This character was almost as nasty as Leatherface himself. Leatherface was also recreated well. His physique demeanor and shear brutality was achieved enough that Gunner Hansen would have been proud. Although Hansen will always be the best actor to wear the stitched human mask and wield the chainsaw.There were however some changes from the original that I did not agree with. Firstly I was not 100 percent convinced that the film took place in 1973. Granted the setting achieved a 70s look I felt the actors were not quite on the same level. For some reason it seemed that they had a present day quality to them this maybe in part that their dialogue and hair styles seemed a bit off. There was only one scene I had a real problem with which was the lost of Leatherface's arm. During the end of the film he is hunting the last soul survivor in a slaughterhouse she then jumps from her hiding place and hacks off his arm with a large meat cleaver. The problem I had with this was that Leatherface is quite a large fellow and this girl who could not weigh more half his body weight whacks off his arm with I believe four hacks. After the first blow one would think he would either move or knock her away but it was almost like he just stood there letting her swing at his arm as if it was a tree. Basically in this film Leatherface does not come out quite as the victor as he did in the original film. I think that's one aspect the made the original so disturbing the villains actually win.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being one of the few commenter's on TCM that hasn't seen the original and is only 15 years old I thought my 2 cents in would be considered useful or interesting to contrast to that of other comments written on this movie. I watched this movie hoping to be freaked out. I wanted to scare myself. But to be honest I spent most of the time critiquing the directing of this movie and the way Nispel has tried to create and attain the climax of this movie. The only thing truly massacred in this film was the potential of gore and thrill. The overdramatic music inappropriate choice of costume and actors massacred the message the producers were trying to get across. Like all slasher films the only thing you're meant to achieve out of watching it is a few hours of having the sht scared out of you. And the sad thing is the raw thrill of this movie could have fulfilled that but instead was squashed by its modernistic screenplay. Throughout most of the film i believed the face shown on Leatherface was what was meant to be depicted as his own only to realize that was a skinmade mask. I'm still waiting to find a villain truly horrific and disgustingly distorted that their image is tattooed into your mind every time you shut your eyes. The highlight of this movie would have been the scene with Jessica Biel and her limp friend finding refuge in a house that they first tried to secure shut with a lounge. I congratulate Nispel on the way he created the sense of being for want of a better word so close yet so far from death. The supposed footage found really killed this movie. Particularly when you've just been reading up on what this movie really is based on which isn't much to my friends dismay a man psychologically challenged with a skin disease and a chainsaw. Above all i felt lied to! The only thing people should take away from this slasher film is JUST BECAUSE THEIR FILM EDITOR CAN MAKE A SCENE APPEAR 80 YEARS OLD FILMED WITH A 1950'S CAMCORDER DOESN'T MEAN THERE REALLY IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY OF CANNIBALS WITH A SON WITH SKIN DISEASE THAT TAKES HIS ANGER AND RESENTMENT OUT ON TEENAGERS BY DETACHING LIMBS WITH A CHAINSAW RUNNING WILD IN THE OUTBACK OF AUSTIN Texas!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very safe to say that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre1974 was a cultural phenomenon for horror movies and helped change the shape of the entire genre. The movie provided all the essential elements that are vital in horror movies because when it comes down to it these elements come from what the people want to see. We want to see the twisted things in our imaginations and nightmares come to life and what I love about TCM is it is something that could really happen to you. Sure the movie is a little cheesy now and I think Franklin was hilarious but its the direction that counts. To me Leatherface is the greatest killer of all time I like him better than Freddy. I love him because he is very stripped down he's not supernatural and reacts to pain like any normal human would. He has all the essentials such as a very creepy image and psychotic behavior. Nobody can hold a candle to Leatherface.Ok enough of that let me get on to the review of the REAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I will not say anything about the story because I want everyone to see it for themselves while knowing very little about the story. It takes a lot for a movie to impress me when the anticipation level is hitting the sky because I expect so much and usually always get disappointed this happened with Terminator 3. With the new TCM it stays true to the roots that made the first one a hit but this one BLEW me away.Lets start with he cast. Everyone was amazing and fit in perfectly. I had doubts about Jessica Biels at first but now I see her in a brand new light. I could see no ounce of weakness in any of the characters. The moods expressed throughout the movie were flawless and very convincing. The acting plays a huge role because the better the acting the more real the feel is thats when you step into the shoes of the people in the movie and live it out with them. This is what makes and breaks movies and I'm proud to say the cast delivered.The story line has been totally changed. This story is 100 times better than the original I was very impressed. There are far more twists and turns and because the storyline has such a high thrill value it keeps you glued to your seat. Our theater was packed and only 2 people that I know of left for bathroom breaks. I have never seen this happen before with a movie. Anyway the storyline could not have gotten any better. One reviewer said some of the stuff in the movie was predictable that is total BS this movie has so many turns that you have no idea whats going to happen next.Now onto the star of the movie LEATHERFACE. I thought nobody could top Gunner Hansen from the first TCM but Leatherface in the new one is the best one I have ever seen. He is bigger scarier meaner and crazier than ever. He is the main focus as far as enemies go and I think its great this pretty much paid tribute to him and it shows everyone that he is guy to be reckoned with. The moment he did the first kill I knew this movie was ON and had a feeling it would top any slasher movie ever made.In closing let me say that when this movie ended A LOT of people started clapping and cheering. I saw no disappointed face leaving that theater and this is the first movie ever in which my high anticipation was exceeded. I don't care what ANYONE says the original while it is still a classic and will always be in our hearts can't even come close to this one. Storyline imagery jump scenes kills twists etc.. this movie has it ALL and leaves a lasting impression strong enough to make you want to go pay 7.50 all over again and again and a gain until you get sick of it. Michael Bay a lot of people doubted you when you signed on to this but I always defended you and let me say I know you have shut all those people up. Job well done!".

On a business trip to DC in 1998 I saw The Game with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn on the way out... great movie but very heavy and deep.  However on the way back this movie was playing.  Based on initial reviews I wasn't expecting much but watching it was like someone purposely made a funny version of The Game and I probably annoyed my fellow passengers as I was laughing so hard.  I thought Murray was at his best not unlike Chevy Chase in the Fletch movies shame they didn't make more of those as they were both in their comical element.The coincidental or perhaps not pairing of these two films really added to my enjoyment of both.  On a cold rainy weekend I strongly recommend renting both and watching them in the same order I did you won't be disappointed!".

That is because I hate to say the average viewer often is a teenager or adult who likes their comedy very broad and simple. No this will not appeal to fans of Porky's or Little Nicky because it requires the viewer to have a reasonable attentionspan and the ability to enjoy a comedy that doesn't telegraph what will happen next just how many movies these days are hard to predict anyways?.The movie is a screwy difficult to describe spy adventure where everyone knows just how deadly the stakes areexcept for Bill Murray's character. He mistakenly thinks everything that is happening around him is a type of performance art sort of a Theatre of the Absurd. You MUST watch it.".

That is because I hate to say the average viewer often is a teenager or adult who likes their comedy very broad and simple. No this will not appeal to fans of Porky's or Little Nicky because it requires the viewer to have a reasonable attentionspan and the ability to enjoy a comedy that doesn't telegraph what will happen next just how many movies these days are hard to predict anyways?.The movie is a screwy difficult to describe spy adventure where everyone knows just how deadly the stakes areexcept for Bill Murray's character. He mistakenly thinks everything that is happening around him is a type of performance art sort of a Theatre of the Absurd. You MUST watch it.";

The supporting cast play to their purposeful stereotypes and most importantly don't get in Murray's way. Peter Gallagher of 'Orange County' fame plays a very good straight man as Murray's brother and Joanne Whalley seems to be playing her part and enjoying watching Murray's performance at the same time. There is a generous supply of double entendres predictable but well written and funny. This movie can be enjoyed by families as well as 'adults only'.

However Wally answers the wrong phone call and is mistaken for hitman Spenser.

Blissfully unaware Wally sets out to foil the plot.This is one of those films that I'd kept meaning to see for ages but never got round to it.  So when I finally did I maybe had too high expectations for it.  So for the first 20 minutes I was a little impatient and was bothered that I wasn't really enjoying it or laughing very much.  However once I got past this I relaxed and started to enjoy it.The plot is mush and even if you take it seriously all the pieces don't fit together and the plot doesn't make a lot of sense.  However ignore all this plot nonsense  this is all about Wally stumbling from one misunderstanding to another lucky occurrence.  We're not in the realms of classic comedy here and it certainly isn't hilarious.  Rather it's funny and enjoyable  in that even when I wasn't smiling I still had a fixed grin on my face.Murray is the film's saviour.  He stumbles around so very well and makes even the most basic misunderstanding funny.  Gallagher is a passable straightman and WalleyKilmer is decent but really suffers from having to share a screen with Murray.  A fleet of British faces make up the rest of the cast  from Molina Wilson Woodeson to the sublime John Thomson and faces like Dexter Fletcher and that guy offa Family Affairs'.  To be honest it's all a bit distracting having so many oh that's ' and you do have to try and get past it.Overall this isn't the funniest thing you'll ever see but it is enjoyable and will make you smile for 90 minutes even if the belly laughs are less often than you'd like.  Murray runs the show and brings laughs out of the least inspired routines.  Well worth a watch if you're in a silly undemanding mood.".

It was based on a true story and Joanne WK's performance became the highlight of her career.  In The Man Who Knew Too Little Joanne WK once again plays this character but for laughs.  Kind of neat considering that the two films probably don't share the same audience which is apparent since so far I am the only reviewer to pick up on this connection despite the obvious spoof. When she appeared on screen and I saw she was spoofing her Scandal role it was like actually getting one of Dennis Miller's intellectual jokes. If you have only seen one of the films you should see the other one too.  If you have not seen either start with Scandal if not for chronological sake then at least to get the inside joke in the later plus Scandal is a really good film and very timely considering the ClintonMonica thing.  Bill fans Murray that is don't worry he is here in fine form.  For movie buffs this film is but a series of spoofs of wellknown and not so wellknown mostly filmnoir flicks think watered down Mel Brooks circa Young Frankenstein not so broad not so obvious but cool when you get it.  If you're under the age of 35 you probably won't get them my niece part of the money demographic was shocked to find out that there was actually a movie called The Man Who Knew Too Much which explains exactly why the film didn't do better box office.  Most of all the interest is Joanne WhalleyKilmer who has brought back to comedic film the wonderful French Maid costume.  Once a staple of Vauldeville Bob Hope comedies and Pink Panther films the French Maid's costume should be mandatory for all women endowed with great legs.  Oooh La La!  Even if you have not seen Hitchcock or British cinema you never heard of filmnoir let alone pronounce it and your knowledge of Cold War and foreign spy history is nonexistent there is Joanne WK's killer bod and cool spoof.

And I'm one of them.And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one levelthough the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. I mean Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007. And the writing is really very witty here giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny always fast affair. That isI laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic typethe hero who succeeds by accident. Often it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is.The plot is simplesome bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know in this sort of movie that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast and the eventual inevitability of the plot hold it back though. So it is what it is still a great romp.You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "That more than adequately sums up my feelings of 'The Man Who Knew Too Little'. It's his show. All the way. There is also no denying this is a rather stupid movie because it has to be. The only prerequisite is the situation must be completely implausible and the main character a complete bulb and on those terms this movie passes with flying colors. Wallace Ritchie Bill Murray is a man perhaps the furthest thing from ultra cool and sexy a la James Bond. I guess the fact that he is a fortyplus year old man working at Blockbuster is confirmation of just that.Coming to visit his brother James Peter Gallagher you can see from frame one that James wants nothing more than to get rid of him. Yes sign him up for some harmless fantasy roleplaying and adventure. Where's the harm in that? He's supposed to go to a telephone booth and await fake instructions except when he picks up the phone it's an actual spook relaying him to go to an address. Seconds later the real assassin approaches the telephone booth phone rings and picks it up. It's the game calling. Some man is pretending to beat up a woman across the street as we can see the window and corresponding sound from the telephone. The assassin without emotion calmly walks across the street and mechanically puts three shells in the male actor. A rare moment of dark humor in an otherwise overthetop silly movie.The rest follows a pattern of Wallace stumbling around unaware of what he's really involved in and this illusion he can do  say  try anything without consequence of death is weirdly amusing. Of course furthest from plausible but having to be as such. If you can shoulder a sporting Bill Murray carrying the weight in order to save a threadbare story you'll find something to like here. Even though by the end it had worn thin I had a real good laugh or two and that's more than I can say for most comedies nowadays. A mustwatch for Bill Murray fans.".

I guess the fact that he is a fortyplus year old man working at Blockbuster is confirmation of just that.Coming to visit his brother James Peter Gallagher you can see from frame one that James wants nothing more than to get rid of him. Yes sign him up for some harmless fantasy roleplaying and adventure. Where's the harm in that? He's supposed to go to a telephone booth and await fake instructions except when he picks up the phone it's an actual spook relaying him to go to an address. Seconds later the real assassin approaches the telephone booth phone rings and picks it up. It's the game calling. Some man is pretending to beat up a woman across the street as we can see the window and corresponding sound from the telephone. The assassin without emotion calmly walks across the street and mechanically puts three shells in the male actor. A rare moment of dark humor in an otherwise overthetop silly movie.The rest follows a pattern of Wallace stumbling around unaware of what he's really involved in and this illusion he can do  say  try anything without consequence of death is weirdly amusing. Of course furthest from plausible but having to be as such. If you can shoulder a sporting Bill Murray carrying the weight in order to save a threadbare story you'll find something to like here. Even though by the end it had worn thin I had a real good laugh or two and that's more than I can say for most comedies nowadays. A mustwatch for Bill Murray fans.";

His character believes that he is in avantgarde theatre and everything in the script some of it very contrived lends credence to this belief.  At worst it drops to the level of Jerry Lewis buffoonery but the script is also filled with brilliant touches and all the plotlines dovetail extremely well.

	schema:headline " Not a good or funny film but 2 or 3 positive aspects still exist about this project";
	schema:reviewBody "Agent Ranjid rettet die Welt is a German movie from 2012 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. It is one of the more known works by director Michael Karen. The writing cast includes of no less than 4 people including Dieter Tappert who is more known as Paul Panzer here and Kaya Yanar the GermanTurkish comedian who is the star of this entire project. By the rating you can already see that this film was not entirely wellreceived but while I did not think it was a good film I still believe that it may not be a catastrophe either. It is basically what you'd expect a film in which Kaya Yanar plays his most known characters from his television shows and stage performances. There is nothing positive here that surprises you really but there are also no negative surprises for the most part. I thought this was what you could expect just like with other German comedian who all have at least one trademark film like Atze Schrder or Mario Barth or a handful more.The problem for me was partially that I did not find the Ranjid character too interesting ever. It is really just an uninspired stereotype for 90 of what he does and also he just doesn't go well with comedy I believe. The body guard guy is slightly more entertaining so luckily he gets a fair share of screen time too which elevates the material at times. But he was also looking to much unrealistically like a hero which totally goes against the James Bond spoof even if that one mostly refers to Ranjid of course. There are cameos by several other people from the German entertainment industry like Keller Kalkofe Gerhardt Kebekus Herforth... Anyway I thought it was nice for once to see Gode Benedix playing a major character as he is an actor I like and you rarely get to see too much from him. Of course he did not save the material either here. Speking about the material it is certainly disappointing that this level of quality is all they could come up with from no less than four writers. A good aspect though is that the film is really really short runs for 82 minutes only and this includes a great deal of closing credits too. As a whole I'd really only recommend it to people that really love Kaya Yanar as he is the center of the film from start to finish. I myself think he is a better comedian and host than actor and this film gets a thumbsdown from me but like I said it is not as disastrous as some people say it is. Oh yeah final note here Rutger Hauer plays the main antagonist which I found kinda surprising as he is actually still somewhat of a big name even today. But he is as weak as the material surrounding him and when he had to rush in trademark lines from Yanar character Was guckst du? it was a bit on the embarrassing side for sure. Yeah like I said watch something else instead and don't get your expectations up for a film where the biggest female character is named Viagra van den Hupen.".

The love interest role fell to a woman who looked  like she would be more comfortable in a porn film add to that1 Some very bad acting mostly from big Dolph 2 A totally rubbish villain 3 Offensive Russian accents 4 straighttoTV plot 5 Some cheesy sexrelated oneliners that are disgusting and offensivethen you have one really really bad movie. Just when you thought Dolph couldn't stoop any lower he does. In fact Dolph sums it up himself with a line from the film  asked if he knew what Agent Red was he replies sounds like a bad action movie boy was he ever right!".

Expectations were low from the opening credits listing no not just because Dolph Lundgren was top billing but a guy with one of the worst names in the business  Randolph Mantooth  was SECOND billing obviously I wasn't expecting much. The love interest role fell to a woman who looked  like she would be more comfortable in a porn film add to that1 Some very bad acting mostly from big Dolph 2 A totally rubbish villain 3 Offensive Russian accents 4 straighttoTV plot 5 Some cheesy sexrelated oneliners that are disgusting and offensivethen you have one really really bad movie. Just when you thought Dolph couldn't stoop any lower he does. In fact Dolph sums it up himself with a line from the film  asked if he knew what Agent Red was he replies sounds like a bad action movie boy was he ever right!";

Words cannot express how terrible this movie is. I don't care how bad that J. Lo movie Gigli is it will not hold a candle to this waste of matter for pure crappiness. Dolph Lundgren is a marine who apparently is the only member of the entire US armed forces who can fly a stealth fighter in footage lifted from another crappy Dolph movie that must go board a sub in Russia so that some chemical weapon that the Russians stole from the Americans during the cold war can come back to the US. On board is Dolph's exfiance who aside from looking like a reject from a Ron Jeremy movie is also possibly the worst actress to ever set foot on the planet. I had to look up this actress to see what other suckers have hired her for movies and found out two things.... 1. thankfully she's not in demand and 2. Her shoddy acting is eclipsed only by her amazing spelling I think her name is Melanie but it looks like some sort of indecipherable mumbo jumbo the way it is spelled. Anyway I'm off track... this movie is pure crap.. not even one of those watch with your friends after some herbal refreshment movies... Everything from the recycled and butchered storyline of terrorists on a sub where every possible cliche is used and screwed up to the awful performances to the terrifyingly bad dialogue. This is the kind of movie that I think can be used as a torture device. There is one saving grace though after watching the performances in this stinker you'll be appreciating the master thespianism that is one Jean Claude Van Damme.".

Damian Lee does a god awful job here with really bad camera work bad shots during the tame action scenes and did a great job at keeping it bland and boring throughout!. The Acting is terrible!. Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off and while he was likable he just seemed to be going through the motions however i still Love Lundgren  and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!Lundgren Rules!. Meilani Paul is terrible as the love interestshe was annoying and very unconvincing!. Alexander Kuznetsov is laughable as the main villain and wasn't menacing at all.

Damien Lee's direction of the action scenes is annoying at times with shots so close up it ruins the fights but there is an attempt at some Woo'esque action but it must be pointed out that the best action scene was borrowed from Stormcatcher they actually took out a whole scene and in Stormcatcher the bloke in the scene was not Dolph but it is supposed to be him in Agent red all of a sudden Dolph is about 5ft 11 instead of 65. and it must be pointed out that Tony Hickox is a much better director. Basically this film is a very clich action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny notably the bad Russian accents and the puns one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying have you ever heard of agent red and Dolph replies  it sounds like a bad action movie so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty badyou could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.

Sounds like the name of a bad action movie.The first complaint is the glaring inconsistencies.  Having American's flying MIG's having airtoair missiles turning into torpedos when they hit the water.  The fact that the submarine looked like an oil refinery rather than something where space is of a premium.  Or maybe the lack of any attempt at military accuracy.  The fact that the whole fleet couldn't destroy one measily sub!  Or just the way the virus behaves.  They say starts with headaches then vomiting and then bleeding everywhere.  Well guess what people just started choking and then dying no vomit and only occasional blood.  Oh and they said that the reason this virus was so terrible is that it has a 100 fatality rate and it kills within 12 minutes. Guess what that is called a dead virus since in 12 minutes it can't get very far.  The dangerous ones are when you are contagious for a long time before showing symptoms and then you die.Then there is the horrible characters.  Every Russian shown was either a terrorist or drinking vodka.  All the Americans were caricatures of real people and they kept saying God help us.  The American admiral had to ask the president to make every decision.  Then there was Dolph Lundgren. Special forces marine so naturally he is sent to protect a virus on a Navy ship.  And they send him via commercial transportation to boot.Other bad things?   So much of the footage was stolen from other movies it is laughable.  They included a female terrorist basically so she could have a catfight with Dolph's fiancee.  And then imagine every cliched action movie moment that is even vaguely appropriate for a submarine or even airplane.  Basically imagine giving a group of 4th graders the plot and have them fill in the story write characters etc. and you will have this movie.".

The very few action scenes which made it all the way into the movie just aren't anywhere near the quality I would rate as acceptable. Lundgren isn't exactly a great actor which shouldn't matter because he's an action star and when he has nothing to work with actionwise a project is doomed from the start. Agent Red proves this. I suffered heavily for more than 90 minutes. Don't make the same mistake as me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I gotta call shenanigans on this movie. If you can put together a production involving a legitimate Clevel star like Doph Lundgren a couple of recognizable faces like Stephen Macht and Randolph Mantooth and a babe like Natalie Radford who will get naked and can actually act you've got the raw materials for some Perfectly Acceptable Entertainment. No you're probably not going to win any awards but if you keep the production values reasonably high and come up with an action script that doesn't insult the intelligence of the average mollusk cranking out something plenty of 14 year old boys will think is cool shouldn't be that great a challenge. Agent Red fails to meet that standard.I can forgive the cheap and poorly conceived sets on display here. Stacking some props in empty office space and trying to pass it off as the command deck of an aircraft carriers doesn't look that bad and the inside of a factory can vaguely resemble the interior of a submarine though you should know better than to let the audience see the cement floors in your supposed sub. What I can't look the other way on is that there's enough stock footage in this film to choke a horse and that fairly extensive action scenes from at least three separate movies probably more have been cannibalized to try and prop up the otherwise abysmal storytelling at work here. I mean hardcore cinema geeks could make a drinking game out of naming where all the shots came from that obviously didn't originate with writerdirector Damian Lee. If those are the kind of low borderline crooked tricks a filmmaker has to resort to it's better for everyone if they don't even bother.And the script here is even more egregious. Again I can excuse the blatant ripping off of Die Hard and the plentiful use of creaky clichs. Who expects something like Agent Red to be art? However it frequently appears that no one read this screenplay all the way through. Otherwise someone would had to have noticed the eyerollingly repetitive exposition the hammertotheforehead foreshadowing and the you'vegottobekidding me moments of dramatic illogic in the plot. Let me give you an example of what I mean by that third thing. Toward the end an admiral Randolph Mantooth decides he has to sink a submarine in order to prevent an attack on the U.S. Almost immediately after that scene we get another where the President Bill Monroe orders the admiral to sink the sub. But if he was already going to do it why did they include the latter scene of superfluous command? And if the folks behind Agent Red thought there was some drama to be found in the President ordering the admiral to sink the sub why include the former scene of the admiral deciding to do it all by himself? There's no way to explain both being in the same movie unless nobody was paying attention.As for the detailsa deadly bioweapon is being shipped from Russia to the U.S. by nuclear submarine with Marine asskicker Matt Hendricks Dolph Lundgren and his bitchy hardfaced scientist of an exfiance Meilani Paul along for the ride. A group of terrorists who spend an inordinate amount of time moving in slomotion led by Dr. Kretz Alexander Kuznetsov and his fanatical lovemate Nadia Natalie Radford kill everyone on board except Matt and his honey and plan to launch the lethal bioagent at both America and Russia to protest the creation of such genocidal weapons.Lundgren practically sleepwalks through this motion picture perking up only for the fight scenes where it's so clear the other members of the cast have such little training that Lundgren essentially has to fight himself. I do have to give him credit for knowing how pathetic this movie was going to be and trying to avoid looking as bad he might have. There a scene at the beginning involving a commando raid to steal a stealth fighter which still doesn't make any sense no matter how many long I think about it where every other member of the infiltration team is sporting this hilariously bad camouflage paint on their faces while Lundgren's mug is unadorned.If you're still unsure about Agent Red let me put it this way. JeanClaude Van Damme is the only person I would encourage to watch this film and that's only because it would make him feel a lot better about his career choices.".

Agent Red is what happens when footage is cobbled together and a presumed movie is assembled but without any surprises or intelligence. The presence of Dolph prevents this from being a zero star movie but in all other aspects it really is.Assembling footage is not the same thing as making a movie which the horrendousness of Agent Red amply proves.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

Soon once the sub is in route it is taken over by Russians on board. The mission was a simple one To get back a highly contagious virus made by Americans stolen by Russians and now given back to the U.S. which is completely stupid in theory Bad guys on board are sick of the use of chemical warfare and want to prove to the world how wrong it is...ahem...so they plan to attach the chemical to warheads and shoot them to New York and Moscow to spread the disease there...OK yea that will teach them war is wrong by killing millions of innocents..But anyway Dolph is on board and of course he's not gonna let this happen..oops did I spoil the ending for you? This movie was pretty bad slow and boring with a horrible cast. I love Dolph Lundgren so thats why I got it  and hes a cheesy action star but I am a huge fan so it's all good. No one else did any good on this film. Directorwriter Damian Lee brought nothing new to the table many of the best shots were actually edited from films like Blown Away and Crimson Tide. Can't give him any writing credits either because this is so much like the movie Counter Measures from 99 with Michael Dudikof.The movie was produced by legendary Bmoviesoftcore porn director producer Jim Wynorski but on the credits he used his alias name Nobel Henry. He even did many scenes of reshooting but didn't allow his name on as director. Thats bad when a guy who has done as much garbage as Jim has doesn't even want his name attached to it.Bottom line it has some decent action with Lundgren but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone  very low budget nothing new or original. Does have some pretty good stuff the first 1015 minutes with great blood splatter and action once on the Submarine it lacks any great action though. Stephen Macht had a small part in the film and thats a bonus I have always liked him.I am not one to notice or care about such things as kissing in an action film but I have to say that the worst on screen kiss ever happened at the end of this film..Movie had a great quote...Lundgrens character is asked ever heard of Agent Red He replies sounds like a bad action movie  funny! 210 stars".

Stephen Macht had a small part in the film and thats a bonus I have always liked him.I am not one to notice or care about such things as kissing in an action film but I have to say that the worst on screen kiss ever happened at the end of this film..Movie had a great quote...Lundgrens character is asked ever heard of Agent Red He replies sounds like a bad action movie  funny! 210 stars";

As propaganda it goes down easily with a terrific cast and some hilarious moments particularly when Bogart and Demarest attend a secret meeting posing as Nazis.The plot of course is preposterous and the notes that Bogart finds in Veidt's desk are for some reason written in English instead of German but none of that takes away from the enjoyment of the movie.The performances are all excellent but Bogart is a wonder. His nononsense honest delivery and perfect timing work beautifully in comedy as well as drama.This is a delightful movie  don't miss it.".

This 1942 Warner Bros. film is much more enjoyable than we suspected because even though the film was supposed to tackle a serious problem it has a lot of fun moments that make the film much lighter in tone than perhaps the film makers intended.At the center of the story we find 'Gloves' Donahue a small time gangster and his crew. They are a fun group that are drawn into an international spy story right in their own backyard. Ma Donahue comes to ask her son's assistance in trying to solve the murder of her baker neighbor and the fun and games begin in full force.There are a lot of good moments in the film but it is dominated by Humphrey Bogart who runs away with the picture. His crew is also a great asset to the film Frank McHugh a fantastic actor no matter in what picture is excellent as well as William Demarest one of the best character actors in the movies of that era. A much slender Jackie Gleason puts in an appearance as Starchy a member of Donahue's team.The heavies are amazing. Conrad Veidt is wonderful as the Nazi spy trying to blow up a ship in New York's harbor. Mr. Veidt was such an elegant figure in everything he did. Judith Anderson is seen as the mysterious assistant to Mr. Veidt's character. Ms. Anderson had a way about her that she dominates the scenes in which she appears. Peter Lorre does a lot with his small piano player Pepi.The film never ceases to entertain. Thanks to Mr. Humphrey and the wonderful cast assembled for the movie it will not disappoint anyone with an open eye for a lighter take on a serious matter.".

	schema:headline " Get those Nazis! And boy do they!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to start this review by mentioning that I saw this Bogart film before Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The African Queen. I was just a teenager and boy did I love this film! I waited years to be able to see it again and it continued to remain among my favorites. When it came out on video I bought a copy and watched it several times a year just to see why I enjoyed it so much. Although it has been a while since I have watched it I wanted to revisit an old favorite by giving it my review. After the attacks on September 11 2001 films like All Through the Night seem much closer to reality especially this one with its New York City setting.Gloves Donahue Humphrey Bogart is about as interested in World War II as Scarlett O'Hara was in the civil war. He finds more contentment eating his favorite Papa Miller's cheesecake and will eat no facsimile! or going to the race track or ballgame. So when the baker who makes his favorite cheesecake mysteriously turns up dead Gloves is naturally upset and does all he can to a. find the secret cheesecake recipe b. woo his widow or c. find the killer.If you said C then you were right but the tongueincheek wisecrack remarks of A and B are keeping within the theme of this lighthearted World War II propaganda film. Gloves eventually discovers that Miller was involved with a group of Fifth Columnist spies against his will and sets out to break them up much to his own surprise. Yes his crew is an overaged group of Bowery Boys played comically by William Demarest Frank McHugh Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers and yes the villains are much like the ones the overripe Bowery Boys used to face in their movies. In fact the Bowery Boys had plot lines during World War II very similar to this movie...The Nazis are a nasty bunch of seemingly civilized creatures. Conrad Veidt General Strasser of Casablanca is the epitome of dashing villainy as the head of the Nazi Ring who hides behind the innocent appearance of an Auction shop owner. Peter Lorre also from Casablanca is the evil Pepe who we see early on doing the nasty deed to poor Mr. Miller Ludwig Stossel also in Casablanca. To civilize his murderous character Lorre's Pepe is seen as the piano player in a nightclub. The wonderful Dame Judith Anderson seen two years earlier as the evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca is all in black here again but with sequins and a touch of glamor added to her role as Veidt's obvious mistress. While she has fewer scenes than Veidt or Lorre Anderson adds subtle touches to her character through her unspoken love for Veidt that makes the viewer feel sympathetic to her character.The heroine Leda Hamilton is played by Kaaren Verne the reallife wife of Peter Lorre offscreen. Here Verne can't stand Pepe who obviously lusts after her. Verne is first seen after Miller's murder visiting him then disappearing before Gloves can question her. Gloves' nosy mother played by the wonderful Jane Darwell who informed Gloves about Miller's disappearance in the first place later locates Leda in a nightclub causing a disturbance with the nightclub's owners Barton MacLane and Edward Brophy. When Brophy is shot by Pepe he lives long enough to give Gloves a sign that will ultimately reveal what is going on.The film moves at such a fast pace that to go through every scene would take away a lot of the excitement and take a lot of space. We'll just stop with the synopsis here and say that this film moves like lightning. While longer than most B films of this nature 100 minutes All Through the Night moves just as quickly and is ultimately more entertaining. The writers spent more time with character development but that doesn't slow down this film one bit. Every character who crosses Glove's path has a chance to reveal a thing or two about them which makes them more than just onedimensional villains or comic relief. Even flighty McHugh gets his chance with a minor secondary plot involving his girl.During World War II there were many antiNazi dramas and comedies and All Through the Night stands out as a unique one in the sense that it takes place in our own back yard. Released just two months after Pearl Harbor All Through the Night served its purpose in bringing the idea of spies in our neighborhoods to the forefront of the public's mind. I'm sure many people in the audience upon seeing this film looked at the person sitting next to them in the darkened theater and wondering Is this person really a Nazi Spy?".

	schema:headline " A curio from my youth";
	schema:reviewBody "When I was a kid a local station had a package of films from the 30's and 40's it would run constantly. My young friends and I developed 68 favorites we would all congregate together to watch everything in the neighborhood stopped for Errol Flynn Charge of the Light Brigade The Sea Hawk Santa Fe Trail They Died With Their Boots On Gentleman Jim Objective Burma or Abbott and Costello Buck Privates AC meet Et Al. The one Humphrey Bogart feature that I remember from this package is All Through the Night. I saw him in this years before Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and the many other classics he was in. I got my first chance to look at it in perhaps 40 years recently. It's a strange film in many ways but still entertaining and a significant part of the Bogart film legacy even if it's far from a classic. We think the great stars just went from one classic to another because that's all we see but just as with modern stars they made many movies like this between them that also rely on their appeal and mostly fulfill their assignment of entertaining the viewer. Those films should not be forgotten. This film suffered from ill timing taking a semicomic spin on the Nazi threat only to be released just after Pearl Harbor. It must have been about as funny under those circumstances as Ishtar would have been on September 12th. As so many reviewers have commented it unites the Bowery Boys strain of humor by way of Damon Runyan with a Fifth column plot such as we see in the same year's Saboteur both films make reference to the burning of the Normadie without actually naming it and say their set of villains was responsible. The Nazis seems to have seen Bogart's previous gangster flicks and consider him a dangerous criminal You're just like us but the film takes pains to depict him only as a gambler whose biggest vice is that he doesn't mind liberating out of town gamblers from their bankrolls with a crooked deck. He credits his skill with firearms to days he spent at Coney Island. One interesting aspect is the reference to the Dachau concentration camp. I had thought the concentration camps were just rumored until they were liberated after the war. Maybe their true nature was not known until then. The heroine's father is supposed to have died of 'natural causes' there if that's possible in such an unnatural place. This is surely the only time Dachau was ever mentioned in a film with any kind of comedic element.The film is a mother lode of noted character actors and soon to be famous comics including these future TV icons Jackie 'C' Gleason and Phil Silvers. It has the pace of a 'B' but the length of and 'A' film. Towards the end you can't believe how much has happened and presume the film must have lasted 3 hours. Some of the dialog is corny but most of it is funny. Frank McHugh gets stuck on his wedding night hanging out with William Demarest and complains about it. Bill tells him 'I can cook!' Maybe he was looking forward to cooking for the Douglases on My Three Sons.I was pleased to see how many reviewers noted the similarities in the plot of this and North by Northwest with the auction scene and the police being led to the headquarters of the fifth columnists only to find nothing of interest. Always borrow from the best or at least the pretty good such as this.".

	schema:reviewBody "All Through the Night was started almost the day after the Pearl Harbor attack and rushed as fast as Warner Brothers could get it out to the movie going public. It's a curiosity today but for different reasons.Humphrey Bogart is one of those characters who straddles between the legal and illegal. When his mom Jane Darwell asks him to find out what happened to her baker of German ancestry Bogey starts his own investigation. Along the way the partner of Barton MacLane who is a rival of Bogey's gets murdered and now the police are looking for him as well as MacLane's mob.But Bogey persists and finds a nasty nest of Nazi fifth columnists using an antique auction as a cover. I've often wondered whether films like All Through the Night weren't a double edged sword in terms of propaganda. For audiences in 1942 I suppose it was good to see an AllAmerican hero like Humphrey Bogart besting the Germans. Yet the Germans in so many of these films are portrayed as incredibly stupid I do wonder if a whole lot of our draftees didn't go in the armed services with some bad preconceived notions.But All Through the Night does have is an incredible cast of some of the finest character actors ever assembled. The Germans are played by Conrad Veidt Judith Anderson and Peter Lorre and they play it completely straight. They'd have to or the film wouldn't work on any level. Kaaren Verne is the heroine who the Nazis are using to entice Bogey she's working for them because she believes this will save her father still in the fatherland.Bogey has such people working for him as William Demarest Frank McHugh Wallace Ford Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers. With Gleason and Silvers who were pretty far down on the cast list you had two people who would make their major breakthroughs in the next decade in television. Add this entire cast up and it's pretty impressive all these wonderful movie people doing their own particular shtick at the top of their game.For that reason All Through the Night should be seen and enjoyed even if you might wince at the over the top propaganda.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bogart Let's Get Silly!Mixing up so many genres into a single movie could potentially be a disaster yet I've perhaps never seen a better genre mashup than All Through the Night. I'm astounded at this movie's ability to have a bit of everything and pull it off so immaculately bouncing back and forth between drama comedy action murder mystery and even film noir. All Through the Night is the closest thing to a Hitchcock movie starring Humphrey Bogart in which an ordinary man gets caught up in espionage and becomes a fugitive for a crime he didn't commit with moments in the film such as the auction scene or Bogart deliberately getting arrested by police directly reminded me of North by Northwest likewise the movie even stars Judith Anderson in the Mrs. Danvers hairstyle from Rebecca while Bogart's exploits against the movie's Nazi villains gives an urban Indiana Jones edge to the film. Even the movie's final climatic moment had me on the edge of my seat and thinking to myself how is he going to get out of this?!. One top of that the film gets an additional boast with some truly superb use of shadows and lighting All Through the Night really exemplifies the unique look of Warner Bros. movies of the 30's and 40's.I may sound hyperbolic but the more I think about it the role of Golves Donahue may be the greatest performance of Bogart's career why you ask versatility! Just like the tone of the film he is able to continually bounce back between being serious to just downright silly. Bogart has made me laugh during comedic moments in his other movies but I never knew he could make me laugh this side splittingly hard from subtle moments such as throwing the reserved sign off a table in a nightclub to the more obvious in which he infiltrates and stalls a secret Nazi meeting. At another point he delivers the line More here than meets the FBI I do love me a corny pun but with Bogart delivering it just makes it funnier. All Through the Night makes me wish he had starred in more comedies.On top of all that the character he plays is a momma's boy yet he's still badass! I find this aspect of his character is hilarious in itself. There's something adorable about a tough guy who wears dotted bathrobes and loves cheesecake so much exemplified even more with his mother being played by the ever motherly Jane Darwell. All Through the Night features a large selection of character actors at some of their best work and even features a young Jackie Gleason in one of his earliest film roles what more secrets does this movie hold? If I was to find any point of contention with All Through the Night I wouldn't have minded seeing a bit romance between Bogart and Kaaren Verne but with a film that has this much merit it's hard to complain.All Through the Night is an antiNazi propaganda film and an effective one at that. I find the satire here is on par with The Great Dictator and To Be or Not Be as the movie pokes fun at Nazi ideology. The leader of the branch of Nazi spies is played Conrad Veidt whom there was probably no one better at the time to play evil Nazis. Golves Donahue is also a minor gangster which reflects the attitude of reallife gangsters of the time who worked with the government to infiltrate Nazi spies. One scene in the film involves Bogart giving a chilling monologue on how the Nazis will take people's freedoms away in an argument against US isolationism in the ongoing war in Europe all this however without even mentioning the word Nazi once throughout the film. Another interesting aspect of the film is the mentioning of an actual concentration camp Dachau. Being released in 1941 before the true nature of the camps where discovered this is one moment I found quite chilling. All Through the Night was released in the US only 5 days before the attack on Pearl Harbor although Warner Bros. had already long established themselves as an antiNazi studio.By the time I watched All Through the Night I had already seen all of Bogart's major movies and figured I was largely finished exploring the actor's filmography thus it came as such a delight discovering this obscure gem which satisfied me more than many of his more famous movies. This is the type of movie which makes me want to scream out Why the hell is this not more well known?! but then again its moments like these in which I live to be a cinephile.".

The leader of the branch of Nazi spies is played Conrad Veidt whom there was probably no one better at the time to play evil Nazis. Golves Donahue is also a minor gangster which reflects the attitude of reallife gangsters of the time who worked with the government to infiltrate Nazi spies. One scene in the film involves Bogart giving a chilling monologue on how the Nazis will take people's freedoms away in an argument against US isolationism in the ongoing war in Europe all this however without even mentioning the word Nazi once throughout the film. Another interesting aspect of the film is the mentioning of an actual concentration camp Dachau. Being released in 1941 before the true nature of the camps where discovered this is one moment I found quite chilling. All Through the Night was released in the US only 5 days before the attack on Pearl Harbor although Warner Bros. had already long established themselves as an antiNazi studio.By the time I watched All Through the Night I had already seen all of Bogart's major movies and figured I was largely finished exploring the actor's filmography thus it came as such a delight discovering this obscure gem which satisfied me more than many of his more famous movies. This is the type of movie which makes me want to scream out Why the hell is this not more well known?! but then again its moments like these in which I live to be a cinephile.";

	schema:reviewBody "Humphrey Bogart tangles with treacherous Nazi spies in director Vincent Sherman's All Through the Night a witty World War II propaganda thriller that takes place before Uncle Sam entered the war against the Axis. All Through the Night boasts a terrific topnotch supporting cast featuring Judith Anderson Jane Darwell Jackie C. Gleason Phil Silvers Peter Lorre and William Demarest. Perennial Nazi impersonator but reallife German Jew Conrad Veidt of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari battles with Bogart in this seriocomic espionage melodrama. A year later Bogart and Veidt locked horns again in Michael Curtiz's Oscarwinning romance Casablanca and Veidt played more Nazis in MGM's Nazi Agent and Above Suspicion before he succumbed to a heart attack in 1943. Scenarist Leonard Mystery Street Spigelgass and Edwin Larceny Inc. Gilbert have penned a topflight lightweight rollicking whiteknuckler that puts our hero between a rock and a hard place. All Through the Night resembles classic Hitchcock thrillers like The 39 Steps and North by Northwest. Our wrongly accused hero stays one step ahead of the police to exonerate himself of charges he murdered a nightclub owner. Anybody who loves offbeat Humphrey Bogart movies will enjoy this humorous hokum.All Through the Night opens with a group of Runyonesque Broadway gamblers sitting around a table discussing the combustible European predicament. Mr. Alfred 'Gloves' Donahue Humphrey Bogart interrupts their heated conversation. One of Gloves' minions Sunshine William Demarest of Escape from Fort Bravo explains what they've been doing with toy soldiers and tanks on the table in front of them Just showing how England can win the war. An amused Gloves chuckles I'll arrange a conference between you and Churchill. Sunshine points out Don't you think it's time you got your mind out of the sports section and on to the front page. Gloves dismisses Sunshine's suggestion That's Washington's racket let them handle it. Gloves' problems start when Louie Phil Silvers runs out of Gloves' favorite cheese cake from Miller's Bakery. Gloves swears by Miller's cheesecake. When Louie tries to substitute an inferior brand Gloves busts him in a heartbeat. Later Gloves' mother 'Ma' Donahue Jane Darwell of The Grapes of Wrathbegins to worry him about Mr. Miller's disappearance. When Gloves stumbles onto Miller's corpse in the shop basement things really begin to click. The NYPD is suspicious about Gloves from the start but they don't arrest him until they find one of his gloves next to the body of a dead nightclub owner. Everything hinges on finding a young vocalist Miss Leda Hamilton Kaaren Verne of A Bullet for Joey that was seen with Miller before he died. As it turns out Franz Ebbing Conrad Veidt and his secondincommand Pepi Peter Lorre of M are planning a 911 style terrorist attack not unlike a similar act of sabotage in Alfred Hitchcock's own Saboteur with Robert Cummings about Nazis blowing up a ship in New York harbor.Jane Darwell of The Grapes of Wrath is hilarious as Gloves' presumptuous mom who constantly interferes in her son's affairs. She gets Gloves into real trouble when she follows Miss Hamilton to the Duchess Club night spot run by Marty Callahan Barton MacLane of High Sierraand Marty summons Gloves to get his mother off his hands. Lorre is particularly nasty as Ebbing's righthand man. One of the greatest running gags in All Through the Night concerns Gloves' flustered chauffeur Barney Frank McHugh of Bullets or Ballots who has just been married and cannot convince Gloves to let him have time enough to consummate his marriage. The Production Code Administration cautioned Warner Brothers about a lot of subversive dialogue with regard to Barney's situation. Apparently some kind of deal was struck between Jack Warner and Joseph I. Breen over the salacious content of the dialogue. In the opening scene for example Sunshine argues that they can catch the Nazis with their Panzers down a comment that drew the wrath of the Production Code because of the implied sexuality in the remark. Nevertheless the line made it into the film. Despite its racist content there is a howler of a scene when Gloves' AfricanAmerican valet Saratoga Sam McDaniel of Three Godfathers delivers with supreme straightfaced solemnity to Miss Hamilton that Things ain't as black as they look. Sherman keeps things moving in a dead heat as Gloves struggles to elude the police and get the goods on Ebbing and his dastardly bunch. Another hilarious scene occurs at an auction with some incredibly funny dialogue that sounds more like gibberish than actual words.All Through the Night runs a close second to Raoul Walsh's Errol Flynn actioneer Desperate Journey as one of the best preWorld War II thrillers.".

Karen Verne is the girl forced to work for the Nazis as her father is in Dachau.Even when the spy ring is exposed the police have a hard time in believing Bogart even with Verne's backup.";

The foot chase scenes on rooftops and city streets are well done. The music throughout sucks.Assi Dayan is the son of the famous Israeli General Moshe Dayan. Both Assi Dayan and Fabio Testi are still active in filmmaking. They both have likable personalities and nice faces with interesting accents. Think of Daffy and Donald Duck with better eyelashes.The story is far more applicable to today's world than it was to the 1970s world of moviegoers. It has a plot that incorporates terrorists seeking nuclear weapons.The bad guys look very bad. If you have ever found yourself annoyed with an organ grinder's music there is one scene in this film you will enjoy.An old cargo ship becomes a nice setting for target practice late in the movie. The bullets hit everything except the good guys.With the two lead guys being so good looking at that time the director was somehow not able to insert a scene that had any real sex appeal. Even when Fabio is in bed with a girl it does not become intimate or interesting. The director should have stuck to the acting and plot development and left the nudity and sex scenes for better directors. Blake Edwards could have found much better music. J. Daniel Cadinot could have done the buildup to the nude scenes.Not a bad movie especially in today's world.Tom Willett".

	schema:reviewBody "Since it is virtually impossible to determine what parts of The Uranium Conspiracy were directed by either of its two codirectors Gianfranco Baldanello of Colt in the Hand of the Devil and Menahem Golan of The Delta Force it is difficult to praise the appropriate person for the parts of this IsraeliGermanItalian movie that succeed. The first twothirds of this scenic picturepostcard lensed travelogue thriller qualify as straightforward espionage boilerplate. Unless you watch the widescreen version of this movie you cannot properly appreciate cinematographer Adam Greenberg's impressive pictorial compositions. The final third bristles with machine gun violence as the heroes make sure that 'crime doesn't pay' for the villains. Five scenarists collaborated on the screenplay unless each had a hand in rewriting it. Again it is hard to tell who is liable for the good the bad and the ugly in this lightweight crime thriller about a terrorist attempt to ship uranium to evil foreign powers. Basically this European actioneer pits the Mossad a.k.a. Israel Intelligence against villains who display little regard for human life. Renzo Fabio Testi of Gang War in Naples is a hired troubleshooter and Israel Intelligence has infiltrated him into a uranium mine in Zaire that resembles a prison. Renzo is out to learn as much as he can about the Baron's Siegfried Rauch of The Eagle Has Landed efforts to export the key ingredient for atomic bombs. The Mossad agent who serves as Renzo's gobetween Dan Assaf Dayan of The Day the Fish Came Out has more faith in him than his superiors. Renzo is good with his hands in a tight spot and he is suave enough to seduce ladies. Eventually Renzo goes to bed with Helga Janet Agren of Seven Dangerous Girls who works as a secretary for the Baron at a Salzburg Austria chemical processing plant where she answers phones performs simple typing duties and is pretty much left alone to do her job. She falls for Renzo and furnishes him with enough incriminating information to raise the Baron's hackles. The Baron and his plugugly henchmen take Helga in for questioning. They want her to identify Renzo. Renzo and she cross paths and Renzo manages to rescue Helga from the Baron. A lively little boat chase through the canals of Amsterdam comparable to a similar chase in Puppet on a Chain ensues. Renzo is captured but Helga suffers a far worse fate. Helga's departure about halfway through The Uranium Conspiracy endows this thriller with more depth than it would have been otherwise. She is like the sacrificial lamb in the James Bond movies. One of the two girls that 007 stands between usually dies at the hands of the villains. Furthermore Renzo doesn't get the girl at fadeout and he remembers her after she has passed. A surprise like this is as radical as this movie gets and it imparts greater dramatic weight to the film. Our heroes team up after the Baron has taken Renzo hostage aboard the freighter carrying enough uranium to make 25 plutonium bombs. Israel Intelligence attaches electric mines to the hull of the ship. Everything is set to go boom when Dan refuses to let Renzo die in the process. Mind you Dan's superiors lack Dan's faith in Renzo. Dan sneaks aboard the ship rescues Renzo and a firefight breaks out for control of the ship. Unfortunately the villains overwhelm our protagonists but Israel Intelligence is on the ball. After almost detonating the explosives on the ship's hull the Israel send in a team to wrest control of the ship from the Baron. This part of The Uranium Conspiracy moves much faster with the shootout. The Mossad masquerade as Spanish Customs to board the ship. This final firefight delivers griping action. Again the fuse in this explosive thriller burns slowly in the first twothirds of The Uranium Conspiracy until it ignites the fireworks in the final third.".

A rollicking yarn that not only proves Golan was a competent director but also cements Testi's position as one of the more charismatic rough an' tumble leading men of the 70's and I genuinely feel a retrospective of his dashing heroics is well overdue.

Thirty some plus years ago this would have played like a fantasy with it's plot involving a clandestine business group buying up two hundred tons of yellow cake uranium. Today who knows? Fabio Testi and Assaf Dayan portray a couple of hunky secret agents on the trail of the deadly cache taking them to various scenic locales in Europe among them Amsterdam and Milan. Janet Agren shows up for the first half of the film as a love interest for Testi's Renzo and if there's a twist moment in the picture it's what happens to her character about midway through. Although we're set up for a grand show with all those explosives planted on the Scheersburg it comes to naught when the good guys make the save at the last moment. My question is if the boss handing out assignments to Renzo and Dan Dayan wasn't too concerned about blowing up the ship with just Renzo on board why did it matter if Dan went looking for him  the stakes were the same. Oh and there's a character named Ulrich in the cast whose real name makes me wonder why he didn't change it for professional reasons. Seriously you have to look it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "This obscure thriller is the result of a collaboration between three countries  Italy West Germany and Israel  and with all that talent involved you'd think the movie would be at least halfway decent. Sadly not. Instead this is a deservedly forgotten little movie that attempts to channel the '70s interest in conspiracies mysteries and thrillers but offers only lacklustre thrills and excitement. Don't be fooled by the promise of a 'GolanGlobus' production in the opening credits  this is before the two names became synonymous with OTT Chuck Norris films packed with cheesy action. The only action to be found here is limited to around fifteen minutes of boat car and rooftop chases that take place around the halfhour mark. The boat and car scenes are subBondian at best but always go through the motions than offering anything in the way of genuine excitement. At least they show off the nice canals of Amsterdam which always make good movie backdrops. The rooftop fights are better and we do get to see a guy falling from the roof so this is easily the most exciting part of the film.Otherwise the running time is padded out with shots of the hero played by Fabio Testi walking around sitting around or talking to people. There's a lot of inaction and even the climatic battle on board a ship is particularly dull by genre standards  this is an extreme even ludicrous case of the bad guys not being able to hit anybody while the good guys kill at a rate of one baddie per shot. The standoff runs on interminably for twenty minutes or so and is enlivened only by an appalling Scottish accent that had me reaching for the mute button.The film has a gritty dirty onthestreet look but the effect is more depressing than enthralling. Testi long a staple of Italian cinema can be pretty good and charismatic when he wants to be but the film doesn't offer him the opportunity. Assi Davan is the Israeli costar and he fares little better and the two are so thinly characterised as to make them almost interchangeable. Janet Agren  familiar to horror fans for her role in the cult Lucio Fulci film CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD  looks good if heavily made up but her womaninperil scenes are limited. She only seems to be around to whip her top off and take part in a twist worthy of Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Other regular staples of Italian cinema  e.g. Hebert Fux  are invisible in a film populated by cardboard cutouts throughout.Utterly devoid of incident excitement and the genre staples of suspense and tension THE URANIUM CONSPIRACY is a bythenumbers outing that ticks all of the boxes without ever doing anything right. Given the cooperation between three countries during production this might be the result of a 'too many cooks' situation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where Eagles Dare was produced by folks who decided that Alistair Macleam deserved to be produced on film by someone who followed the author's exciting ideas. The result is a major improvement of the User qualities of the character played by Clint Eastwood the potent casting of Richard Burton who is very very good for once in an adventurelevel lead as the infinitelyresourceful leader of a WWII team of destructive agents and an intelligent if actionlevel work of cinematic artistry. Others have written very well on this film what I want to add to their basic core of arguments is some notes about the acting and ideas. From the group's boss Michael Hordern to the ladies Mary Ure and zoftik Ingrid Pitt to enigmatic Robert Beatty everyone involved is more than adequate in hisher part to very good. The three enemies Ferdy Mayne Derrin Nesbitt and Anton Diffring excel in whatever scenes they are given and Peter Barkworth Donald Houston Patrick Wymark et al as traitors have never been seen to greater advantage. Director Brian Hutton faced the allbutimpossible task of bringing a vaguelyimplausible raid staged in snow country on an isolated castle to life. With stirring music lovely art direction and edgeofimpossible special effects involving explosives running machinegun duels in a bus falling telephone poles a battle on a cable car wrecking at an airport and a parachute drop betrayed from the start he manages to bring the entire tale off very nicely by my standards. The other chief asset of the film lies in its unusually intelligent dialogue plot turns and constant surprise. I counted at least seven major surprises every one of which as in a good Hitchcockian thriller leads to a memorable scene these are therefore not just script gimmicks but rather they qualify as ingenious use of the adventure genre to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. This film perhaps is what James Bond films always should have been but only in the case of Doctor No and Goldfinger ever were. One could wish that The Secret Ways Ice Station Zebra and several others of McLean's thrillers had been treated with as much respect and near genius as this memorable piece of screen excitement was for once afforded.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic stuff!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the first real action movies as we know it today ever made. The movie has lots of explosions and gun and fist fights. The story is told in a fast pace with lots of cuts even though the movie itself isn't short at all 158 minutes..Even though it is still a war movie this movie isn't as heavy and or serious as many other WW II movies made in the same period. It is kind of in the same style as The Guns of Navarone Also written by Alistair MacLean.. It's more is adventurous and fun to watch than heavy or realistic. Director Brian G. Hutton later also made the other 'fun'adventurousWW II movie Kelly's Heroes.Another element that distinct this movie from other movies from the same genre is the story. The story by famous writer Alistair MacLean is just brilliant! It begins as an average WW II rescuemission movie but as the movie progresses the story takes several twists until at a certain point you don't even know who to thrust anymore. The ending is really actionmovielike spectacular and features a tense fight an a moving cablecar followed by the perhaps even better car chase which really reminded of the chase were Indy and his father are escaping the Nazi's on the motorcycle in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Even the music sounded kind of similar! I wouldn't be surprised if Spielberg and Williams were inspired by this movie. The same goes for many other movie directors and other persons in the movie business by the way. I see similarities between this movie with 'modern' work quite often both in story and characters as well as the action editing and many other elements from this movie. This really is an inspirational movie that as an action movie just like as for instance North by Northwest was far ahead of its time.It was a bit strange to see Clint Eastwood in the sidekick role. The main character of the movie is played by the legendary Richard Burton. Both actors really push this movie to an higher level with their profession and expertise and both are very believable in their roles.An entertaining action packed adventurous war movie with a splendid story and two wonderful performances from the two main actors.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the first real action movies as we know it today ever made. The movie has lots of explosions and gun and fist fights. The story is told in a fast pace with lots of cuts even though the movie itself isn't short at all 158 minutes..Even though it is still a war movie this movie isn't as heavy and or serious as many other WW II movies made in the same period. It is kind of in the same style as The Guns of Navarone Also written by Alistair MacLean.. It's more is adventurous and fun to watch than heavy or realistic. Director Brian G. Hutton later also made the other 'fun'adventurousWW II movie Kelly's Heroes.Another element that distinct this movie from other movies from the same genre is the story. The story by famous writer Alistair MacLean is just brilliant! It begins as an average WW II rescuemission movie but as the movie progresses the story takes several twists until at a certain point you don't even know who to thrust anymore. The ending is really actionmovielike spectacular and features a tense fight an a moving cablecar followed by the perhaps even better car chase which really reminded of the chase were Indy and his father are escaping the Nazi's on the motorcycle in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Even the music sounded kind of similar! I wouldn't be surprised if Spielberg and Williams were inspired by this movie. The same goes for many other movie directors and other persons in the movie business by the way. I see similarities between this movie with 'modern' work quite often both in story and characters as well as the action editing and many other elements from this movie.

Their mission evacuate an Allied General who has detailed knowledge of the Normandy invasion. Parachuting down into the Alps the team soon discovers that one of them is dead and that there is a Nazi traitor in their midst. And that is not all what's going on...From opening scene to final scene Alistair MacLean's screenplay is a masterpiece of the action genre with a detailed and involving plot that unfolds in a very interesting manner. There are plenty of hairpin turns along the way that build up the suspense to a truly explosive TNT packed climax. That is all thanks to Brian Hutton's direction which is well a blueprint for contemporary studiobudget action filmmaking. The film is long but the realtime development of many scenes makes for terrific suspense even in slow moments and utterly breakneck action scenes. The best example is the final 45 minutes  an escape scene in realtime as our heroes breakout of the Schloss Adler. Consisting of shootouts fights chases explosions and car crashing it is probably one of the best action sequences ever made. For reasons beyond me Brian Hutton's career never fully took off into action adventure filmmaking but had it he would be the Hitchcock of action filmmaking. This film does to shootouts what Hitchcock did for showers! Well almost.Next are the stars  Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton. They are the leaders of the covert operation and they are a terrific fearless submachine gun totting duo who give the Nazis what they deserve most  pure hell. The classic corridor shootout as Eastwood fends of soldiers from the castle radio room is brilliant and ridiculous at the same time  he takes 'em all out! With a submachine gun in each hand! Make no mistake this movie is ridiculous and wholly improbable but if you find an action film that is more entertaining involving and suspenseful along with being pure fun to watch I'll be damned.If that's the cake then the icing must be Ron Goodwin's amazing score of epic proportions. First appearing in the opening credits or the DVD main menu it is the type of stuff that makes contemporary master film composer Hans Zimmer proud.Action film fans this is one of the ultimate movies for you. Take note  Watch it! 1010Rated PG quite generously for pretty extensive violence and action".

Don't get me wrong I love Clint as much as the next girl but Burton is so...masterful. He's deliciously awesome. And sometimes when he's wiping out tons of Nazis you can see this gleeful evil and satisfying smile on his face that just tells you this guy love his job. If he isn't killing Nazis he just wouldn't know what to do with himself. That's my kinda man.Okay so you have to totally suspend some belief for this movie to work but it's a James Bond like thriller. I mean people who are commenting that it doesn't conform to WWII historical standards have got to get their heads out of their books for a bit and try enjoying life instead of merely studying it for a while. And by the way as one user commented some helicopters like the one in the movie were flying in 1939 in Germany. They just weren't widely used at the time.This movie totally kicks butt. Forget about it making sense in a military way that's not what it's about. War Games didn't make sense either but it was fun anyway. And another little gripe about some critics the Germans aren't in a position to blow up the doors in the castle because tada that's a really stupid thing to do seeing as how if they miscalculate the explosive charge they could bring a ton of medieval blocks slamming down on their heads in the process. The Nazis are stupid in this movie but they're not that stupid. Duh.Clint manages to wipe out about half the Reich in this movie with his machine gun and even has a great take where he does a Matrixstyle dualwield gunning move which is all in great fun. Hey Han Solo wiped out about half the Stormtroopers in the galaxy too with his blaster and trying to point that out as being unreal would be just...well...silly. The Force isn't real either. Wanna complain? Go figure....I suggest you get this movie on DVD. It's awesome. The letterbox format totally kicks and I love it. The score is great. The action is awesome. The plot the first time you see it always keeps you guessing. At least it did for me but that's because I don't read a billion books on spies so that I can dream about being one when I never will be. Maybe that's why I enjoyed this movie a lot more than some others. This has got to be one of my top all time favorite movies.Yes! Awesome movie. Have fun watching it. It's long but it's great. Sometimes great movies are best when they are long so you get to enjoy them more. To the others who took this waaaaaaaaay too seriously relax.It's...just...a...movie.

As usual the critics are wrong.Navarone has many virtues but too much talk and highmindedness slow down the story.   Anthonys Quayle and Quinn are wonderful but Gregory Peck comes off as more of an Oxford don than a worldrenowned mountaineer and David Niven playing surely the oldest corporal in the British forces.proves an insufferable bore.  Eagles on the other hand dispenses with the moralizing claptrap and serves up nonstop action.  Although it's running time is approximately the same as Navarone's it never seems as long and you never feel the characters are trying to make a point except with their machine pistols.  Of course Eagles greatest strong points are Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.  By 1968 Burton had eschewed the serious parts for the big money and the critics crucified him for selling out.  Well in this case I'm glad he did since he's superb as team leader Major Smith.  Burton projects an aura of invincible selfconfidence.  He's rather reserved much of the time but you never doubt his engagement.  This is a man who simply won't be defeated.  Peck's stuffy diffident performance in Navarone pales by comparison.  And Eastwood though hardly Burton's equal as an actor is Dirty Harry in boot camp  his Schaffer will kill you sooner than look at you and it doesn't hurt that he looks great too.Eagles also has a better villain than anyone in Navarone superior scenery and a far superior score.   Ron Goodwin's theme has been etched in my mind for over 30 years but I can't remember a note from Navarone's.Perhaps the greatest World War Two adventure film of all time.  Less realistic than a James Bond movie but outstanding escapist entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps one of the best war films ever to come out of Hollywood WED is typical BoysOwn escapist adventure where our heroes Burton Eastwood et al can do no wrong and the action comes thick and fast.But this isn't total mindless violence see Rambo 2 for that kind of rubbish. WED does have a decent story and nice little plot twists that although not totally plausible do make the film a bit more thoughtprovoking than just watching 148 minutes of gun fire explosions decapitations and soldiers being thrown off cable cars at great altitude.Even though both Eastwood  Burton hog most of the show and rightly so they are ably supporting by two women Mary Ure  Ingrid Pitt. Both women don't have chunky roles but its significant to see any females play such positive parts in what is mostly a male arena when it comes to war films.Some of the photography is absolutely stunning even though some of the stunts are clearly filmed in the relative safety of a studio and it shows too!The acting although not as pofaced talky  selfrighteous as the film's nearest rival The Guns Of Navarone see review is good by most standards. Burton looks perhaps little old for this kind of allout hero roll but he manages to pull it off with his fierce determination and calm disposition.As for Eastwood well it meant a uniformed departure from his poncho gun holster  cowboy hat from his day with Sergio Leone. He is still playing the same kind of character as The Man With No Name and is still killing hundreds of bad guys while looking suitably cool  reserved the only difference is the era  from the Wild West to WW2.But surprisingly the combination of Burton's classical approach to acting  Eastwood's brash newkidonthe block 60s adaption works quite well and make for a good partnership as they go about kicking German Butt in their usual inimitable ways.Brian Hutton's direction follows the pace  temperament of Alistair MacLean's sparkly screenplay although I do feel the film is a tad too long and I think about 15 minutes could've been cut without really upsetting the balance of the story.WED doesn't challenge the brain it is thoughtprovoking in its own little ways and probably bares little or no resemblance to how life was really like during the real WW2. But for all that WED is great entertainment. It doesn't insult the intelligence but then again it was never meant to. But what we are left with is a very enjoyable romp with a great cast and superb scenary.It doesn't take itself too seriously as Guns Of Navarone does and neither is it just mindless violence Rambo 2. This film dares to be different and succeeds in spades.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "During World War II Major Smith is in charge of a highly dangerous mission to rescue a captured American general held in a remote mountain castle being used by the Germans as a command centre. As he and his men attempt to infiltrate this stronghold it seems that doubleagents are everywhere and the mission is doomed to fail ...There are two types of war movies the poetic philosophical ones and the ones where they blow up as much stuff as possible. This is the best example of the latter and for me the best World War II movie ever made. I think it's the unique structure that does it for me  there's an impossible mission to break into an impregnable fortress which lasts for eighty minutes followed by a fifteenminute dialogue scene that piles so many crazy plot twists on top of each other that it turns your brain into mush. Then there's an unparalleled fifty minutes of nonstop action as our heroes kill their enemies destroy the communications blow up half the castle rappel down the walls escape in a cable car leap into a river drive a truck through occupied territory dynamite a bridge smash up an airfield and escape in a fastmoving plane. I think this sequence is simply the finest nonstop action footage ever lensed. The great novelist Alistair MacLean wrote the story directly for the screen although he also published it in book form and came up with the most exciting wartime spy adventure ever written. There's just no flab in it it's a long movie but it's all plot and action all the way with no boring characterisation love interest waffly dialogue or padding. Despite this or perhaps because of it the cast are fantastic in the lowkey tone of their performances grim dogmatic straightahead and focused with Burton and Eastwood a brilliantly unlikely pair of leads and kudos to the relatively unknown Nesbitt as the memorably creepy redheaded Major Von Hapen the scariest Gestapo officer in the movies until Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. The four key technical elements of any film  photography music editing and art direction  are all outstanding particularly Ron Goodwin's big booming drummerboy score which pounds memorably along. This is that rare cinema treat a brilliant story brilliantly realised. Our appreciation must also go to the incredible stuntwork by Hollywood legend Yakima Canutt who was the assistant director and supervised many great sequences like the hairraising fight atop the cablecars. Shot in fantastic Alpine locations in Austria the Schloss Adler is really the eleventhcentury Burg Hohenwerfen south of Salzburg and at Borehamwood Studio. Trivia  Clint Eastwood as the charming Major Shaffer kills about forty people up close and personal in this film and about another forty indirectly via explosives  a Boy's Own comicbook soldier hero if ever there was. This movie is the best kind of entertainment  fastmoving actionpacked and dramatic without ever being stupid a sensational story and superbly put together. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take Alistair MaClean's Guns of Navarone and Ice Station Zebra then you have the recipe for Where Eagles Dare. Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton are sent on an Alpine spysabotage mission behind enemy lines aimed at confusing and delaying the Germans. It's interesting to see Eastwood take seconds to Burton's acting in this picture. Eastwood was just coming off his major success with the Italian westerns and was an international star but wasn't an American leading man. This film marks the last time he wasn't in the starleading man part. Dotted throughout the movie are wonderful actors who turn in solid performances. Accomplished thespians Patrick Wymark Donald Houston and Derrin Nesbitt to name a few are faces many will recognize from UK television roles. An interesting point made in the film is the ordinary German soldier's sometime disdain for the fanatic Nazi SS or Gestapo trooper. This is shown through one German officer's unwillingness to comply with the local Gestapo major. It's rare to see that kind of layer added to the German side of a plot in an American picture. Generally they are always just treated as bad guys to be dispatched in hails of lead or burning explosions. The film holds up well over time and there's little to date it to 1969 save for the youthful faces of many of the actors. Some 36 years after its release Where Eagles Dare continues to be entertaining. It certainly beats the current crop of big gasoline driven explosion movies that have no plot. It is heavy on action and plot but it has a running time of 155 minutes  plenty of time to develop plot and action.".

It is heavy on action and plot but it has a running time of 155 minutes  plenty of time to develop plot and action.";

	schema:reviewBody "Clearly one of the best of its genre Where Eagles Dare comes across as a powerful espionage drama with a high dose of adrenealin. Although the screenplay is quite convoluted it is extremely engrossing and keeps the viewer on the toes. In fact the intertwined storyline adds to the vigor and vitality of the film. Its like a guessing game which the director plays with the audience. Richard Burton charts out of his usual epic and sensitive roles and dons on the mantle of a tough Major. He is ably supported by Clint Eastwood who is impeccable in his little speaking role of of Lt. Schhaffer. The cinematography and background score catapults the film to new heights. The title music is haunting and remains with you hours after you finishing watching the film. I feel that maybe a little more deft editing would have enabled the film to be labled as a classic.".

The majority of WW2 war films are American of course with a subjectively American point of view ie the Yanks won the war single handed . Not surprisingly two WW2 war films I still love today are DAS BOOT and CROSS OF IRON both of which are German productions . WHERE EAGLES DARE is a British film but suffers from many of the faults as its American counterpartsThe screenplay was written by the late Alistair MacLean at a time when even his shopping lists would be produced into blockbusters . MacLean was a schoolteacher by trade but was famous for his meticulous research into the subjects he wrote about which makes WHERE EAGLES DARE doubly disappointing  The GermansNazis are portrayed as being cruel and very stupid  theyre also very easy to kill because unlike the British and American characters they find it impossible to shoot straight . In fact its totally ridiculous the way Eastwoods character is able to fire two machine guns at once and throw back the Germans grenades without getting a scratch . In truth the Germans were very efficent on the battlefield while being very cruel off it.Maybe Im a bit hard on the movie since its not really a war film but a spy story set during the war  a bit like a James Bond film where Anton Differing is Blofeld . Its also interesting to see Richard Burton play a very similar character to Bond since he was once a candidate to play Flemings character and if his performance here is anyhing to go by he might have outdone Connery as a sadistic assassin but probably would have been less convincing as a  sophisticated womaniser . Theres also a brilliant twist where it looks like Smith isnt who he claims to be but this is the only moment of brilliance in a film with cliched portrayals of Germans and rather poor production values  Check out the myriad of scenes featuring some painfully obvious back projection  which wont appeal to an audience in 2003".

The two main Allied agents waltz through their mission killing Nazis with ridiculous ease while casually strolling through a hailstorm of bullets. Never once do you get the impression that the heros of this movie are in any danger of death or of failing to complete their mission despite the supposedly incredible odds against their success.  This makes for a painfully boring movie completely lacking in suspense but abounding in absurdity.For me the worst crime of this movie is the way it trivialises the Allies' bloody struggles and hard won victories over the Germans during WWII.  The final verdict?  Even Colonel Klink would have been insulted.  Nuff said. But if you want the dirty details... Warning! Possible spoilers and definite rants follow. Where else but in Hollywood could a group of British covert agents openly and casually discuss their plans for infiltrating the most heavily guarded Nazi fortress in Germany while sitting in a German pub filled wall to wall with Nazis? Hello?! Where but Hollywood could a British and American agent stand unconcealed atop a trolley hundreds of feet above the ground travelling into the heart of this very fortress and not be seen by the trolley guards who seemed to be determined to look in every direction except the one from where the trolley is approaching?  Where else would a Nazi guard knowing that Clint Eastwood is an American agent fall for his extremely lame I need to tie my shoelace !?! line while travelling in a car!  Germans know the importance of properly tied shoelaces while sitting in an automobile! Where else can a single Allied agent Clint Eastwood of course hold off hordes of Nazi soldiers singlehandedly?  Not only that but casually pick up a Nazi grenade tossed at him and throw it back at the Nazis taking his time in doing so whereupon it promptly explodes?  Were these German grenades designed only to kill Nazis?  Then when the plot demands it a single Gestapo officer orders both of our heros to drop their guns and they do so promptly despite the fact that they both have two machine guns to his one Luger and Nazi officers as hostages to boot. I'm sure there is more of this incredible stupidity to report but I couldn't bring myself to watch more than half of this absurd movie.".

Hutton's Where Eagles Dare than he did western outlaws as either Sergio Leone's Man with No Name in the Dollars trilogy or criminals as Dirty Harry in his five Warner Brothers crime epics. Bestselling Scottish author Alistair MacLean penned the splendid screenplay that he later converted into a much tamer novel about a team of elite British M.I. 6 secret agents that parachute into Germany to rescue a highranking officer with a mother lode of knowledge about the June 6th Normandy landings. This atmospheric MGM blockbusterclocking in at 158 minutesis probably the greatest actionadventure opus with a World War II setting ever produced. We're talking walltowall gunfire with more surprises and complications than most movies envisage. Burton and Eastwood appear in top form and busty Ingrid Pitt and Mary Ure as undercover female agents give them considerable help and guidance. Where Eagles Dare is also notable for composer Rod Goodwin's percussive orchestral soundtrack. Goodwin carved out a niche for himself in World War II movie soundtracks with 633 Squadron Force 10 from Navarone Operation Crossbow and The Battle of Britain. Some war movies take an antiwar stance but neither Hutton nor MacLean had higher ideals on their collective minds when they made this warasanadventure epic. If you are a World War II movie buff and you haven't seen Where Eagles Dare then you need to get yourself a copy of this memorable massacre.Admiral Rolland Michael Hordern of Royal Flash sends a group of British commandos on a suicidal mission to rescue U.S.A.F.F. General George Carnaby Robert Beatty of 2001 A Space Odyssey one of the overall coordinators of planning for the second front Canby has been is imprisoned in an impregnable mountain fortress called the Schloss Adler a.k.a 'the Castle of the Eagles.' As it turns out the Schloss Adler is the headquarters for the German Secret Service in Southern Bavaria. Colonel Wyatt Turner DSO MC Patrick Wymark of The League of Gentlemen informs them that the castle is named appropriately because only an eagle can get to it. Apparently on a night flight to Crete Carnaby's British Mosquito was shot down by a wandering Luftwaffe Messerschmitt and the Mosquito crashed in near the town of Werfen. Major Jonathan Smith Richard Burton of Raid on Rommel Lieutenant Morris Schaffer Clint Eastwood of Kelly's Heroes Captain James Christiansen Donald Houston of 633 Squadron Sergeant Harrod Brook Williams of The Wild Geese Captain Philip Thomas William Squire of Alexander the Great Sergeant Jock MacPherson Neil McCarthy of Zulu and Edward Berkeley Peter Barkworth of Seven Keys are to parachute into Germany enter the castle and snatch Carnaby.One of the sergeants suggests at the briefing that the R.A.F. fill a bombladen plane and crash it into the mountain fortress. Rolland reminds him that killing an American general might anger General Eisenhower. No sooner have our heroes bailed out than one of them the radio operator is found dead in the snow with a broken neck. The Gestapo raids a tavern in Werfen and arrests the rest and takes them separately for questioning. Smith and Schaffer are hauled away together but they manage to escape after their car crashes. Smith and Schaffer then climb atop the cable car that ascends to the Schloss Adler. Simultaneous one of their undercover agents Mary Ure is being escorted by a suave but sadistic Gestapo officer in the cable car to work in the castle. Once our heroes have gotten into the castle Smith interrupts a meeting between high ranking German officers and General Carnaby. Smith proves beyond a doubt to SSStandartenfhrer Kramer Anton Diffring of Heroes of the Telemark and Gen. Rosemeyer Ferdy Mayne of The Fearless Vampire Killers that he is a doubleagent working for the Nazis as well as the British with a nighttime call to another highranking German general.Eventually when it comes time to break out of the castle Smith relies on Schaffer who plasters the place with tripwire explosives. Once the Nazis realize what is going on all hell breaks loose. Where Eagles Dare the movie surpasses MacLean's own novel he wrote the screenplay and he provides Richard Burton with some of the greatest lines that you'll ever hear in the World War II movie. Indeed Where Eagles Dare is the best World War II thriller that Burton and Eastwood ever made with Burton making more W.W. II thrillers than Eastwood. The rest of the cast is firstrate and composer Rod Goodwin of 633 Squadron provides a memorable score that ramps up the action and intrigue. At 158 minutes Where Eagles Dare never lets up on either action or excitement. The surprises that crop up in the narrative match the sizzling action sequences. Clearly this is Brian Hutton's most memorable film far better than the action comedy romp that he went on to direct Kelly's Heroes with Clint Eastwood after Where Eagles Dare wrapped. For the record the propeller driven plane that appears during the opening credits is vintage Nazi plane. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the fighter planes that Smith and Schaffer blow up in the last major shoot out sequence.Hollywood has yet to equal Where Eagles Dare.".

Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman James Woods who took him under his wing. Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy. He meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke Lukas Haas who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass. Influenced by this book and his experiences with LSD Jobs and Kottke spend time in India. Two years later Jobs is back in Los Altos California living at home with his adoptive parents Paul John Getz and Clara Lesley Ann Warren. He is working for Atari and develops a partnership with his friend Steve Wozniak Josh Gad after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer the Apple I.

Unfortunitely this movie seems incomplete and without heart. More accurately most of the scenes seem incomplete disjointed and pointless. It all adds up to nothing.Problem 1 You don't care for Jobs and you leave the theater not knowing Jobs. There are few emotional moments in the movie  except when you want to spit on him. Fire this person unnecessarily deny that loyal employee wellearned benefit use your wealth to destabilize the company... it all describes someone you are glad you don't know personally or professionally.Problem 2 The movie is paced slower than my Aunt Minnie in a walker. I've seen paint dry faster.Problem 3 The acting... maybe I should say the affectations. Kutcher overemphasized Jobs odd gate and stance as if it meant something. But why distract us with an antalgic back hyperextension of the knees increased lordosis and anterior propulsion? It distracted from the story and took me out of the movie every time.Problem 4 The editing was horrible. Scenes would start and finish randomly  with no emotional content. Many scenes had no relationship to the structure of the movie  taking valuable time and adding little to nothing disjointed would be too nice of a word.Problem 5 The strange arc of the storyline ended before it began in earnest. The writing didn't explain how the apple II was able to sustain the many many years of subsequent failures. Do corporations really build stockholders via image not performance? Metaphysically I know that untalented aholes who use abuse and throw people away deserve to suffer. But we didn't see suffering. We see a fabulously wealthy person whose emotional system was M.I.A slide through life on the efforts of others.There is no teaching moment in this movie. There is no emotional content. There are no memorable lines or moments. This isn't a movie it feels more like revenge cold and pointless.".

It is a truly unremarkable biopic of the master of innovation as you could possibly imagine. Jobs follows an overly safe unimaginative course that clocks in at a tiresome 122 minutes. The storytelling is painfully straightforward covering only the principal events of his professional trials and tribulations and providing little else beyond what is already public knowledge.Developing his imagination for computer programming at Atari Steve Jobs Ashton Kutcher brings in his friend Steve Wozniak Josh Gad to help with the hardware aspect forming a partnership that would soon lead to the founding and development of Apple Computers a force within the industry throughout the 1980s. Steve is not prepared for the financial demands and the ruthless business mentality and is eventually forced out of the company he began only to return in the 1990s with a fresh game plan on how to bring Apple back into the public consciousness and to dominate the industry once again.Jobs is a biopic with a very narrow focus and without any sense of risk or adventure. It is so intent on covering Jobs' entire corporate career that it simply reduces his personal life to a footnote. Stern completely glosses over Jobs' personal life which is essential to any selfrespecting biopic. The entire production feels rushed and slapped together simply to benefit from being the first one out of the gate.To his credit Kutcher puts forth a good effort and he undeniably looks the part of Steve Jobs. Unfortunately Ashton always looks like he is trying too hard to play the part and never fully becomes the character he's portraying. His limitations on the big screen prove to be a major liability. He has developed a screen persona as likable character which has served him well with numerous TV sitcoms. Not so much with movies.What emerges is a movie that has a made for TV feel which depicts a selfabsorbed creep who stabs everyone in the back to simply to get his way that goes on for two plus hours. A thoroughly unsatisfying tribute and we are still left none the wiser as to what made The Father of the Digital Revolution beyond what we already know.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apple is currently the highest net worth company in the world and to own any of the Apple gadgets has become a status symbol. Steve Jobs is an idol a revolutionary and an inspiration to the millions of people who want to change the world. After his death his legendary status grew even more as it always does with passed away celebrities so it is perfectly reasonable that there were high expectations for this movie. People were expecting a grand masterpiece of epic proportions about a man who many want to relate to and who many want to be. Unfortunately the movie took a slightly different turn and the result of this can be seen on the IMDb movie score. This movie is not an epic journey of a strange protg who eventually achieved everything there was to achieve and was carried on the arms of a cheering crowd at the end followed by the end credits. NO! This is a movie about Jobs  about his personality about his decisions about his victories and about his failures. It is a cruel representation of what you have to go through in this world to achieve the status that he now has. It's a movie about a troubled hipster who wanted to learn and to achieve something but hated the system into which the young are thrown into. He dropped out of College but still attended some classes he got into fights at work because he would yell at his coworkers that they were not doing their job he took other peoples ideas remade them into a story and sold them with his speeches and he wanted all. He was stubborn he always wanted the impossible and here comes the part that made him a legend he always got the impossible out of people.Eventually he was driven from his company he made bad calls bad decisions bad products but later came back and dominated the computer scene again. He probably had more bad moments than good but it's the good ones that count...and it's the good ones that changed the world.The people didn't get what they wanted...they didn't get a people's hero nor the man that was always right. And no one wants to see a movie about a man who nobody liked half of the movie...but it is how he was and you have to accept that.Ashton Kutcher's portrayal was also quite good and it seems that all the comedy movies and series that he has done have earned him a title of a bad actor so you will hear a lot people saying this was a miss cast. Don't believe this people go see the movie and make up your own mind.So don't be discouraged by the low IMDb ranking and see this movie with expectations of a great movie about a man who was an inventor a visionary a man who changed the world but was still only that a man nothing more nothing less.P.s. Don't expect to see any modern products in this movie. At the beginning you will only briefly get to see the first generation Ipod while other products are all the ones from the era before 1996. The movie actually ends in 1996 so many are disappointed that the movie did not show the era of Ipod's Ipad's Iphone's and Macbook's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jobs could have been insanely great but instead gives a lackluster glance at the highlights and low lights of Steve Jobs' life.While the film is factually accurate from the events cited and statements Steve Jobs made down to the realism of the characters appearances it lacked character development and a cohesive story. It is well cast and well acted. However with major events being presented in the film like news headlines there is no story justifying their existence. Steve Jobs is portrayed giving repeated quoted monologues instead of engaging in real dialog between himself and his coworkers to illustrate the chemistry of their relationships that lead to their success.Since 1982 I spent most of my adult life using Apple's products writing thousands of lines of code on the Apple II computer and reading every news story about Apple. The film fails to capture the grueling work and the pride programmers and engineers feel for designing cutting edge hardware and software to create Apple's superior computers and software.For such a prolific inventor and complex man that Steve Jobs was I am surprised that a veteran director like Ron Howard or Steven Spielberg didn't direct this. I really wanted to know how Steve Jobs' fatherinlaw inspired him and instilled in him his drive for perfection. I wanted to learn how Steve started iTunes and invented the iPod. These were not in the movie.There are many key events in Apple's history the film omitted that were crucial to understanding Apple's success. Steve's idea for the Mac originated with his engineer Jef Raskin showing him a prototype bitmapped GUI of Alto computer at the Xerox PARC think tank in 1979. It had the first personal desktop interface of windows icons menus and a mouse a major advancement over the millions of existing command driven PC's in the market using green screen monitors with monospaced fonts of 40 characters by 24 lines. Jobs was immediately convinced the Alto interface is the direction Apple Computer must go so he bought it from Xerox and designed the Lisa and later the Macintosh on this concept. The film omitted this visit to Xerox.There was fierce competition in the personal computer industry. A decadesold storied rivalry between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs began in 1985 one year after the Mac debuted. Except for one scene in the film this rivalry was completely omitted from it. Jobs' was irate that Gates stole Apple's graphic user interface GUI from the Macintosh but the film fails to show how this happened. Jobs previously went to Microsoft to hire Bill Gates to write business software Word Multiplan etc. to enable Apple to sell its new Macintosh computer. In doing so Microsoft learned how Apple's GUI worked reverse engineered it and created a similar interface for Microsoft's new Windows operating system to work on the existing millions of IBM computers running Microsoft's Disk Operating System MS DOS. Microsoft would compete directly against Apple Computer. Though the film does portray Steve Jobs as a disciplinarian a perfectionist and temperamental it never shows why he was this way.The film was remiss of major events and details needed to explain Apple's success story. Jobs got his start in electronics working for HewlettPackard after calling founder William Hewlett on the phone at his home. Jobs met Wozniak at HP. And Jobs used The HP Way as a blueprint for starting Apple Computer. Steve Jobs' miraculous turnaround of Apple from near bankrupt to profitable in three years and to the world's largest company in 13 years business leaders consider the biggest ever success story in the history of American business. How the film could leave out this turnaround inventing the highly successful iMac PowerPC iPod iTunes and iPhone is astonishing. Even before coming back to Apple Jobs reinvented Pixar animation after buying The Graphics Group from George Lucas revolutionizing animated movies for Disney that were created on NeXT graphics workstations the most advanced in existence that Steve Jobs invented. This too was omitted from the film.In one of his biographies Steve Jobs explains succinctly how the iPod epitomizes Apple Computer it combines Apple's incredible technology base with Apple's legendary ease of use with Apple's awesome design. This is the premise upon which Jobs should have been based. I recommend the film but with reservations.Chris Kaufmann".

It just makes me so mad to think that they could get away with making something like this Spend your 14 dollars and get something to eat while you watch Pirates of Silicon Valley a much better and much more accurate story of Steve Jobs and Apple's beginnings";

	schema:headline " An utterly perfunctory retelling of the Apple founder's ups and downs in his early professional years that is good only for the completely ignorant";
	schema:reviewBody "The first of what will surely be many biopics to come of one of the  20th century's greatest innovators 'Jobs' only draw is being first out  of the gate. Yes if you haven't yet been acquainted with the  tumultuous early years of the Apple founder then this perfunctory  retelling will probably be as good an introduction as any but everyone  else who is familiar with the story will be disappointed with this  overly simplistic portrayal of a complex man whose ambition was both  his greatest gift as well as his most significant stumbling block.  Beginning in 2001 when he unveiled his masterpiece the iPod to  rapturous applause Stern and his firsttime feature screenwriter Matt  Whiteley rewind the clock thirty years ago to 1971 when Jobs was a  student at Reed College Portland. An LSD trip a journey to India and  a brief stint at Atari later Jobs teams up with his buddy selftaught  engineering wiz Steve Wozniak Josh Gad to build Apple computers in  the former's parents' Los Altos garage. Jobs had the inspired idea to  combine a typewriter with a TV and the Apple II was born  but not  without the funding from entrepreneur and former Intel engineer Mike  Markkula Dermot Mulroney.  To find a dramatic hook Whiteley predictably focuses on the most  pivotal turning point in Jobs' life as Jobs' launch of the Macintosh  computer in 1984 sparks off an internal feud with his CEO John Scully  Matthew Modine and the rest of the Board including J.K. Simmons'  Arthur Rock that leads to his ouster and the company's subsequent  decline. Of course Jobs makes a return to the flailing company in 1996  upon thenCEO Gil Amelio's Kevin Dunn request returning Apple to its  roots in the personal computer market and paving the way for its  success today.  Is there anything this dramatization adds to that true story which you  cannot glean from any textbased account? Hardly if anything it  merely puts a face to the disbelief disappointment indignation and  gratification Jobs must have felt when he was kicked out of Apple and  then presented with the golden opportunity to rebuild the company into  the vision he had for it at the onset. The storytelling is pretty  straightforward covering the important events of his professional ups  and downs but providing little details beyond what is already public  knowledge.  Admittedly to expect more would probably be a tall order since the  man has passed away and the others who would be familiar with these  past events did not participate in the making of this film  including  the reallife Woz who in fact has been a vocal critic of the movie.  But more disappointingly Stern completely glosses over Jobs' personal  life and personality both of which are essential to any  selfrespecting biopic  after all how can any biography be complete  without an insight into the person whose life story is being told?  Whiteley's episodic script is utterly superficial in this regard  and  we're not talking about Jobs' drive determination or innovation.  Instead Jobs' crucial relationship with Wozniak is thinly sketched  not only because it omits how they met and their chemistry but also  because it barely explains why Woz quit Apple dissatisfied with the  direction the company was heading and the person that Jobs had become.  Other aspects of Jobs' character are given short shrift  for instance  we see Jobs dumping his pregnant girlfriend ChrisAnn Brennan Ahna  O'Reilly and refusing to recognise his newly born daughter as his own  early on but are given little explanation how and why he settles down  and turns into a family man later.  If the scripting is a part of the problem then the acting is yet  another. Chiefly while bearing more than a passing resemblance to  Jobs Ashton Kutcher is not up to the part. To his credit one can tell  Kutcher has put in a lot of effort into the role emulating his  character's awkwardly hunched posture as well as to some degree his  voice and gestures unfortunately Kutcher always looks like he is  playing the part and never quite becoming the character he is supposed  to portray. It is an affected performance and Kutcher's limitations as  a dramatic actor are all too apparent here. In fact the supporting  acts steal the show especially Mulroney's solid turn as Jobs' ally  turned adversary.  Most of all Stern's film rarely possesses the qualities that  characterised Jobs  it isn't bold enough to offer a balanced or  critical even perspective of the man including his more unsavoury  personal aspects nor unique enough to provide a distinctive look at  the early years of his storied career. What emerges is simply bland and  uninspired filmmaking which in the context of Jobs' illustrious and  intricate life is an unsatisfying tribute to a man who spent his time  being exactly the opposite.".

	schema:headline " Searching for Jobs. No Jobs here. This Jobs did pretty okay still.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was no 2010's Social Network but Jobs did an alright job. This movie seem to be the walking talking movie commercial that Apple need. It seems like an extended Apple ad. It was too much Apple to chew enough in my opinion. At less Social Network gave us a break from praising Facebook because Zuckerberg is portray as a successful man who also suffer from it. He betray his friends to get where he is or his friends end up betraying him because of his success. This movie praise Jobs way too much and act lie every success that Apple had was because of Steve Jobs. In my opinion he wasn't the brilliant mind that the media portray him to be. He was just narcissism enough to run a business savvy but he did get a lot of help from a lot of people. In my opinion Steve Wozniak Josh Gad deserves more credit than Jobs. He is the one that pretty much create Apple. Still this movie wasn't as good as 1999's TV mini movie Pirates of Silicon Valley that follow Steve Jobs and Bill Gate's career even better. In my opinion Jobs was alright biographical flick. The movie follows Steve Job's life from 1974 while a student at Reed College to the introduction of the iPod in 2001. I guess the film didn't care about his success with the IPHONE and IPAD. Nor does this film want to tackle the pancreas neuroendocrine tumor that he suffer from in his later life. It doesn't even mention what we was going between him getting fired and him getting rehired by Apple. Where is NeXT? NeXT was very important in the telling of Steve Jobs life. It was his lowest point. They didn't even mention Pixar for crying out loud! One of the reason why Steve Jobs got his job back at Apple. It even cut out most of the best part about Apple. The rival between Apple and Microsoft was cut to a 3 minute talk. No Bill Gates no anything. The film seem to be missing a good chuck of his life right there. I would love to know how he create those items. Sadly the film directed by Joshua Michael Stern doesn't do that. I wish this movie was created as a miniseries rather than this to focus more of those things that wasn't mention in the film. The film was written by Matt Whiteley and had Steve Jobs portrayed by Ashton Kutcher. While I'm not the biggest Ashton Kutcher fan I think a lot of criticize about his acting might be a bit harsh. Honestly I think a lot of criticize is coming from his work outside of this film. If you going to be a critic at less tell them why Ashton Kutcher didn't work for the role. In my opinion he wasn't bad in the film but he wasn't good too. I just found the whole thing about him not wearing shoes a bit odd. At less Ashton Kutcher put some research into his role and did the same diet as Jobs. He went to the ER because of that. That shows you that he was serious about his role. The meadow scene was laughable and show Ashton Kutcher limited ranged. The real Steve Jobs was a bit of jerk and I like how the film hints about it. People follow him like sheep and if you disagree with him. He will fired you or sue you. I don't know how watching a jerk is appealing. I think people are romanticized him way too much. I think most people coming in to see this movie thinks that way. To watch the 1984 ad on the big screen and think about how Apple is now. Apple has become what it wanted to fight against. A censoring all powerful organization that control the market. In my opinion Apple is way too big. Apple outsource manufacturing jobs to Asia to make their products for a cheaper price and we buy it. Rather Apple only gives short term goals servable jobs to Americans. If they gave more long term manufacturing jobs here. Maybe I would praise Apple more. There is no need to praise an American company when there is a period of high unemployment here in the US. In my harsh opinion the film was like watching Thomas Edison take credit for the light bulb and other products when in truth other people made it in his workshop. This movie is the fan boys of Apple products. In my opinion the Apple products are a bit overrated often rip off or stolen. The pacing of the film was pretty bad. A good example is how Jobs didn't accepted his daughter Lisa Annnika Bertea beforehand and then the film cut to later on his life without explaining anything Jobs accepted his daughter in his life. How on earth did that get resolved? It's never explain. The movie need to talk about his complexities more. It only hints. It fails to connect with people. I do hope Aaron Sorkin do end up picking up the Steve Jobs biopic project and writes better than this movie. I found no jobs here.".

He makes the movie so difficult to watch where was the director for God's sake!.But the problems don't end there. Jobs' life is only partially portrayed so if you only know about Jobs being at Applethat is still pretty much all you know about him. Engineers are portrayed as they typically are in Hollywood filmsnerdy enough to be uncool.Where is the story??!!

He makes the movie so difficult to watch where was the director for God's sake!.But the problems don't end there. Jobs' life is only partially portrayed so if you only know about Jobs being at Applethat is still pretty much all you know about him. Engineers are portrayed as they typically are in Hollywood filmsnerdy enough to be uncool.Where is the story??!!

The creators had the opportunity to make a significant informative film with their character study of the man who formed such a powerful company. But this one was a failure.The movie is supposed to be a character study. But honestly this movie doesn't teach us much about Jobs moreover it gives us a basic time line of his life and company. Kind of like those short 100 page biographies you read in 3rd grade for a book report that just really skim the surface and leave out everything. This film lacked transitionfluidity and seemed choppy. Like the scene where we see him at his house with his family the film never discussed that he came to have a wife and children. We only know that Lisa his daughter was from a previous relationship. And we learn that he tried to deny Lisa as his for a long time since the film focuses on it but it never shows that he had a change of heart and accepted her as his child. Isn't a biopic supposed to teach us about a persons emotions feelings about life and his relationships with others?If you want to learn about who Steve Jobs is read his biography. If you want something that makes you FEEL smart like you know about the genius of a man and Apple Corporation watch this film.".

For me this was the most awaited movie of the year more so because of having read the biography a couple of times. The ironies however does not end with the case of the font but the perfectionist he was I am sure if among us today he would have wanted some major iterations in the movie before his actual story came out to the public. A movie reaches out to a much wider audience exponentially than a book and those of you who have read the book should agree with me that movie did not do complete justice to Jobs biopic.Joshua Michael Stern who is known for directing dramas has concentrated more on the dramatic side of Jobs rather than the genius his was. He has failed to explain the reason behind his outbursts his mad passion for perfection and the primary reason for the personality that was the Steve Jobs. I would not dwell into the particular events but Stern could have shown the cause and consequence for the milestones he achieved. Whether it was shortage of time or bad script writing the movie would fail to connect with audience who do not much about Jobs. Moreover important events which made Jobs what he is like the creation of NeXT the buying of Pixar and his fight with cancer are completely missing.Ashton Kutcher has come a long way from portraying the stupid kid in That 70's show to portraying one of the geniuses of our generation. He is eerily similar to the original Steve Jobs and full marks to him for taking on the nuances the body language and the talking style of the Apple founder. The jaw line was perfect and as a young Jobs he was flawless. The script could have given him more to showcase his acting prowess but sadly the whole movie cracked around there. I am sure Jobs family would also share the view of Kutcher doing a brilliant JOB.The only other character worth mentioning is that of Mike Marrkula played by Dermot Mulroney a brilliant actor with an equally brilliant performance. Matthew Modine James Woods John Getz and others are just supporting the main man as the in his real life it was all about himself. The music is good and you get to hear some famous Bob Dylan songs in the movie as Steve was a big Dylan fan all this life.Even though for me Steve Jobs life has been a 55 I had expected a much better product from the production and so would have Jobs. A 35 from me sadly for the movie and for all the Jobs and Apple fans this is a must watch. However I would suggest you read the book before going to the movie. Alternatively if you have seen the movie and not the read the book now is the time to pick it up and do it.".

The main character is played by Ashton Kutcher here and he got a Razzie performance for his portrayal. I personally believe this was not justified. He did a fairly decent job in portraying the Apple mastermind and you could definitely see Jobs' mannerisms in Kutcher's performance. Also a thumbsup for the makeup department. Kutcher looks nothing like Jobs but they made it work.I believe that as a whole this was a movie that did not have really many great moments but it was solid from start to finish and even at a massive runtime of over 2 hours there were hardly no segments when the film dragged. This has received a lot of unjust criticism. I personally enjoyed the watch and it also made an informative impact as it tells you a lot about the life and career of Steve Jobs.

At times his portrayal seems a little clunky as he tries to master the walk of Steve Jobs he has an awkward kind of stoop which doesn't translate well on film. However there are other times when AK's performance is incredible his voice is near perfect pitch his body language mannerisms and words are so intuned to Steve he could be channeling him.One reason that the film has lower ratings is in my eyes that most people who see it won't have a great knowledge of the intense man that was SJ. He was a brute a tyrant and at times appeared crazy. If you read the biography by Walter Isaacson you will probably get a clearer picture. Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it cuts off just before all the really good stuff came along the iPod iTunes iPhone and iPad. The film also does not deal with Jobs' cancer or death which just leads to a feeling that it is incomplete.I personally liked the film and I don't think that it tarnishes Jobs' memory like I said he wasn't a saint oh BTW he is also a hero of mine it is just a complicated sometimes haphazard chronicle of an even more complicated man.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all actuality no one will never truly know how Steve jobs really was as an overseer and company head. As a story Ashton Kutcher pulled it off just as good as Noah Wiley the catch..... his voice. Kutcher carries a throaty teenlike voice that doesn't match up to the forever renowned Steve Jobs But he pulled it off perfectly in looks and mannerisms. There are many scenes where Kutcher plays a convincing jobs just by looks alone except however when any voicevolume comes about. This movie played the described Steve jobs to a T. The story was slow in certain spaces and even entered a lull in some but it stayed true to the heart of an ambitious young man in the heart of silicon valley who had a vision and a dream. Sure you may say tis movie doesn't capture the true heart of Steve jobs but who could other than the great himself. To the anti critics give Kutcher a chance because any biographical role is hard for any actor...... lets see you do it. The film focuses on the early and critical years of apple and evolves into where Jobs returns as CEO in the late 90's which is almost a prequel so in all actuality let it be that. Like any tasteful biography should be it doesn't focus on his death it focuses on what good the man did for this world. Don't consider this movie as a full on true story because its not. Consider it as a good story with great historical points in general telling the story of a man who perfection was the only option. It tells the story of a man with ambition. Even though there weren't many teaching points in the movie it really doesn't matter because thats what we have google for but be prepared for opinions. I gave this movie an 8 because it deserves every little point it can get as long as its worth the rating and this one got an 8 from me. As an early 80's child who saw the birth of the mac in my living room I can honestly say that the ambition put into the mac bled all over my living room and I felt the future every time I touched the desk. This movie allowed me to relive what it took to get that mac in my house. The mac will always be the ONLY PC ever all others are just copycat remakes of he 1980s trying to push Job's vision in another name and form to the public. Just to add a note If it wasn't for Jobs's education programs I never would have felt the need and use of a PC. My mother was a teacher who got hers on an extreme discount because of the school that hired her way before windows was ever introduced. This isn't a story of computers iPhones or iPods this is a story of a man who invented windows and yeah he did invent Windows. Without JobsGates would have never created Windows. Its just a good story! exclamation point!".

Even though there weren't many teaching points in the movie it really doesn't matter because thats what we have google for but be prepared for opinions. I gave this movie an 8 because it deserves every little point it can get as long as its worth the rating and this one got an 8 from me. As an early 80's child who saw the birth of the mac in my living room I can honestly say that the ambition put into the mac bled all over my living room and I felt the future every time I touched the desk. This movie allowed me to relive what it took to get that mac in my house. The mac will always be the ONLY PC ever all others are just copycat remakes of he 1980s trying to push Job's vision in another name and form to the public. Just to add a note If it wasn't for Jobs's education programs I never would have felt the need and use of a PC. My mother was a teacher who got hers on an extreme discount because of the school that hired her way before windows was ever introduced. This isn't a story of computers iPhones or iPods this is a story of a man who invented windows and yeah he did invent Windows. Without JobsGates would have never created Windows. Its just a good story! exclamation point!";

After taking LSD he realizes something unclear to the audience and his slacker buddies... But in the blink of an eye he's working at Atari screaming like a jerk boss even before becoming one. His sidekick is Steve Wozniak the pioneering engineer who built the first Apple computer. Nicknamed Woz and played by short and tubby Josh Gad he's the intentional audience favorite using witty sarcasm to alleviate the tension of his climbing and often cutthroat entrepreneurial partner. Gad in playing a goofy sidekick more than a real person partially redeems himself during the first of two heartfelt pleas to Jobs who during the early 80's when Apple got really big turned more corporateminded than artistic.And just as we jumped from college to Atari there's an awkward cut from the initial team working out of Steve's father's garage to the immense Apple building where several characters are forgotten and Jobs doesn't gel with the stiff suits including Dermot Mulroney's backer Mike Markkula a one time confidant and good friend. The best scenes occur in and out of that dusty garage the rudimentary Apple compound sadly we're not in this pivotal era long enough. Much of the film has Jobs desperately battling the powersthatbe in chilly whitewalled offices.Kutcher's piercing eyes are narrowed intensely and he's surprisingly effective but otherwise burdened by a forced imitation of quirky physical mannerisms Walking with a bentforward TRex posture is distracting and downright unnecessary the audience was giggling throughout.Although there are interesting moments and we learn some important lessons in tech history JOBS is hardly a biographical film Overlong scenes with uncreative CEO's demolishing each new idea are tedious repetitive and overwhelming.When the bigwigs aren't around and Jobs passionately lectures his minions on how to create usable products for the future the film plays out like a melodramatic commercial for Apple products which might have been intentional If Steve Jobs wasn't so uncaring and temperamental they'd probably have him walking on water... or creating the shoes to make it happen.".

As for Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs he did a helluva good impression according to Apple folks who were at the screening I attended. The dialog accurately reflects whats already out there in print reIsaacson and Moritz books on Jobs and the history of Apple computer.Like many docudramas I've seen the film had trouble creating the kind of underlying drama that a fictional account could do and the movie suffered a little bit from not having much of a back story.

Ashton Kutcher have the worst performance of his career he was so artificial and so I judged from the opening scene that this movies probably gonna be a marathon. He tried so hard to act like Jobs and amid this crises he made himself so fake which obviously bantered the character. Just because he looked like him doesn't mean he can portray Jobs!Enough about Kutcher if the story would have been epic it could have overshadowed Kutcher's gruesome acting. But the MAIN drop back of this film was the story I mean it's pretty frustrating because you watch a movie to seelisten to a story  when you don't have an idea what the story is it's a big kick on the face of the maker and writers. Seemed like a student procrastinated on an essay the night before threw a bunch of crap and submitted. On difference is that the maker of Jobs spent money for throwing crap. From the point of an avid movie goer it's hard to fathom how can someone put so much time and money to make something that wouldn't work. Well all we can do see warn people to not waste their time and money on this movie!".

	schema:headline " This Jobs biopic lacks a heart and soul";
	schema:reviewBody "If you don't share our enthusiasm and care for the vision of this company. Get out! You're done.How could you make a biopic about an inspirational and visionary man in such a bland manner? The film lacked the very elements that made Steve Jobs such a creative entrepreneur. It's a shame because the subject matter alone almost guarantees you will watch a great film. Jobs has altered our lives at this very moment I'm writing from one of his Mac computers while my brothers are chatting on their iphones and listening to music on their ipods. Somehow such great material got lost along the way and this Joshua Michael Stern directed film simply looks like a made for TV biopic. It is one of those movies that are so uninspired and consist of bad writing that you simply thought it was made for TV. Take for example The Social Network a film about the creator of Facebook a biopic I thought beforehand was going to be dull and boring but was completely blown away by Aaron Sorkin's script. He made Mark Zuckerberg look completely appealing. But here we have a much more visionary person like Steve Jobs whose story we all want to see told on film and the result from Matt Whiteley's script is completely uninspiring. The film could be called Apple Inc because it felt like it focused more on his creation than on the creator. There is nothing innovative about this biopic but the good news is that Aaron Sorkin is working on a script for another Steve Jobs biopic that hopefully will make justice of such an inspirational man. I can't even blame Ashton Kutcher for the failure of this film because the main problem here was that the script was so bland that all we had were one dimensional characters having uninspired dialogues. If I had never heard of Jobs before I would've thought that this visionary and charismatic leader was simply a dull and unloving person. You simply don't care for the Steve Jobs that's presented here.The film begins by introducing us to Steve Jobs Ashton Kutcher as he is presenting his latest creation the ipod which will change the way people listen to music everywhere as we already know. That is as far as the film goes as we jump back to the past and see Steve dropping out of college sometime during the 70's. He attended some creative classes simply as a drop in but he spent most of his time getting high with his friend Daniel Lukas Haas with whom he also travelled to India for a spiritual visit. Back at the US Jobs worked at Atari where he had trouble getting along with his coworkers. He was offered a special deal to create a circuit board and that is where he got his friend Woz Josh Gad to help him out. After having success Jobs and Woz partnered together selling circuit boards and founded their own small business in his parents' garage. Along with Daniel and Woz Steve hired Rod Holt Ron Eldard to help out with the engineering of the first Apple computer. Their next challenge was to get the funding needed to build the company which they finally got from Mike Markkula Dermot Mulroney. The film then goes on to focus on Apple's early success and later Steve's trouble getting along with the company's CEO John Sculley Matthew Modine his forced retirement from his own company and then his return to Apple several years later. It's a shame the film focused so much on Jobs's turmoil years and left out the most creative period of his life his successful return to Apple. I was OK with the fact that it showed his early beginnings at his garage because that is where the dream was born but I wish the film would've focused more on his successes. Jobs wasn't portrayed as a saint either and that is a plus we see how turbulent and erratic his behavior was at times as a temperamental manager. Ashton Kutcher wasn't terrible as Jobs he got some of his posture right the scene where he walks across the hallway at Apple is near perfect and at times the tone of his voice was also right but I also felt that there were several scenes where he lost that voice and simply became Ashton Kutcher again. The narrative structure of the film didn't work either. I felt there were so many moments that seemed disconnected at times and rushed. It's like they got some details right but the motivation behind Jobs' work was left out. His character lacked depth and so did everyone else's who simply come in and out of the film to set the next stage. I don't think that the perfectionist Father of the Digital Revolution would've approved of this movie if he were alive today. The biopic simply scratches the surface of Jobs' life but stays away from his heart and what really motivated him to be the visionary innovator he was. I'll be looking forward to Sorkin's take on his life.".

But it takes all the genre clichs from these movies while following the same story structure of Social Network. Since I mentioned David Fincher's movie Social Network I will start my review with the major problem in jOBS Considering Social Network was an aptly marketed everyone's hero style of an average businessdrama movie in order to market a Steve Jobs life story appropriately this wasn't the right choice. The cause of this marketing errors are the trailer the poster with Ashton Kutcher on it and the movie itself with Ashton Kutcher starring in it. Then what is jOBS about? jOBS is just a simple telling of a person's epochmaking achievement like Schindler's List Spartacus Raging Bull Braveheart Papillon The Pianist and even David Lnych's The Straight Story. jOBS has more than a few things in common with those movies including the pain of sacrificing your beloved ones in order to succeed in your career including similar character traits similar ethical beliefs similar moral decisions. jOBS is only a brief telling of what Steve Jobs gave to the Macintosh computers just like what Oscar Schindler gave to Jews and what Braveheart gave to Scotland. You can't expect to see the birth and death of Steve Jobs in this movie. This is not a biopic instead it's a drama poorly marketed good businessdrama. There are both strong and weak points in the technical side of jOBS. As a start having no narration is a strong point yet having not explained why Steve Jobs dropped out from college is crucially a weak point. Ashton Kutcher takes his girlfriend and goes behind bushes in the country and smokes weed. Then we get to figure it out that Steve Jobs has dropped out from college because he smoked weed and got his girlfriend pregnant. Refusing the birth of his first child due to his busy work schedules Steve Jobs character has been made more weaker and weaker minute after minute. There is certainly a rule of character growth followed in this film but none of this film's audiences have really bought that character growing incidents. This is an average businessdrama movie set in the world of entrepreneurial minds. You're lonely you always keep a positive mind but always looking for a person to trust you are goaloriented you take maximum risks for every little achievements in your life you are a reliable friend to your colleagues but they are always afraid of you and you see every step in your life as a competition with someone else's steps in their lives... This is a strong premise that killed the sense of making a Steve Jobs movie to honor his memory. This movie should have been made in 1997 when Steve Jobs have become the de facto chief CEO of Macintosh. And this movie could have been titled Think Differently as this is what it is only about. If this has been a movie called Think Differently made in 1997 then it could earn some recognition. Now people would come to you and ask What did Steve Jobs do for the last 14 years of his life as a CEO in Apple?".

I'm thinking of Wozniak Job's daughter Mike etc.And all that speeding through the story of his life to just finish halfway of his real success and end credits appear just to let you down with all your expectations blasted.".

People not acquainted to Job's life will have the feeling they're missing something and people who have read the book or simply know a little of Job's life will conclude the movie missed a lot.We'll see Steve bullying on everyone as a dictator running Apple right after picturing him as some clear minded wise man with a strong meditation and spiritual background.The story would have been so strong if only the characters took their time to develop and not just showing them to the camera say their names and on to the next clip of Jobs and his illuminated doing. I'm thinking of Wozniak Job's daughter Mike etc.And all that speeding through the story of his life to just finish halfway of his real success and end credits appear just to let you down with all your expectations blasted.";

Of course when you decide to take a movie genre and break all its rules one by one it helps to have two major movie stars by your side. Our American friends may not realize how big Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci are in France. They're like Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston only more rebellious and real and glamorous and daring and hip. When you look at their respective filmographies you know for sure that Agents secrets won't be a Troy or a Along Came Polly though I do respect and love Brad and Jennifer their career moves are sometimes well surprising. Now Vincent and Monica are a real life couple and they do not play a couple in Agents secrets but two spies who pretend to be a couple on a mission that will go awfully wrong. Don't expect too many visual effects here  the suspense is intensely psychological and the cast does deliver even though the screenplay sometimes doesn't to be honest the story is not always clear. When I saw the movie most people in the audience were very angry by its ending. Without giving it away I can tell you it is daring  the director wanted to make a movie about the extraordinary life of ordinary people who have no choice once they've chosen such a lifestyle but to live this way till they die. Their whole life is a mission and it has no end.".

The plot is realistic and the characterization has the existential overtones the French so much love agents doomed to obey orders and never ask questions living a lonely life of lies without any friendswhile blowing up ships and routinely jumping down planes. The film manages to find new ways to thrill and narrate the story and that when the espionage thriller field has already been saturated with Hollywood superproductions so for a French movie to succeed with half the budget and with a European sensibility is great going. Part of the action moves in Casablanca and Geneva but these locales are used in a refreshing way not the usual Hollywood exotica elsewhere if you see this movie try to compare it to say Bourne Identity and you will know what I mean. I love thrillers but for a long time hadn't seen a movie that really kept me glued but this was it. There are minor gaffes like the makeup in places the panicky way the agents are always looking around why are they being so obvious in a crowd when they are supposed to be secret eh and some flat actors.

The best casting is Vincent Cassel and he's probably the only one who took it seriously. The chief staff of the secret missions are too light to be described as bosses.

Apart from some interesting cinematography eg. the tandem swim at sunset this film is absolutely empty.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING SOME SPOILERS AHEAD I'd like to vindicate this movie since many people seem to have disliked it. And I'll tell you why this is one of the best spy movies I've ever seen. I'm no expert about the world of espionage but according to what I've learnt about reallife spooks this movie is based on reality in many aspects.The plot is based on operations conducted by the reallife French spy agency the DGSE that really occurred the bomb attacks on a German weapons trafficker in the 1950s who was supplying rebels in the Algerian War of Independence and the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior a ship owned by the environmental organization Greenpeace in 1985 in Auckland New Zealand. In the latter case just like in the movie a French female spy infiltrated Greenpeace and stole plans of the ship to be bombed and the actual bombing was carried out by French nageurs de combat combat divers more or less the French equivalent of Navy Seals some of them posing as a couple of Swiss tourists during their stay in New Zealand.For what I know about the subject the movie authentically depicts the modus operandi of reallife field agents e.g. George Vincent Cassel avoiding being seen with his contact Tony Eric Savin during the operation in Casablanca spy agencies hiring foreign mercenaries to do their deniable ops i.e. dirty jobs to make sure such ops will be deniable if discovered agents being betrayed by their own hierarchy for reasons of higher national interest the dirty tricks spy agencies of yet allied countries do to each other and more specifically to the DGSE the rivalry between the military officers represented by Cassel Bellucci and the Colonel played by Andre Dussollier and the civilian technocrats represented by the noname blackhaired cigarettesmoking guy in his early forties played by Bruno Todeschini the former ones having lost control of the agency to the latter over the years the DGSE was originally run by the French military. Many people found this movie boring but that's because the lives of real spies are exactly like that! The director stated that he wanted to depict accurately the state of mind of reallife field agents i.e. their solitude the fear they perpetually feel etc. and he has exactly achieved that and his movie must be seen more as a documentary look on real spies not as a James BondJason Bournelike action thriller. Those Hollywood movies aren't even remotely true to the real world of espionage. Even the British TV spy show Spooks seems unrealistic in comparison with this movie.I hope I have given some facts that will give a clearer perspective to some viewers in order to better appreciate Agents Secrets which may indeed seem a bit difficult to understand for those who are unaware of the reallife background it is based on. And on a purely cinematographic level this movie offers brilliant writing directing editing and acting. Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci convincingly portray two spies having to pose as a couple and always working professionally during their mission i.e. they're always careful never to allow an ounce of sexuality in their relationship. This is all the more remarkable acting as they were actually already married in reallife at the time of the shooting!A definitely memorable movie.".

It was either this or taking lives. Please notice I had read imdb reviews that warned about the nature of this film  not good at all. But it was monica and vincent and bruno... So I said what the heck.minor spoilersThe movie begins with a couple of nice shots. Then the story unfolds. We meet the agents and get to action. And here's problem No.1  how and where did those two get to meet each other how was the contact made.. We watch them separately and then bang! on the plane. I was left kinda blank on that. The same goes and in that scene where she has to kill that woman in the prison. One minute she's in and the next she drops the pill and out she goes. But then again some might say whats there to show. Anyway... And then to the action. Or to be exact more action less talk. That seemed to be the director's motto. Which was good I assume. It was something you don't see in spy films so I appreciated it. At first. Because later it gets just a bit annoying. What I appreciated even  more was the fact that there were no shootings and explosions every 10 minutes. And here's problem No.2  you can't follow a minimal structure of showing things and action and then take the main character alive out of a blaster car accident. You just can't! Even though I liked the way it was shown silence while car on air and then crash! boom! bang! the way it turned out the hero with just some scratches it reminded a lot of that hollywood staff. And finally problem No.3 was monica's acting. I don't know what is wrong I actually adore that woman but here... I don't know maybe she was tired from the passion she seemed completely out of the movie. She had the exact same look on her beautiful face in the entire movie. Why?I don't want to admit that I have get used to hollywood stuff and that  I am not in place to appreciate something different because I watch more different movies than Hollywood movies. But when different gets so out of line...I wouldn't say it is a spy thriller because I don't think it is. Also this film gave me a hard time because never before had I consider rating a movie below 5. I added a point for each 'thing' I liked  the guy who played the contact man vincent and monica and some nice shots. I think you all know how much is 111.".

Couple that with an opening sequence that begins on the dark side of the moon slowly zooming down to earth  almost like a Google Earth video  and to a ferry somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea to finally stop upon a man's eyes at extreme closeup. And all done with only two almost seamless dissolves between the computer wizardry and the real McCoy... And all the time the pulsating sound track from Bruno Coulais hits you almost as forcibly as three assassins forcibly and gruesomely dispatch the hapless agent returning to base...Such is the combination of cinematic and directorial skills as evidenced by the director Frederic Schoendoerffer and cinematography by JeanPierre Sauvaire. Add to that the consummate acting by the likes of Vincent Cassel  unforgettable in La Haine 1992  and Monica Belluci probably best known to US audiences in The Passion of Christ 2004 and you have a cinematic thriller treat that the French do ohsowell and ohsooften.Take a team of five agents from an unspecified secret French agency add a notorious gunrunner from Russia mix with the intrigue and settings in and around Casablanca in Morocco stir it all up with CIA mercenaries trying to spoil the fun and top it all off with betrayal in the midst of the French team and you have 109 minutes of dirty dealings and some breakneck action that might just leave you breathless. Some of the stunts were simplystunning in fact I just had to review  again and again  the last car chase with the most spectacular headon impact I've yet seen. But then I'm a sucker for a good car chase ever since I saw Bullit 1968. What! You haven't seen Bullit yet...? Tsk tsk...The plot is straightforward and the director uses visuals to show most of it with a bare minimum of dialog. It is however a relatively complex story with a number of subplots the French agent who wants to quit and who pays the price for trying the degree of collusion between government and dirty business the nature of the arms trade and why it continues. But hey we all know that it's a dirty world and there are dirty people in it always ready to do their bit for...for...oh yeah democracy.To some extent I was let down by the final scenes. On reflection however it was appropriate if a bit flat  especially after all that blazing action. You be the judge when you see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As he reached the status of French cinema's mandarin and by proving to be the undisputed commercial ruler of nonAmerican cinema Luc Besson retired form directing and began writing and producing a whole serial assembly of rather simple French programmers which were set to compete with midbudget Hollywood efforts. Some of those films like Taxi or Crimson rivers Rivieres pourpres managed to score amazing box office. And yet Besson's employees failed to deliver anything more than middleoftheroad of halfbaked products. However each of those titles managed to either reach or surpass Hollywood products in certain setpieces. Thus Besson's productions cured European fear of Hollywood's technical supremacy.The other line of French lust for Hollywood unlike Besson's superficial clan is represented by frontmen of the Newest Wave of French Cinema consisted of extremely talented and educated auteurs like Gaspar Noe Christophe Gans Jan Kounen and Olivier Assayas who use the rethorics of genre cinema in order to create brave and edgy body of work and blend of arthouse.The acting icons of the Newest Wave are Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci the couple who defined four most important films in the last ten years of French film history  Jan Kounen's Dobermann Gilles Mimouni's L'Appartement Christophe Gans' Pacte de loups and Gaspar Noe's Irreversible. The two of them star in Agents secrets  the film which tries to use the fourth method in order to tame the energy of commercial cinema.The explorer of the Fourth Method is Frederic Schoendoerffer a classicist among contemporaries son of famous Pierre Dien Bien Phu whose body of work mostly includes documentaries and chronicles of French colonial presence in Indochine. Frederic gained attention by grim and very serious police procedural Scenes de crimes. In his debut the absence of stars prevented it from being an important title in the Serial Killer Film Pantheon.Agents secrets is a thriller partly inspired by a recent incident when French secret service DGSE which belongs among the most discrete sank the Greenpeace ship. That event caused a backlash and DGSE eventually abandoned some of its' operatives.In Agents secrets  agents are ordered to sink the ship used by the notorious Easteuropean arms dealer. When the ship is sunk agents consider mission accomplished. Suddenly it transpires that they provoked CIA by this act and DGSE abandons them.This exciting yarn is adultoriented judging by robust pacing and character portraying. Unlike as exceptional The Bourne Supremacy which grabs the viewer Agents secrets  attempt to seduce you. Thus if Supremacy is the model of what 007franchise should have been then Schoendoerffer's film threads in legacy of John Mackenzie's The Fourth Protocol. On the other hand its' Hollywood counterpart is Tony Scott's Spy Game another fine film about the dynamics of espionage reality. All of these films were directed by Europeans even if some belong to AList Hollywood milieu meaning that Europeans especially Brits are the goto guys when it comes to spy yarns. Agents secrets is a fine espionage thriller that delivers efficient and disciplined roles of two authentic and probably greatest contemporary French film stars. This film marks the return of adultminded espionage film where espionage finally became a subject instead of being an excuse for action mayhem. Simply put in Agents secrets  the device is also the goal and this is why it stands out as a calm and articulated commercial film in the age of hysteria.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's how Jonathan Ross describes this French subtitled movie when he introduced it when it was shown on the satellite French movie channel Cinemoi.The now almost famous to us Brits Vincent Cassel playing 'Brisseau' and his wife Barbara or Lisa Monica Belucci are the couple in question and are part of ring of agents totally professional taking great care to meticulously plan everything. They don't ask questions. Maybe they should...Out in Angola is a bloody civil war and that requires guns lots of them. A Russian arms dealer trading from Switzerland is going to send a shipload of weapons out there. The Secret Agents are set the task of going out to Morocco and sabotaging this sailing by planting explosives on the vessel and blowing it up.So that's the premise interesting and realistic and to do just that would be far too straightforward right?The movie moves along quite quickly shot in old style i.e. steady cameras instead of wobbly jarring ones. But there is excitement too with wellshot stunts especially car chases French thrillers always do them well and moody mellower moments. It's humourless and efficient and we aren't asked to like or approve of the protagonists or what they do. It gets sufficiently complex to be satisfying it's well acted and about the right length.It's a good thriller but somehow not a great one. It needs an extra something though what this is difficult to pinpoint. It doesn't quite reach 710 for me but is very close. Whether it's worth buying as a DVD and at the present cost is a different matter. But rented or on Cinemoi then it's a great choice for a midweek action movie.".

	schema:headline " John Woo's classic one of his best 90's action films till it's date!";
	schema:reviewBody "Broken Arrow 1996 is one of my favorite John Woo best US action films alongside Hard Target which is my first John Woo favorite film Broken Arrow is my third personal favorite John Woo action film that I love to death! Hard Target was his first American movie this is his second American movie which I think is incredible classic action thriller from the 90's I have ever saw. It is going to be 20. years since this movie come out and i still love it today more than any other movie.I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. He acted convincing as the main villain Deakins in this movie. Broken Arrow has a great score great actors and different style of terrorists who stole nuclear warheads but didn't took over some plant or building or plane or train etc.. It is completely different action movie. Christian Slater was awesome as the main hero. I love this movie and it is never too long or boring unlike FaceOff. In my honest opinion the movie to me is compared to Die Hard and it is one of John Woo's best underrated action movies but that is just my opinion. It is a die hard movie in a desert heat much a like as Stallone's Cliffhanger. But with very different story and it is a stand alone movie which I love that. John Woo never liked making sequels so A Better Tomorrow II 1987 was his last sequel he made so I am glad this movie doesn't have any sequels remakes or reboot. In my opinion the 80's had a lot of better action movies but the 90's had a very cool action movies too. I still love Die Hard With A Vengeance to death and still love other action movies that were made in 90's. I love Broken Arrow to death! It is my favorite John Woo movie! This is a great film recently and it is a cool action movie. It's got action excitement and interesting characters and Legendary music. I love this film. Christian Slater as the Good guy the Hero was cool and John Travolta was an intriguing character and hilarious damn what a rush. The action in here is amazing. Fun action good acting quick pace and entertaining. The final sequence on the train has some quality explosions and even has bad guys killed by helicopter blades. The best thing about this movie though is John Travolta who hams it up beautifully he is having an absolute blast as Vic Deakins former US Air Force pilot turned terrorist loon. He also has one of the most over the top and awesome bad guy deaths of all time. I have always enjoyed this movie I never felt bored I love the action sequences on the train when Hale Christian Slater uses one of his martial arts to defeat Deakins John Travolta was spectacular he deactivate the nuclear device and kills Deakins it was outstanding. Hans Zimmer theme for Deakins ripped off movie Scream 2 for Dewey David Arquette theme. Hans Zimmer provides one of his greatest scores to this movie with some nice twanging guitar from Duane Eddie. I love how any time Travolta is on screen he has this hilarious guitar theme tune which is cool but hilarious funny at the same time. Broken Arrow has Woo's trademark slow motion and double gunplay galore. I believe there is the odd pigeon thrown in for good measure too. Not entirely sure Samantha Mathis was all that great as the female love interest but it is cool to have a Pump up the Volume reunion 1990. Which I never watched that movie before I am glad they both of the actors Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis worked together once more again.Broken Arrow has plenty of flaws but for sheer explosive entertainment you could do a lot worse. I love the movie and could watch it on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Bluray's to get me this movie on Bluray I actually have this film in Bluray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find. I have them both on Bluray discs.".

It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it.Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing people die bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the getgo. If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role overthetop and delivers some fantastic lines. It doesn't hurt that him and Slater tango well neither. If Travolta attempted this movie now instead of when he did  it wouldn't work. He's done too many goodygoody roles to come back down to this. Laws of nature will not allow him to make another good movie where he plays a bad guy. Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one.".

The plot has John Travolta as the smiling treacherous heavy and Christian Slater as the trueblue captain in the USAF out to spoil Travolta's plot to blow up Denver with a kidnapped nuclear device. There is a cute red head thrown fortuitously together with Slater. She has nice plump lips big blue eyes and the tightly tailored slacks of a Park Ranger. Very nice. We watch her from below as she climbs the ladder on the side of a boxcar. There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars roll down sandy hills and so on.But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie. What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two  a knock on the door a tug on the trigonal whatever  you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned. None of the characters changes in any way. There is no dialogue worth remembering. There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner. I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter.I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu. That's why I genuinely like it. I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson for the ripoffs from Indiana Jones for the gorgeous Utah scenery for the rocketing diesel train Lake Powell the redhead climbing the ladder the fist fights the bouncing Humvees the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale the redhead climbing the ladder the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them three times the redhead climbing the ladder.I just like it that's all. Anybody up for some sesame oil?".

There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars roll down sandy hills and so on.But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie. What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two  a knock on the door a tug on the trigonal whatever  you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned. None of the characters changes in any way. There is no dialogue worth remembering. There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner. I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter.I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu. That's why I genuinely like it. I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson for the ripoffs from Indiana Jones for the gorgeous Utah scenery for the rocketing diesel train Lake Powell the redhead climbing the ladder the fist fights the bouncing Humvees the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale the redhead climbing the ladder the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them three times the redhead climbing the ladder.I just like it that's all.

	schema:reviewBody "John Woo after his many Hong Kong efforts came to America and made Hard Target 1993 which due to studio interference and bad taking of direction by Jean Claude Van Damme wasn't as good as it could have been. Woo got a bad reputation due to his conflicts with both the MPAA and Universal and it took him awhile to get this one off of the ground. Woo had never worked with special effects so he was treading into new territory. Luckily he got two great leads Christian Slater soon to be in Windtalkers and John Travolta FaceOff. They take his direction well and each gives a good performance. As the traditional villain's henchman which I like to call Indestructable Villain Sidekick Howie Long gives a good performance and dies a good death too. I never appreciated this movie that much until watching it tonight and I realized this is probably the most actionpacked movie in a long time. It takes only about 6 minutes to get going and then boom! boom! boom! Action sequence after the other no letdown in between. This movie has plently of shootouts explosions and great innovative twists kicking the rear blade of a helicopter to knock a gun out of one's hand to make a action movie good. John Woo's cinematography the great shared moments the 20 dollar bill and whatnot are what makes this one a great action movie. Another thing that makes this flick great is that it gave Woo the power to get FaceOff his best Hollywood outing the greenlight. I'm looking forward to Windtalkers and love all of Woo's movies.9 outta 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Broken Arrow 1996 is my personal favorite John Woo underrated action film that I love to death. John Travolta and Christian Slater are in their finest roles in this breathtaking John Woo rollercoaster action movie. This is Die Hard in the desert and I absolutely enjoy this movie so much. It has incredible music score theme from Hans Zimmer. It is wonderfully directed by John Woo it has a wonderful pacing and It has a great paced on to a fight in the finale. I enjoy this movie MILES more than FaceOff the most overrated John Woo film. Broken Arrow is my action movie from the 90's that I watch constantly. The stunt work in here is very dangerous and all practical real for example Christian Slater's character is right above the ground shooting the helicopter and you see the helicopter hops right over him and Samantha Mathis one in the same shoot. The helicopter almost cut Samantha Mathis legs if Christian Slater wouldn't pulled he away she would have been almost cut that stunt was for real and it was real dangerous. This is my movie and I like practical effects and stunts that are done for real. Christian Slater run's while John Travolta and Howie Long are trying to run over him with a army jeep Am General HMMWV M1043 and Christian Slater jumps on the back of the jeep and John Travolta hit's the back of the jeep HMMWV M1043 in front that army jeep. That stunt was real and it was really dangerous. Christian Slater did his own stunts. No CGI or fancy editing that was all done for real a lot of dangerous stunts in this. It is an adrenaline rush and an underrated film. No one talks about it today. I think it is the most underrated in the action genre. John Travolta in my opinion is a finest actor I love his work I love his movies he is my favorite actor. This was the second US movie that John Woo directed and yes it was really good done action movie. I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. This is not only John Woo favorite film of mine but is also Christian Slater's favorite film. I absolutely love his character Capt. Riley Hale. I love the finale I love the sequence on a train where Hale cut's the helicopter power line and when a pilot try's to fly off and Deakins seas gas spiting on a floor and the pilot starts the chopper and Deakins yelles Cut the power and the pilot shows such a weird look and when he pushes the button the chopper blows up killing the bad guys to pieces. I love the train sequences. I love how Christian Slater kills on a train one of the bad guys he stands right before Terry and he jumps grabs the gun and shoots the bad guy right between her legs. The guns are used well in this movie and you will see them a lot. The explosions are fantastic in this movie. No CGI no shaky cam this is perfect underrated action movie that I love to death!1010 I love it to death! I love this movie to death. I own the Bluray disc btw this was very hard and difficult to get on Bluray. Hard Target was easy this movie wasn't easy to get. John Woo John Travolta and Christian Slater all did a wonderful job.".

The ending was short but effective because of the pleasing lack of sentimentality and sexism. Keep up the good films because I certainly enjoyed this one.".

It may be off on implausibility but you won't need much to think about once the theater gets dark. And when the theater does get dark and the film starts the action just keeps pouring in. Woo delivers style over substance there's more action here than plot but what style! This is one of the finest piece of action escapism in years it's also one of the most stylish ones.John Travolta and Christian Slater star as two military pilots who volunteers to transport two nuclear warheads via Stealth Bomber jet. Turns out the true reason is Maj. Deakins Travolta who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom. When he ejects his partner Capt. Riley Hale Slater and crashes the jet in the middle of the desert Hale is out to stop his old partner from detonating the nuclear bombs if his demands of a large amount of cash is met. Samantha Mathis costars as a local sheriff Terry Carmichael who gets caught up in the entire mess and ends up helping Hale out to stop Deakins from going ballistic there are very few romantic inturns between the two just for the good of it.The film runs at 108 minutes and Woo doesn't let things up. There's action here and action there. It's walltowall full of action and less plot in comparison. The film's plot resembles that of the previous year's hit SPEED which may due to the writer being Graham Yost who also wrote that recent blockbuster hit. But who cares both films take liberty from the DIE HARD films and they both turned up well. In the matter of execution this derivative affair is brought with style and pure walltowall action and thrills. And under Woo's hands the action is done with style and freshness.Although with a large amount of violence Woo is the kind of action who treats them like paint in his canvas. Action fans will be pleased by how who treats the heartpounding excitement and pure action as his ballet . It's action filmdom as a form of art. Highly recommended!Rating  out of 5.".

One of the best things about this film was seeing a strong female role played by Samantha Mathias. For once Hollywood used a woman who did not have to rely upon a man to save her. This was not a love interest part it could easily have been played by male or female. The direction was good as with all John Woo's work and not cluttered up with too many special effects. The action rattled along. John Travolta made an excellent villain and delivered some pretty cool lines  all credit to the script here for avoiding too much cheesy dialogue. Delroy Lindo as ever was good as was Christian Slater  good guys are never as much fun to watch as the villains!John Woo imposes his signature dramatic flair and so elevates this from the more generic action thrillers. The slomo balletic action beats. The poetic gunplay choreo. The prolonged standoffs. The flash on this guy! Is it a case of style over substance for this movie? Probably. The story is essentially Slater and Travolta in a catandmouse chase that encompasses the canyons and hills of the desolate Utah badlands. So it's a travelogue as well. This movie is farfetched and mindless and anathema to airtight plotting. If nothing else this movie is worth it for reuniting Slater and Samantha Mathis who rocked it so hard in Pump Up the Volume. John Travolta is terrific. Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice sane soldier doing his duty. The love interest isn't an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something but a park ranger also doing her duty. She is cute earthy and actually believable. If you want a film that delivers well paced action some great oneliners and plenty of thrills Broken Arrow is one to watch.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

Delroy Lindo as ever was good as was Christian Slater  good guys are never as much fun to watch as the villains! I would compare this with the underrated Chill Factor rather than Speed. If you want a film that delivers well paced action some great oneliners and plenty of thrills Broken Arrow is one to watch.".

	schema:headline " Oh my. Where to start ... this little baby is a gem for a sarcastic reviewer";
	schema:reviewBody "Air travel in the 1970s which was before fare laws made it more affordable still retained a certain amount of chic.  It was expensive enough that a lot of people had still never flown.  In a family with five kids our mode of transportation was a Volkswagen Bus.  The Brady Bunch was the only big family I knew who went on vacations involving air travel.  And for the record my first flight was in 1987 when I was 22.This movie has so many hilarious moments in it it's hard to catch all of them.  First Karen Black that witchylooking broad who wore the Zulu teeth in Trilogy of Terror has a few intimate moments with Charlton Heston AKA Cockpit Moses AKA NRA is My Copilot.  I'm sorry but the idea of him and her together ... ewwww.  But I digress.Next we have the legendary Gloria Swanson assaying the role of ... Gloria Swanson.  What this consists of is  droning on endlessly into a tape recorder or to her luckless secretary who probably would have considered a plane crash a welcome diversion about her fascinating life how she was a rebel in her career etc.  the only thing she leaves out is what it was like to be bundling with JFK's daddy  and wearing this bizarre sort of burnoose that ends up looking like a maneating nun's habit.  Which sets us up nicely for the introduction of two nunly stereotypes.Sister Martha Scott displays a traditional habit including a wimple and a traditional outlook.  Sister Helen Reddy I swear I'm not making this up is wearing a postVatican II modified habit and looks a lot like Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music.  Which is ironic given later events.Getting thoroughly plowed in the airport bar are Mindy's dad the guy who never wanted to have sex with Audra Lindley and Carmine Vespucci.  They run into Myrna Loy who you'd think was an ordinary oldlady type only to reveal that she swills boilermakers at every possible opportunity.  If you're wondering why this was even a plot point join the club.And now on to the plane.  What a marvel of design that baby was!  Those seats were the size of Lazy Boy recliners even in coach class.  To think that if only I'd been born to a millionaire I could have experienced flight in the days before you get shoehorned into a seat the size of a toy poodle carrier with your knees in your face ... and not only that THIS plane has a groovy spiral staircase leading up the flight deck so that the passengers can ogle the stews' legs as they rush back and forth with coffee tea or me.Just when we think the ham can't get sliced any thicker they wheel Linda Blair onto the plane in the role of a young girl Sister Martha unnecessarily informs Sister Helen It's a young girl! as if Sister Helen couldn't see that.  And not just any young girl.  A young girl who is DESPERATELY in need of a kidney transplant.  Played by an actress who doesn't seem to catch on to the fact that someone in desperate need of a kidney transplant isn't going to be beaming and bubbling over about how exciting it is to look at all the people.  However since Linda was simply assaying yet another of the roles in her 1970s Put Upon Damsel collection I can't fault her too much.Meanwhile at another airport a former Air Force Glory Boy from The Best Years of Our Lives is preparing to journey home to Boise Idaho.  He calls home and the phone is answered by none other than the blonde broad who took Uncle Charlie's apron and put the wrecking ball to My Three Sons.  She's his wife how is it that all the lovely young actresses in this film are head over heels in love with these geriatric actors?  Point to ponder. So ignoring  the forecasts of bad weather and the ominously prescient comment of a friend who says he's looking pale our lone pilot leaps into his Patsy Cline Special and heads out in the middle of a driving rain.Now this sets up the pivotal scene.  We have a large 747 loaded with 150 people those seats were ROOMY man and an itty bitty plane with a guy who's starting to not feel so good and they're both circling Salt Lake City waiting for permission to land.

	onyx:emotionText "Air travel in the 1970s which was before fare laws made it more affordable still retained a certain amount of chic.  It was expensive enough that a lot of people had still never flown.  In a family with five kids our mode of transportation was a Volkswagen Bus.  The Brady Bunch was the only big family I knew who went on vacations involving air travel.  And for the record my first flight was in 1987 when I was 22.This movie has so many hilarious moments in it it's hard to catch all of them.  First Karen Black that witchylooking broad who wore the Zulu teeth in Trilogy of Terror has a few intimate moments with Charlton Heston AKA Cockpit Moses AKA NRA is My Copilot.  I'm sorry but the idea of him and her together ... ewwww.  But I digress.Next we have the legendary Gloria Swanson assaying the role of ... Gloria Swanson.  What this consists of is  droning on endlessly into a tape recorder or to her luckless secretary who probably would have considered a plane crash a welcome diversion about her fascinating life how she was a rebel in her career etc.  the only thing she leaves out is what it was like to be bundling with JFK's daddy  and wearing this bizarre sort of burnoose that ends up looking like a maneating nun's habit.  Which sets us up nicely for the introduction of two nunly stereotypes.Sister Martha Scott displays a traditional habit including a wimple and a traditional outlook.  Sister Helen Reddy I swear I'm not making this up is wearing a postVatican II modified habit and looks a lot like Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music.  Which is ironic given later events.Getting thoroughly plowed in the airport bar are Mindy's dad the guy who never wanted to have sex with Audra Lindley and Carmine Vespucci.  They run into Myrna Loy who you'd think was an ordinary oldlady type only to reveal that she swills boilermakers at every possible opportunity.  If you're wondering why this was even a plot point join the club.And now on to the plane.  What a marvel of design that baby was!  Those seats were the size of Lazy Boy recliners even in coach class.  To think that if only I'd been born to a millionaire I could have experienced flight in the days before you get shoehorned into a seat the size of a toy poodle carrier with your knees in your face ... and not only that THIS plane has a groovy spiral staircase leading up the flight deck so that the passengers can ogle the stews' legs as they rush back and forth with coffee tea or me.Just when we think the ham can't get sliced any thicker they wheel Linda Blair onto the plane in the role of a young girl Sister Martha unnecessarily informs Sister Helen It's a young girl! as if Sister Helen couldn't see that.  And not just any young girl.  A young girl who is DESPERATELY in need of a kidney transplant.  Played by an actress who doesn't seem to catch on to the fact that someone in desperate need of a kidney transplant isn't going to be beaming and bubbling over about how exciting it is to look at all the people.  However since Linda was simply assaying yet another of the roles in her 1970s Put Upon Damsel collection I can't fault her too much.Meanwhile at another airport a former Air Force Glory Boy from The Best Years of Our Lives is preparing to journey home to Boise Idaho.  He calls home and the phone is answered by none other than the blonde broad who took Uncle Charlie's apron and put the wrecking ball to My Three Sons.  She's his wife how is it that all the lovely young actresses in this film are head over heels in love with these geriatric actors?  Point to ponder. So ignoring  the forecasts of bad weather and the ominously prescient comment of a friend who says he's looking pale our lone pilot leaps into his Patsy Cline Special and heads out in the middle of a driving rain.Now this sets up the pivotal scene.  We have a large 747 loaded with 150 people those seats were ROOMY man and an itty bitty plane with a guy who's starting to not feel so good and they're both circling Salt Lake City waiting for permission to land.  Until Air Force Glory Boy has a heart attack and his plane collides with the jet in midair. Ouch.Particularly since September 11 it's blackly amusing to see all the passengers sitting so calmly and obediently in their seats after the collision.  Even if we were to suspend rational thought long enough to accept the idea that a collision that sucks out the first officer wouldn't be accompanied by enough pressure to suck out the entire flight crew and maybe the back wall of the flight deck the fact that everyone just sat there bundled up in their coats and cheesy purple airline blankets while THE STEWARDESS IS FLYING THE PLANE? thank you Sid Caesar is still hilarious to comprehend.Now lest I give away the Cheez Whiz ending too much let me just say that I don't understand why if everyone else got shoved out the inflatable ramps Karen Black and Charlton Heston were allowed to promenade dramatically down the regular steps to the tarmac ah those days before jetways.Anyhoo this one is better experienced than described.

Its a typical disaster movie which is nowhere near the league of Poseiden or Inferno. Its an enjoyable pass of 2 hours but its all by the numbers ie identify characters disaster failed rescues successful rescue. It looks very dated now but then again it is 30 years old. Oh and the hairstyles are fantastic!".

Black gives a truly committed performance as the frightened stewardess forced to confront the situation headon and she's matched by disastermovie stalwart George Kennedy as a flight engineer charged with overseeing the rescue operation knowing that his wife and child are aboard the stricken plane. As with all Universal movies of the period it looks like a widescreen TV feature and the cheapskate production values are obvious throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "I have read many of the viewer comments on this film and I can say that most were right on target so there isn't much point in my repeating what they've already said.My main comment would be Save yourself the time and expense to see this film and rent Airplane! instead. They are essentially the same film with the only real distinction being that Airplane! actually was intended to be a comedy.... and a damned good one at that. In fact as I recall Airplane! was named the best comedy ever made by the American Film Institute. This is quite phenomenal when you consider that it was nothing but a spoof of Airport 1975. And this may be the one and only truly distinctive aspect of Airport 1975. That is it did inspire a truly great film. Otherwise it had very few redeeming qualities. The film is nothing but a haphazardly thrown together collection of all the film clichs that could be squeezed into the allotted run time. I recently watched it for the first time since its original release mostly out of sheer curiosity. I remembered it being bad.... as all the sequels to Airport were. They were all presumably made as serious films but they were all so sloppily made with such terrible scripts that you couldn't help wonder why they weren't just released as comedies in the first place. For example as has been well documented in other viewer comments how could anyone take Linda Blair's and Helen Reddy's roles seriously? I mean how could they keep straight faces with the scenario and dialogue they were supposed to work with? All that was missing was a laugh track.I am glad I read some of the IMDb comments as I was viewing Airport 1975 on AMC because they really added to my enjoyment of the comic aspects of the film. As I said this was the first time I had watched it in about 30 years and in the meantime I had of course seen Airplane! But until rewatching Airport 1975 I did not realize the degree to which Airplane! was inspired by Airport 1975. At times I was dumbstruck at how scene after scene were all spoofs of actual scenes from Airport 1975. And this made the film very entertaining to me when otherwise I may have just hit the channel button on the remote after the first 10 minutes of so of the drivel that Airport 1975 actually is.".

	schema:headline " Cheesy silly unnecessary sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER!!! Help us!  Oh my God help us! Stewardess Nancy Pryor screams into the radio at one point in Airport 1975.  She may as well have been speaking for the audience that was suckered into seeing this cheesy silly and unnecessary sequel to the excellent 1970 suspense classic Airport one of those rare sequels that is so bad it actually dimishes the original in stature.The film opens with Nancy Karen Black meeting her pilot boyfriend Al Murdock Charlton Heston at Washington D.C.'s Dulles International Airport. Both are headed back to L.A. Al on an earlier flight but Nancy has something important to talk to him about and wants him to wait and fly back with her.  He has an important meeting and can't.  She gets pssed PMS maybe? and blows him off.  They part and you know nothing good will come of it.  It's not long before Nancy is working her flight the redeye special a nonstop cross country overnighter.  The flight crew is composed of Capt. Stacy Efrem Zimbalist Jr. the copilot Roy Thinnes and Flight Engineer Erik Estrada.  Since this is typical Hollywood filmmaking the stereotypes run rampant  the captain is a good stable family man the other two lecherous rude chauvanistic dopes while the stewardesses are beautiful young midwestern refugees like cute young Bette Christopher Norris.  And then there are the passengers  a bunch of drunken Conventioneers Jerry Stiller Norman Fell et al a couple of professional football players two nuns Martha Scott Helen ReddyHelen Reddy???!!! the wife of the vice president of operations Mrs. Patroni Susan Clark an old drunken matron Myrna Loy a pathetic wannabe actor Sid Caesar and a famous movie star Gloria Swanson and her assistant Augusta Summerland. And then there's the last to boarda dying kidney patient being flown to California for a kidney transplant Linda Blair and her mother Nancy Olson.  More about THAT later.About the same time the plane takes off small pilot Scott Freeman Dana Andrews is about to leave Boise Idaho evidently to fly south for the winter.  Actually I'm being a smartss.  He's going home from a business meeting.  He decides to make the trip even though the weather is terrible which has no bearing whatsoever on what happens next.  Anyway after wasting a halfhour or so of screen time on silly banter between the passengers and crew and a famously parodied scene see Airplane involving Reddy's singing nun and Blair the pilots inform the passengers they have to land in Salt Lake City since the entire West Coast is socked in with fog more about this later also. Ditto Scott Freeman.  Unfortunately for everyone involved Freeman has a heart attack and plows into the 747 blowing a hole in the cockpit killing Thinnes and Estrada blinding Zimbalist and leaving Nancy to fly the plane which brings us back to where we began with the classic  Help us!  Oh my God help us!  I won't give away any more of the plot although it's predictable what's going to happen since there are no pilots on the plane and the film's hero Heston is on the ground. Oh and did I mention George Kennedy returns as the original picture's most popular character Joe Patroni?  He's been promoted from airline troubleshooter to the aforementioned vice president of operations and his wife and son are also on board so he becomes Heston's sidekick in the rescue attempt.So what's wrong with this film?  Oh let me count the ways.  The script for one is horrible.  Don Ingalls a former airline pilot is responsible for this lumbering and boring pile of cliched characters and hackneyed dialog. The direction by '70's hack Jack Smight is singularly uninspired and wooden failing to coax a single winning performance out of what is a pretty impressive cast.  The attempts at humor are preposterous  are we to believe an outofwork actor could afford to fly crosscountry simply because of his pathetic bit part in the onflight movie?  And that it's funny to watch Myrna Loy order a boilermaker?  The only thing funny here is some of the dialog and that's unintentional  Bette to Nancy  This sure beats Ogallala Kansas!  Well Bette I hate to tell you this but Ogallala is in NEBRASKA dimwit!  And then there's the whole subplot involving the kidney patient which is absolutely ridiculous.  No doctor would ever okay a girl in that poor of health to fly cross country to get a kidney transplant. They'd fly the kidney to her on a special flight!  It would be quicker in the long run!  I'm sorry I'm shouting but I hate when my intelligence is insulted in a movie.  And speaking of insulting being from California I have to say never in my 40 years of life never have I seen the entire West Coast socked in by fog.  It is impossible.  They could have flown into Ontario or any of a number of inland airports in the region.Anyway suspense is minimal since you know how this one will end although in real life not three years later a similar midair collision resulted in nearly 150 deaths and the obliteration of a North Park neighborhood in San Diego which amplifies how preposterous the entire enterprise is.  As for the acting it is lazy and uninspired with one exception  Karen Black actually tries to give a semblance of a performance and is plucky and believable throughout.  Kennedy also at least tries to liven up some deadly dialog but Heston the once great actor reduced lately to national joke as the onenote archConservative NRA President is stiff and actually looks at times like he'd like to put a bag over his head so noone will recognize it is him in this giant pile of silliness.  Noone else registers much more than a blip on the interest scale although you'll never forget Reddy in a full habit kissing her rosary counting her beads and belting out inspirational folk tunes while strumming a guitar in one of the alltime great camp performances.  And as for Gloria Swanson she evidently smelled the stench that was the script early on and wrote all her own dialog which is why she spends the entire film talking about the benefits of health food and not eating poison foodsher favorite talkshow subject at the time. Worst of all though is watching the great comedian Sid Caesar and the great actress Myrna Loy reduced to picking up paychecks as pathetic sleazy caricatures who matter not one iota to the film or the plot.  They could have blown out of the cockpit hole along with Thinnes and Estrada and no one would have noticed.  Is that any way to treat two legends?Finally a couple of interesting notes  look closely behind Karen Black when she addresses the passengers near the end of the film and you'll see a very young and slim Sharon Gless looking beautiful and grinning from eartoear.  But look quick because that's her entire role even though she's listed in the beginning credits.  Also the beautiful young woman who plays Swanson's assitant is credited as Augusta Summerland aka Linda Harrison aka Nova in the original Planet of the Apes.  Just in case you're interested.  12 out of ".

Yet it's the dead seriousness of the script acting and direction all done with that righton clunky sincerity that gives 70's disaster features their cheesy greatness which makes this endearingly earnest foolishness such toprate tacky trash. Better still the usual boring subplots that often clutter these pictures are pleasingly curtailed here the characters are neatly established with utmost briskness and the basic plot kicks in by the 30 minute mark thereby keeping tedium at bay.Naturally this darling boasts one hell of an allstar lineup Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Roy Thinnes and Erik Estrada as the doomed flight crew Sid Caeser Norman Fell Conrad Janis and Jerry Stiller as obnoxiously dorky middleaged swingers Nancy Olsen as a cute blonde stewardess Dana Andrews Linda Blair fresh from her smashing success in The Exorcist as a sickly yet perky little girl who needs a new kidney or its Stiff City buddy Larry Storch as a jerky scoopchasing TV reporter 50's AIP creature feature regulars Ed Nelson and Beverly Garland Guy Stockwell terminally insufferable pop singer Helen Reddy as an unbearably sweet nun Gloria Swanson as herself Myrna Loy a preCagney and Lacey Sharon Gless in a quick bit Susan Clark Martha Scott and even Assault on Precinct 13 survivor Austin Stoker as an Air Force sergeant. All are tremendous fun to watch but Karen Black clearly cops the top acting honors permanently crossed saucer eyes wide with fright a look of grim determination firmly fixed on her lovely face and jaws tightly clenched the extraordinary Ms. Black gives the kind of remarkably committed performance which inadvertently exposes this howler as the idiotic junk that it truly is.

Veteran bungler Jack Smight the same allthumbs dude responsible for the incredibly atrocious postnuke scifi dud Damnation Alley directed this sucker with his customary artless rentahack craftsmanship. Smight's totally straightfaced dimestore workmanlike efficiency works like gangbusters for this entertainingly dopey nonsense thus clinching this honey's sterling status as a super schlocky slice of airborne 70's thrills'n'spills absurdity.".

It is a typical disaster film for it's time but is thankfully one of the good ones unlike The Concorde or The Swarm. People give it a hard time claiming it to be one of the worst films ever made but it obviously isn't as there are many millions of mainstream films worse than this and many worse disaster movies if you want proof watch any of Irwin Allen's late 70's productions.".

I remember finding it rivetting.  Now it is not only laughably bad it's also pretty boring.  In 1975 I had no idea who Gloria Swanson or Myrna Loy were  let alone Martha Scott or Nancy Olson. Now I mourn their presence in the film  why do they all have absolutely nothing to do!?  Once the film gets going the only thing the writer and director seem to know to do with all this great talent is flash occasionally to them looking worried.  I wonder what these great actors thought when they read the script  okay for fifty pages now all I say is I'm sure we'll all be fine!?!  How on earth did Helen Reddy win the most promising newcomer award at the Golden Globes?  For the last hour of the film her only line is yes dear!  And why was Linda Blair clutching a guitar desperately to her bosom if she couldn't play it?  Obviously just in case a singing nun should happen to be passing by!One of the funniest stories about this film is that the producers approached Greta Garbo to play the Gloria Swanson role.  Can you imagine Garbo breaking her long retirement for this!  Poor Gloria playing herself in her final film comes across as a pontificating knowitall boring her poor secretary senseless with stories of the good old days.  Myrna Loy has an occasional gleam in her eye when working with Sid Caesar shame they couldn't think of any lines for her to say.So ignoring the true talent on board most of the lines go to Charlton Heston at his teethgritting worst.  Full marks to Karen Black for keeping a straight face and allowing later filmmakers so much to parody Does anyone here know how to fly a plane? Airplane!.  If you get a chance read the MAD sendup in which Linda Blair is flying without a heart and Helen Reddy sings a song called We're all going to die and go to hell someday.Did the Universal executives add the joke of naming the airline Columbia?One final point  why do all those ugly old men have such beautiful young wives and girlfriends?

I think most people who see this after viewing Airplane can not do anything but think about Airplane. Just like the comedian on Jay Leno who does President Bush. All I can picture while watching President Bush now Especially after Hurricane Katrina is that darned comedian. Airport 75 is the same way for most people. I do have to admit that the movie has some strange characterization and dialogue at the beginning with all the veteran actors but HEY that only adds to the interest for me. Airport 75 is not near as ridiculous as the original Airport. I mean come on Dean Martin as the pilot. I kept waiting for his alcoholic ass to pull a bottle of Seagrams from under his seat. Also I'm sick of hearing everyone on here focus on Karen Black's eyes one reviewer even said she was bugeyed. BugEyed???? She is neither bugeyed nor cross eyed. She has very deep set catlike eyes that to me are very sexy in a strange unsettling sort of way. I really don't think it is her eye makeup either because I have seen her in other movies where she is much younger and wears less makeup. Her eyes still have that kind of evil unsettling look. Anyway to me this movie is great fun and I think all the main stars George K. Charlton H. and Karen B. all do best what they have always done best SELL SELL SELL their parts. By the way the AMC version they are showing now is so cut up and is not even widescreen. You are missing a lot of the scenes and dialoguethey even cut out anyone saying Damn It as well as lot of the picture is gone due to full screen cropping. Rent the 235 widescreen version or buy it as I did forget about Airplane remember that movies are only for entertainment and watch it again. By the way I also absolutely love Airplane and am eagerly awaiting the new Don't call me Shirly edition.".

Luckily the script only calls for her having to make adjustments to the plane's course instead of actually bringing it safely into the gate!

Of course there are complications involving sick passengers fuel leaks mountains and finding a good rug for Charleton Heston to wear. Can this motley crew of actors bring the plane down safely?? I wonder.You gotta love the casts of these kind of movies. I can take Cid Ceasar Myrna Loy Gloria Swanson and Linda Blair as passengers. I can hold my nose and accept Helen Reddy as a singing nun. The welcome sight of George Kennedy in some sort of administrative role certainly helps. But what in the world was former NFL quarterback Jim Plunkett doing on board? And sitting in coach yet?? I guess he hadn't won a superbowl yet so he didn't rate first class! 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Jerry Stillerdon't think he or is son are funny IMO slept through the whole damn mid air collision. Charlton HestonI'm not a big fan of his strained face and dialogue gave a gutsy but annoying performance as did Karen Black. I love how the Carol Burnett Show spoofed this film calling it Disaster 75. Burnett even spoofed her own show in this spoof. Still take this film for face value. I hate when a lot of people critique a movie and call it this was predictable this was garbage. Look in my opinion movies are to entertain not enlighten. If a comedy or romance film has the same old plot who cares as long as it's fun getting to the predictable ending. Just sit back and enjoy the ride unless the film is utterly boring. Airport 75 is camp kitch soap opera but FUN TO WATCH! I was surprised that the film allowed a female heroine this time. Back then most stewardesses were considered air heads and this being the height of women's lib you'd think the producerstudio would shy away from making the stewardess somewhat capable. But maybe it was reverse psychology?? I did enjoy George Kennedy's role this time as a Big Wig unlike his role in the original Airport. To see his pained expression as he tries to talk to his helpless wife and son...I enjoy seeing an actor in an unfamiliar element. IMO Sid Caesar's character should have been sucked out that hole and Erik Estrada...say no more. This film always reminds me of that Aloha Airlines incident in the 1980's where the fuesalagesorry for any typo came apart in midair causing a huge whole though no one was lost or killed in that incident. Just check Airport 75 out for curiosity sake if you happen to catch it on TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film as a young boy when it came out in 1964 and it made a huge impression on me. However I did not see the film again until recently a rather worn copy at Cinemateket in Copenhagen but I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. In spite of all the years that have passed the film did not seem outdated at all.In 1964 the filming of Tine Herman Bang's famous novel marked the 100th anniversary of the battle at Dybboel where the Danish army was defeated by Prussia and Austria and Denmark lost about one third of its entire area. Indeed one of the biggest traumas in Danish history. The location of the film is Als in the south part of Denmark near the battle fields at Dybboel where the war's final and crucial battle will take place. At the estate of the forest manager normal life has been suspended. The young forest manager has been inducted into the army his wife and son has fled to Copenhagen and the charge of the house has been left to Tine the young altruistic daughter of the local school master played by Lone Hertz.When the Danish troops are pushed back the estate of the forester is turned into a hospital for the wounded soldiers. Filled with grief and despair and surrounded by dying soldiers the forester and Tine begin a brief but passionate love affair which has disastrous consequences.Tine is not considered Knud Leif Thomsen's best film and as far as I know it did not receive much praise by the Danish critics when it came out although Lone Hertz received a welldeserved Bodil as best female actress. My guess is that the highly melodramatic scenes have been considered bad taste and far too melodramatic back in the 1960'es. Especially one of the film's last scenes where Tine's father the old school master played with too?much pathos by Johannes Meyer who has gone mad and taken refuge in the church tower because he is obsessed with the idea that the earth is on fire. At the same time his young daughter gives herself to the forester a married man only a few steps away. Melodramatic? Well I do not agree. In fact the scene reminds me of another great film about war and passion Luchino Visconti's Senso.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is rife with weathered stereotypes spiced with a few somewhat original but inane ideas that are supposed to shock and impress the viewer. It is pure pulp. Not of the good but of the embarrassing variety pretending to be art disguised as pulp. It's not a highly symbolic merciless comment on the state of today's Germany it's just nonsense on parade Agnes was a guy who had his sex changed because he thought his gay friend would like that. Turned out he didn't. Too bad for Agnes. Sometimes it's a good idea to surprise your loved ones sometimes it's really not. Oskar Roehler got this sad story from the arguably trashiest of all Fassbinder movies In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden. For Fassbinder it was the basis of one of his awkward melodramas for Roehler it's just a queer gimmick. Actually Agnes is by far the happiest and most selfassured of the three brothers in this movie which therefore concentrates on the other two Werner and HansJrg.Werner is a Green Party politician working for the German environment ministry. His proudest achievement He can produce his own biological fertilizer. His wife hates him because she has to watch him doing so  every single day. During an especially inane shocking scene he feels the need to produce something valuable while he's having an intense discussion with the leader of his party on the phone. He pulls down his pants and takes a dump on a single sheet of paper. Later on he picks up this sheet and carries his  obviously highly concentrated  biological fertilizer away.HansJrg works as a librarian at a really big modern library with lots of hot chicks studying. When he sees a hot woman walking towards the ladies room he follows her. His 6th sense tells him that there will no one in the first room with the washing basins that she will take the booth next to the one he's prepared with a small peeping hole that she is going to have a tough fight with her constipated bowels featuring lots of heavy breathing. And he's got another kinky superpower  no one can hear him masturbating.This is an original idea because quite obviously it would not work in real life  where a sad creep like HansJrg would have used a spy camera. It's the brainchild of a hack writer who is writing by numbers 1. aiming for an intellectual audience library 2. underground appeal seedy sexualitypeeping Tom 3. symbolic value fecal matter.HansJrg is a sex addict which in German movies never means that he's having sex all the time but that he's always occupied with dysfunctional schemes to get some. He's in a selfhelp group where everyone has got quite obviously exactly the same problem. That's where he gets recruited by a porn producer. The first day on his new job he meets his first new colleague and falls in love with her. He confesses that he's just shot his father whom he blames to have abused Agnes as a child thus turning him into a transsexual. The porn actress agrees to flee with him. They are heading towards Iraq to help the people down there.Whoever takes this movie seriously got a serious problem. Oskar Roehler takes his brainchild very seriously. This is not a comedy nor a campy trash festival. It's just sad.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was slightly surprised to see this rather mediocre German socialdrama having reached the US video stores. Less surprising was that Moritz Bleibtreu was promoted as star of 'Munich' which is true  he did have a 30 second appearance and some critics witty line Freud filtered through Fassbinder. Ironically the line is true Fassbinder wasn't a particularly good or interesting director and Sigmund Freud's theories are rather outdated.The story revolves around the Tschirner clan what consisting of neurotic transsexuals sexaddicts and paedophiles all hidden behind the facade of an average middleclass German family.The dysfunctions within the family seem at all times beyond hope or redemption and none of the characters are remotely sympathetic likable even completely comprehensive unless perhaps you're from a similar background in which case you might not even want to watch this film in the first place. Agnes and his brothers simply isn't a pretty film nor is it a film that will leave you feeling better if you happen to watch it when you feel down. Most importantly it doesn't tell us anything new.What can be said about the acting? Well the main focal points of the film being Martin Weiss as Agnes and Moritz Bleibreu as his sexaddict brother neither performance comes across as completely convincing. Especially Bleibtreu at the time hailed as the new hope of German cinema seems stuck with a limited repertoire. Weiss on the other hand proves that he can convincingly wear a frock and woman's makeup  that doesn't make an actor but explains why this has remained his last appearance on the big screen with the exception of the children's movie Nick Knatterton.Herbert Knaup playing the oldest brother Werner and member of the Green Party still has the best part in the movie  although the scene where he in a grandgesture defecates on a piece of paper and ceremoniously carries his product away seems to say more about this type of movie making than about his own schizophrenic behaviour.As said if you're looking for a film to drag you down or tell you time and again about the rotten times we leave and if you're looking for the most sanctimonious endings in recent European cinema this may be for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Agnes and His Brothers is a German movie from over 10 years ago that runs for almost 2 hours and was written and directed by Oskar Roehler still among Germany's most respected filmmakers these days. The lead actors in here are Martin Wei Moritz Bleibtreu and Herbert Knaup and the title is a reference to Wei' transsexual character. I guess they really wanted to get this little joke in terms of herhis in here even if the story does not warrant it. It's still mildly funny so the title is not a complete failure. However I have not measured it but I am fairly certain that Agnes was the one from the trio that had less screen time than the other 2. And also in terms of memorability Agnes is not the winner here. It certainly is Bleibtreu. He has been among Germany's most famous actors for a long time already over 15 years I guess and I have not always been too happy with his performances. Here however he is easily the best thing about this movie. His character was so wellwritten and he totally nails the part. It is actually pretty sad but because of how accurate everything seems about him it even put a smile on my lips.Apart from the lead trio there are also a couple famous supporting actors in here such as Tom Schilling Martin Semmelrogge Til Schweiger in a cameo etc. Katja Riemann won a German Film Award for her turn here which truly baffles me as I saw nothing outstanding about her character or performance. Also included is Lee Daniels the director from precious and The Butler and I really did not expect him in here the first time I saw this. So random. Today was the second time I watched this movie and I enjoyed it again. Real greatness is missing if we look past Bleibtreu's scenes and I did not really like the ending either but as a whole it was still a good watch. Recommended and I wonder why Wei stopped being in films a long time ago while the 2 actors who play his character's brothers are still incredibly relevant today.".

Agnes is a pure childlike girl who hears voices talks to spirits doesn't know how babies are born and claims she never had one. Is she delusional as the result of abuse as a child? Was she raped? Is she insane? The performances in Agnes of God are extraordinary. Fonda is brilliant as a woman of science who has long ago turned her back on God and Meg Tilly gives a breakout performance as the translucent innocent Agnes. The dramatic scene which ends with Fonda saying I love you...As much as God loves you was one of the most moving in the film.The powerhouse role played on stage by Geraldine Page is that of the mother superior and what better actress for this than the fantastic Anne Bancroft. She is tough vulnerable funny fierce and warm as a woman trying to protect her delicate charge from the horrors of the world. She and Fonda play beautifully together whether bonding or fighting as Fonda strips away the layers to find the truth.It's so rare to see a film with three great female roles and to see them all essayed so well in an excellent story. For this reason Agnes of God is a great provocative film that will keep you thinking about it long after it's over.".

She makes the innocent spiritual and fantasy like world that this strange young nun lives in appealing. One can find yourself almost being envious of the purity of the world that Agnes experiences. The performances of Jane Fonda and Anne Bancroft are also very good. The debate and tension that flows between them is interesting as each forces the other to take a deeper look at themselves their pasts and to confront the reasons for their chosen paths in life. Also these women represent the two sides of one of the main dilemmas in the film and the one that we the viewers are left to wrestle with. Is Agnes better off in her cloistered innocent world where Mother Miriam wants to keep her or would it be better for her to become more aware of the realities of the outside world with all it's diversity and possibilities that Doctor Martha Livingston thinks she should know. The tension between these two characters is not without it's humorous moments as well. It's never easy for a psychological drama to have to sort out the inner darkness of a troubled individual in the course of a two hour film but this one does better than most. Those that need answers spelled out plain simple and clear cut are of course frustrated by the ending but enough is presented here to allow one to draw conclusions and yet leave room for thought and speculation which makes for a far more compelling way to part from a story.".

Agnes often is spoken to by someone she calls the lady as well as her dead mother. There are plot twists and faith based happenings and possible psychological explanations to things that happen in this movie to the point that would leave anyone guessing.I believe this movie to be a hidden classic. The acting is superb and seamless. The only thing I would question in this movie is the directors decision to make Jane Fonda's character Dr. Martha Livingston smoke so much. It is clear that Ms. Fonda did not smoke at the time and she handles the cigarettes awkwardly at times.Meg Tilly however is the light of this movie. She displays a John Malkovich ability to act seemingly crazy but somehow not at the same time.Anne Bancroft when is there ever anything to say about her other then utter perfection.The end of the movie leaves the watcher to make his or her own decision. Is Agnes insane? Or was she brutilized horribly by some man that managed to sneak into the convent. Why did the Mother Superior not tell everything she knew sooner?

Released in 1985 Agnes Of God starred Jane Fonda in a role that she delivers with Oscar worthy power although she is supported by an equally amazing cast of actors including veteran star Anne Bancroft. The strength of this film is in its riveting drama of both a religious and psychological bent not to mention a bleak atmosphere of suspense and mystery. Set in Quebec FrenchCanada in a rural region outside Montreal the story is about Sister Agnes Meg Tilly who becomes the subject of an investigation by Dr. Martha Livingston Jane Fonda a psychiatrist. As the film opens Agnes has just given birth to a baby but who is found dead in a waste basket in her quarters at a remote convent. To avoid a media circus the Mother Superior Miriam Ruth Anne Bancroft keeps her confined in the convent and does not wish to put her into the hands of the authorities. As Dr. Livingston interrogates and befriends the childlike spirited and imaginative Sister Agnes secrets and disturbing facts are slowly revealed. Agnes grew up in a broken home never went to school never learned about the real world and was abused by her alcoholic and psychotic mother. As a result her mind is warped and she is inclined to hallucinations and spontaneous bleedings. The mystery of who fathered her baby remains unsolved even at the close of the film. Agnes believed it was God who impregnated her in a Virgin Mary sort of manner and Mother Superior believed it too. But practical and scientific Dr. Livingston is determined to find out the man who seduced her. The film is not even about who knocked up Sister Agnes but is instead a chilling drama about women and their issues. Mother Superior is a bitter divorced woman who had been a lousy mother and left her family to become a nun. Dr. Livingston is a modern woman who turned her back on Catholicism but who proves to be a compassionate woman bent on saving Agnes from doom. Agnes is herself the most troubled of the women but it is her unbelievable story about a baby with an unidentified father that keeps this film in a compelling vein. Jane Fonda is simply wonderful proving again even at this late state in her career that she still had the makings of a brilliant actress. This role is not considered one of her best but it was the type of role  the compassionate and intelligent liberal that suited her personality so perfectly. Meg Tilly was not very known at this time but this performance is quite good and she would only move on to better roles. Anne Bancroft who had once upon a time in the late 60's seduced a Graduate is humorous and bitter as the old Reverend Mother. The bonding scene between Fonda and Bancroft as they are smoking a nun smoking! and their playful banter is never overly irreverent and reveals warmth within embracing the human side of all people whether a nun or a smoking psychiatrist. Catholicism is never attacked or criticized in this film despite the playful jokes and somewhat antiorganized religion sentiments by the more progressive Jane Fonda character. Religion is merely the vehicle for the mystery. Could it be possible even in our modern world devoid of miracles that a virgin could conceive a child from God ? If it happened to a woman of ancient Romanoccupied Israel according to Catholics today why can't they also believe it was possible in 1985 at a convent in rural Canada ? The film's theme is about fact and reason versus faith and miracles though they are never actually at war with one another in this film whose strongest theme is that of harmony and friendship among diverse characters. Like someone suggested it's a reverse Rosemary's Baby where the horror elements remain in the spiritual dimensions and their influence over the living. In this case the truth about Sister Agnes remains an unsolved mystery and is open to interpretation. This is a most terrific film with several different layers of emotion psychology and spirituality. Two thumbs way up for this wonderful 1980's mystery drama with Jane Fond and Anne Bancroft doing their usual wonderful thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Agnes of God' is simply one of the best acted films made. Based on a Broadway play it stars Jane Fonda Anne Bancroft and Meg Tilly in roles that are their career best in my opinion.The story is that a young novitiate she is not yet a nun has had a baby that is found in the waste paper basket with the umbilical cord wrapped around it's neck and the novitiate unconscious seemingly having no recollection of the pregnancy or birth. Dr. Martha Livingstone is chosen by the court to interview the Mother Superior and Agnes to find out what has happened. Agnes is seemingly an innocent having no knowledge of sex or childbirth having been raised by an alcoholic mother who had migraines and visions of angels. She kept Agnes innocent so she wouldn't end up like her. The Mother Superior is her Aunt which adds complexity to the back story. Dr. Livingstone is a lapsed Catholic who believes in science and has no belief in miracles and knows that Agnes must have been with a mortal man to get pregnant. Mother Miriam is so steadfast in her belief in Agnes as touched by God that she is willing to suspend belief in the hope of a miracle. The interactions of the three main characters in seemingly a battle for Agnes' immortal soul and the belief by Dr. Livingstone that Agnes may not be as innocent as she seems makes for compelling and fascinating drama. The fact that you are never sure how the child was conceived is beyond the point. It doesn't need to be answered. The point of this film is that a woman became pregnant and the child is dead. Who did it and how much does Agnes know.My only complaint with the film is I read the play before I ever saw the film. A miracle happens the play makes clear what it is. The final speech by Dr. Livingstone and indeed the trial is very different and should have been used in the film. It makes more sense. Still a brilliantly acted and directed film that never got the credit it deserved.".

The reason it did not I believe is that it challenges the viewer and takes a serious look at core beliefs thus automatically taking it out of the mainstream.The film really is about three mutually exclusive opposing viewpoints and outlooks on life. One side is represented by Meg Tilly playing the naive young nun accused of murder and who represents pure religious ecstacy. The other is played by Ann Bancroft who plays the mother superior of the convent and while religious knows of and is experienced in the world. The last is Jane Fonda who plays a courtappointed psychiatrist to determine if Meg Tilly is competent to stand trial. She represents the world of secular humanism.On one level the movie is a drama whose underlying plot is to determine exactly what happened that night when Meg Tilly was discovered with a dead baby. On a deeper level the movie is an examination of how each position  humanism religiosity and religious ecstacy  views the world.This film is basically an ensemble plot that pits the performances of Fonda Bancroft and Tilly and their respective viewpoints against each other. It is truly a cultural clash of these three orientations where one side attempts to understand the other. Through most of the movie there is no understanding or meeting of the minds there is conflict and there is only misunderstanding. There is conflict in the movie not just because the screen writers wanted some dramatic tension in the film. These three viewpoint indeed are different points of view where there is little common ground.The legal system must proceed but Fonda secular humanism wants very much to understand the obvious genuineness of Meg Tilly's religious fervor. Is this a reflection of her own secular humanism's own vacuity? She works a little harder than she would have done if this were an other case. And the viewer too wants to believe as well. The viewer does not want to believe that Tilly was molested or abused. The viewer's hopes are anchored on the great depth of Tilly's faith. There is enough evidence to make the viewer believe that perhaps Tilly is pure and did not kill the baby because when she is caught up in her religious zeal she bleeds. Some of the most poignant scenes in the movie is where personally confused and conflicted by all the attention paying upon her Meg Tilly spontaneously bleeds on the palms of her hands. The establishment Ann Bancroft will always have an interest in clearing the matter quickly and neatly. Whether the film presented such a resolution only the viewer can answer.All performances are strong and all the main actresses were Oscarnominated for good reason. Fonda's performance deserved a nomination as well but she wasn't for whatever reason.This movie is thoughtprovoking. If there was any movie not meant for casual viewing it is this one. It deserves five stars for its brilliant treatment on the topic portrayed.".

Fonda Bancroft and Tilly are so good here that the play's basic flaw does not ruin everything that came before. So if you are in the mood to see three really great actresses strut their stuff I highly recommend AGNES OF GOD. Despite its faults it is compelling filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off Jane Fonda is a wonderful riveting actress who packs a punch with every performance. In Agnes of God she delivers on a very personal level portraying a character very close to herself and bringing passion to the screen. She is also in her early fifties looking so loinscorchingly beautiful that I could hardly restrain myself at times. Despite her wardrobe depicting a woman who doesn't care to exhibit so loudly her heartpoundingly bloodthrobbingly luscious body she magnetizes any heterosexual libido watching this film. Now that that's been made clear I'll return to more practical comments upon this movie.Meg Tilly makes you wonder why her sister is more popular and still working these days. She is haunting as a nun who in mind and spirit is still a naive and innocent little girl overloaded with imagination and shame for every presentation of any of the realities of being a woman. Each actress in the film matches the other but only Tilly disturbs us and rocks our emotions.Anne Bancroft in maybe her best performance short of The Graduate is wonderful because of how realistic her character is the sad woman whose present situation brings peace but does not hinder the edge she's developed from life. Her scenes with Fonda are riveting despite the stagelike speed at which they exchange dialogue which hardly has the effect on screen as it would in the original play. The two actresses develop a swaying arch that lasts throughout the movie as they meet and no matter how much they disagree and fight can still find that one moment in the gazebo where they can connect on a relatively comfortable level. They only hate each other because of what the other represents to the other's desperately fixed opinion and if things were different they could get along just like anyone else. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a relationship like that done so well and so clearly in a movie before. It's a rare and odd sort of occurrence and in life that isn't often recognized and those two actresses performed it with the sharp perception that makes them two of the greatest actresses of the 1960s through the '80s.Agnes of God is directed by Norman Jewison with a sort of effect that films rarely live up to. I don't know if I would call it one of my favorite films but I would call it a film that sets a perfect example of effective atmospheric emotional filmmaking. Jewison's use of director of photography Sven Nykvist of Ingmar Bergman fame gives the film the visual moods it has that Jewison subtly projects on us. Every prop setting and landscape is old almost antiquelike and therein lies feeling and atmosphere. There's a sense of history that is never spoken of. Georges Delerue's music is so packed with weeping heartsinking emotion that because of it tears will strain your eyes. The film is so subtle in its workings especially on Jewison's handling of the cinematography and music. The music will slowly sneak into a scene and you will hardly notice it's entrance and it will pack a scene with tension or passion or even fear in any combination of warmth sneakiness and atmosphere. The film entrances you because of these subtleties. Jewison will focus so deeply on one setting that it's an entire universe for us and when a new scene takes place somewhere else it's jolting. What a sad powerful atmospheric film. I cried so hard.".

I love the interaction between Fonda and Bancroft. They're professionals and they're good in this film. That's why the three earned Academy Award nominations. Finally a film about nuns that's not so demeaning or patronizing. Mother Superior joins the convent for her reasons or because she felt chosen to do God's work. Sister Agnes and Mother Superior's relationship is not so obvious to the viewer. YOu have to take into account every word of what is said between these three characters.

Fonda plays the central role and serves as a narrator to the audience of the psychiatrist dealing herself with issues that this peculiar case revived in one of the finest performances of her career.Agnes of God raises several questions about faith religion and even sexual abuse it's the supernatural a miracle of God ? It is possible even admitting a miracle had occurred which the Stigmata Phenomenon is considered... that a virgin can conceive a baby ? Or years of physical and sexual abuse mentally disturbed this naive young girl ? And the most important question of them all... who is in fact the real biological father of the illfated newborn child ? Even if all the answers were left open for the viewer to interpret and decide Agnes of God is truly a magnificent cinematic experience a mystery  drama film which also works as a detective story presenting an unforgettable plot and charismatic characters that will remain with us forever. In conclusion the late Roger Ebert gave it just 1 star well... he was seriously wrong when reviewed this one or just missed the point of the movie that some things are better if they remained unexplained if they opted to conclude this in a way to satisfy the less demanding audiences it could have ruined the emotional power of this thrilling storytelling.Highly recommended !!".

	schema:reviewBody "Agnes of God opens with screams in a convent. As nuns rush to the room where the screams come from the viewer is confronted with the scene of a novice nun Sister Agnes Meg Tilly covered in blood in a paper wastebasket next to her a dead newborn is found. The authorities want to know what happened but Sister Agnes has blocked all memories from that night so Dr. Martha Livingston Jane Fonda has the inglorious task of discovering the truth.Norman Jewison has made a name for himself tackling hot issues in his movies cold war paranoia The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming racism In the Heat of the Night A Soldier's Story corruption in the legal system  And Justice for All. In Agnes of God he portrays the touchy relationship between religion and secular authority. A murder probably occurred in the convent but like a judge says no one wants to send a nun to prison. They'll be content with declaring Agnes insane and temporarily locking her away in an institution. What makes Dr. Livingston's task so inglorious is that she's fighting alone against the state and the church to find the truth.Appointed by court to analyse Sister Agnes' state of mind Dr. Livingston starts asking interesting questions that no one else cares about who was the father? Did any of the nuns know about the pregnancy? Why was Sister Agnes' room the only one with a paper wastebasket? And more importantly was the death an accident or a premeditated murder? Opposing the investigation is Mother Miriam Ruth Anne Bancroft the head of the convent a disillusioned woman looking for miracles in the modern world and who wants to believe that Sister Agnes' presumed virgin pregnancy is the work of God.The movie's main strength lies in the confrontation between these two great actresses. Although the narrative is weak at times the screenplay fleshed out the characters very well giving the viewer a lot of information about their past. We learn that Dr. Livingston had a Catholic upbringing but became an atheist after a traumatic experience in her childhood. She sees Sister Agnes as a victim that must be saved from a world that wants her to live in ignorance.Mother Miriam who could easily have been portrayed as a sinister antagonist since it's always easy to make religious figures in cinema evil or crazy is one o the most compassionate character in the movie wishing only to protect Sister Agnes from an outside world that only brought pain and misery to the young woman. Sister Agnes with her devotion and piousness also reminds Mother Miriam of a time when she still had faith and so becomes an ideal worth fighting for.Meg Tilly also stands out. Always dressed in white in opposition to the black garments worn by other nuns Sister Agnes with her babylike face is a beacon of innocence and kindness. She loves everyone knows nothing about the world outside the convent and may be visited by angels. Most of her performance consists of just looking angelic. But when she starts talking about the baby her soft voice takes a sorrowful angry tone that temporarily upstages the veteran actresses.It's a pity however that her most dramatic scenes come up while she's under hypnosis. That's one my few complaints about the movie. Hypnosis should always be used judiciously since it resolves things too easily. The screenplay could have been stronger  I have nothing to say about the dialogues which are mesmerising but the narrative could have had some tweaking.Also those who watch this movie may not realise that it contains one of the best scores ever composed for cinema. Georges Delerue who composed the music for Contempt Day for Night A Little Romance Platoon and other classics composed a score here that creates a relaxed feeling of harmony perfect for meditation and with beautiful churchlike choral music  and it's hardly heard in the movie. It's a strange decision and ironic since Delerue got his fifth Oscar nomination for it because seldom have a score and movie complemented each other so well.Nevertheless this characterdriven mystery should satisfy anyone looking for some thought provoking ideas. Although Norman Jewison is not hailed as one of cinema's greatest his ability to raise controversial topics and get unforgettable performances from his actors always makes his movies interesting to watch.".

A young naive nun named Agnes Meg Tilly somehow conceives a child giving birth and the baby ends up dead. Finding out what happened here is the job of a somewhat jaded and burned out psychiatrist Jane Fonda. The psychiatrist seems to have a bit of an ax to grind against the Catholic Church and in particular the way the Mother Superior Anne Bancroft has shielded the young nun. The film is absorbing in the way it weaves this story  showing that everyone including the church has secrets. The Mother Superior tries to convince the psychiatrist that Agnes is touched by God and that he permitted the conception. Just how she did conceive is never explained leaving it up to the viewer to decide. Meg Tilly is excellent in a very early film role and Jane Fonda and Anne Bancroft are at their best locking horns over what to do about Agnes. The film shows both the beauty of the Catholic Church and its reputation for secrecy.".

And that is what essentially is. Everything in the movie is a vehicle to narrate a touching passionate and dark love story. Know that and you'll enjoy the movie. Watch the movie expecting a thriller or horror or whatever and you'll be disappointed bored and a little angry as most Spanish critics being from Spain I argue a lot defending this movie seem to be.Moving on from that you get an interesting screen writing in which again everything including the disease that names the movie is a device for the love story with a great directing work although at some points the movie rhythm is a bit irregular a great setting and photography and astonishing performances. You'll find a lot of influences from Poe to pulp magazines even some Brian De Palma which may sound weird and in fact it is. But for me works perfectly.

	schema:reviewBody "Agnosia has a great premise and interesting characters. The lead in is captivatingseeing how JoAna developed her disability. The imagery with the black balloons in the air her coughing and fainting and her father fighting over the guns and then rushing over to help her were all beautiful. The cinematography was excellent. As the film develops you can see how her father and her fiance care and are devoted to her although both in different ways. Another merit was the visual effects used to portray what JoAna sees. It's very glassy simple and effective. Her part was very well acted and enjoyable as well as all the other characters. A little after the middle of the film however things start to get confused and the result is disappointing. The story had started out with this conspiracy to gather a secret family formula from JoAna's father which hooks you in but their method is a bit weak like a Shakespearean metacomedy but instead of switching bodies they switch the room... an interesting idea but could have been done better I think. The worst part however is that the servant the conspirators hire to pretend to be JoAna's fiance having fallen in love with her makes a sexual pass at her. She consents believing him to be her fiance and falls in love with him. The story changed from a thriller to some kind of confused love story.The love triangle is meant to be dramatic but it doesn't work. You don't sympathize for Vincent the servant because he took advantage of JoAna's disability and that is actually rape. You don't relate to JoAna's desire for Vincent in contrast to her affection of Carles her Fiance because even though any woman in her situation may have fallen for Vincent she still would detest him for taking advantage of her weakness. And you can't sympathize for Carles either because he acted as if this was an attack on himself and not on JoAna. The movie ends with JoAna dying and Carles helping up a shot down Vincent her rapist and the whole reason she is dying and both crying over her body. I find this laughable not dramatic. The last thing I would do if my fiance's rapist who she was in love with came back and caused her to die out of his own carelessness is to allow him the satisfaction of seeing her last few moments. The actual introduced story of the conspiracy goes unresolved insinuating strongly that the main antagonist got away with it not only getting away with it but doing so without much of a problem. This is how the movie really falls flat. Why totally abandon the interesting first story for a very weak second story involving some misguided love triangle no one could really sympathize with?".

	schema:headline " The Mad Monk RASPUTIN";
	schema:reviewBody "RASPUTIN did not die easily. As his assassins stood by impatiently Rasputin the Czarina Alexandra's favorite holy man and one of the most hated figures of prerevolutionary Russia stuffed himself with cyanidelaced cakes and washed them down with a sweet wine that had been similarly spiked. His only comment was that the wine was rather poor. The conspirators then shot him repeatedly. He stumbled and fell but didn't give up his ghost. The murderers bludgeoned him and at last when he had lost consciousness they dropped the body into the frozen Neva River. Later an autopsy revealed that Rasputin's lungs were full of water. He'd simply drowned. That was in December 1916 in St. Petersburg. Rasputin still isn't dead as far as movie makers are concerned. He has been played by Conrad Veidt 1930 Lionel Barrymore 1932 Harry Baur 1938 Edmond Purdom 1960 Christopher Lee 1966 Gert Frobe 1968 and most recently by Tom Baker in the 1971 spectacle ''Nicholas and Alexandra.'' Here he is the subject of a curious Russian film ''Rasputin''. I use the word ''new'' loosely. ''Rasputin'' originally titled ''Agoniya'' was made many years ago but was withheld from release in the Soviet Union when it was cleared in what some perceived as a liberalization under by Mikhail S. Gorbachev the new Soviet leader. It is easy to understand why the Russians might have had uneasy thoughts about the film directed by Elem Klimov and with Alexei Petrenko in the title role. In spite of a prologue of newsreel clips accompanied by voiceover narration which tries to put the story of the ''mad monk'' into proper context this film might make one believe that the Grigori Rasputin was the major cause of the 1917 revolution rather than a symptom of the corruption that made revolution inevitable. Except for the newsreel footage and a sequence showing Rasputin visiting his peasant family in Siberia the movie is almost exclusively concerned with showing us lowlife among the aristocratic St. Petersburg swells and their hangerson including Rasputin. In this ''Rasputin'' is comparatively adventurous even risky for a Russian film. It also gives us an almost sympathetic picture of Czar Nicholas presented as a befuddled weak but essentially decent man dependent on his superstitious wife. She in turn is seen as being bewitched by Rasputin whom she believes to be her conduit to God as well as the only person capable of treating her hemophiliac son. ''Rasputin'' is less a coherently dramatized history than a series of sometimes vivid tableaux vivants. At the center is the remarkable figure of Mr. Petrenko's Rasputin a huge heedless messy outofcontrol zealot given to epic debauches severe depressions and mystical revelations. He's a man who finds himself with more power than he knows what to do with and with no real plans to put into effect. He's an opportunist who may well believe in his own powers. Never however does the film make any effort to analyze him or to suggest that given the temper of the times the emergence of such a man was a foregone conclusion. At times this ''Rasputin'' suggests nothing much more than a horror film a somewhat politicized ''Exorcist.'' Mr. Klimov the director employs a sort of impressionistic cinema style cutting back and forth between color footage and monochrome between fictional scenes and newsreels and in one of the film's most successful sequences near the end between a series of still photographs some from the archives and some shot for the film. It is not always easy to follow the story even if one has boned up on the accepted facts before seeing the film but Mr. Klimov keeps the focus fairly narrow and short. With the exception of Rasputin the historical figures are scarcely characterized though Anatoly Romashin looks right as Czar Nicholas. Velta Linne who plays the Czarina looks more like a worried Russian peasant woman than the German princess who never felt at home in Mother Russia. Though it's a footnote to history the life and death of Rasputin retains its fascination. Mr. Klimov does particular justice to the murder plot that ended Rasputin's life. As he stages it to the sounds of ''Dixie'' on an oldfashioned Victrola the assassination turns into a macabre slapstick comedy one in which the victim keeps coming back to life to scare the wits out of the fainthearted desperate highborn perpetrators.".

	schema:headline " An intriguing film";
	schema:reviewBody "Many may not be aware that this film was considered worthless in the Soviet Union after it was made and shelved for years. Director Elem Klimov made several changes to the 1975 original version and it was ultimately released in 1981 and shown at the Venice Film Festival 1982 where it won the FIPRESCI prize out of competition.The original name of the film was Agony Agoniya and not Rasputin a name by which the film was marketed for a while. The title Agony was evidently in line with what the director had in mind. If we were to accept that argument was the director's original film about the spiritual agony of the controversial holy man? Or was it meant to reflect the agony of Czar Nicholas who could not go against the Czarina's total faith in Rasputin? Was the title meant to depict the agony of a great nation afflicted by the abysmal corruption among the monarchists who were there to make money while the poor starved and the indecisive Czar painted flowers to distract himself from the more pressing political problems One fine sequence in the film soon after the Duma castigates the Czar shows the silent but mentally tortured Czar with tear filled eyes looking for comfort in the sympathetic gaze of his loyal butler. Was the title also to depict the agony of the Russian Orthodox Church which was suddenly losing its grip on the worshippers with the rise of the Bolsheviks and holy men like Rasputin? We will never know unless we see the original version the director made. My guess is the director wanted to combine all these agonies and that Rasputin the individual dominated only a segment of the agonizing events. What we do know is that this film and its many versions that were put out by Soviet and the postPerestroika Russian authorities were at no point of time expected to depict Rasputin as the sole villain that led to the to the 1916 October Revolution.The film does offer several insights into the enigmatic character of Rasputin. He did indeed accept bribes from those wanting favors from the Czar while the film distinctly indicates that it is debatable that he loved money and wealth. He was least concerned about getting rich because he could get what he desired without pelf. Rasputin had an ability to foresee the future but could totally misread his dreams The film includes an interesting sequence where he rolls in a pool of stagnant water as he can foresee his fall from grace at the Czar's palace. He could perform small miracles could utter saintly statements the cowl does not make a monk and believed like a village bumpkin that you could sin and then start life with a clean slate! No wonder the Russian Orthodox Church saw in him an evil rascal. What happens to him after the Church traps him is totally unclear in the version of the film I saw. Was he castrated? Klimov's Rasputin is unusualhe is an animal waiting to ravish a beautiful woman one moment and then a religious zealot throwing out the woman for having tried to seduce him the very next moment.I am convinced that Klimov's film is less about Rasputin than about the people that surrounded him. Take the Czar for one.Klimov's cinematic essay shows him scurrying away from a meeting on war preparations in dark passageways behind wallmaps worried equally about his haemophiliac son Alexei the crown prince who is depicted as a brat. The personal worries of the Czar in the photography dark room in his relationship with the Orthodox Church his empathies for his worried wife doting on her children have been given importance unlike Franklin Schaffner's Nicholas and Alexandra that seemed to focus on the Czarina Janet Suzman more than the Czar. Interestingly Klimov's film downplays the Czarina's role focusing more on the Czar.Klimov's range of agonies does not end here. Even the assassins of Rasputin are agonizingly guiltridden. Most Russians are Churchgoing Orthodox Christians and Klimov understood his audience quite well. The dubious role of the Orthodox Church in those troubled times are pitch forked into prominencethe film shows the burial of Rasputin officiated by the Church in the presence of the Czar.Finally Klimov spliced documentary footage to show the agonies of the common man at every given interval to add validity to his essay on the varied agonies he captures on celluloid.While Klimov's film shows patches of brilliance one needs to recall that he initially made his mark as filmmaker decades before Agoniya having made remarkable satirical comedies like Adventures of a dentist. I have yet to see the latter film however what both films have in common is that wonderful Russian actress Alisa Frejnlikh who played the Stalker's wife in Tarkovsky's Stalker. His last few films Agoniya and Idi o simotri Go and seeCome and see proved that he was now looking at life grimly. He was then working closely with his wife actor and director Larisa Shepitko and was reported to be a devoted husband. Equally enigmatic is the role of Lady Vyrubova played by Alisa Frejnlikh. What was the relationship between Rasputin and Vyrubova? Probably the answers lie in the director's cut of Agoniya which is possibly lost for ever.I was privileged to have met Klimov at Hyderabad India in 1986 during a Film Festival. It was after his wife's death. I recall that he was withdrawn and less than forthcoming to questions. Was he afraid to talk? Was he a genius who was never allowed to prove it because of political pressures? This is probably why both Agoniya and Klimov remain enigmatic for me to this day.".

The subject matter is one of the most fascinating episodes of the 20th century the collapse of Russia's Romanov dynasty amid world war and revolution and in particular the pernicious influence of the peasant holy man Rasputin over the royal family...so why is this such a dull turgid movie? In an interview on the DVD director Klimov makes a big deal about breaking Soviet stereotype by showing Czar Nicholas as a flawed human being rather than a complete monster and also about Soviet limitations on showing graphic sex therefore Rasputin's notorious debauchery is only barely hinted at. So Soviet censorship is at least partly to blame but so is Klimov's ineptitude. Instead of spectacle or realism AGONY uses clumsy and dated propaganda techniques to convey its historical context. It delivers not a shred of psychological insight into its subjects nor even the satisfactions of simple sensationalism. I still await the film that will give me some understanding of the phenomenon of Rasputin.".

I was appalled by the tale and shook my head as any good reasoned young man would. It was a story that stuck with me for much of my life. And I often wondered if such an important biography would ever be published about this mysterious and remarkable historic figure. I truly did not think so and believed that Hypatia's memory would have to live on with what little history there was written about her and the blurb mentioned once or twice by Carl Sagan as he recounted the once magnificent library of Alexandria.People are stupid. I agree with Ridley Scott on this. They really and truly are. Whether it's the zealots portrayed in this film or the Christian who sat behind me commenting on the film he ACTUALLY APPLAUDED the Christians in the film or just people in general they really are stupid. It's how we get things like religion and place not just some whimsical desire in them but a devout belief a serious conviction of some entity that is displeased by earthly decadence. Hence the crux of the story in Agora.We have the absolute mind numbed moronic thinking of the masses verse the practicality of those who know they do not know everything but have a thirst for knowledge and to share that knowing with others so that they can live a life free of fear.But we see that it is fear that wins out. Not reason. Not logic applied to a simple problem with a simple solution. But pure unmitigated fear. Everyone from the heads of state the heads of religions the heads of mobs the heads of any social entity in Roman Imperial Egypt is gripped by fear. Knowledge. Reason. Logic. Understanding. Education. Those are the true weapons that can assail the most ardent of foes.But fear is primal and infects everyone and everything like a plague spread by rats. The notion of imaginary beings who in spite of being all powerful and all knowing are vested in a patch of desert and how its human female population dresses should be a warning sign. Does this not sound familiar? We have the same concerns today and although codified and addressed by legislation for local morays and investigated and codified by alleged behavioral experts people are still pretty touchy about anything remotely informative that doesn't gybe with their ideals as a for instance sex in this case.Hypatia thinks like a man despite her sexual makeup. She is the one who calls reason as any good leader or scientist would. The rest merely cower to the polity dominating the social terrain. But she is optimistic. Even so the times tragically overwhelm her.The story of Hypatia has been somewhat elongated no doubt for dramatic effect. Regardless it's a good watch. Buy yourself a ticket or grab the DVD when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.Enjoy! ".

But in that fog of dull wits are always people like Hypatia who want to see further and understand more.As to the historical nature of what Hypatia herself did I think the film goes too far. It seems highly unlikely to me that she bridged the gap between Ptolemy and Kepler essentially by herself just thinking about the problem. Prof. George Saliba and others have written extensively on the subject and the thousand years of analysis primarily by the Arabs was actually necessary for Kepler to finally solve it. But the idea provides very well to the story to show the contrast of one people who spent their lives thinking and those the spent their lives praying judging and persecuting.The movie does very well in putting religion in its proper place and exalting science with the kind of devotion of one who is obsessed with it. It provides a comparison of the ultimate sacrifice of oneself to spreading understanding as supposedly Jesus sacrificed himself for the purposes of spreading ignorance and piety this is not in the movie but the parallel was so obvious. Hypatia actually achieves something that we all benefit from to this day while Jesus achieved nothing.This film is exceedingly important in this era when the next generation is not as impressed by dogma but still falls victim to it.".

For example pagan persecution of Christians as shown in the early scenes had ceased a hundred years before Hypatia's time.

Certain people seem to think that any negative statement about any Christian must be historically false and biased. Some reviewers actually said that Orestes in this film was a pagan he was a Christian just one who did not persecute others does that disqualify him from Jesus's grace? The historical Orestes was a tolerant Christian just as in the film.Yes the story is remarkably true to the historical record read Socrates Scholasticus a liberal Orestestype Christian. Yes Cyril and the Parabolani did exist just as described yes the fanatics were opposed to philosophy and pagan science. If anything they were considerably more extreme than shown in this film. Sozomen a cheerful Cyriltype Christian historian talks about the killing of philosophers with great relish. Read Augustine on astronomy and science and on toleration of dissent. Or Lactantius or Tertullian What has Athens to do with Jerusalem? This is our primary faith there is nothing we ought to believe besides. Not all Christian leaders and writers were wise and humane. For conservative Christian cosmology look up Cosmas Indicopleustes admittedly a hundred years later. The views of Ammonius in the film follow Cosmas. For general background try Synesius Ammianus Marcellinus or Zosimus. The Library of Alexandria. Wise people judge others on their actions themselves and not on the affiliations they profess. The library was mentioned up to Hypatia's time and not mentioned after. Some people try to blame it on Julius Caesar although Antony later rebuilt it and then desperately on anyone other than on someone who carries a label they identify with.

As far as anyone can tell Christian mobs destroyed it along with the rest of pagan institutes. Theodosius gave orders in 3912 to destroy not just the Serapeum but all pagan temples and worship.The scene of the Christians distributing bread was good convincing and historically accurate. Some reviewers have used it to imply that pagans would not do this. It was true at the time. But remember that during the pagan empire there was dole of bread in cities normally nobody was short of bread. Constantine nullified the urban bread ration with a stiff poll tax. There are many places where the film is bravely historically accurate even at the cost of risking mass appeal. Hypatia's chastity. It was brave to have purely intellectual romance without any sex or even kissing. The religious aspect of her astronomy. The lack of any modern political correctness for the main characters.Also good was the direct historical reconstruction of key scenes Cyril's biblical challenge to Orestes over advice from a pagan and a woman the subsequent physical attack on Orestes the persecution of the Jews etc.As for things which actually were historical inaccuraciesKepler. This was a kind of sweet artistic liberty. I took this as a sort of inside joke. Hypatia was an astronomer among other things and her most original work was on the mathematics of conic sections. So to have her tentatively propose the possibility that the the earth might move in a different conic section  an ellipse rather than a circle  is entertaining but not entirely implausible.It would have been much better to have explained in more detail Hypatia's views on spirituality and the flesh so that her cure for her admirer's physical passion was a bit more clear. Perhaps this is in the scenes that had to be cut. In reality this is explained in detail in Synesius's letters.Synesius of Cyrene. He was in fact a much more sympathetic character than made out in the film both more humane and braver and more admiring of Hypatia. He is the only character whose writings we still have personal letters that are well worth reading even today. Perhaps Amenbar needed a more critical character to balance Orestes's total admiration. But that kind of utter devotion was common between teacher and pupil in philosophical schools even across religious boundaries. Again it is interesting that certain reviewers seem to think that admiration for a pagan equals paganism even today. Just like Cyril. The message of the whole film was that this is not true. It was too subtle for some obviously.The initial attacks of pagans on Christians are anachronistic. Also pagans could not own Christian slaves at this time. But I suppose they had to explain the fanatics hatred for the pagans somehow other than an inflated memory of events that had occurred a century before.".

For the record the real Hypatia  a pagan philosopher in fourth century Alexandria who deduced that the earth orbited the sun in an ellipse and preserved her right to operate as a lecturer by repelling her suitors with a gift of a handkerchief stained with her own menstrual blood  was killed as a witch by fundamentalist Christians who scraped the living flesh from her bones with seashells. It is her life and thought however and not the manner of her death which is the chief subject of this film and that is as it should be.The astonishingly realistic recreation of Alexandria is in itself a remarkable cinematic feat the costumes look entirely authentic the performances are flawless and the cinematography  always beautiful  is often thoroughly awe inspiring. Ultimately however what makes this film so great is the way in which it puts human beings into perspective swarming fundamentalists ransacking the agora are likened to ants and in one of the most inspired shots in cinematic history Alexandria is viewed from outer space and is sublime and utterly insignificant all at once whilst suggesting that human beings are nevertheless capable of reaching the heights of reason and plumbing the depths of unreason. It is one of the ironies of history that the monstrous 'Saint' Cyril of Alexandria is recognised as a Doctor of the Church whilst not a single word written by Hypatia has survived.Much ink will be wasted in coming months in discussion of whether this film deliberately paints Christianity in a bad light. The truth is that no form of religious extremism looks good in this film and for that reason alone it ought to be statutory viewing for all people who are convinced that theirs is the only god. Rachel Weisz plays the lead role with such grace and conviction that her refusal of Christian baptism accompanied by the words I believe in philosophy  clunky as they may look on the printed page  becomes one of the most powerful moments in modern cinema.Forget the lukewarm reviews and see this film for yourself. Thrown off the scent perhaps by publicity overemphasising the romantic element in the film reviewers have begun to argue that the plot begins to flag in the second half. This is to miss the point entirely the film is not a romance it is an exploration of one woman's discoveries about our place in the universe and it is at once humbling tragic and victorious. I found myself on the edge of tears throughout most of it entranced by the splendour wisdom and realism of its vision. The ending was the hardest and the truest thing I have ever seen in a film.But don't trust me. Make up your own mind. That is what Hypatia would have told you to do.".

The film is unbelievably sad in it's depiction of mobs of religious extremists destroying accumulated knowledge a fact that has happen many times throughout history delaying our progress in so many ways.This is a truly a horror film for those whose value science rationality free thinking and feminism.Unfortunately this film got only a very limited theatrical release in North America.I give it plenty of kudos and 8.510".

So it's pretty apt that they developed a story around the idea of christians overcoming jews and pagans yes but more important forcing Orestes the old school guy to play their political game and wiping out Hypatia the last free thinker and a woman!.Those viewers that care about historical truth whatever that is should mind a few things here there aren't enough true facts for us to be able to tell a factual story of the events and in this film specifically we shouldn't take things at their facial value but to consider them as metaphors for something. Characters stand for what they represent in their context. It's all a metaphor including the physical act of destruction of the library. Library the term referred to the books back than to knowledge no the physical place and this certainly is understood by the writers here who nevertheless use the idea of the building being destroyed but as a metaphor. That building which is fairly interesting 1 even if virtual becomes the central piece of the metaphor and the richest thing about the construction of this film for how they play with the idea of distances. It's as simple as this first you have the Greek school controlling the library and everybody else outside. Than christians take over throw the greeks out and make the library into something close to a church. The remaining Greek thinkers are thrown to the outskirts.

And Hypatia comes to go on with her research outside the city marginal to the new order.There is a certain visual interest in the recreation of events but it seems to me that there was more to the intentions of Amenabar in what concerns the use of the camera than what technology allowed him to do.

I believe in some ways full appreciation of this film can only be achieved if you have watched a completely unrelated work Cosmos by Carl Sagan.Both the Library of Alexandria and Hypatia were terms that constantly came up in Cosmos and although it is unclear if Sagan had any influence in the making of this film it really embodied Sagan's philosophy. For example there are a lot of aerial shots looking at the Earth from afar  often during dramatic scenes of either love or violence that shows both how insignificant and how precious the human existence is. In spite of all our wars and hate and differences we are all being carried on this lone blue vessel journeying through the vast emptiness of space. Are we really that different? Or do more things unite us than divide us like Hypatia says? In a moment of sheer ignorance men can destroy their own proudest and most beautiful achievements and erase all of their accumulated knowledge. It's happened before and it could happen again. This film delivered this message with beautiful precision  are we naive like Orestes of Alexandria to think we have finally changed? Or should we look at ourselves in the mirror and know that we still have a long road ahead to better ourselves? The choice is up to us.".

I will first comment on the pros and then the cons.The GoodFrom the beginning the film's exquisite detail is evident  costumes sets props hundredsthousands of extras etc  reminding me especially of HBO's Rome series. CGIs were amazing and the sound effects used in certain scenes with large numbers of people were thunderous and powerful  surely the best I have seen from a film. It is by far the most ambitious project in the bringing to life of an ancient city that I have seen on screen. I only wished that they would have had the actors speak in Greek but that would be asking too much I suppose pAlso I liked how the film did not focus so much on portraying any one religious group as the bad guy. Naturally one would have assumed that it was going to be the Christians after seeing the trailers but in fact the goods and the bads were exposed in all religions which added to the realism and historical accuracy of the film.Above all this director ought to be commended in his attempt to capture the society in the city of Alexandria of late antiquity. This has never yet been done in cinema and Amenabar clearly attempts to do this out of extraordinary passion for his work. Agora presents to the audience a glimpse into a world that is little known outside of the circles of ancient historians and classicists and the film's portrayal of religious strife between the different groups in Alexandria successfully shows a very complex ancient society.The main character Davus also serves as an important figure by representing the common man living in Alexandria at the time who must face the challenges of an ancient society in transition. However I feel that the subtleties of Davus' character who is indeed a source of much important historical information would be misunderstood and ignored by the audience which would be in search of something more direct and in yourface from the film.Overall the film was at its best when it subtly hinted certain elementsthemes to the audience  this is when it showed the most sophistication in the portrayal of history and skill in terms of artistic merit.The BadI think the biggest mistake that the director made was to focus too much on the religious conflict. Without a doubt during the first 45 minutes the audience was engulfed and captivated with awe by the strife between the pagans and the Christians probably because such a time in history is little known today and rarely portrayed in art or discussed but the film does not give a break to its constant references to religion. Throughout the two hours the script continuously shows the characters' endless preoccupation with religious matters which takes away from development of their individualities. Amenabar tries to differ attention toward other things through the love triangle between Orestes Davus and Hypatia  which works well at times but could have been developed far more especially between her and Davus. He also gives some attention to science a big mistake IMO because in such scenes one feels like the film turns into a lecture. If Amenabar had tried to use CGIs to demonstrate some of the scientific concepts discussed among characters he could have added something artistic to the bland dialogue of those scenes.I was also somewhat disappointed by Dario Marianelli's score. HAving heard his compositions for Pride and Prejudice Atonement and V for Vendetta I was expecting a musical score that was more intense and thoughtprovoking rather than a more or less typical and primitive symphony that one often hears in epic historical films.810".

I recommend this movie to all intelligent adults but unless you have a reasonable background in classics andor ancient history I suggest you look up a bit about the period and about Hypatia first. The movie is not antiChristian  a careful assessment of the story shows this via a number of sympathetically portrayed Christians. Unfortunately so few Christians are actually aware of their early history that many of them will freak out when they realise how violent their history has been at times and declare the movie antiChristian propaganda.".

	schema:reviewBody "The chief reason to see this film is for Rachel Weisz's performance as Hypatia the philosopher. She is the main character and she gives an excellent performance. Whenever she is on screen you are riveted to the screen. Her excitement at discovery her endless desire to learn her ability to figure out the mysteries of the universe are fascinating and she makes them feel exciting even though we know it all already. Unfortunately when ever she is offscreen there is nothing to hold our interest until she returns. The rest of the plot is a really blunt unsubtle message about the dangers of religious zealotry blatantly inserted onto Hypatia's story to give it some sort of relevance. The sheer lack of subtlety and intelligence behind this message is annoying. The Christians are all bigoted mindless intolerant fools and the pagans are not much better. Hypatia by contrast is presented as an atheist which she certainly wasn't and the only reasonable person left. I have never liked having ideas forced down my throat and this movie does that extremely roughly.Hypatia has often been seen as a martyr to science which is really a shame since the history doesn't support that. In this movie she is basically presented as an atheist who doesn't believe in any of the gods which is just flatout wrong. She was a Neoplatonist and what the Neoplatonists were known for was their incorporation of religion in their philosophy. The supposed atheism of philosophers is a myth that should really be discredited by now and the Neoplatonists actually had miracles and spiritual elements in their teachings. That isn't to say that they had no scientific interests but they incorporated them into a wider religious context. To have Hypatia speak out against religion in general was just wrong.The Christian zealotry in this movie is extreme to the point of being utterly unbelievable and insulting. They burn all of the books in the Library of Alexandria because they are pagan filth. The actual event that took place at this time was the burning down of a pagan temple and it's library of religious texts. The Christians never touched the library. For that matter they never intentionally destroyed scientific or philosophical works its just that the Dark Ages wasn't really the sort of time when they had much use for those tracts which led to many of them being lost. Turning her death into a primitive reaction to education is also bull. She was killed by a Christian mob it is true but it was over a political conflict not a religious one. The Christian elite was as highly educated as the pagan elite before them and this wasn't seen as contradictory.Still what's good about this movie is Hypatia. She is presented with intelligence and grace and comes across as an extremely likable person. Unfortunately the film is intent on removing her personality and making her merely a symbol. It is to the film's greater credit that in this it fails.".

All the film can be summarized in one phrase of Hypatia. You don't doubt your God. I have to doubt what I believe. This is the struggle that this film depicts. This is the core of the Greek identity. This is what is important. The film is about the death of a world and the rise of another. The reasons why are shown very well in the film. Do not hesitate should anyone of you visit Greece to study what specific parts of the Greek statues where destroyed by Christians.

I'm a bit of a history buff and I'm always excited when an ancient city is recreated with such attention to detail. But it couldn't have worked without a great cast and Rachel Weisz was perfect for her role. She had just the right combination of charm strength and enthusiasm for math  philosophy to convince the audience that she was a legendary intellectual that could elicit loyalty from her male students and slaves too.This film recreates the religious struggles of the late Roman Empire the destruction of the Library of Alexandria the ensuing ignorance and the relegation of women to 2nd class status in society. I greatly enjoyed watching this and I hope that many more such films are created in the future.".

	schema:headline " Visually stunning and a strong message about fundamentalism";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I will say that the cinematography of this movie was beautiful. It's a shame that more viewers did not get to see it on the big screen in a cinema because here I'm sure it would have been even better. I first stumbled across this hidden gem on Netflix. I had never heard of the movie or heard of Hypatia but enjoy period movies so I decided to give this one watch. Its an unusual movie for the genre in that the lead is a woman and the casting of the primary male characters were all from virtual unknowns. Having said that I thought all the acting was top notch across the board. The story is set in forth century Alexandria in a period of great religious change in the city. While at first glance the story seems to be about Hypatia a philosopher and scientific pioneer the story is rather seen through the eyes of her young slave Davus who is played by Max Minghella. I had seen him play in the Social Network prior to watching this and here he was a revelation. His near mute performance is delivered primarily through looks expressions and body language. Some of the scenes he shares with Rachel are stunning and very touching. The first act delivers strongly but as the second act unfolds the main characters seem to get lost in the the up swelling of religious upheaval. Part of the problem is the script here seems to relegate the interesting characters of Davus and Ammonius to spectators while Hypatia studies and the very one dimensional Cyril plots. Oscar Isaac as Orestes was very good in the second half. A powerful scene with his childhood friend Synesius is a strong one. The final section of the movie is completed by a beautifully passionate violent but heart wrenching scene featuring the leads which is excellently performed. Aside from the scripting problems and some painful lines at times this movie could have been even better. I would class it as a very strong movie with excellent acting beautiful visuals portraying a very interesting time in history. While many Christians will think of this as anti Christian I think the overall impression I was left with was the moral of anti fundamentalism. Neither Christians or Jews or Pagans were sold as good in this movie. All groups committed atrocities which parallel the tensions in our world. Overall worth a view on Netflix at least. 910.".

And love of a young slave with his mistress. And I cannot say I love one aspect more than the other.

Some say that thinking of the stars what really happens in this world and what happens in the cosmos is no really concern of ours because in our day to day life we never get to use that knowledge. But what if we all think like that then such philosophies that gave birth to our modern sciences would have been for nothing. To know that we also share the passion the passion of those great philosophers like hepatia in finding out the mysteries of the universe is truly something. To ignore that passion and say that we don't want it is to disgrace the progress of science.I think one of the greatest crimes in human history is depicted in this movie the great burning of the library of Alexandria. This is only one of the incidents that has shapes our history or more accurately mutilated our history. Such incidents has caused the demise of the progress and set back the steady succession of the development of science. And for what . In the name of religion. All in the name of effing religion.

	schema:headline " Agora a wonderful historic film about the fall of the pagan world and the rise of Christianity";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Agora explores without sentiment or melodrama a time period and a subject that I have often overlooked the violent and tragic end of the Pagan Classical World and the beginning of the Christian Dominated West which also launched the Dark Ages. Watching this film I cannot help but ask myself would we have been better off if the worshipers of Serapes and Isis had won the day.The movie was divided into two historic parts the sheltered pagan world of wealth and statusquo where Christianity was no more than an annoying cult and the Christian world under Emperor Theodosius with all of its early Patriarchs and Saints. The film's main character Hypatia was a sheltered brilliant upper class Pagan a mathematician and philosopher living in a liberal world of free thought. Before her all the ancient knowledge of Rome Greece and the Near East lay in scrolls in the Great Library of Alexandria a treasure that only the pagans seemed to comprehend. This pagan world felt a little bit like our own with its freedom of thought and its blind belief in the universal search for knowledge and understanding. One of my favorite things about the pagan world was that the elite Patricians and the wealthy Jews all enjoyed the theater.The pagan world presented in the film had a dark side as well. The slaves although treated somewhat warmly still had to wear a collar and they were also whipped. Another problem was in the established pagan cult religion of Serapes and its high priest who was an ass. But aren't so many high priests and people in authority asses even today. It was a world in decline but Hypatia and the other privileged Pagans didn't know it. She dwelt in the realm of the mind protected by the serapium and walls of the Great Library. Yet down below in the Agora the growing number of discontented Christians were about to rise up and smash the pagan world to bits. And that's exactly what they did by tearing down the statues taking over the city and burning all of the scrolls in the library to ash thus casting a darkness over the mind of the world which wouldn't lift until the Renaissance.In the second half of the film we see Christianized Alexandria some years later. Here the freedom of the mind that was so prevalent in the beginning has been crushed. Most members of the pagan Patrician class have by now converted to Christianity whether they believed in Christ or not. Hypatia is the last holdout huddled in her mansion working on her brilliant theory of a heliocentric universe while the world around her slips into intolerant religious darkness based on faith and scripture alone. As the Bishop held the Bible over his head proclaiming that the scriptures say that women should be seen but not heard a chill went down my spine. The Christians had traded in all books and all knowledge for that one book the Holy Bible.

	onyx:emotionText "The film Agora explores without sentiment or melodrama a time period and a subject that I have often overlooked the violent and tragic end of the Pagan Classical World and the beginning of the Christian Dominated West which also launched the Dark Ages. Watching this film I cannot help but ask myself would we have been better off if the worshipers of Serapes and Isis had won the day.The movie was divided into two historic parts the sheltered pagan world of wealth and statusquo where Christianity was no more than an annoying cult and the Christian world under Emperor Theodosius with all of its early Patriarchs and Saints. The film's main character Hypatia was a sheltered brilliant upper class Pagan a mathematician and philosopher living in a liberal world of free thought. Before her all the ancient knowledge of Rome Greece and the Near East lay in scrolls in the Great Library of Alexandria a treasure that only the pagans seemed to comprehend. This pagan world felt a little bit like our own with its freedom of thought and its blind belief in the universal search for knowledge and understanding.

The rise of the power of the Christian cult in the Roman cities and how this effected classical GrecoRoman culture.The film presents a compelling vision of life in classical Alexandria. The historical detail was superb. The GrecoEgyptian deity Serapis was indeed worshipped in this period. The mixture of Hellenic and Egyptian culture was spot on. The recreation of the Library and Serapium was a wonder to behold perfectly in line with what we know about the period.We cannot know whether the Early Christian Church or it's followers were really responsible for as much strife as the film suggests. But it is plausible given accounts of the era such as the reallife stripping and murder of Hypatia and widespread destruction of pagan temples. Given our present experience with religious fanaticism it is easy to see how a new religion claiming to have a universal answers was likely received by both hungry new converts searching for meaning and existing communities.The film is not suggesting that all Christian Martyrs were fanatics elevated into propaganda figures. I am guessing this perceived suggestion is what some Christians found objectionable. No doubt some people will read the film in this way one cannot help that. Some however may well have been provocateurs harassing their neighbours and then reaping the fear and outrage it provoked. Isn't it interesting that those pagans who died for their beliefs aren't also considered Martyrs by the Christian Churches? They were persecuted too but but their beliefs were 'wrong' of course.At the end of the day neutral people in the middle of the two paranoid and bigoted communities are often the ones who suffer the most unjustly. Hypatia is depicted as a true humanist she does not care what cult people follow and is only concerned for the welfare of human beings. Between the two reactionary factions remaining humane and independent becomes impossible as it has for so many millions in conflicts across the world in our own time.

	schema:reviewBody "The present is always wanting which makes it ugly abhorrent and unendurable. The present is obsolete. The moment it lands in the present the coveted future is poisoned by the toxic effluvia of the wasted past.  Zygmunt Bauman Michelangelo Antonioni's Red Desert opens with an out of focus shot. We're at an industrial estate the earth poisonous the sky toxic factory fumes snaking their way up into the air. Fittingly a man complains that his food tastes of petroleum. In interviews Antonioni would call this the malaise of progress.A woman and child appear. Her name is Giuliana Monica Vitti and she is the wife of a factory worker. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly apparent that Giuliana is stuck in what Jean Paul Sartre called a state of existential nausea. Having sustained minor injuries in a crash Giuliana becomes hypersensitive. Now deeply attuned to the world around her Giuliana begins to feel the suffocating pain of existence. Reality itself has become an invisible weight. It smothers and crushes.But Giuliana resists. She puts on a brave face and does her assigned duties as a wife and mother. But it's no use. As sensitivity inexorably leads to alienation Giuliana begins to isolate and shield herself from all stimulus. These unconscious acts of removal soon become conscious acts Giuliana attempts suicide. Her attempts fail.Antonioni's landscapes convey Giuliana's mental anguish. Every object denotes a threatening presence every location emblematic of the poor girl's fragile psyche. Antonioni has Giuliana sit next to a tilted cart to convey her lack of balance has her wear a tight coat to convey how besieged she feels uses out of focus shots to emphasise that Giuliana is out of sync with everyone else alternates between sound and silence to differentiate between Giuliana's comfort and pain and has her paint her shop in cool colours to convey her attempts at separating herself from the poison. And as always with Antonioni how characters enter certain spaces what these spaces are and how they act and react within these spaces are essential to the story.Unsurprisingly those around Giuliana can't relate to her troubles. Extended set pieces parties group sex financial conquests other biochemical stimuli etc highlight the ways in which man habitually shields himself from painful contemplation. But Giuliana removes herself from these indulgences she sees people as pitiful desiremachines always chasing nothing. Anhedonic she grows disillusioned with nothing less than all human behaviour.The only one to empathise with Giuliana's pain is Zeller Richard Harris another wounded existentialist. Typical of Antonioni's male characters Zeller is rootless travelling from place to place but never finding contentment. The two begin a subdued romance but despite Zeller's attempts to get to the bottom of Giuliana's condition nothing changes.But though nothing changes everything moves almost imperceptibly. Antonioni's use of moving cargo ships the juxtaposition between movement and tranquillity past and present modernity and poverty all work together to create a unique aesthetic. This is not just Italy's postwar reality but a new world order an illusory neocapitalism in which there exists endless production endless motion but progress itself is nowhere to be seen.The film represents the acme of modernist minimalism but is itself an exploration of the trauma of modernism. Antonioni is unconcerned about how social changes affect industrial workers and focuses instead on upwardly mobile skilled workers or middle managers of the new world. The film is typically said to be about alienation and ennui but it's more about the ambivalence toward economic transformation and how this transformation destroys feeling exploits desires makes love impossible and creates a world of only shared pretence. The title of Antonioni's film itself alludes to a lack of eros or love. Giuliana's in a desert of red. A lack of human passion mankind's future waning of affect.Antonioni then gives us a wonderful sequence which encapsulates the themes of his film. Giuliana's son seems to have caught a strange disease. His legs don't work and she fears that he may be paralysed. Tell me what's wrong! Giuliana screams. But like Giuliana the boy doesn't speak. He's unable to articulate his pain and so must suffer in silence. His pain private his legs broken the boy seems too weak to exist in this new world.It's a simple bedtime story that cures Giuliana's son. She tells him of a girl who swims away and lives on a secluded island. She is happy alone away from the world here on this silent beach. But one day a ship visits. The girl finds the ship beautiful and mysterious. Seeing the beauty in man the girl then begins to hear the rocks and island singing all around her. Cue reconnection but of course the island and boat are a fantasy.The film ends with two brilliant scenes. Giuliana like Zeller attempts to flee the world. She heads out to the docks and boards a ship. Like the lead in Antonioni's The Passenger she wants to get away. It's only in a moment of selftherapy when she finally articulates her pain to a sailor who doesn't speak her language and doesn't understand her that Giuliana comes to some measure of not just closure but false connection. She then leaves the ship.Red Desert ends with a coda that mirrors the film's introduction. In this scene mother and son look on at the factory landscape. The boy asks his mother why the factory's smoke is yellow. She tells him that the smoke is poisonous. Why doesn't it kill the birds? he asks. The message is clear Giuliana hasn't been cured she's simply learnt to cope. And the birds? Some have adapted to the smoke some avoid it altogether but most nonchalantly breathe it in. The poison doesn't register. The world's flocks fly blissfully unaware.9.510  Masterpiece. See Safe 1995 and Cries and Whispers 1972.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the most part I've never been terribly impressed by the new wave movements in the French and Italian cinema of the 1960s. How many times do we have to watch the upper middle class intelligentsia wallowing in their designeralienated angst?  And why don't those films ever bring up any mention of altruism?  Perhaps those folks wouldn't feel so alienated if they got off their seats at the cafe or on their yacht and actually tried to participate in the world.  Maybe they could help those who don't have the leisure to whine about their hardships in life.  Or maybe they could even do something to counter the coldness and ugliness that surrounds them.This film is different because this time the isolation and coldness is real and tangible and we are entrapped by it as much as the main character is. We can see the ugliness and filth sweeping over everything like a virus. And we can see how isolated one becomes when one discovers that she is the only one who seems to be sensitive to it.  No one really sees or listens to Giuliana including I'm sorry to see some of the commentators here at IMDb!.  The people around her see her 'function' wife mother sexy lady but not her identity.  I will admit that Monica Vitti isn't terrific in this.  She gives a great 'performance' but it seems too much a performance. If she had been anything like Gena Rowlands in A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE this film would be a masterpiece.  As it stands it's still an excellent film.As for this film's use of colors... I heard once that if you drop a copper penny into a goldfish bowl it will eventually drain all the color from the fish.  I don't know if that's true but that is what essentially has happened to the town that's depicted in this film and sadly thousands of similar places all over the globe. People have adapted.  And real color has been drained out of everything. The only colors we see in the film are manmade.  Thick bright glossy paint coats everything from walls to houses to the pipes in the factories.  There are no natural colors that contain any real texture or sensuality or warmth. Even the natural elements look unreal.  The land is riddled with greenish muck the sea is coated with muddy oil and the sky is choking in clouds of frightening yellow smoke.   The painted colors that we see throughout the town function like pink pebbles in a dirty goldfish bowl.  It is a distraction that rapes one's senses.  It's like muzak in an elevator.  And by the end of the film like Giuliana we are suffocating from it.There's an incredible scene about twothirds of the way through the film where we escape with Giuliana in her mind to a dream world.  There the colors radiate from the shimmering sea and the sand and the sky.  And the surrounding hills have more sensuality and texture than the people in Giuliana's real world.   I'm glad that Antonioni gave us this image.  This film is certainly depressing yet it has balance.  There are few places left on this planet like Giuliana's pastoral island.  But the fact of that image gives us a glimmer of hope like Winston Smith and his journal in '1984'. Even if the only beauty that exists is in our minds that's something.I think this is definitely Antonioni's best film.  It isn't for all tastes but then the best films never are.".

	schema:headline " Sublime Monica Vitti shines in Antonioni's abstract masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's 1964 piece 'Red Desert' is on the surface a film that deals with the changing face of the world under rampant industrialisation but far more than that it's a comment on alienation and human adaptability in such a society. Guiliana played by Monica Vitti is the wife of petroleum plant manager Ugo. She lives in a spacious modern apartment with Ugo and their small son but there's an undercurrent of instability in Guiliana's persona a feeling of unease and angst that Monica Vitti exhibits in Guiliana's every action. Vitti's portrayal of Guiliana is one of a woman on the point of a nervous breakdown always fidgeting wringing her hands looking at unease and full of angst and continually walking away from conversations forcing others to follow her. The way her character hugs close to walls at every opportunity is allegorical of her need to be surrounded by friends family and loved ones claiming that she is only ill when I'm alone. We find out that Guiliana had recently been in a car accident and had spent a month in hospital being treating for shock but unbeknownst to Ugo Guiliana isn't adjusting well after her accident while her husband remains entirely oblivious. Into the frame comes Corrado Zeller Richard Harris an engineer friend of Ugo on his way to set up a new petroleum plant in Patagonia. Zeller is a quiet reserved man who like Guiliana is visibly at unease with his surroundings however his life and work afford him the luxury of moving from place to place while Guiliana feels increasingly trapped in her existence. Inexorably Zeller and Guiliana are drawn to each other Zeller recognising a kindred spirit of sorts and Guiliana casting out a cry for help that only Zeller is capable of recognising. The fact that Zeller picks up on this and is continually drawn to Guiliana despite her unstable demanding behaviour immediately points to his attraction to her but it's only after acting on his attraction that Guiliana comes to accept her station and encounters her defining realisation people aren't cured they adapt. But it's not just Guiliana's life she has to adapt to it's her surroundings beautifully brought to screen in what was quite surprisingly Antonioni's first foray into colour. With a telephoto lens to flatten the perspective framing scenes purposefully out of focus and the use of disarming longcut shots Antonioni paints a bleached and chemical picture of postwar Italy an Italy that expanded into an industrial superpower at an alarming rate. Antonioni was so adamant about how this world should be presented that he insisted on painting trees barrels walls and even whole fields to ensure the results he envisioned. An extreme measure certainly but a welcome one as the stark sterile greys of this industrial Italy juxtaposed here and there with flourishes of artificial manmade colour are often brought to the forefront of the viewer's mind when at times the pacing and ambiguity of the narrative create a lull in interest. Those manmade colours provide another allegorical point alluding to how the society of this industrial community has adapted to the bleak repetitiveness of the environment by injecting splashes of primary colour into their surroundings. One criticism that's easy to level at 'Red Desert' is that it's an entirely singular film  Guiliana is undoubtedly the protagonist of this piece but everyone else even the ambiguous love interest Zeller appears on screen barely defined. This might be a problem for anyone expecting a traditional narrative but that's not what 'Red Desert' is about. There's no real progression of story here only the progression of Guiliana's mental state everything else is quite incidental and as such is not admitted entry into Antonioni's vision. It's this bold vision that provides the films defining hallmark the wonderful cinematography that surrounds Monica Vitti's accomplished if somewhat overwrought performance.".

She's married to the manager of the factory. She is losing her direction and sinking into panic and despair. Her husband friends and even her little son are not enough for her to recover her sense of identity. She even tries an affair with a friend of her husband. Still....Maybe the story in itself would not be sufficient to raise one's interest but the way Antonioni tells it makes this film an interrogation mark concerning man and modern society. The bleak colors of the landscape mixing with the fog and the smog are a portrait of her and ours why not? loss of points of reference. Reality becomes mixed with dreams but not all of this is shown in the film. Some of it is implied. Some of it is shown  like when Giuliana Monica Vitti is with husband and friends by the sea and the fog slowly makes the others' faces look strange and nightmarish.Giuliana lives near the industrial concern managed by her husband  a small town in the vicinity a solitary sea a dock and some ships in it big chimneys expelling smoke and foggy nights  days complete the picture. Memories come and unfold  good and bad  some of them described in her own words others evoked by images and words that have the taste of a fairy tale. Insanity seems to be knocking at her door and life is so far away. Drifting with the wind and waves of life  if only someone could help her! Il Deserto Rosso flows in a natural way  we forget that we are seeing actors and become immersed in the film. Antonioni is a great actor's director and I think he knows how to extract the best from them.The DVD had a bonus where I watched the interview of Antonioni made immediately after the film's release. For my surprise he showed himself a simple kind of man. He didn't employ big words to define his film and revealed a sense of humor. This was the time during which Antonioni had a relationship with Monica Vitti a superb actress and in the few words he used he gave me the keys to his direction technique that is to create an ambiance where the actors can feel at ease let them feel their roles and make them give their best.Antonioni had their followers in Brazil too. The more remarkable of them was Walter Hugo Khoury that with Corpo Ardente 1966 made a Brazilian deserto rosso  a good film but far less good than Antonioni's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually I see a film and comment on it. If it is one I have seen before that comment has folds from my life and internal imagination. Every film I have seen builds that imagination in some way. A few are profound and some of those are knowingly so either me or the film knowing.I saw this a great many years ago when visual wisdom was less familiar and it had a great impact on me. At that time the intellectual economy was fueled by a sort of controlled French angst formatted for digestibility by young college minds. It really was so. Malick was one in my vicinity who could master a meal made of this without excluding more nourishing things but that is a different story than the one I want to tell.I cannot recall the year perhaps 1966 I saw this at the Orson Welles theater in Cambridge. Since then I collect the sounds of waves on beaches. I've travelled widely and for some reason have a near perfect aural recall of each experience of the watered desert. It is my primary anchor to the forms of nature.The shape of this film is an outer world bleaker than anything Lynch has given us. It is a beast of form factories that even today amaze me with their power. If this existed in Italy  which I have no doubt  then Soviet stuff is beyond my tolerance. Huge threatening forms seem created by gods to swallow color and thereby grow engulfing everything. Within this we have a sole conscious mind succumbing. We drift we succumb. The art here is homeopathic we are given an experience in color that has power not in brilliance but in what is not there what has already been swallowed. The cinematic vocabulary of form  three dimensional space  eating minds denoted by color... it is effective. This is Antonioni's greatest accomplishment I believe.Nested in this is an inner cinematic world an island not yet visited by the diseased lumbering ships that spew clotted filth. It is just starting to be explored by a keen clean sailing vessel. This is literally an island populated by a Miranda the young still vibrant inner self that remains of our onscreen body the woman we have besieged in the outer film.But this inner film is a contrast color abounds. The forms do not contain they rest. The colors have subdued and incorporated the forms that flow. In a subconscious way these informed my life as an architect first in form and later in more encompassing conceptual form. We have a newly adolescent girl on the beach experiencing rather than observing. Her own inner form hinted at futures in the same way that the outer film's colors hinted at rich pasts.And at about 122 in we have those waves. The filmmaker has not only manipulated contrasts in color and form but in the sound experience as well. At this inner beach the sound is lush hyper real. We have a few moments of the fullest life you can experience as we hear the smallish waves encounter the beach. May you enjoy and cherish these curated sounds.In most beaches each wave is shaped not by an encounter with the sand land but by an encounter with the preceding receding wave newly exhausted by its desires and reseeding a growing desire in the next.

	onyx:emotionText "Usually I see a film and comment on it. If it is one I have seen before that comment has folds from my life and internal imagination. Every film I have seen builds that imagination in some way. A few are profound and some of those are knowingly so either me or the film knowing.I saw this a great many years ago when visual wisdom was less familiar and it had a great impact on me. At that time the intellectual economy was fueled by a sort of controlled French angst formatted for digestibility by young college minds. It really was so. Malick was one in my vicinity who could master a meal made of this without excluding more nourishing things but that is a different story than the one I want to tell.I cannot recall the year perhaps 1966 I saw this at the Orson Welles theater in Cambridge. Since then I collect the sounds of waves on beaches. I've travelled widely and for some reason have a near perfect aural recall of each experience of the watered desert. It is my primary anchor to the forms of nature.The shape of this film is an outer world bleaker than anything Lynch has given us. It is a beast of form factories that even today amaze me with their power. If this existed in Italy  which I have no doubt  then Soviet stuff is beyond my tolerance. Huge threatening forms seem created by gods to swallow color and thereby grow engulfing everything. Within this we have a sole conscious mind succumbing. We drift we succumb. The art here is homeopathic we are given an experience in color that has power not in brilliance but in what is not there what has already been swallowed. The cinematic vocabulary of form  three dimensional space  eating minds denoted by color... it is effective. This is Antonioni's greatest accomplishment I believe.Nested in this is an inner cinematic world an island not yet visited by the diseased lumbering ships that spew clotted filth. It is just starting to be explored by a keen clean sailing vessel. This is literally an island populated by a Miranda the young still vibrant inner self that remains of our onscreen body the woman we have besieged in the outer film.But this inner film is a contrast color abounds. The forms do not contain they rest. The colors have subdued and incorporated the forms that flow. In a subconscious way these informed my life as an architect first in form and later in more encompassing conceptual form. We have a newly adolescent girl on the beach experiencing rather than observing. Her own inner form hinted at futures in the same way that the outer film's colors hinted at rich pasts.And at about 122 in we have those waves. The filmmaker has not only manipulated contrasts in color and form but in the sound experience as well. At this inner beach the sound is lush hyper real. We have a few moments of the fullest life you can experience as we hear the smallish waves encounter the beach. May you enjoy and cherish these curated sounds.In most beaches each wave is shaped not by an encounter with the sand land but by an encounter with the preceding receding wave newly exhausted by its desires and reseeding a growing desire in the next. It is a water to water rhythm of desire that incidentally involves the form of the beach.Not here. The waves are gentle enough to speak directly to the beach. We have not stirred the greater urges yet the girl is young  as young as I was being male. The caress of water on sand conveys the soft swallow of coarse sand pillowing and sucking the water.

	schema:reviewBody "Michelangelo Antonioni is often referred to as a director whose work is not for all tastes. Well what artist is? What the utterer of such sentiments usually means is that they do not 'like' his films because they are not filled with insipid action worse dialogue lack of character development etc. In fact some critics of Antonioni even claim that his characters are all warped and one dimensional loners potential Lee Harvey Oswald types bathed in depression and anomy. What this evidences is that the critic has not really watched the film or confuses a character that is confused with a confused portrayal of the character. Callow critics often mistake the thing itself for how it is presented. A good example of this tendency is Antonioni's 1964 film The Red Desert Il Deserto Rosso his first film shot in color.The film is lauded as a great example of the use of color or an expressionistic or impressionistic work of art apparently critics cannot decide again proving they do not even know what the terms mean but then dismissed as slow dull or that old stand by 'It's like watching paint dry.' Well only if you're an idiot or think that the lowest common denominator crap of a Steven Spielberg is somehow an example of 'genius.' As with Stanley Kubrick's later magisterial 2001 A Space Odyssey this film does not lack a narrative nor is the narrative poor. It is simply a different form of narrative and an outstanding example of such. Yet even The Red Desert's boosters often make the error of stating that Antonioni is 'more interested in shapes and spaces than character.' Not so for how those characters enter certain spaces what those spaces are and how they act and react within those spaces is essential to the story which is the depiction of how human beings react to the permanence of loneliness in the stasis of change. Although often lumped together with Antonioni's L'Alienation Trilogy L'Avventura La Notte and L'Eclisse this hour and fiftythree minute long film transcends those three because by film's end the protagonist has learnt how to survive and will. The heroes of the earlier films all flounder founder or despair at their plights.It is in fact a remarkable script penned by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra who also created great films with Federico Fellini and Theo Angelopoulos thus positioning himself as one of the greatest screenwriters in cinema history alongside Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen. And whereas the use of color is often lauded as 'beautiful' there is very little said as to why it's beautiful and that's not because of the colors themselves but how they contrast with the desaturated world the characters inhabit such as a fruit stand that appears early on in the film yet all the fruit appear grayish as if covered with a mold. The reason for this is that the world is being portrayed subjectively but from an objective perspective. This is so the audience can sense some of what Giuliana Monica Vitti is sensing without having to couch all of that in predictable point of view shots from her perspective. It is a technique that accomplishes what it attempts but so successfully that few viewers and critics seem to even realize this fact. there is no denying that Antonioni avoids cheap sentimentality but this lack only adds to the deeper takes that his camera eye allows the viewer. The characters do not willfully slough off emotions with ease as in so many wannabe droll Postmodern Hollywood takes think any Bill Murray film and character. Instead as in the best films of Stanley Kubrick and Theo Angelopoulos two other filmmakers accused of lacking character insight and narrative strength this allows Antonioni's characters to fully humanize not merely artificially preen before the camera. We see them think reject regret observe and many other things. While this bores some simply for the act of doing so to an astute lover of art it is how these things are done that matter not if they are done. And Antonioni does these things superbly making every glance facial tic sigh etc. count for something that is a throwaway in lesser films.If the 18th Century was the century where poetry was the dominant narrative art form the 19th Century was dominated by the novel and last century was owned by the film especially those of giants like Antonioni. What art form will take the mantle this century may not have even been developed but it will have a hell of a long way to go to match the greatness of a film like this for with each successive art form the complexity of the narrative increased even if poetry today is almost solely lyrical thus not even competing in the same area. The Red Desert stands not only as a triumph in the master's oeuvre to equal his other masterworks La Notte and Blowup but as one of the great films and art works of all time equal to the very best and superior to most be they the best plays of Shakespeare the best symphonies of Beethoven or the best paintings of Picasso. Trust me on this for time will avail both this work of cinema and my assessment.".

	schema:headline " Appearance of suffering";
	schema:reviewBody "I love Antonioni for these flickering realities. In Blowup he gave us memory as the chimera of the mind the formation of human suffering. Going backwards to The Red Desert I find that the mind hasn't been transcended yet nonetheless we get a beautiful paradigm on the acceptance of that suffering as a fundamental condition of life. This is not an ultimate reality but at least it's a first awareness of the appearance of suffering.We have the fragile erratic woman with the fractured soul as main character here learning to be whole again. Only Bergman had done this before but Through a Glass Darkly is literary and it pales when we see it next to the power of Antonioni's cinema. People like Polanski and Lynch would go on to make similar films with varying degrees of insanity permitted by surreal devices moving them inside the fracture the brilliance here is how the movie hops in and out of it swapping and shaping realities.This is true first in the marvellous embedded story the mother narrates to her little boy we see this unfold in her mind's eye not the boy's. The island world there is peaceful and contained sufficient and whole unto itself. Now and then mystery beckons and the girl in the story swims out to it but she doesn't lose heart when it eludes her. It's in the nature of things to elude us. I like how these mysteries are vaguely poetic a saiboat and an unseen song as opposed to the violent omens encountered in David Lynch.I discover this again in the bedroom scene where Corrado coerces a shaken Guiliana into sex a masterstroke by Antonioni because it's an uncomfortable coupling to see yet not vulgar or perverse. Guiliana submits to the sexual advances and for a moment the room turns inexplicably pink like the sand in the island of her dreams. The wonderful ambiguity of this is that it's never apparent whether the fantasy is where she flees for safety or if she permits sex in order to reach it. But that flight into imagination lasts only for a while and does not change the world the bedroom is still the same.I love how with hardly any consideration or concession made to how a story ought to be explained Antonioni sketches in a bleak barren landscape that serves as projection of tormented minds the traces of human souls aching for connection seeking a unity of bodies that soothes in the yawning nothingness of the universe. He does not wait for a god to make his presence felt or perceive the defeaning silence as proof of damnation but rather ushers his characters on a path towards self awareness.Guiliana's torment then begins with her false perception of the world. When she hears a scream that her husband didn't she's shaken desperate to prove it to herself unsure if she did hear a scream after all. Outside the cabin the mist hides her company from her eyes and she despairs more. In the mind's fixation to a world we think should be unchanging and always grasped the world itself begins to fade.When they finally separate Guiliana pushing him out because now she knows he can't help her knowing also that the courage must come from inside and that she must not cling to things or people to get through the day Corrado leaving with hardly a word knowing at the same time that he can't help her either it's like a firework of cinema.The final scene where Guiliana explains to her son about the poisonous yellow smoke and how the birds have learned not to fly there could be saying too much about her newfound awareness because we can infer it from the scene with the Turkish sailor but I like how Antonioni bottles the sentiment in a gentle metaphor. As humans we may be swimming alone in a sea of suffering but we can learn to tranquil the hand that makes it navigable.The one touch I have a hard time swallowing is that Antonioni doesn't trust us to understand who the girl in the hospital was making Monica Vitti tell us. Perhaps the film is enough of a drifting haze as it is and he wanted to drop an anchor there to make at least something certain.It's the acceptance of suffering as part of life that matters here for me how Antonioni makes cinema with it is only the masterstroke. As with films he made later his cinema is spiritually important to me because conceptual understanding of ideas he presents or the appreciation of the visual vocabulary which is rich in color and texture like few directors managed cannot substitute for the final tangible experience of living through it all.".

Now and then mystery beckons and the girl in the story swims out to it but she doesn't lose heart when it eludes her. It's in the nature of things to elude us. I like how these mysteries are vaguely poetic a saiboat and an unseen song as opposed to the violent omens encountered in David Lynch.I discover this again in the bedroom scene where Corrado coerces a shaken Guiliana into sex a masterstroke by Antonioni because it's an uncomfortable coupling to see yet not vulgar or perverse. Guiliana submits to the sexual advances and for a moment the room turns inexplicably pink like the sand in the island of her dreams. The wonderful ambiguity of this is that it's never apparent whether the fantasy is where she flees for safety or if she permits sex in order to reach it. But that flight into imagination lasts only for a while and does not change the world the bedroom is still the same.I love how with hardly any consideration or concession made to how a story ought to be explained Antonioni sketches in a bleak barren landscape that serves as projection of tormented minds the traces of human souls aching for connection seeking a unity of bodies that soothes in the yawning nothingness of the universe. He does not wait for a god to make his presence felt or perceive the defeaning silence as proof of damnation but rather ushers his characters on a path towards self awareness.Guiliana's torment then begins with her false perception of the world. When she hears a scream that her husband didn't she's shaken desperate to prove it to herself unsure if she did hear a scream after all. Outside the cabin the mist hides her company from her eyes and she despairs more. In the mind's fixation to a world we think should be unchanging and always grasped the world itself begins to fade.When they finally separate Guiliana pushing him out because now she knows he can't help her knowing also that the courage must come from inside and that she must not cling to things or people to get through the day Corrado leaving with hardly a word knowing at the same time that he can't help her either it's like a firework of cinema.The final scene where Guiliana explains to her son about the poisonous yellow smoke and how the birds have learned not to fly there could be saying too much about her newfound awareness because we can infer it from the scene with the Turkish sailor but I like how Antonioni bottles the sentiment in a gentle metaphor. As humans we may be swimming alone in a sea of suffering but we can learn to tranquil the hand that makes it navigable.The one touch I have a hard time swallowing is that Antonioni doesn't trust us to understand who the girl in the hospital was making Monica Vitti tell us. Perhaps the film is enough of a drifting haze as it is and he wanted to drop an anchor there to make at least something certain.It's the acceptance of suffering as part of life that matters here for me how Antonioni makes cinema with it is only the masterstroke. As with films he made later his cinema is spiritually important to me because conceptual understanding of ideas he presents or the appreciation of the visual vocabulary which is rich in color and texture like few directors managed cannot substitute for the final tangible experience of living through it all.";

Famously Antonioni had no qualms about using actors as mannequins in his meticulously created scenes but Vitti's committed performance puts too much trust in him. It's interesting to compare her performance to that of Julianne Moore's fine turn in Todd Haynes' Safe a movie with the similar theme of the psychological impact of modernity on an individual.

	schema:headline " Expressive Notions Of Human Nature";
	schema:reviewBody "The mental conflicts Giuliana has throughout Red Desert are shown by prominent uses of various colours to represent the notions of human nature. Blue is just one of these prominent colours. After walking up from a bad dream Giuliana begins to walk around her house in a daze shown through her movements and a piece of non  linear editing. The scene largely contains the colour blue on the walls and on the hand rail which Giuliana sits by. Blue is conveying her feelings of depression as she still suffers the effects of her accident. Once Ugo fully questions Giuliana on her reasons for her dazed state he begins to kiss her and act in a sexual manner. Again the colour blue plays a vital part in the scene as it represents the coldness of Ugo. He is only thinking of his sexual desire rather than fully understanding his wife's problems and does not even realise she is not seeking sexual pleasure at this point in time she is seeking emotional support. It shows how careless Ugo can be with Giuliana whose negligence is repeated on multiple occasions.Green is another dominant colour which features for different purposes. In Giuliana's introductory scene she wanders around the Industrial factory in a green coat. Though out this scene Giuliana acts bewildered as she looks at the workings of the factory and the smouldering waste it has left behind. Green is a colour associated with the environment which in Red Desert is clearly being polluted by Ugo's factory. Giuliana is the opposite of Ugo when it comes to the environment she is disgusted by the state of the environment around the factory. This is established through micro techniques. The eerie electronic score building up in intensity and the blurred vision from Giuliana's point of view gives an insight into her feelings of industrialisation destroying nature. There is also the non diegetic sound of a voice in an operatic tone whilst the point of view shot progresses. The true meaning of the operatic voice is not known till much later in the narrative when Giuliana tells her son a story about a young girl who lived on an island where nature had such beautiful colours and there was no noise. Giuliana concludes the story by stating the young girl began to hear a voice from the caves where the rocks were like flesh. The voice mentioned is the same operatic voice heard in the earlier point of view shot. The story is clearly shown to be an allegory for the destruction of the environment by the carelessness of human nature happening within Giuliana's world including Ugo's actions in his factory. To a lesser extent Green is also presented as showing the misfortune of Giuliana. As she draws closer to Corrado Giuliana discusses the experiences of a girl she meet whilst hospitalised. This 'girl' is actually Giuliana herself but is referring to the experience in such a manner as she is shamed by the experience. She tells Corrado how the 'girl' felt that her identity was lost and felt out of place. This conversation takes place in a room where Green is the prominent colour highlighting Giuliana's misfortune due to her mental trauma.Although the colour Red features less than other colours in Red Desert it is the dominant colour in one of the film's pivotal moments. Giuliana Ugo Corrado and a few acquaintances spend time in a shack. They eventually all relax in a small room with the colour Red on the walls. They discuss how Quail's eggs enhance sexual desire which results in gaining energy for intercourse. This leads to some of the group eating Quail's eggs to gain the mood for sex. This includes Giuliana who in digesting the Quail's egg spins around in a trance before enthusiastically stating I want to make love!. Red incorporates itself into two meanings in this scene. Red is commonly associated with love and lust which obviously takes place in this scene through the sexual energy between the characters. Yet it is also known as conveying death and danger which reaffirms the thoughtlessness of human nature shown in Red Desert. The eating of the Quail's eggs for their own desire is an act on the same scale as Ugo's factory polluting the environment as they are killing off further generations of Quails which means destroying another part of nature.Grey is the fourth and final prominent colour to express themes and emotions in Red Desert. In the scene where we are introduced to Ugo and Corrado they were walking around the factory observing activity. Grey surrounds their environment as operations continue. It illustrates the factory as a bleak and dull place which creates a negative atmosphere of the factory relating to the destruction of the environment adding emphasis to the pro  environmental theme of Red Desert. Later in the narrative Corrado visits Giuliana in her shop. Again outside the dominant colour is Grey as Giuliana has an episode of depression. She sits next to a stall consisting of Grey items and stares at her surroundings which included staring down the empty road the Greyness showing Giuliana's sadness which she is experiencing both visually and emotionally.All these colours which contain the themes and emotions in Red Desert show the wealth of expressionism that runs through the narrative. They bring to life the emotions of the characters as well as the atmosphere within scenes. Red Desert makes these emotions intensely visual for the audience which only enhanced the drama. Connecting the colours to the characters made for greatly active viewing thanks to the expressionism provided in each scene. Red Desert is a visual appetite for those who appreciate films of the artistic quality.".

In these modern times 1960s for Antonioni man is virtually alone without any form of support help or care. This is by far the most depressing lesson the movies have ever taught me and yet I seem to not care so much if only because I feel I do not agree with Antonioni nor am I interested in seeing a film on this subject again. Granted this is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made comparable to Days of Heaven and Barry Lyndon. Nevertheless despite its great ambitions to capture the existence of humanity amidst a backdrop of industry dirt and noise I cannot help but feel almost cold and indifferent. This has been a problem of mine since La Notte which by itself had some merits as it explored deeply the reasons for which marriages disintegrate. L'eclisse by contrast was terribly slowpaced incredibly languid in its story and quite ambiguous in its message. All of this is fine unless of course the director intends to send a clear message.I have no doubt Antonioni intended with these four films to capture the very mood in which most people felt in the 1960s and I feel he succeeded brilliantly... with L'Aventurra. By contrast these next three films simply labor the point. Sure they are different in exact plotting and setting but they all feature the same actress Monica Vitti with her stunning but remarkably cold eyes and desolate settings meant to convey to the audience the feelings of the characters. This is all fine but is it really necessary to say essentially the same thing four times in a row? Many will say yes but for me to see L'Aventurra was enough. That was a beautiful moving emotional film about these heavy themes. The same cannot be said for the subsequent three.".

Guiliana Monica Vitti a gorgeous neurotic chick staggers through her damaged life punctuated with individual graphic explosions as the backdrop. The guarded orgy scene is dated and silly. Much of the visual drama in this film must be due to the accomplished hand of cinematographer Carlo Di Palma as well as Antonioni. Although set in an industrial wasteland the film is a study of beautiful images on a monumental scale. Using a factory setting with an enormous steam vent early in the film Antonioni puts the actors so close they look almost frightened. I can imagine the director screaming at them Closer! Closer! Among other strong images are mountains of green glass jugs packed in straw. He even uses the Istituto di Radioastronomia Northern Cross telescope in Bologna so large we never see it entirely. Il Deserto Rosso displays Antonioni's visual poetry at it's best .".

Although my taste often runs to foreign language films I find myself siding with the average viewerwondering if there is any point to this film. And as I sit here and write my review I wonder why Antonioni would make a film that would have little if any interest to most viewersthough this can be said about several of his other films such as his inexplicable Zabriskie Point.The film is set in a toxic wasteland of a town. There is a huge factory there and almost everything is grey and dead. The water is a cesspool a boat arriving at the port has some sort of plague and yellow smoke is belched by the smoke stacks. It is truly an awful place. Giuliani Monica Vitti lives there with her son and husband and the camera follows her throughout the movie. She is bored and mentally ill and spends pretty much the whole film complaining about her life staring into space and questioning her existence. There really isn't a whole lot more to the film than that though Corrado Richard Harris pops in and out of the movie and sticks around long enough to have sex with screwy Giuliana.Overall this is a dark depressing and seemingly pointless film. Perhaps it is supposed to be some statement about life itself and interpersonal alienation though frankly I think this is ridiculous. Life is good and sweetand seeing an awful film like this seems like a waste of time.".

Guiliana is withdrawn has bouts of anxiety and paranoia. She had previously been in a car accident involving a van and been hospitalised for a year with serious shock. This role is played beautifully by Viti who had collaborated with Antonioni on his three previous films whilst she strikes the occasional contorted pose she uses her eyes majestically to portray a fractured anxious thought process. If her eyes are not frantically darting around encapsulating immaculate confusion then they are sunken glacial and permeated with sadness.Guiliana is married but on meeting her Corrado seems almost infatuated with her awkward unstable demeanour. They enter into a subdued affair that is restrained by her seemingly perpetual elusiveness. She is haunted by details  that we have no awareness  of the road accident. It could also be argued that Guiliana is affected by the surroundings she inhabits. The film is set in Ravenna an industrialised bleak landscape of factories chimneys pumping out fumes infecting the horizon with a dense fog. All that is left of the natural surroundings of field and trees is the barebones of rotten forgotten husks. The oncegreen grass churned into slurry. The infected waters yellow and frothing as the waves hit the poisonous rocks.This was Michelangelo Antonioni's first film in colour. The last in a loose tetralogy informed with themes of alienation in the modern industrialised world. Red Desert was preceded by L'Avventura 1960 La Notte 1961 and L'eclisse 1962. Whilst much of the landscape filmed here the overall effect of the visuals is astonishingly beautiful. These stark brooding images stay with you. Whilst the natural colours dissipated by the onslaught of industrial waste infecting the air are washed out by heavy pollution Antonioni lightly daubs his miseenscene with slight painterly strokes of colour often outoffocus across the composition with a massproduced object of manufactured descent.The theme of the relationship between the polluting element of the manufacturing industry with human emotion is open to interpretation in this film. Do we see these objects of consumerist desires that illuminate the screen with their intensely garish gauche fabricated colours as the fundamental fascination with the industrial age? Are we like Guiliana so totally absorbed by our modernist surroundings that we find solace in the objects that this modern industrial age has produced? Any film that is open to new ideas excites me. A film that can be represented with new adaptation of thought. Our understanding of technology and the changing face of industrialisationglobalisation will undoubtedly change as I am sure will the interpretations of this beautifully constructed piece of cinemaart.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

I would like to have it put in the Library of Congress. Shown in theaters like the THX sound check . Relationships are soul stealing ordeals that are best left hidden but Ah Lamour is brilliant. It's funny but the minimum number of lines for a comment is ten here on IMDb . That means I have to write almost more lines that the length of this film. Weighin in at around a couple minutes Ah Lamour is a power packed mini movie. After seeing it you will give up dating sex and having children. If bitterness is your fuel I highly recommend Ah Lamour. For stick figures the animation is actually quite brilliant. See it.".

The protagonist approaches several womengirls and gets rejected every time even when he does not even ask them out but just wants to know what time it is. And the ending is one that some people may see as slightly misogynist but I believe there is some truth to it. Then again Hertzfeldt is absolutely known for being always very much over the top in his films. That is just his style. And it is as unique as his animation. If you have seen another work from him you will immediately know who directed these 2 minutes here. And he actually included some criticism about his main character as well or males in general namely that he did not talk to the overweight unattractive girl but just passes her by. So both sexes are getting their fair share in a certain way. I believe Hertzfeldt improved during his career and this is not a contender for his best film in my opinion but it's still worth a watch. 2 minutes wellspent.".

As an Italian I know there is no acting involved here. She IS Italian. She reminded me of Anna Magnani in Bellissima there is not a single false note. Clint Eastwood clearly dedicates the film to her and the results are pure magic. The film is based on an unreadable book at least I couldn't get through it in spite of the brevity of the volume  the film however is bound to become a classic thanks to the powerful chemistry of the stars. If you love filmlike I do I recommend you to see it once and let yourself be taken away by the truths in Meryl's eyes then go again and take note. Look at every one of her moments from how she closes the refrigerator door to her laughter. Look at her reaction when she discovers that Clint stopped at Bari her home town just because he thought the place was pretty. Look at her hands her walk and then go back to her eyes. It's a treat of the first order. Clint in front as well as behind the cameradoes a miraculous job. I passionately recommend it no matter how young you are.".

Meryl Streep could never be Italian. Well there I was thinking and prejudging like people I detest. I was so wrong. Not just because she fooled me although there is no fooling involved here. She won me over. I forgot she was Meryl Streep the actress and I lived Francesca's story to the fullest because I suppose that's the mystery of great acting I was confronted by her sheer undiluted truth. The truth in her eyes in every one of her gestures. The truth on her brow. Her thinking transparent. Clint Eastwood does the right thing putting the entire film at her service and placing himself as the foil to liberate that powerful latent side of Francesca. I though it was ironic and I'm not sure if was meant to be that a wonderful woman like Francesca will sacrifice what could arguably be call the love of her life for those children. The grown children's mediocrity was kind of shocking to me. Will the revelation of their mother's secret reveal a latent greater side to their natures. I hope so. Francesca deserved extraordinary children. Try no to miss this little miracle.".

Even though Eastwood didn't write this Richard LaGravenese did it beautifully based on a novel by Robert James Waller he does a good job in front of the camera while also directing this human encounter between a photographer played by himself and an Italian housewife Meryl Streep magnificent in 1960s Iowa. Their four days together would change their lives forever. The premise doesn't sound too original but Eastwood wonderfully captures all the raw emotions between these people who seem throughly genuine alive and passionate. Lennie Niehaus' beautiful music score helps enhance the romantic atmosphere and the slow pace is never a bore since it's necessary to make you live those brief but special moments with them. From westerns to female boxers to jazz musicians to war dramas Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a good story and The Bridges of Madison County ranks among his best. 1010.".

Her opening scenes at the breakfast table are staggeringly beautiful it could have been a silent movie we would've understood and live Francesca's story just by looking into Meryl's beautiful face. Every laugh every move every nuance is so Italian and so real that I went to look up her background to see if there was some Italian blood in her. Apparently not but she reminded me of Anna Magnani and of my mother  she's Italian too so I should know. Clint Eastwood's performance is tender powerful and generous. I started going to the movies in the 70's and part of the fascination was to go and see movies with adults doing adult things behaving and reacting to life the way adults do. Five Easy Pieces Coming Home Sophie's Choice and then the old great old ones from Sullivan's Travels to All About Eve As a side note I should inform the decision makers that on my second visit to the theater I took five kids with me two 17 year old boys and three girls 18 16 and 16.

People who normally wouldn't read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the socalled intelligentsia. Personally I am inclined to think that its tale of middleaged romance struck a cord. It may not have been wellwritten but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss a Brief Encounter for the nineties. Still it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it yet here it is larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely utterly heartbreaking.Perhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men or are simply nonexistent yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn't entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He's not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just oldfashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course the 'romantic' in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film's beating heart.What is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood's film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and costar Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep's great performances. As Francesca the woman who finds in Eastwood's photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project her versatility doesn't always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly not just into the consciousness of her character but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy let me assure you it isn't. Cheesiness isn't in Streep's vocabulary even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller's novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever it's paid off. On screen The Bridges of Madison County is a great love story there won't be a dry eye in the house.".

So a film of the book 'The Bridges of Madison County' did not fill me with joy and pleasureable anticpation.Yet Clint Eastwood has waved a magic wand and worked wonders on the lack lustre source material by pairing it down to produce a beautiful warm film with only one real flaw more on that laterThe film's overwhelming main strength is the casting of Meryl Streep. As Francesca she dissolves into the role  at times her gestures and dialogue seem so natural and unforced it is as if Eastwood had installed a flyonthewall camera into the house of a real Iowan housewife. She lifts the film  which does centre on themes which could appear trite in the wrong hands  to the level of profound piece of art. Her selflessness and devotion to her family and tortured sense of divided loyalites are presented so powerfully and so plausibly that the final scene in the car at the end those who've seen it will recall immediately what I mean pulls at your emotions so hard you'd swear it was you who was making the decision. I defy anyone with a pulse not to shed copious amounts of tears at this point  you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved on some level by this great great performance.Clint Eastwood provides good solid support in the sense that he doesn't overact and allows Meryl to become the heart of the film. This is a wise decision  part of the terrible weakness of the book was its dependence upon the inane thoughts and ramblings of Robert Kincaid. The film is beautifully directed beautifully photograhed and beautifully scored  the radio tunes and the nondiegetic Bridges Love theme really enhance the romantic lush tone and mood of the film.My only problem is with the misguided decision to cast Francesca's older children and flash back periodically to them reading through their Mother's journals. The acting in these parts is mediocre at best and they detract from the elegance and poignant mastery of Meryl Streep's central performance. The ashes scene at the end is  I feel  necessary for closure but the rest of the scenes featuring the chldren should have been scrapped. The Francesca and Robert sections stand alone and require no interruption  these other segments cheapen the mastery of Meryl.Above all this is a film which on paper can be dismissed as pure soap opera. But it transcends these potentially trite themes to make a universal story of love selflessness devotion and choice that speaks eloquently to the viewer no matter what your age or experience. It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves yet again why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too  no other actress could have brought so much depth warmth beauty charisma and humanity to this character. As a humble film lover it's all I can do to applaud her from the depths of my heart. Bravo Queen Meryl!".

My favorite part of the movie was when Robert was leaving and the two cars were staying at the lamps one behind the other...it was a very touching sceneI think. So to draw the conclusionI can recommend to everyone to watch the movie THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because after watching it you're getting an other state of minda better onethat doesn't allows you to give up hoping for a better life...".

	onyx:emotionText "I've watched this movie yesterday evening and it had a great effect on me.In my opinion this movie is outstanding because it reflects an average lifewhich is then becoming a really extraordinary onerepresenting that everyone's life can change from one moment to the other.And I think this meaning tells something to everyonebecause everyone has dreams that seem that one can't fulfillbut this story says the oppositeso that at any time can come an opportunity that you have to recognize and be brave enough not to release.Another thing is that you may have to live your whole life in only four days and you have to be able to live it so that after it you can say that you had a really wonderful life. My favorite part of the movie was when Robert was leaving and the two cars were staying at the lamps one behind the other...it was a very touching sceneI think. So to draw the conclusionI can recommend to everyone to watch the movie THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because after watching it you're getting an other state of minda better onethat doesn't allows you to give up hoping for a better life...";

Behind it a dusty road leading through green fields a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge which startles her two grown kids particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...Late summer 1965 and Francesca an Iowa housewife in her mid40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid Clint Eastwood. Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk they seem uneasy at first  but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.So begins four days of falling in love four days of uncertainty secretive glances shyness turning to boldness feelings longburied in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay it isn't in Streep's accent which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point and it isn't in the framing story which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film which he coproduced and cowrote the elegiac Doe Eyes theme for in addition to directing and starring  even to me a big fan already at the time it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy but he's not schmaltzy a poetic man but not pretentious about it and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner but deep down there's something missing something we can feel almost from the beginning something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end and as he stands in the rain waiting and hoping at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.But as good as Clint is  and this is surely one of his two or three best performances  Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent  whether you like it or not it really isn't terribly important here  and you see a less mannered more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the makingof piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style but it does wonders for her giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction  it can't seem studied and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barnlike red covered bridges there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects  Jack N. Green's lovely SeptemberOctober photography and the wonderful Eastwoodchosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington among others  are just about perfect as well.What the film ultimately builds to  and much of it is on Streep's shoulders  is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done she's not going to beat herself up over it  and neither should they. At the end we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult would have involved hurting herself and others there's no easy answer only a bit of hope for the next generation as they at least have come to accept and understand and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....".

In all she has received 13 Academy Award nominations the most recent for her supporting role opposite Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper in the fascinating film 'Adaptation.'In 'The Bridges of Madison County' Streep stars as Francesca a conventional wife of an Iowa farmer...

She describes herself as happily married but nevertheless falls easily into a chaste but tender affair with a charismatic wandering photographer on assignment for National Geographic magazine in the fall of 1965... Robert Kincaid Clint Eastwood stops at Francesca's farm to ask for directions... While closeups provide Streep's intimate thoughts some women lost patience with her indecision and reticence...Francesca although nervous by the attention of the courteous visitor but guilty about being unfaithful to her passionless Iowa husband finds out a mystical attraction for the top photographer who has come to Madison County to take pictures of the local covered bridges... Francesca was at home alone her husband and two children having gone for four days to the Illinois state fair...Francesca and Robert talk about their lives and their old dreams and as their relationship grows they both find themselves drawn to each other falling deeply and immediately in love... Their true love strikes at the heart of everyone... 'In a universe of ambiguity this kind of certainty comes only once.'The suffocating rain sequence has to go down as one of the most poignant in cinematic history beautifully complemented by a soundtrack resonating with a melancholic piece of blues and piano... Every performance in the movie is backed up by a truthful believable script full of real everyday people... The poignancy of each moment is underscored by an unforgettable choice of romantic melodies... The motion picture nominated for the Csar Awards in France is another example of Eastwood's exceptional style as both a filmmaker and as an actor...As a filmmaker Eastwood proves his comprehension of the secret of romance novels showing sensuously and sensitively the way people feel and think when they are really in love... As an actor he is very convincing as the loner with much to share... Although his travels have taken him far across the 'other side of the world' he still looks cleverly back on his life...His film gives us the passion between two lovers but also life's compromises and regrets... It is a realistic portrait of a man and a woman who love the memories they share... It is a sensitive exploration of feelings which grows into something neither one can get free... It is an invitation to consider what might have been missed or lost in our life... Meryl Streep is heartbreaking as a lonely woman surrounded by family... We truly feel her pain and desperation... She fights with all the love hope frustration and responsibility... She is someone whose dreams of coming to America have not been fulfilled by the tedious reality of her life in Winterset Iowa... Her busy life is filled with details but has nothing that truly excites her anymore... She is forever altered by a chance encounter.. Her emotional range is enormous and her laughter is as charged with energy as her tears... But you never doubt the truth of what she's feeling... As the pair reveal their own lives through each other a connection is made and in just four fateful days they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart...We all dream of the chance meeting that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca couldn't stay together physically but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world...

To fall in love with some one in just four days is just wonderful to me. I watch it on Starz and it played everyday for a week and I watch it every day it came on. she was a strong lady to stay there and be unhappy for all of those years. It is simply a beautiful movie. I love the part when he was picking flowers for her and she told him that the flowers were poison and then she started to laugh that was hilarious to me. Because just in the few minutes she had know him he brought out something in her something that has not been released. She was more herself in this movie.I would surely recommend this movie to some one else.".

	schema:headline " A surprisingly sensitive film that Eastwood does well to keep away from the usual sentimental clichs of the weepy genre";
	schema:reviewBody "When Francesca Johnson passes away her grown children are puzzled to learn that she wishes to be cremated and her ashes scattered from a local bridge rather than being buried next to her husband. Their puzzlement turns to surprise and shock when they read their mother's secret journals and read about an affair she had had many years ago with a photographer who came to the area for a few days.I had seen this film many years ago in the cinema when it came out and had only average memories of it. With it coming onto TV recently I wasn't sure if I'd bother because I had the idea in my head that this was a rubbish weepy but decided to go for it anyway. I am glad that I do not just make assumptions about films based on genre because my memory had tricked me in regards this film and in fact it was surprisingly good. I'm not generally a weepy fan but this is not what you think a weepy will be. Reading the plot summary and watching the film itself it is clear how easily this could have fallen into sweeping sentiment and unbearable mush and it is to Eastwood's credit that it never does. Even as the plot sees the lovers falling into idealised romance the film never does and it is the cool calm direction that keeps it from being this way. Some will see this as 'excusing' the affair but I don't think it does  affairs happen because the grass is greener and that is just what this film does it seems romantic and idyllic but that's because it is meant to be. I'm the last person to try and defend having affairs but I don't think that this film did this but I can understand why people would dislike it for doing this.Without the mush what is left is a film that is refreshingly free of sentiment and is able to deliver a grown up romance that is genuinely touching. This is seen in the honest chemistry between Francesca and Robert sometimes things like this happen  two people just click nothing has to be massively wrong in the relationship for it to happen. The film avoids easy shots like making the husband be a real idiot and just tries to show us why these two fell for one another so quickly. It isn't perfect of course and it is still a weepy of sorts  some of the dialogue is a bit selfconsciously 'deep' for my liking but generally it was an adult telling of an adult romance  no corny ending no sweeping score or clichd effort to pump the audience for sentiment instead I found it genuine and as cold hearted a bstard as I am I was moved by the film.I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and this film was a real pleasant surprise as it showed how able he is as a director and performer. I have already praised his work as director but he also turns in an unshowy and natural performance in the lead. Streep has never totally won me over and I often felt that doing an accent is not the same as giving a performance. Here her accent put me off at first but generally she is good and shows suitable restraint in depicting her character. She suffers a bit from having to deliver a narration that occasionally contains sentimental dialogue but she does well despite this. The support cast is OK but really contributions from Corley and Slezak are no more than distractions from the main show which is a collection of natural scenes between the two leads and no one else.Overall I consider this film a reason to not just watch any specific genre of movie and reject films simply because 'those aren't my type of things'. I was pleasantly surprised by a film that is romantic without being sentimental or mushy idealistic without being unrealistic moving without being sickly. True it may not be everyone's idea of a great film nothing goes bang and there are no car chases but I liked it a lot more than I had expected and if you want to see an adult love story then you could do a lot worse than this.".

It also makes me feel really good to know that right now my wife is probably fantasizing about dumping me for some rugged exciting outdoorsy type.This is basically another Jack and Rose Titanic situation where the audience is deliberately kept from the reality of what would happen if these two shmucks really did get together. Namely Clint would dump Meryl when he got tired of having sex with her or Meryl would dump Clint when she finally figured out what a twit he was. Well it's nice to know that they will be stuck with each other for eternity  under a bridge of Madison County.".

Concluding you've found it after a 4day encounter is probably not the wisest decision you will ever make. It's an exciting escape but of questionable value upon which to build a relationship. In only 4 days they've already have two arguments. Francesca's family lets the door slam which bothers her but she takes no issue with Richard sitting at the dinner table and flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor. How long would that tolerance last? She plays Italian opera on the radio does such a station really exist in rural Iowa? which her children rudely change without even asking. Yet she doesn't seem to care that the radio plays light jazz not Italian opera when Richard is there. Richard helps her in the kitchen for probably a grand total of 2 minutes while she does all the prep cooking and cleanup. True love is blind I guess. A sentimental tale but not realistic.

The whole movie is completely enjoyable. What I mean by this is that the creators took the time to introduce the characters to us without hurry which helps us to become more involved with them later.IMDb suggests to its reviewers to compare titles with similar ones. In this aspect I want to say that I think as many persons do that this is one of the best romantic dramas of all time. I want to say too that it is both my favorite Meryl Streep and my favorite Clint Eastwood movie so far. IMDb also suggest reviewers to recommend similar titles to their readers in that sense my second favorite Meryl Streep movie is Kramer vs Kramer and my second favorite Clint Eastwood movie is Gran Torino and I am not sure if the third one is Million Dollar Baby or The Unforgiven. Sorry I still have no idea about which is my third favorite Meryl Streep movie too many movies too different from each other to choose from.OK about THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. Maybe its beauty comes from making an extraordinary love story happen to almost ordinary people. He is a photographer for National Geographic and she is and Italian immigrant born in Bari that lives in the county of Madison in Iowa USA. She is home alone while her family is away and he happens to arrive to her town to take pictures of the great bridges and landscapes. The story is actually told by the sons of Francesca the Meryl Streep's character when they find a letter let for them by her telling them their story. Its a narrative arc that makes you wonder how much people maybe YOU have met in life without really knowing them and their motivations for living. At the moment of making this review The bridges of Madison County is not included in the IMDb top 100 greatest movies of all time but I really believe it deserves a place there.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review by David del Real.

In reality her romantic interlude would have turned sour because it would not live up to her expectations in everyday life just as her idea of the American way of life didn't being married to an ordinary farming lad.As an Italian homemaker Francesca is stereotyped from the start as the opera loving romantic cooking breakfast for a largely unappreciative family in a mundane world which she once viewed through rose tinted spectacles whilst daydreaming back home in Italy.The film's message is that romance can be deceptive in that it misleads women into mundane lives that bear no reality to what they have been taught about it.

We are both in our seventies and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly reading these reviews in chronological order it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships we think.One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero but his wife gives it ten and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women.Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her afterdeath confessions to her children were wicked and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her where they could both then attend the graves of their parents if they so wished.As has been pointed out many times in these reviews Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust not love.Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in wartorn Italy. They probably got married in Italy and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive as on his deathbed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband.We give this film a rating of two because it has stimulated thought and conversation but to class it as a romance is absurd.".

I did not know what the film was about only read the rave reviews and spent my money on it. What a mistake. Meryl Streep plays bored Iowa housewife and mother Francesca who jumps in the sack with a perfect stranger after her husband and kids go away to the county fair for four days. Wow that's admirable of her! Gosh this story is so sensitive romantic poignant brilliant breathtaking beautiful timeless warm and fuzzy etc. Those are just some of the headlines here in these user comments. I'm not kidding. It brought many women to tears. Wow I just hope guys don't marry those women.To those people who think this is so warm fuzzy and romantic I wonder what your reaction would be if that was YOUR husband or wife cheating on you?I was sorry to see Eastwood and Streep be a part of this schlock.

	schema:reviewBody "While I don't condone infidelity affairs can make for great cinema. However not in this movie despite featuring two stars Meryl Steep and Clint Eastwood whose talents are wasted here. Streep's at times compelling performance is expended on a film which manipulates viewer emotions so they don't see this affair for what it is. It shouldn't be considered a great love story just because it's the wife who is cheating on the husband not the reverse. It is not poignant sensitive and romantic as often described but instead involves boredom lust and naive schoolgirl thinking far more than genuine love. Yes it does have wonderful cinematography but viewers shouldn't confuse the beauty of the Iowa scenery as indicating that this illicit relationship was in any way beautiful. When you get past the acting and the scenery...Here we have a housewife Francesca longing to travel and bored with her faithful hard working and decent but dull farmer husband and unexciting country life. While her husband is off at the State Fair with their teenage children she has an affair with a stranger who chances her way a ruggedly handsome world traveling photographer named Robert. She foolishly concludes after a few conversations and sexual encounters some of which occur in the marital bed she shares with her husband not exactly endearing that her new man a charismatic wanderer is her true love. Of course her husband 'doesn't understand her' but her lover who has known her for a few days is her soul mate who understands her completely. Would viewers be as sympathetic to a man whose wife didn't understand him who had an affair because he suddenly found his soul mate and contemplated leaving his family so he could go off with his lover to follow his dreams??? From the onset Francesca is miserable living in a house in the middle of nowhere but she has only herself to blame. Wasn't she aware when she married him that her husband was a farmer that they would be living in the country?? There would have been hobbies and interests she could have pursued even living in the country where she might have found some degree of fulfillment and which wouldn't have upset her husband especially given that her children were getting older all the time so likely to permit her more freedom. Francesca should have discussed her needs wants and dreams WITH HER HUSBAND! Admittedly he wasn't exactly sensitive but neither did he appear to be a monster who would have cared nothing about his wife's unhappiness had she made him aware of the full extent of it. She never really made much effort to open her heart up to him. While she did remain with her family playing the self sacrificing martyr and suffering for years in silence are not admirable IMO. She stoically 'did her duty' but never attempted to make anything better of her marriage.Who is to say that if she had gone off with Robert he wouldn't have dumped her when she started to bore him? Having one failed marriage behind him and a history of reluctance to commit he didn't come across to me as a very promising life partner. If Robert had really loved Francesca he would have thought of her best interests instead of selfishly encouraging her to abandon her children. The dancing scene where they end up in bed comes across as a clich seduction nothing original or memorable. The truck scene in the rain is supposedly so moving but how can anyone sympathize with a woman even considering leaving her teenage children for her lover of four days? Unwisely Francesca chooses to write a tellall journal about the affair to be read by her adult children after her death requesting that her ashes be scattered off a particular covered bridge to join her lover's ashes. I found this neither romantic nor touching but selfish and pointless serving only to upset and potentially hurt her adult children. If she and Robert genuinely had this great love surely it wouldn't have required some grand romantic mingling of their ashes off that bridge to prove it. Of course these children a rather uninspiring pair who contributed nothing positive to this movie quickly become understanding and are not as would be more believable devastated about their mother's infidelity and especially learning that their father wasn't her true love. In fact we're to believe this revelation actually helped them sort out their own romantic messes. The modern Hollywood message I guess.Had she not chosen to risk hurting her children with her afterdeath revelations I might have felt some sympathy for Francesca wasting so much of her life based on four days of the romantic exciting passionate early phase of a new relationship foolishly pining for a man who likely would have brought her unhappiness even if she had been free.Those who want a truly moving film about an affair should watch the 1945 Brief Encounter. It has class. Much the same idea  bored middleaged housewife has short term liaison with exciting new man but unlike this film the wife realizes what she does have in her husband and contrary to the clich about not being understood relates her tale as though addressing her husband the only person in the world who would understand. It perfectly contrasts committed married love versus the excitement of a new romance. And its heroine a very sympathetic character would NEVER have deliberately hurt her adult children for such a pointless whim as the ashes. Alas Bridges is no Brief Encounter.".

	onyx:emotionText "While I don't condone infidelity affairs can make for great cinema. However not in this movie despite featuring two stars Meryl Steep and Clint Eastwood whose talents are wasted here. Streep's at times compelling performance is expended on a film which manipulates viewer emotions so they don't see this affair for what it is. It shouldn't be considered a great love story just because it's the wife who is cheating on the husband not the reverse. It is not poignant sensitive and romantic as often described but instead involves boredom lust and naive schoolgirl thinking far more than genuine love. Yes it does have wonderful cinematography but viewers shouldn't confuse the beauty of the Iowa scenery as indicating that this illicit relationship was in any way beautiful. When you get past the acting and the scenery...Here we have a housewife Francesca longing to travel and bored with her faithful hard working and decent but dull farmer husband and unexciting country life. While her husband is off at the State Fair with their teenage children she has an affair with a stranger who chances her way a ruggedly handsome world traveling photographer named Robert. She foolishly concludes after a few conversations and sexual encounters some of which occur in the marital bed she shares with her husband not exactly endearing that her new man a charismatic wanderer is her true love.

Because of a few lines professing his what? Great opportunity? His good times with her? What he said was This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime. What was certain about it? Was it more certain than the wife he divorced without regret? Romance note before you trash your life such as it is and run off with someone who has managed to abandon one marriage and looks down on commitment in general AT LEAST know that he loves you! And if he really does he will NOT ask you to abandon your children!Another question What exactly did he see in her? What was so special and different to leave him without sense enough to come in from the rain? Are these two soulmates or is she just a woman who needs to feel loved and frustrated enough with her life to have sex with a total stranger. Was the sex sooooo life altering that he was willing to finally settle down? Passion and love let's not confuse the two one can last four days perhaps a week maybe a year... the other a lifetime. Sure drop everything and go... he's got nothing to lose while she'll lose what little she has. That is NOT romance it's sad. It's insulting. The more you think about it the more his certainty plays like a pickup line.And when did these DEEP LASTING emotions develop from the 3 or 4 conversations they had? While driving along in the truck? Or was it when they were soiling the sheets in the bed where she was to sleep with her husband? Which brings me to the issue of infidelity and the dim view of marriage in general? He doesn't seem to value it she suffers through it. In this lopsided romantic story there's scarcely a happy couple to be found let alone happily married one. As a GUY who LOVES romance please PLEASE do not accept this counterfeit tripe of an offering as real romance. Hollywood has gotten so lazy as to toss us a scrap and expect us to gobble it up as fillet! A man who asks a woman to leave her husband and her kids who are almost grown is thinking of himself. A REAL man and REAL love would offer to do whatever you wanted to make YOU happy. He would say I cannot bear to lose you BEFORE you had to have a conniptionfit in the kitchen. HE would be devastated on that last day BEFORE you served breakfast before you did anything and would take you by the hand and ask you to sit down and with a lump in his throat the size of Iowa look you in the eyes and ask What are WE going to do? THAT is romance. It's not a 4day teenage fling with older actors. It's nomatterwhat 'till the end 'till death do us part!HUSBANDS listen up! Your wives are quietly telling you something. Get busy and do your duty as a husband. Sure she's adjusted her life for you sometimes sacrificially but you are bound to do all within your power to see that she is happy and fulfilled!

Robert Donat is superb in his transformation from a good doctor to a money making doctor for the rich.

Robert Donat as Dr. Manson a highlyprincipled physician who struggles with the conflicting demands of his profession provides an uneven central performance.  It is sometimes hard to understand his motivations and this is the film's biggest weakness. Rosalind Russell does a fine job as his everfaithful often suffering wife. Her performance is perfect and does provide a moral core to the film. The film wisely avoids a lot of details of the novel that would have muddied up the storyline.  In the book Dr. Manson has an affair with one of society patients.  The film also boasts some fine performances from a very young Rex Harrison and Ralph Richardson.  In fact Richardson's role as an idealistic though flawed doctor steals the spotlight every time he is on the screen.  The film also has a great look especially the outdoor scenes of the British villages.".

Athough stylistically and culturally a world apart it is thematically a precursor of Mizoguchi's Sansho Dayu. Made in great Britain in 1938 its MGM backing certainly shows in higher production values than most home grown films of the period  and this in spite of much reliance on back projection of the sort that even the great Carol Reed could not always effectively disguise. One of Hollywood's top directors King Vidor invests it with visual quality and in a part that could have been tailored for Greer Garson Rosalind Russell makes a surprisingly convincing female lead supporting the hero throughout his tribulations with every ounce of Garsonian understanding he needs. But it is Robert Donat as the idealistic doctor who first tries his professional hand in the dark Welsh colliery valley that is the film's greatest strength. Here was an actor who brought a sense of dignity and integrity to every role he undertook from the earliest Richard Hannay to the Chinese nobleman in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness which he was brave enough to play when he was literally gasping for breath. His performance in The Citadel is not entirely free from clich but I imagine this was something imposed by the conventions of the period. How else to explain that when he becomes mean and mercenary he suddenly sports a very short and unsympathetic moustache which if memory serves me right miraculously disappears for the final scene of redemption. For the rest there is a galaxy of British acting talent to be found among the supporting roles with a brief glimpse of the dignified Nora Swinburne and a few more of a youthful Francis L. Sullivan doing his obese bigot stuff with rather less brains than usual. And as if this was not all there is Sexy Rexy Harrison gracing the Harley Street scene Cecil Parker playing a particularly odious surgeon who would no doubt be struck off the Medical Register if he were around today and the great Ralph Richardson investing the role of Donat's best friend with just about the right amount of Shakespearean rhetoric that the part will support. All in all a veritable treat provided you suspend just a little bit of disbelief.".

Fortunately six years later this wonderful film was made by King Vidor on a similarly critical novel by the English writer A. J. Cronin THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM HATTER'S CASTLE. Cronin usually was not like Sinclair Lewis a social critic  he was a general novelist. But in THE CITADEL he turned perceptive social critic. Like Lewis in his novel the society is just as guilty about the malfunctions of the medical profession as the doctors are. But here it was spelled out.Robert Donat is a newly trained doctor in England and he initially is quite the idealist as Ronald Colman was as Martin Arrowsmith. Donat's Dr. Andrew Manson tries to fight society for it's own good but finds it has a habit of hitting back at idealists. Soon despite the emotional support of his wife Christine Rosalind Russell Andrew discovers the pleasures of becoming a prosperous society doctor. He has such wonderful models before him  like Rex Harrison who talks of the heart of gold of his patients in reference to their bank accounts rather than their personalities Harrison in his autobiography REX admitted that he got into serious trouble with his personal doctor after the latter heard that line and confronted him at Rex's next examination. His best friend and colleague Dr. Denny  Ralph Richardson tries to get him to work with a set of idealistic doctors in making a first rate reasonably priced clinic for the poor and working classes but Donat rejects the offer. He also turns out to be cold towards the plea of the owner of an Italian restaurant for help for her little daughter although he is aware of an oddball genius who can help the girl with a radical surgery technique. It is only when a tragedy occurs that he is shaken out of his current complacency back to his duty as a healer.It is regrettable that ARROWSMITH was badly butchered in it's script and production but it is to be thoroughly commended that this excellent version of THE CITADEL exists to show how the first novel should have been handled.".

A lot of the same ground was covered before in Arrowsmith and would be covered again in Not As A Stranger and then in over a dozen or more medical drama shows on television. Stories about medicine and its practice is a genre we will never tire of.Robert Donat plays the idealistic young doctor who is assigned a number of positions in Great Britain and the story is how he deals with the various situations he encounters. Along the way he picks up a wife in the person of Rosalind Russell. For an American to review this film probably one should have a knowledge of the British health system and remember this would have been before the days of the current health system of socialized medicine. That system was put in before the post World War II Labour government changed things.One of his assignments is a coalmining area in Wales and Donat because of his own integrity and commitment manages to make a whole bunch of enemies and has to leave. His assignment is in what might be described as an HMO run by the coal miner's union. He starts doing research in a chronic cough he notices several of the miners have and upsets a whole lot of applecarts both with labor and management. He also isn't so easy with giving sick slips to malingering workers and they don't come to his defense. Not easy at times to be an idealist.For a while Donat takes an easy road in a wealthy sanitarium that caters to upper class hypochondriacs. Doctors Felix Aylmer and Rex Harrison are getting rich themselves off them. But eventually Donat finds his true calling in research.Rosalind Russell said that working with Donat was a pleasure but the film itself wasn't. She and Director King Vidor were the only Americans in this film and she and Vidor took a lot of criticism for taking jobs away from British players. Not like she had anything to say about it MGM loaned her out there. Still she did her job without a trace of a British accent.Besides Aylmer and Harrison other noteworthy British players in the cast are Emlyn Williams and Francis L. Sullivan. Williams is one of the local union heads and Sullivan is a blustering boorish lout of a miner who leads the opposition to Donat's research. All of them do fine jobs and Harrison got his first real notice by American audiences in his role.Because for two generations we Americans have been awash with medical dramas all these situations seem all to familiar to us. That's a jaded point of view. The Citadel is a fine drama and worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by a wider audience than it currently receives. The screenplay of The Citadel is excellent and deals with issues that have a continuing relevance today. Indeed its themethe importance of having a strong sense of vocation and integrity especially among medical doctors will probably always retain its original significance.Robert Donat plays a physician who starts out as an idealistic young man working in a poor Welsh coal mining district but after a series of disappointments he leaves and becomes a cynical member of a London clinic for rich patients practising the kind of assembly line medicine that is all too common today in many countries. It is likely however that the film had a definite influence in countries like the United Kingdom and Canada which developed publiclyfunded medical plans after World War Two.But even the best universal health care systems can still be prone to such problems as inequities in the availability or quality of treatment and incompetent or uncaring doctors interested only in making money. Moreover the issues of professional ethics individual conscience and personal commitment are applicable to many other occupations as we've recently seen in the cases of corrupt corporations such as Enron which have also abused people's trust.The other main virtue of this film lies in the acting of Robert Donat. Sir Laurence Olivier once stated that Robert Donat would have been a greater actor than Olivier himself was had it not been for the chronic asthma that plagued Donat throughout his life and ultimately killed him. That terrible respiratory illness may have inspired him in The Citadel to give one of the most sensitive and moving performances I have ever seen on film during the scene in which Dr. Manson gets a baby thought to have died to breath again. Donat's complete mastery of what the legendary Konstantin Stanislavsky called temporhythmn gives a palpable urgency to this scene that is unforgettable. Watch his delicate and expressive use of his hands while he works to save the infant he's holding. These are the hands of a great actor giving life to a scene and at the same time the hands of a great doctor giving life to a child.This is acting of the highest order and if you want to see what the real Stanislavsky Method and not the inferior misinterpretation of it by Lee Strasberg was all about Donat's performance in this scene remains as magnificent a demonstration of its goal of emotional truth as I have ever witnessed in many years of watching theatre and film. The rest of his performance is equally brilliant. The changes in his face perfectly convey the degrees by which the former idealist becomes a jaded opportunist and then. . . Well I don't want to be a spoiler and give the whole story away! I highly recommend The Citadel to anyone who enjoys films that have real meaning or who appreciates the true and truthful art of actingacting that is so brilliant and free from any trace of mannerism and artifice that we forget we're watching acting at all. We're seeing life and art unfold together. Thanks to the talent of Robert Donat form and content become one his concern with integrity and the film's concern with it simply merge into an inseparable artistic unity. This is a cinematic experience that nobody should miss.".

Moreover the issues of professional ethics individual conscience and personal commitment are applicable to many other occupations as we've recently seen in the cases of corrupt corporations such as Enron which have also abused people's trust.The other main virtue of this film lies in the acting of Robert Donat. Sir Laurence Olivier once stated that Robert Donat would have been a greater actor than Olivier himself was had it not been for the chronic asthma that plagued Donat throughout his life and ultimately killed him. That terrible respiratory illness may have inspired him in The Citadel to give one of the most sensitive and moving performances I have ever seen on film during the scene in which Dr. Manson gets a baby thought to have died to breath again. Donat's complete mastery of what the legendary Konstantin Stanislavsky called temporhythmn gives a palpable urgency to this scene that is unforgettable. Watch his delicate and expressive use of his hands while he works to save the infant he's holding. These are the hands of a great actor giving life to a scene and at the same time the hands of a great doctor giving life to a child.This is acting of the highest order and if you want to see what the real Stanislavsky Method and not the inferior misinterpretation of it by Lee Strasberg was all about Donat's performance in this scene remains as magnificent a demonstration of its goal of emotional truth as I have ever witnessed in many years of watching theatre and film. The rest of his performance is equally brilliant. The changes in his face perfectly convey the degrees by which the former idealist becomes a jaded opportunist and then. . . Well I don't want to be a spoiler and give the whole story away! I highly recommend The Citadel to anyone who enjoys films that have real meaning or who appreciates the true and truthful art of actingacting that is so brilliant and free from any trace of mannerism and artifice that we forget we're watching acting at all. We're seeing life and art unfold together. Thanks to the talent of Robert Donat form and content become one his concern with integrity and the film's concern with it simply merge into an inseparable artistic unity. This is a cinematic experience that nobody should miss.";

But after seeing The Citadel i'm starting to rethink King Vidor. Indeed i thought Our Daily Bread a very fine film certainly from the standpoint of direction. But what Bread lacked in the two lead performances which are quite corny and camp has been perfected in The Citadel where we are given two marvellous performances from Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell. And i didn't have the same feeling about Vidor's messagemaking in Citadel that i did in Bread. It is more subtle in Citadel and also for a better cause altruism in the medical profession a very noble thing as opposed to socialism the subject preached about in Our Daily Bread. But now i've started thinking this about VidorHe was a passionate artist  how much do i prefer this to someone like Rossellini who didn't think much of movies or someone like Bergman who often he can be optimistic depicts human nature as an empty valueless abcess. The fact that he expresses such strong messages and that in fact he has something that he finds of value is immensely reassuring. I get so used to railing against preachy filmmakers that i seem to equate nonpreachiness with cynicism and even nihilism. Well one doesn't have to dispise everything to make a wonderful film which is what Vidor has done here.Everything works in The Citadel. It draws you very nicely without pomp or flashiness but with immense skill into its environment and what a lovely environment it is. You so badly want nothing bad to happen to earnest idealistic young doctor's assistant Dr Andrew Manson. I hesitate to use the word perfection but there is a real perfection to this movie. And i was more than a little bit moved by it. I really enjoyed it i just thought it was wonderful. Mr Vidor really was a king.".

The contrasts between the poor living conditions of the working class Welsh village he initially serves to the opulence of the high  society aristocrats who seduce his ideals largely out on the golf  course are well brought out by director Vidor but above all else he's aided by a top cast on top form. Donat effortlessly moves from youthful high hopes and spirits! in the company of Ralph Richardson especially the drunken comedic scene where they blow up the sewers to ward off a typhoid risk to lazy disaffectation in the company of the ever  urbane Rex Harrison with equal elan. Although his role is speechy at times he is always convincing and believable. The afore  mentioned Messrs Richardson  Harrison show their already established talents in contrasting roles and Russell is youthfully radiant as his supportive wife. Illness was to deprive Donat of making the most of his talents but just consider the disparate movies he adorned of those he managed  Goodbye Mr Chips The Thirty Nine Steps and right at the end of his life The Inn of the Sixth Happiness.

It can give us a dose of social realism such as Bicycle Thieves the post World War II Italian film or as in this film exhort us to improve the human condition.In this movie medicine is subverted for personal gain and social status. The theme of the movie is not about medicine per se but about values. In this case the ethics that certain professional people adopt when they make their way in the world.

Vidor makes not only extremely effective use of his natural locations and sound effects but leads a fine cast to deliver some really stirring performances. Donat as usual is marvellous. His impassioned final plea before being kicked out of the medical profession for his ideals is one of the film's high points. Also strikingly impressive are Rex Harrison as a rakish moneymad bedsidemannered rogue and Cecil Parker as a venally incompetent surgeon. It would be churlish not to commend Penelope Dudley Ward who makes something human out of the flashy Toppy Leroy and serves as such a delightful contrast to Rosalind Russell's realistically dowdy schoolteacher of a wife. Nor must we forget the forceful cameos supplied by Francis L. Sullivan Emlyn Williams and Joss Ambler.

He comes to his senses and saves a child ballet prodigy only to be accused of assisting an unlicensed doctor.

While important to the story Rosalind Russell's stint here as the wife is clearly secondary this is Donat's film from beginning to end nevertheless she does well. A key player here who does not get enough screen time is the wonderful Ralph Richardson as another small town doctor who maintains his principles throughout. Rex Harrison is just right for his part.There was really only one criticism I had of the film  the ending. I often think films end too abruptly and this is one of those.

	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin's last picture is a film with many faults yet it's not as bad as often claimed. I've seen it many times myself. Here is my opinion of itOne of the most important flaws is the miscasting of Brando. He seems ill at ease. Thus Loren has to carry the film virtually alone. The whole structure of 'Countess' is not well balanced. There's too much simple visual comedy for a romantic comedy and vice versa. The plot is thin It's supposed to be simplistic. Also the score is at times muddled as previously introduced dramatic themes come and go without any reason see and hear Hedren's first appearance. The film is also a bit overlong.The good things There are points when the music is up to Chaplin's usually high standards Cargill's comedy scene storm theme. Cameo appearances are nice. Direction is more focused and production values are certainly superior to A King in N.Y. Yes I believe that what is often described as Chaplin's 'flat' direction due to a lack of skill is an artistic style by choice. Simpleness is not the same as unskilfulness. For instance during the dance scenes the camera movement following actors is subtle and economically made. You'll notice it if you watch them in fastforward.And if one may feel disappointed at the film on the whole there's at least a very beautiful poignant and simple ending that is in my opinion the best of any Chaplin film I've seen. Its every element is in place.Therefore it's a rather mixed bag of a movie most suitable for Chaplin fans and very interesting as a curio at least.".

Excellent acting going on here.It is dull to start with static camera like silent films stagy and obvious studio sets but by the time the sea sickness scene came along I was laughing and drawn in. The post marriage bedroom scene is funny.There is a scene at the bar with Sydney Chaplin Charlie's son where he tries to distract Michael Medwin where Sydney looks amazingly like Charlie in attitude and timing  but this is probably due to diligent direction by his father.A really nice theme music from Charlie again. Yes it is old fashioned a filmed play was absolutely released in the wrong decade with the wrong leading man but does show some of the Chaplin traits and even perhaps genius certainly his humanist philosophy in the treatment of homeless or stateless persons.A real shame it was so savaged by critics at the time and disappointed him in his old age.

The film is strange as it is in modern colour with good picture quality but the sound and dialogues as well as being poor acoustically are reminiscent of the 40s or 50s but obviously in keeping with Chaplin's style. I have always liked most of Chaplin's talking films but it is the quality of his musical scores that really get me. The score from Limelight and This is My Song which comes from A Countess in N.Y. are absolute masterpieces of Romanticism. Lovely !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a pretty poor reputation and in some ways it is deserved but I also wonder if maybe the reason critics were so hard on the film was because they expected too much from director Charlie Chaplin. It was the last film he directed and in this sense it is a disappointment that he made such an ordinary film. But if they had thought that the director was Homer Noodleman or Myron Lipschitz would they have been so hostile towards THE COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG? The biggest problem about the film is probably the choice of stars for the film. While Marlon Brando was brilliant in some films he also often acted well outside his rangethis film is a great example. He just isn't a funny actor no matter how much he tries in the film. The part appears to have been written for someone like Cary Grant or David Nivenbut not Brando. And Sophia Loren while not as badly miscast also really isn't in her element. Also Chaplin himself only appears for a few seconds and I am sure many were disappointed at only seeing this ever so brief cameo.Now as for the plot I read one review that said this film was made in the wrong decade and I agree wholeheartedly. The movie looks much like a romanticcomedy from the late 1930s. This isn't really a criticismmore that this film would have played better and been embraced more in this decade instead of the more jaded and hip 1960s. I'm sure than many potential viewers were turned off by it being a movie for their parents.Unfortunately the film apart from these minor criticisms wasn't really a bad film. While not the perfect culmination to his career like it would have been if LIMELIGHT had been his final film Chaplin had nothing to be ashamed of other than miscasting.".

The style and sense of humor is not fitting for a 1967 movie and everything feels terribly out of place.Despite that the movie is far from an 'horrible' one it still is a disappointing last movie for Charles Chaplin who directed produced wrote composed and acted in this movie. His wonderful comedy career deserved a more worthy last movie. It's sort of ironic and maybe even sad that man to blame for the failure of the movie is Chaplin himself. What ever made him think that an old fashioned story and style of filmmaking would make a successful and good movie? Had this movie been made in the late '30's or '40's the movie would had felt more right. Everything than would had more sense and everything in the movie would had connected better to each other. The style of filmmaking and the story itself simply work too old fashioned for an 1967 movie. As a result of this the story feels childish and throughout its running time mostly not funny enough. This movie was made in the wrong decade.But there are more problems with the movie. Another one of those problems is Marlon Brando. Of course he's a great actor and without doubt one of the very best of all time but I'm sorry he just wasn't much good as a comical actor. He doesn't seem at ease in most of the comical sequences and he just feels totally miscast. Sophia Loren on the other hand is fine in this movie as is Tippi Hedren. Chaplin's son Sydney Chaplin also plays quite a big role in the movie and he plays a surprising pleasant character who gets more important in the movie as the story progresses. Charlie Chaplin himself also shows up in a very small role. Another very pleasant cameo is by Oscar winning actress Margaret Rutherford. The scene with her is perhaps the very best of the entire movie. The rest of the characters and actors just seem pointless and don't really make a lasting or important enough impression.So does the entire movie to be honest. It feels like a pointless movie that doesn't add anything and has no surprises in it or reasons to make this movie a mustsee. No not even for the Brando Loren or Chaplin fans. This movie is certainly not one of their best moments out of their long careers and none of them really make a wonderful shining impression in this movie.Sure it does have its moments but overall it's filled with too many old fashioned sort of comical situations that are too often stretched out for too long and too much. As a movie it's entertaining enough to make it worth your time but as a comedy it really isn't good or funny enough to consider this movie a great or really memorable one.I agree with Quentin Tarantino on this issue see My Best Friend's Birthday this is not Charlie Chaplin's finest moment.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Fun family fest for Chaplin's final film";
	schema:reviewBody "Movie goers film critics and people in general have at least one tendency that often clouds our judgment. It's called stereotyping. In this case it seems to be a consensus of many in all three above groups that Marlon Brando was miscast as Ogden Mears in A Countess from Hong Kong. And apparently to the detriment of the whole film. But was he? Or have many people viewed this film bitten by that stereotype bug that can infect our brains? Marlon Brando  the serious actor! The master actor of dramatic roles! How could he be any good in comedy? He doesn't even know how to smile or laugh!Well after seeing this movie I have to think that Charlie Chaplin knew full well what he was doing. Even if the critics of the time and many viewers then and now can't see it or appreciate it. Chaplin the comedy genius and supertalented actor writer and composer did not just put out a flop for his last film. He managed to do another very clever funny and entertaining piece of the milieu in which he excelled. No it's not his best but it fits nicely with all his other films in the better category.Countess has a good serving of wit and sight gags  two hallmarks of great Chaplin comedy. Not as many as in The Great Dictator Monsieur Verdoux or A King in New York. But his inimitable style for simple yet sophisticated comedy is stamped all over this film. Others have commented on his musical mastery and a little history behind this film. Since much criticism is aimed at Brando and his part I'll just dissect that a bit. Brando's role was the perfect straight man for this scenario. Only he doesn't have one joker buffoon or eccentric sidekick. Rather he is the central character that several others play off of in comedic interplay  mostly light but at times very funny. His serious side is exactly what is needed to make the rest of it work as it does. Some have noted that Cary Grant or Rock Hudson would have been more natural in this role. Sure they would have added their amusing bewildered or befuddled expressions to the dialog for good laughs. And their characters would have been more in tune with that of the countess. But I don't think that's what Chaplin had in mind. Remember  Ogden Mears was prominent in political circles and feted as ambassadorial material. So Chaplin wanted a real person from real life to put in this role to add a sense of sharper contrast to the humor of the plot. I think Brando was his pick for that reason. And I think it works well. All we need do to thoroughly enjoy this film is cast aside any preconceptions we may have about who can play what type of roles. Then sit back and watch this film as it is. And enjoy the wonderful Chaplin wit. As for the family fest  his son Sydney did quite well as Harvey one of those who played nicely off Brando's straight man. And daughter Geraldine was among the club dancers early in the film though without any lines. Charlie's two cameos were nice the latter very funny where the chief steward himself was fighting seasickness. All in all those of the Chaplin clan made nice filler for his last film.".

It is an often bizarre but strangely appealing film that doesn't work either as a comedy nor as a love story Sophia Loren plays the little tramp just like Chaplin would have done it thirty years earlier and Brando gives the most unusual and maybe worst performance of his lifetime. The supporting cast though is magnificent Patrick Cargill steals every scene he's in as Brando's kinky butler Hudson Margaret Rutherford does a heartbreakingly funny cameo as an old lady mistaken as Miss Loren Geraldine Chaplin appears briefly as a detached society girl Sydney Chaplin and Michael Medwin prove their comedic skills and Charlie himself tops it off in a oneminuteshtick as a seasick steward.The secret star of A Countess from Hong Kong though is Tippi Hedren in her small role as Brando's snobbish wife who gets dumped for the whoreCountess. She is icier prettier and even more sophisticated than in her two Hitchcock movies. To me her Martha remains one of the best performances she gave in her career.Brando and Loren. One of film history's most famous cases of miscasting! As a pair they just don't match there is no spark or affection or whatever between them. Unfortunately this was supposed to carry the movie for two hours.Universal tried to tighten the illfated comedy by shortening and redubbing it for the video release it's now 103 instead of 118 minutes and some other actors dubbed some of Brando's and Hedren's lines but this only made it worse and almost unwatchable. I was fortunate enough to watch the unedited version of the film a couple of years back on TV and I kind of liked it even though I noticed its shortcomings.One of the biggest mistakes I think lies in Chaplin's script itself. Apparently he wrote it in 1931 as a vehicle for himself and his thenwife Paulette Goddard and didn't change a single line when he shot it 35 years later. This among other things makes A Countess from Hong Kong look strangely oldfashioned and out of time. It might not be everyone's cup of tea and it failed miserably when it came out but it's one of the great sick films and definitely worth a look.".

I have watched it several times and admittedly don't regard it as Chaplin's best work but it is far from a bad film. For 1967 the film would have been old fashioned but surely that means that 40 years later in 2007 the film should be even more old fashioned but it is still an enjoyable film. The bedroomfarce which is what the film mainly focus around even gave me some big belly laughs. When the doorbell rings over and over again which finds even Marlon Brando's character hiding even though he is supposed to be in the bedroom got me laughing more and more each time it happened. The film also has a love story which develops throughout the film although not realised to near the end. Chaplin himself makes a small cameo as a seasick old steward which is one of the funniest highlights of the film. The music score itself is a reason to watch the film  one of the theme songs 'This Is My Song' reached number 1 in 1967 when sung by Petula Clark. If you are a fan of Chaplin then definitely see A Countess From Hong Kong because it is his final film because it is his first film in colour because Sophia Loren and Sydney Chaplin act extremely well and aspects of Chaplin's performance style can be seen in them. Fans of Marlon Brando don't bother watching although he does have some OK moments. All in all not a bad film but not a brilliant film but not bad for a director aged 77.".

	schema:headline " Farewell to Chaplin";
	schema:reviewBody "Although he tinkered with an antiwar comedy in the last ten years of his life Charles Spencer Chaplin's last motion picture was this film A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. It was not the most dismal one of his career  A KING IN NEW YORK had that melancholy distinction. But A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG is almost as bad. The distinction between the two is a minor one A KING was made out of anger  Chaplin had been proud of his adopted country the United States but after 1936 he felt increasingly alienated from it. A multimillionaire his antiNazi stance was not popular in many quarters among isolationists in the late 1930s and his left of center view on labor's rights did not sit well either. J. Edgar Hoover put him on a list of suspicious foreigners to watch. Then came his paternity trial which left a sour taste in his mouth the scientific evidence against paternity was rejected by the jury. His change of direction with THE GREAT DICTATOR and MONSIEUR VERDOUX lost many fans who could not understand why Chaplin had to turn to monsters like Hitler and Landru in his movies. Then came LIMELIGHT where he seemed preachy and too full of pompous philosophizing. And then when going back to Europe on a trip the third rate Attorney General of the day McGranary pulled his passport and refused to allow him to return claiming he was a Communist. This and the McCarthy period's blacklist made him disappointed and bitter  and he used A KING IN NEW YORK to pulverize the defects he now found in American society. Some of the bitterness is still obvious in A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. The key to the plot is that Marlon Brando who comes from a prominent American family like the Rockefellers or Kennedys is about to get an important diplomatic post which may lead to bigger political prizes read the White House in a few years if he behaves himself and returns to his icy wife Tippi Hedrin. Anything after all for political success in Puritanical America. Brando is almost willing to do it but he is taking a boat to Hawaii to meet Hedrin who is coming from the states and while on the boat he meets Loren. Loren is the title character a Russian aristocrat who lives as a callgirl in Hong Kong and has stowed away on the boat. She had met Brando at a party before the boat sailed so she is sticking close to him and his aide Sydney Chaplin.Chaplin apparently planned this film in the 1930s which would have made more sense  downattheirheels Russian aristocrats were more notable in 1937 than in 1967.

	onyx:emotionText "Although he tinkered with an antiwar comedy in the last ten years of his life Charles Spencer Chaplin's last motion picture was this film A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. It was not the most dismal one of his career  A KING IN NEW YORK had that melancholy distinction. But A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG is almost as bad. The distinction between the two is a minor one A KING was made out of anger  Chaplin had been proud of his adopted country the United States but after 1936 he felt increasingly alienated from it. A multimillionaire his antiNazi stance was not popular in many quarters among isolationists in the late 1930s and his left of center view on labor's rights did not sit well either. J. Edgar Hoover put him on a list of suspicious foreigners to watch. Then came his paternity trial which left a sour taste in his mouth the scientific evidence against paternity was rejected by the jury. His change of direction with THE GREAT DICTATOR and MONSIEUR VERDOUX lost many fans who could not understand why Chaplin had to turn to monsters like Hitler and Landru in his movies. Then came LIMELIGHT where he seemed preachy and too full of pompous philosophizing. And then when going back to Europe on a trip the third rate Attorney General of the day McGranary pulled his passport and refused to allow him to return claiming he was a Communist. This and the McCarthy period's blacklist made him disappointed and bitter  and he used A KING IN NEW YORK to pulverize the defects he now found in American society. Some of the bitterness is still obvious in A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. The key to the plot is that Marlon Brando who comes from a prominent American family like the Rockefellers or Kennedys is about to get an important diplomatic post which may lead to bigger political prizes read the White House in a few years if he behaves himself and returns to his icy wife Tippi Hedrin. Anything after all for political success in Puritanical America. Brando is almost willing to do it but he is taking a boat to Hawaii to meet Hedrin who is coming from the states and while on the boat he meets Loren. Loren is the title character a Russian aristocrat who lives as a callgirl in Hong Kong and has stowed away on the boat. She had met Brando at a party before the boat sailed so she is sticking close to him and his aide Sydney Chaplin.Chaplin apparently planned this film in the 1930s which would have made more sense  downattheirheels Russian aristocrats were more notable in 1937 than in 1967. But the script was never acted on. My guess is that it was really just a passing fancy and that it lacked the thought that went into CITY LIGHTS or MODERN TIMES or VERDOUX.

Probably he could have gotten by in comedy had he stuck closely to some of the dramatic images he created maybe so maybe not. But in A Countess from Hong Kong Brando is doing a part that Cary Grant or Rock Hudson would have fitted in nicely but is an absolute disaster with Brando. I wonder if Chaplin tried to get Hudson or talk Cary Grant out of retirement.On the other hand Sophia Loren as the mysterious Countess who's among the flotsam and jetsam of refugees in Hong Kong without any official status anywhere. She says she was a countess back in old mother Russia she is a prostitute in Hong Kong. Whatever she is she's perfect.A night of entertaining a party of wealthy Americans including Brando finds her stowing away on his ocean liner bound for Honolulu. Brando maybe unhappily married to ice princess Tippi Hedren but married he still is and about to be named U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Don't want any scandal where those people are concerned. And Tippi's coming to Honolulu to meet up with him.Stuff that Rock Hudson could have handled that Cary Grant could have phoned in lays like a lead balloon in Marlon's hands. It's a comedy that just ain't funny around him.Best performance in the film Patrick Cargill as Brando's valet Hudson who is asked to perform some unusual service for his boss. Some might even call it a dream assignment.I will say this among his other talents Charles Chaplin was a great composer as well and the number This is My Song comes from this film. He composed the soundtrack for the whole film and did a fabulous job.If he had only cast the male lead better.".

In the case of Charlie Chaplin he did his usual auteurtouch writerdirectorproducercomposer in this case no significant acting on a story that was more or less a trifle. If he had made another movie before he passed on a great one perhaps then it wouldn't be too much of a problem. But the pounding that critics gave him for 'Hong Kong' was pretty voracious making it probably moreso about him than the actual film as he had taken so long as he had since City Lights in making a movie that in truth wasn't to his usual standards. Some of the criticisms aren't totally fair i.e. directing style is tired and others are i.e. Brando was miscast. It's very problematic but at the same time it has moments that hint at the joy that Chaplin could conjure and it shouldn't be completely disregarded as a disaster or trainwreck.Is it dated? Sure. Chaplin sticks to oldfashioned filming techniques however not too turgid or unwatchable as far as studio movies go from the period and attitudes between men and women almost despite the innuendo thrown in like in the scene between Loren and her husband in the bedroom with his peaks behind his covers. The premise is simple as is usual for the director an ambassador Brando is en route from Hong Kong and a stowaway'countess' Loren stays in his room. He keeps it all quiet and despite being something of a stuffshirt is generous bringing her clothes however not fitting and food and in the meantime as he tries to figure out how to get her to US shore without a passport they fall in love. This last part falling in love is predictable and clich and doesn't even quite work because of the short amount of time and razorthin line between the two characters getting on each others nerves and feeling genuine affection.To say that Brando was miscast goes with saying something else other actors could have played his part probably better but at the least he does try his hardest to fit into this kind of stiff repressed kind of turn and in a sense does a good job if looking past his usual bravura being absent in place of what is required. It's just well compared to his best work that he falters here. Loren does a little better albeit with only a little to do really with such a twodimensional character with only vague plans once reaching American shores. And people like Sydney Chaplin and Tippi Hedren make their impressions on screen but only for so long. And sadly a lot of jokes Chaplin hoped would probably hit off well like the seasick bit or the repetitive better hide! moments Loren has to do to not be caught fall flat. Only a few really catch on like the scene where the old lady the 'other' Natascha is greeted by flowers and chocolates from a wrong admirer or some of the scenes with the 'fake' husband and his idea of consummating the marriage.These flaws pointed out it isn't very dreadful an experience and sometimes it's fun seeing Brando and Loren in their personality tugofwar plus the cheerful and usually spoton Chaplin score. It's worth watching once... if not for more than that. It's a sad way to go but it could've been worse. 5.510".

The next morning he discovers Natascha hiding in the wardrobe in his cabin having decided to board the vessel as a stowaway to escape a life of prostitution in Hong Kong. Ogden discovers that he has been appointed new American ambassador to Saudi Arabia a position he suspects will further alienate him from his estranged wife Tippi Hedren. More immediate in his evermounting problems however is the fact that Natascha is an illegitimate passenger on the ship with no official passport or papers who must be hidden at all costs.

Looking beyond the oldfashionedness A Countess From Hong Kong is put together quite professionally  it looks sumptuous and is handled with complete competence throughout. The most negative reviews hammer the film as if it is some sort of epic turkey a display of utter ineptitude which it really isn't.

Aside from this the film has other flaws. However these could be overlooked by the fact that this is Chaplin's final film and it should be viewed historically. While it's no GOLD RUSH or CITY  LIGHTS let alone MONSIEUR VERDOUX or LIMELIGHT it still has its moments. With stars like Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren maybe audiences were expecting too much then and still are now.".

I have read in a couple of Brando books that critics of the era ripped this movie calling it oldfashioned saying that film comedy had passed Chaplin by etc. etc. The tension on the set between Brando and costar Sophia Loren and perfectionist Chaplin was also well known. The film also bombed at the box office. Plus I read on the message boards that Quentin Manos Tarantino doesn't think much of this film either. Given all this baggage I expected to see an insufferably unspeakably awful film that should have been burned before release.I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't as bad as all that. In fact I didn't find it so bad at all. I didn't laugh out loud to be sure but I did smile at several comic moments. I liked a couple of sharp lines as well for instance when Ogden Brando says he wants to quit politics and find something else to do his assistant tells him he could do murder rape arson. There are other more respectable professions. Clichd? Maybe but a funny one. To be sure there were a few oldfashioned bits such as when Sydney Chaplin for no discernible reason sits next to a guy in a bar and splashes a drink behind his ear. Then when the guy is distracted S. Chaplin takes the guy's drink and swigs it down looking very much like his father as he does so. There also seemed to be one too many moments of someone's at the door! Hide Natatsha! That joke kind of wore thin by the end. Still I thought Brando and Sophia Loren did their best and were fun to watch. All in all I thought it was a pleasant fun movie and enjoyable.

Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable but it's only one taste bud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves.There's pretty much zero laughs the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly the chase scenes are visually unwatchable it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre.Fortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess.I tried my best to enjoy the film but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.

In the film Hawke plays a former NASCAR driver whose wife is kidnapped by some maniac on a phone Jon Voight. This maniac forces Hawke to drive all over the place cause large amounts of damage and it's up to the poor viewer to figure out why. GETAWAY is without question one of the worst movies of the year. It takes elements of SAW TAKEN and DRIVE and puts them in a blender but the end result is just downright horrid. The most shocking thing is the fact that director Courtney Solomon has made one of the ugliest more boring action pictures in the history of cinema. He has bragged that no CGI was used in the car stunts but it really doesn't matter if it's true because the scenes are so poorly shot and many times it's just one second clips with quick editing which is just annoying. The entire visual style of this picture seems like some kid got ahold of some editing equipment and didn't know what he was doing. While watching the picture I couldn't help but think of the director and editor in the editing room giving each other high fives and saying awesome nonstop. Another problem is the dialogue which is just downright horrid and it's amazing that actors like Hawke and Voight can keep a straight face while saying it. The performances are even worse with Hawke sleepwalking through the role and every scene just seems like he's wanting to walk away from the camera and go home. Voight pretty much gets to do nothing except talk with a funny accent and this adds nothing to the picture. As for Selena Gomez I've seen her acting ability before and it's the time I saw a dead goldfish sitting at the bottom of its bowl. GETAWAY doesn't have a single thing going for it but my expectations were low going in. I just never could have imagined that a major studio would release a picture like this into theaters. I'm sure even the lowstandards of Cinemax would have turned this thing down.".

The whole reason I went to see this movie is to see some kickbutt car cinematography but there is better free content on youtube that I could have watched to whet my appetitelike Ken Block's gymkhana series or vintage rally Bgroup footage. To say that I am disappointed would be a lie I had a feeling this movie would be a dud because they hardly marketed it at all and released at the end of summer which is always a bad sign. Ethan Hawke's performance may be the only redeemable part of this movie as I could really tell he was working hard to make the 11th grade level dialog work. Selena Gomez's acting was predictably subpar it seems to me the only reason she was included in Getaway was to get guys my age into the theater. And if the two other dudes in the theater besides my friends and I are evidence it didn't work. In short don't waste your time on Getaway watch The Transporter or Top Gear instead to get your gearhead action fix.".

But Getaway has been so poorly received unjustifiably so in my opinion that I thought I'd weigh in.This is a popcorn movie. Nothing more. I understood that going in. It's not high art. It doesn't revolutionize moviemaking and is not even the high point of the genre. But it's entertaining and that's all I ask of a movie. Give me some popcorn and a Coke and dim the lights let me forget about the world for a couple hours and I'm happy.The two leads are very good in my opinion. Ethan Hawke is a very capable actor and he brought a depth to his character that I didn't expect. He expressed concern without being overly dramatic or gnashing his teeth or chewing up the scenery and conveyed his character's limitations without appearing dumb. Selena Gomez was bright and had the expected attitude of someone her character's age without being precocious or annoying.Most of the plot was admittedly easy to figure out early on but the movie still provided plenty of excitement in how it got there. There were some aspects of the story that were dismissed without explaining a lot of detail but it didn't rely on otherwise smart people doing dumb things to make it all work and I appreciated that as well.I've read criticisms by others concerning the shakycam technique during the chase scenes. I didn't find that to be a problem in the least. It was much less annoying or even apparent than in movies like Transformers. I found everything was easy to follow and served the story well  I didn't think any style choices got in the way. And there was one streetlevel point of view sequence that I thought was especially well done  presumably a single take  that gave me a real rush.Overall I enjoyed Getaway but that may be in part because I went in with low expectations due to its opening weekend box office and some negative reviews. With stiff competition this summer there are certainly better choices for your entertainment dollar. I don't know if I'd even consider this in the top ten or twenty films this year. But for cheap ticket at a matine or secondrun theater or later as a rental it's an entertaining diversion.".

I wish I could take that back and do something else instead like sleeping than watching this piece of garbage.The film has it all. From clich action sequences and bad acting. Selena Gomez gave the worst performance in her career ever. Playing as The Kid she's so annoying and horrible that she deserves her Razzie nomination. And why did Ethan Hawke accept to play in this movie? He could have been chosen a better role.Overall Getaway is a horrible film. It's a mess and a noisy action flick. I will give this film a score of 1 because there's nothing good to watch this film. It's just a completely nuisance.".

I read a few of the reviews on here prior to watching this then scanned the next full page and saw almost all 1star or 1starbutwould've givenzerostars etc. So not the highest expectations. Plus I'm not super big on just watching cars drive around especially a Ford. I'm not that big on fixing my car every other week either so there's that.I also saw someone saying that the only reason I'm watching this is to see Selena Gomez. Well I have no idea who she is so I'd have to say that assumption was incorrect. The name rang a faint bell but that's about it apparently she's one of those Disney slaves or was until recently. Following that I noticed a disturbing amount of stuff about her sexuality and whatnot. I looked up her age and I believe it was like 19 it was yesterday and I didn't really care so I could be wrong. Maybe 21. So what the hell guys? I'm only in my late 30's and I think she's too young. Slightly chubby face looks like she's still got baby fat. Frickin' pedophiles man. No wonder most girls are all whacked out and paranoid about men. As Louis CK said men are the number one danger to women and ours was heart disease I believe. Anyway there's that spiel. If you watched this just to scope out some barely legal Disney actress then you may want to see a psychologist. And yes I wouldn't be surprised if she's encouraging this sort of thing. Morality aside it is profitable.Well none of that really matters cuz I doubt this movie is going to do much for her career. Did I like it? No can't say I did. Was I miserable and bored the whole time? No not really. It wasn't a great movie but by today's standards it was fine. Like Fast and the Furious wout the gratuitousunnecessary booty shots and homosexualMr. Potato Head star. I watched Death Race once too. Same basic circumstances bored and too lazy to find something else to do. I'd put them at about the same level. Ethan Hawke does fine. He looks out the windshield he shifts a lot not that it seems to effect the speed of the vehicle at all and he treats his costar way better than she deserves.Yes her part is lame. It reminded me of that James Bond movie where Denise Richards was supposed to be a nuclear physicist even though her hooters made it physical impossible to use a microscope or see a keyboard or anything. You're supposed to believe she's this tough chick who can drive fast isn't afraid to bust out her gat and that she can hack or whatever they call it. Just doesn't sell it. They should've used whoever that girl was in Death Race or something. Selena Gomez is basically jammed into the movie wno finesse. I guess she acted okay. Well not really. Was pretty bad sometimes. Just totally miscast.The rest of the movie? Eh all right. Nothing great but I took a little time to see what people who voted this down liked and couldn't really make any sense of it. Usually I see BS reviews in favor of the movie. But here there's so many universally bad reviews that I gotta wonder. Then again why bother undermining a movie that went ahead and did all the work for you anyway? I dunno.The only part that left me incredulous was a POV sequence near the end. I don't care how beat up the Mustang was or that it was made by Ford and therefore doomed to failure there's no freakin way some SUV could outrun it. And not only that the SUV had more hp and recovered from stops quicker. Maybe Ethan Hawke is just a crappy driver. Maybe that's the point of the movie.Oh one more thing. I will give this movie props for not trying to pretend it was in America or something. I've noticed a lot of lower budget movies will film in some Eastern Bloc country I believe do to incentives and being relatively inexpensive comparably. The second Ghost Rider movie much worse than Getaway comes to mind.Yeah it wasn't a good movie. But it wasn't that bad.".

The Angles the camera work inside the car and outside and these different angles possible. There's really nothing more i can say.

	schema:headline " A glint of really good amongst glaring really bad";
	schema:reviewBody "I want to say right off the bat that I won't be bashing Selena Gomez. Not as a person anyways. I think to hate a film because of a former teen star that you find irritating is childish. This film has a disgustingly low rating currently on IMDb and its 99 due to the fact that grown adults think its cool to bash on a teen star. I caught this on opening day just wanting to see something at the theatre and this was the last thing left to see. I was not disappointed that I saw it. It was mostly brainless action that I could sit back and veg out and just enjoy a pure popcorn flick. Now that being said there was some serious misssteps in the course of this film. Fast and The Furious fans can rejoice because I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie with this many car chase sequences. There were simply too many and they didn't really differ from one chase to the next. It got to the point where our lead would turn a corner and be confronted with more cop cars and I sort of groaned aloud thinking...here we go again. But I understand that there was NO CGI used in the film and they actually carried out the wrecks and chases and for that reason I give them big kudos. There was also one very cool first rate top notch chase scene that I think was nearly brilliant. It was near the end when our hero is chasing down our main villain. There is what felt like a five minute scene from the perspective of the car in a high speed chase. There was no voice over nothing to distract just a racing car from that perspective. It was brilliant and I felt myself pressed into my theatre seat feeling the adrenaline. This is sort of the good of the film. I will in a moment cover the bad because there is some bad.Ethan Hawke is quite good in a role that is very stereotypical. There is really nothing new to his husband pushed to his limits to save his wifefamily. He has a particular set of skills that he's good at. We've seen it before and its slightly tiresome. However Hawke carries his own and is good in the role. Now we have Selena Gomez. She did okay...very okay. Honestly her role wasn't necessary. She was a distraction and some of her line delivery felt forced. Her character was meant to be a sarcastic lively spark plug so to speak and sometimes she pulls it off and sometimes it feels like she's straining to fit into the character. I honestly think that is because the character feels so out of place. The chemistry between her and Hawke is not romantic by any means but more of a friendship bond under the circumstances and its okay...better than I expected. It isn't great but its okay. I knew Jon Voight's voice right away and what a great villain he was. I mean not only does he have only a fleeting scene on camera but his voice was perfect and menacing and he did more acting with his vocal scenes than Hawke and Gomez combined. He is obviously an acting legend for a reason. I thought his character was terrific.The story has a fair mystery that unravels at a good speed. It isn't the smartest storyline but it is interesting. You sort of see the twists coming but it still a decent story. I thought the entire villain angle was very clever and I quite enjoyed his anonymity right up to his last scene. Director Courtney Solomon has very few credits and experience to his name. This absolutely shows in this film. The editing should have been tighter the chase scenes more diverse characters retooled to be less predictable and more interesting. It is a very sophomoric thriller. I suppose they figure it will be Gomez's teen fans will be the ones to carry the film hence that feel to it which is unfortunate. I mean I had modest expectations going in and how could you not? I never understand people that rate a movie so low as though they expected The Godfather of films. This provides exactly what you would expect and delivers decently. No one will ever say what an amazing film it was and yet it is entertaining. Turn your brain off get some popcorn and just watch it for what it is. 710".

You sort of see the twists coming but it still a decent story. I thought the entire villain angle was very clever and I quite enjoyed his anonymity right up to his last scene. Director Courtney Solomon has very few credits and experience to his name. This absolutely shows in this film. The editing should have been tighter the chase scenes more diverse characters retooled to be less predictable and more interesting. It is a very sophomoric thriller. I suppose they figure it will be Gomez's teen fans will be the ones to carry the film hence that feel to it which is unfortunate. I mean I had modest expectations going in and how could you not? I never understand people that rate a movie so low as though they expected The Godfather of films. This provides exactly what you would expect and delivers decently. No one will ever say what an amazing film it was and yet it is entertaining. Turn your brain off get some popcorn and just watch it for what it is. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie. Granted I only watched it for Selina Gomez but after I watched it I was amazed. The acting is great you can really see the fear and the excitement of the actors faces. When an explosion happens or a car nearly hits them you can see the fear and surprise on the two main actor's faces. The car chases are fast and very realistic. Lots of cars hitting other cars. Though the number of times they avoid the police chasing them and the routes that take to avoid them is a little unbelievable. The relationship that develops between Selina and the male actor is interesting. The development of a relationship under extreme stress was well acted and very realistic. So other than the sheer number of times they avoid the police and some of the ways they do so this movie was very realistic and believable which is very important for me with regard to an action movie. There is not gore or explicit violence but there are car chases explosions avoiding the police an abduction and some gunfights make the PG13 rating accurate. Altogether a very enjoyable movie I would recommend to anyone who likes action movies".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start from the top. This movie is called Getaway. The trailer features a number of cars doing back flips bouncing off of each other and various other types of vehicular carnage and very little else besides a wisp of a plot thread involving a man his kidnapped wife and flying around Bulgaria in a stolen Shelby Mustang being directed by a voice on cell phones. So you go to the theater and the entire movie is set up in the first three minutes. The man gets told his wife is in mortal danger if he doesn't follow instructions to the letter steals the car and basically floors it for the next 90 minutes or so. The cast list on here gives a name to exactly two individuals. Everything else is generic Kid Thug Man Voice Plausibility therefore doesn't exist. Reality doesn't exist. Common Sense doesn't exist. Most of the reviews seem to think the script is lacking. To a point it is sorely lacking in a number of departments. However if you don't know what you're in for within that first 3 to 5 minutes you're really watching the wrong movie. It delivers exactly what a movie with this trailer and title and set up should. Lots of stunts lots of vehicular destruction and very little plot. The actors do not have a lot of help from the script which seems to always be trying to set up the next load of driving stunts instead of character development. You get bare outlines of the two actors with the most screen time and very little else. However because it's Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez they do their best with what is given. Mr Hawke is a reliable presence and Ms Gomez I think has a bright future assuming she stays clear of Lindsay Lohan territory. Yes the script is lacking. Yes the plot has cavernous holes in it. Yes the twist ending may leave you with the proverbial OH COME ON!! sort of feeling. But this isn't an awards season kind of movie. Take it on its own terms and it's a fun ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "For car racing lovers Paul Walker fans what have you look no further than this movie. The photography from inside the car looking out is great like at the start where you almost feel you're in the passenger seat part of the exciting adrenaline ride you're about to take. It just won't let up too. Here you're guaranteed one hell of a ride and that's exactly what you get. From it's beginning we are thrusted straight into action of the story with no turning back. With the recent disappointment that must of been widely shared for people who saw the trailer for Vehicle 19 then saw that film they'll be well compensated here. I didn't expect to see this much drive time in this not so happily received flick. What we got here is a situation movie more the norm today where we learn of the why's later on as in Vehicle 19. The story set up is good may'be a little hard to swallow. We got Hawke a former racing car driver back in the actors seat again. His wife's been kidnapped as he's forced to play along stealing a sports car and doing all the exercises that is asked of him otherwise his hot wife bites the bullet. Only it's Selena Gomez's car ohhll scary! sarcastic note a present from rich Daddy who owns a big insurance banking enterprise. The voice sending out the demands to Hawke via a radio that's been installed in this car sounds totally real this isn't a man you wanna cross. I never made the voice for that of Jon Voight. I was thinking more along the lines of Armin Mueller Stahl. As a actress. Selena Gomez doesn't really impress me and she does little here except bitch and moan while just adding scenery. It's Hawke's on the edge performance that compels us a truly believable performer. Now to the movie itself where again reality takes a backseat as if sacrificed. Going through crowded parks ice rinks without hitting anyone defies logic and in many other obstacles too shown in the film. It only works in the movies. Why add more complications if wanting to stay on the path of reality. Oh yeah I forgot to point out a few cameras have been installed the car so like Hopper in Speed our ingenious nutter Voight here sees what the two are up to 247 Gomez sometimes giving Voight a piece of her mind as well as the bird to a trucker they almost collide with. The standoff between a brigade of police cars and Hawke ends all too easily. He puts a gun to Gomez's head threatening to kill her and within thirty seconds all the cop cars back away. What an unreality? Wouldn't happen. The cops wouldn't give in that easily. And Hawke hardly put a gun to her head for about 2 seconds. No convincing act. So why did they back away so quick is my question to you. Because it's movie and they didn't want to rock the boat of the story with more complicated plot. Adrenaline junkies of racing films will absolutely love this. It is non stop action my hat going of to the photography and camera work second to none.".

And yet every turn of events leaves a much bitter taste on her. It seems like if tears were a permanent mark of every Russian woman like if by definition no woman would dare to call herself Russian without ever tasting the bitterness of life.Ryazanov is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors. Though here I may be coming late since he actually achieved fame and glory during Soviet time a long gone era. Anyway his Zhestokij Romans or A cruel Romance tells a tale which seems to me timeless.Consider the plot of a very beautiful young woman whose life ahead is full of promise.. But consider also that this girl's life is actually torn apart by events which seem apparently out of her immediate control like if fate was conspiring against her at every other corner. Even her mother willingly or not at some point sells her though like every other mother she blindly believes doing what's best for her daughter's future. Zhestokij Romans is sinonimous to drama just watch the final scene which is so powerful telling and poetic...I especially enjoyed the Gipsy scenes. All that dancing joy and vodka were very moving in this film. Just as Yugoslav director Emir Kosturica has immortalised the Gipsy people i.e. Underground we also see in Zhestokij droves of joyful Gipsies carrying everywhere they go that sound which is at the same time melancholic and joyous. Some other scenes reminded me of Svadba Pavel Lounguine a film which also features lots of partying and rivers of vodka despite the imminent disgrace and bitterness of life. I even found some parallels with Luna Papa another film from the former Soviet republics in which a young and pretty girl has to rapidly mature and leap from childhood into adulthood.The Gipsy scenes also served as a very effective contrast between joy and doom. While they kept dancing tragedy was occurring elsewhere. It's like they say one man's happiness is another man's suffering.That's why I consider this movie to be Timeless. That's why I consider the last scene a gem of cinema like anything I've seen before. Our lovely Larissa is embarked in that permanent quest for real love and affection.".

Intrigues now start since certain other men who have eyes on her cant process the thought of losing her to an ordinary post office man.Brilliant acting great story when you have a chance go see this movie you wont regret it. 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll try not to spoil the plot for anyone especially since while you will guess the direction in which the fate of the heroine is moving you won't guess the final resolution till the last moment.What makes this masterpiece so rare is the confluence of four exceptional artists which allowed unprecedented blending of music into a thriller with well developed characters. Not as a background but as a part of the story. Let's just say that if you skip the lyrics you won't be able to follow the motivation of main characters. This is what allowed it to stand the test of time. I watched it 27 years after it was made and it is as fresh and vibrant as if it was this year's production.First of the four is of course Ostrovsky who wrote a thriller with character development and emotional story that will keep you guessing to the very end even after you know each character it's motivation and sometimes even fate. It's close to knowing that is Titanic going to sink but you can't stop watching since it's the how and fine grained aspects that really matter.Even without the other cinematic elements the play itself would make for a good movie but for director Eldar Ryazanov this is just the beginning. Ryazanov is the principal artist here who takes the credit not just for the exceptional blending of music but also for making the actual big river Volga and an old steamboat integral parts of the story and metaphors. One can easily imagine Missisippy and Jazz instead of Gypsy music or Danube and a Strauss waltz band without any change to the story. He made conceptual structure completely universal while keeping the full flavor of the old Russia.The composer Andrei Petrov is the next artist equally responsible for this rare blend and not just the instrumental part but also vocal actual poetry used for lyrics and the stylization and blending of Russian Gypsy music.Last but not least  Nikita Mikhalkov as the male lead and the heart and soul of the ensemble who managed to combine tragic comic and even musical aspects in impeccable performance with surprising facial and physical acting capabilities.This is the ensemble playfilm meaning that most actors had to work hard to make their characters alive but female lead Larisa Guzeyeva  deserves special praise for effective blending of dramatic and musical aspects doubling up as narrative. Also there are virtually no precision cutting tricks director cutting into replicas to make it look like less capable actors actually played emotions and transitions. Scenes are mostly filmed in long shots with minimal editing. Just that aspect provides the quality an order of magnitude above a comparable Hollywood production. It's not that it's not doable but that the cost of production would be prohibitively high to reach that level.And in the end I will say      this is one of the films to keep and watch again every several years. Like the big river it constantly flows and is constantly fresh.".

At this time there were 3 classes the nobles peasants and the emerging raznochintsy class. Many of the characters in the film are from the latter and the focus upon wealth and social status is apparent. In summary this is a great film which really shows the changing social structures of the 1850s Russia. I would highly recommend this film to anybody interested in romance or Russian history.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface this movie looks like it's possibly just another romantic drama about a girl and her suitors but take a look again!! There is much more to this precious film than meets the eye. For starters our lead lady Larissa appears to be every guy's dream girl. She is beautiful graceful has a soothing voice and has different males vying for her attention. With all these qualities one would think that she is in control of her life and should get what she wants but instead she is caught in a world where she is powerless and is pushed and pulled one way and another. As strong as she appears she seems to have an inescapable fate no matter what she does and her attempts at removing herself from it just causes further issues. Upon her realization it is interesting and a bit gloomy what she chooses to do upon realizing her fatebut you'll have to watch to find out.There are many subtle symbols spread throughout the film and they are enjoyable to spot. I love when movies tell their story not only with the characters but with the environment and this film definitely adds those eye catching little details. It adds a sense of artistry to what is an already a visually pleasing film. However you do not need to understand or spot the small inferences to enjoy the film the film as a whole is enjoyable as is as well. However if you are familiar with a little Russian culture literature or the play altogether it will get you thinking.It is important to note that the film is originally based on the play called the Dowerless bride. A dowry is the property or money a bride will bring to a man if he gets married to her. Well the film is centered around wealth the wealthy and how to maintain wealth so for our lead to be without dowry and yet still be adored you can see how it can lead to complications. It brings to light necessary topics of women objectivity a patriarch society and the harsh reality of a capitalistic world. All the surrounding men play their parts great and I love that there is a wide cast of characters. The two main male leads are intriguing in the way they develop. or not develop in some cases. We don't just have the charismatic guy but also have the shy little man the wealthy men gypsies and serfs. All part of the Russian culture. It is a great film to get a small taste of the Russian lifestyle but there are also many aspects and behaviors that are not so different than our own. The film itself is very pleasing to the eye. The costumes are gorgeous and sometimes looking at the modernity of the film I forgot these folks were in Russia. The style is similar to that of a Russian Audrey Hepburn film but definitely has its own dark take on matters inside it. I hope you enjoy it as I did.".

	schema:headline " Watch this film";
	schema:reviewBody "Typically I dislike the romance genre I don't fully know why but it has never been my thing. However I strongly recommend watching this film. The film focuses mainly on the character Larissa the daughter of a widowed noble woman who is poor. The mother in question is trying to marry off her daughters to wealthy and hopefully nice men. However later in the film even the daughters who were married off at the beginning of the film as well as prior to it meet with bleak fates. Eventually Larissa meets with a similar fate as her sisters. This is just a brief synopsis the film is much deeper. It displays a situation that could have happened or even might have happened in Russia during the late 19th century. However the situation in the film is not just an examination of things that happened in Russia. In fact it is more of an examination of the social norms surrounding women and marriage during that time period. As the film gets darker toward the end Larissa realizes how she is viewed by her suitors. She becomes aware that she is perceived as a fancy object and her life up to this point has basically been an auction. I have seen very few films regarding romance and marriage where a character becomes aware of their own objectification in such a way. There are many characters in the film that have a heavy impact on it but the two that stand out are that stand out are Larissa and Paratov. Interestingly what makes them stand out is how much they have in common. Both are struck with misfortune as far as wealth goes both have exceptional talent and both are considered attractive. The main difference is that Paratov is a man which means that he can solve his misfortune in wealth through a variety of avenues. However Larissa is a woman and in this time period there's no way that she knows of out of her troubles unless it's through marriage. The music and cinematography is excellent. The camera work is stellar there are often shots through windows and as far as I know there were no signs of the cameras reflection in these. The music fits the tone and often matches up with the scenario it is accompanying. Otherwise it uses intentional dissonance. The acting is believable and is lively enough to keep me invested in the dialogue. As with any film I recommend seeing it in its native language.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me the movie was good and had a lot of great qualities within it. This story of self discovery takes the audience on a roller coaster of emotions throughout the movie.Larisa Dmitrievna Larisa Guzeyeva and her family would have been referred to as the class of the raznochintsy's. They were not peasants but they were not nobles they would have had noble descent. Surgey Sergeyevich Nikita Mikhalkov was another example of this class. There is also parts of the movie where we see Surgey act kindly towards any social class including the gypsies which in Russia's history was around the time when the peasants and serfs of were emancipated. One of the main themes that I noticed was the social obligation that people of the time period had to deal with such as the women marrying someone with money or the men marrying a woman with a dowry. Women were usually seen more as objects with money rather than real people. That is clearly shown with Larisa as she realizes she's only an object for people to auction off. There isn't too much that happens with true love because the love the characters had for each other was either lust or only for money. As far as character development goes I think that Juliy KapitonovichAndrei Myagkov has the most. Throughout the movie he is seen as the little man and he stays that way more or less but shows a side of his character you wouldn't expect. He starts off as a quiet man trying to win Larisa's heart but he is constantly shut down. By the end of the movie he's showing his anger and shows his true character when he tries to win back Larisa. All together I enjoyed the movie and thought the acting was done very well. I also liked the historical significance seen throughout it.".

Just as the American Dream is expressed repeatedly ad nauseam? in Hollywood movies I had a strong feeling after watching this movie that the 'Russian Dream' had been laid bare for my comprehension at last. The worship of impossible romance combined with blindness to all practical considerations and the expression of that romance in the gift of expensive baubles and other grand gestures are the main threads running through this story. And despite the fact that 'Cruel Romance' is a Sovietera depiction of 19th century Tsarist Russia these are cultural traits to be found in abundance in modernday Russians. For this reason watching the movie was a treat to me personally and henceforth I will view my Russian friends and colleagues with a slightly higher degree of understanding.Also I hope to see many more Russian movies in the future !".

	schema:headline " Gender Inequality In 19th Century Russia";
	schema:reviewBody "Film Review Cruel Romance Cruel Romance is a 1984 Classic Russian film made in the final years of Soviet Russia. The film stars Larisa Guzeeva as Larisa and Nikita Mikhalkov as Paratov. Larisa is a 19th century noble women that is stuck in the difficult position of trying to pick a suitor that she love while in a society where love a marriage are inextricable linked to one's wealth and the amount of social and capital gain that can be had from arranged marriages. Overall Cruel Romance is a very enjoyable representation of Russia as it is engulfed in a cultural social and political flux. We see the influence and variety of the growing middle class also known as raznochintsy in Russia as the nobles are making attempts to keep their societal position. Although Cruel Romance ends in despair we are shown a very detailed and complicated picture of the gender roles and the rights that accompanied those roles within Russia during this tumultuous in Russia's history. The film does waver on the side of over dramatic at times however the quality of the cinematography and editing overshadows much of the rather corny moments in the film. There are several themes that Cruel Romance seems to repeatedly emphasize throughout the film. One of the subtler yet consistently emphasized themes throughout the film is the presentation of women particularly Larisa as objects instead of people. Although many would say that this theme is not subtle at all due to the fact that almost every man that is presented in the film in some way or another tries to purchase the rights to Larisa there are other aspects of the film that would suggest that women are property to be owned and not people to be won over by love and affection. An aspect that presents this idea while being largely unannounced is the fact that we are constantly seeing Larisa through glass. Although some may see this as simple necessity due to space constrictions in actuality it is meant to have us see Larisa as if she were an item displayed in a shop window. This aspect is finally emphasized in the final moments as we see Larisa sliding across the front of the boat looking at each of her would be buyers through the class each recognizing her as an item which cannot be bought. Of coarse the problem of gender inequality is not a problem that is secular to Russia nor is it a fictional issue. Although it was much worse in the 19th century gender inequality is still a major issue today. However Cruel Romance focuses on primarily arranged marriages and the role that a woman or man's dowry played in those marriages. This of coarse was a very real issue in Russia during the 19th century. With the rising raznochintsy class in Russia we saw a whole new wave of suitors that depended entirely on their economic value due to the fact that they had no official title. This is displayed very well throughout the movie as Larisa is torn between suitors. An almost comical assembly of these suitors is scene towards the end at Larisa's fianc's dinner party. Overall I would say if you enjoy tragic romances and would like an interesting look into another culture of the 19th century than Cruel Romance is for you.".

The victims here die by lazer blasts or are electicuted or are dropped off high ledges. One girl is burned to death. The film's dummy titleKillbots is probably far more appropriate for this particular movie. The plot at a shopping mall presumably sometime in the nottoodistant future a super computer is installed which is activated at night. It activates solid steal doors which seal off the enterances making breaking in and getting out almost impossible. The computer also controlls three high tech security robots known as protector units. Then one night there is a thunder storm. Lightning strikes the antena on the roof of the mall scrambling the computer's circuts and the computer turns the protector robots into killing machines. After offing two techinitians hired to operate the computer overnight and a janitor Bmovie vet Dick Miller the protector units go after four teenage couples who've decided to spend the night in a mattress store for an orgy. Anybody who's familar with the teen extermination flicks of the 80's or who've seen Scream will figure out right when the couples get together who will live and who will die. But the film is still worth seeing just for Keli Maroney's preformance as Alyson. She manages to play a strong female heroine without becoming a male clone. Her charecter is comparable to Ripley from the Alien series. Also unlike some splatter movies this one's more interesting in that the young people find out right away what's going on and then they all battle the robots together instead of one person getting seperated and killed one by one until there's only one left. This is a definete mustsee.".

It went under it's other name Killbots during that showing and with a name like that you know it's going to be cheesy and stupid. Cheesy it is stupid it ain't.Forget the misleading title or cover art on the box this movie is very entertaining if you like bmovies.  I don't know why but for once in a long while especially in an 80's horror flick I was actually feeling for the characters.  I can't explain why but the acting and direction were both well done and though it's more of a horror spoof than anything it is quite a frightening concept.  Though some of the deaths are stupid and the action scenes unrealistic I couldn't help but see the similarities between this and Dawn of the Dead.  I mean these kids once they figure out what's going on and witness the famous head exloding scene they wage war with the robots...I mean they break out a freaking arsenal and lay waste to these things yeah like Dawn of the Dead what kind of mall would have firearms in it?  I mean one guy has an M16 assault rifle! though I can't remember them ever reloading once...it's all in good bmovie fun.  The major complaints I have with this one is that like I said before some of the deaths are 'throw away' obvious and without style most of the movie they are running from cheesy 80's laser effects shooting all around them but never hitting them...of course when they do finally make contact you never expect it but it is still a good movie to watch on a boring friday night with friends and a couple cases of beer.  I love the quote that the robots say every time that they dispatch one of the teens.  It is simply priceless. Also watch for Barabara Crampton of ReAnimator fame as one of the horny teenagers.  Overall not bad and when I think of the title and what this movie is I'm surprising myself in giving it a 810.".

Chopping Mall how can you not love that title? is a lot of fun to watch and it's easily Jim Wynorski's best effort out of more than 60 directed films. Despite the fact that Chopping Mall doesn't take itself too seriously and mainly focuses on satire there really are some tense moments and properly mounted suspense sequences. The laser headexplosion sequence is famous and there are multiple other cheesehighlights. But what is perhaps the most surprising are the engaging acting performances and the welcome amount of tasteful nudity. The most familiar cute face in the cast is Barbara Crampton who stars as a screaming beauty in between her two greatest films ReAnimator and From Beyond. Truly ingenious are the endless references towards Roger Corman's repertoire especially illustrated through cameos of Paul Bartel Dick Miller and Mary Woronov.

	schema:reviewBody "From the film's title  Chopping Mall I was expecting a movie along the lines of a slasher film. And well I was completely surprised. While Chopping Mall is in a way a slasher movie it's of a different kind. The movie basically revolves around a group of eight teenagers who are hanging out in a high tech security mall after closing time. The kids are enjoying themselves having sex and whatnot when suddenly one couple is murdered by the mall's hightech security robots. The steel doors to the mall slam shut leaving the remaining teens trapped in the mall with a gang of killer robots mercilessly attacking them. The doors don't open back up until six a.m. the next morning  can they make it through the night? This film has complete Bmovie cheese written all over it. The story for this movie for one is creative but flatout silly if you really think about it. The acting  well let's not go there. I'll just say that it was pretty bad overall  bad delivery and they were completely unbelievable. There were typical archetype characters including the promiscuous girl the nerdy guy and the good girl. The film's special effects are another thing. The CGI is completely horrible although back at the time this was made 1986 I suppose that this could have been looked at as some highquality technology. Viewers today though will be able to see how unbelievable it really is. The robots also kind of reminded me of vacuum cleaners but that was just me. Aside from this movie's negative points it's got one good thing going for it  it's really entertaining in all of it's cheesy glory. It's not scary in any way just entertaining and may please gore fans for some of it's murder scenes  I have to admit the headexplosion bit was classic.Overall Chopping Mall is nothing but a corny Bmovie. It's campy the acting was far below average the strange techno music was annoying and the special effects are unconvincing  but despite that it's entertaining for the most part. You'll have a fun time watching it but it's hard to take any of it seriously at all. 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this movie when it first came out. Talk about high tech. Like Wargames you look at it now and High Tech looks like ColecovisionI have to say this is a very entertaining movie. There were a few Andy Warhol factory people in the movie but mainly the stars were unknown other then Kelly Maroney who had built up a following from her role on the soap Ryan's Hope. I think the lack of marquee names are always a advantage in horror or thriller movies because that means anyone can can killed murdered and maimed.In the beginning of the movie we see a man give a demonstration about this new security system that he has set up in this mall. It seems that he has employed some robots to do what security guards use to do. We as the viewer know this is not going to be a successful venture. Movies involving computers or robots in the 1980 were always going to be a recipe for disaster.There is a bad storm and for some reason the robots go haywire. Meantime we have a big party brewing for later on with some of the teenagers working in the mall. One is a new teenager to the area and she is persuaded to tag a long. We know since there are no stars in the movie she will be the smart one. Seems that furniture stores in malls double as hotels for teenage parties at night. A pretty good idea if you are a teenager who works at a relatives furniture store.Well of course there are 4 boys and 4 girls. It looks like one teenage couple is married but I never could figure that out. Kelly Maroney the new girl in town gets paired off with the male nerd character. They like each other they remain content looking at TV while their friends are cavorting Now this is from Teenage horror movie 101. The couple who has sex first or is involved in taking drugs or drinking too much are the first to get killed. And the formula is in effect here. Seems one of the girls want a cigarette and asks her boyfriend to leave the store and get some out of the machine. She bares her breast and right then and there she was doomed. We know as viewers the kill bots are already causing havoc. The boyfriend gets killed and the girlfriend goes looking for him and while the other teens at the party witness her screaming on seeing her boyfriend they also witness her grizzly death. All hell breaks loose from then on. I am not going to spoil it and tell what happens. Just hold on to your seats. The movie doesn't stop to take a breathe for a second. This is a textbook movie about how to make a good thriller. It only last 75 minutes and that is all it needs to be. So many thrillers are so over blown and bogged down with stories you forget you are suppose to be scared thrilled and on the edge of your seat. Yes the the kill bots are really cheesy. But there is always something creepy about machines going bad. The new title Chopping Mall is misleading because there is not too much hacking and chopping but more like people being killed by lasers and electricity. The original title was more appropriate..Killbots. A very good little thriller that does its job.".

Just recently I picked up a copy of the movie on DVD and I was not as impressed. First of all the movie tends to drag a bit which is pretty typical of any Concord produced movies. Second the killbots are very silly. Even when I was a kid I had to laugh at the special effects. I guess I saw Terminator one to many times. Third the script writing is just atrocious. How typical can you get? Four the acting is OK I guess. But let me set this straight this movie is still fun even with all its cheese. It does have some cult movie actors that make cameo role. Dick Miller plays a janitor. Gerrit Graham plays a scientist. And Barbara Crampton plays a typical teen steriotype. All in all I'd say if your a fan of these low budget Concord films watch it even buy it why not.".

The premise is interesting enough about 4 couples being locked up in a maximum security mall with three killer robots designed to protect the mall from thieves and the like.  The execution of the plot is methodical and very predictable. So much could have been done with this film but what comes out is just a rather boring movie about teenagers being killed...the ultimate horror cliche! We do however get treats like seeing the Blands from Eating RaoulPaul Bartel and Mary Woronov and Walter Paisley from A Bucket of BloodDick Miller but their scenes are so short and nothing is really done with them....much to my chagrin.  The only other saving grace the film really has are the exposed bosoms from the rather talentless but wellendowed female cast. All in all nothing really exciting here but a decent diversion for a couple of hours slated to be mindlessly amused.".

This new 300 rise of an empire was absolutely horrendous. Rise of an empire what empire? This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on. It was all about the blood and the guts and breasts. I don't mind nudity. I don't mind blood. But the way the director went about it only cheapened the experience. This movie has a line in it you fight harder than you f Artemisia. It could have been beautiful and filled with the promise of something both hilarious and invigorating if the scene it referred to had not been so vulgar. 300 Rise of an Empire was not worth the money I spent on it. There are books out there on this point in history historical fiction books that have stronger character development than this script. The actors did the best they could with what they had but writers and director you owe the public an apology for this poor display of cinematic genius. It was cheap crude and not well thought out. I had higher hopes. Next time actually make something worth watching.".

Xerxes is no way that someone that you've built and only open the doors you had a history of insulting installment.

That would already be a recipe for disaster even though in reality Snyder was supervising.In an attempt to live up to it's predecessor 300 Rise of An Empire is actionpacked presents impressive visuals and is very bloody. In fact there is more action more blood and more nudity than in the original 300. As for the plot there really isn't much to chew on. A naval commander Themistocles is supposedly trying to reunite Greece. Since the story takes place before during and after King Leonidas leads his men to fight the Persians it can be hard to follow at times. Most of the acting was mediocre and couldn't quite compensate for the weaknesses in the story. The Australian actor cast as Themistocles in my opinion was a very bad choice and comes nowhere close to what Gerard Butler did as King Leonidas in 300. He just doesn't bring that rugged heroic presence on screen as is expected. Interestingly I read somewhere that director Noam Murro insisted it would be Sullivan Stapleton who played this character claiming he was 'the one'. Eva Green on the other hand is plays an excellent villain as Artemisia.".

Meaningless because the viewer was given no reason to care for the main character Themistokles nor for Athens nor for the Greeks as a whole.

But for the Greeks there simply is no backstory no reason to care for them at all. Oh Athens is burning ... meh. What is worse the actual history could have given a plot that the film sorely lacked  a tiny terrified democracy is convinced by free speech and a weird prophecy to allow itself to be physically destroyed. Then the Greeks allow all to ride on Themistokles' desperate gamble to trick the Persian fleet into attacking them in the straights of Salamis. By the way Artemisia actually tries to convince Xerxes to NOT send the fleet in. The film gives us no portrayal of Athens democracy weird prophecies or Themistokles' true brilliance. Nor does it reveal that the nascent Western world was balanced on a knife edge. Instead we are expected to believe that a horse and Sparta come to the rescue. Pathos has become simply pathetic.

The slow motion to fast motion gimmick was old 5 years ago and if we want to see 300 style action sequences we will watch 300. Beautiful imagery but I'd rather see paintings of it rather than 2 hours of slow mo. 4.Under explained stakes and characters. I still have no idea why anyone was fighting and what they were fighting over really. And furthermore I felt more sad for the lead villain who was raped repeatedly as a slave child rather than the leading men who think it's cool to have sex with the enemy. And the other heroes from 300 are a culture of people who not only beat children but discard BABIES if they are not born perfectly. These are our heroes? The Persians at least didn't mention that in their back story. 5. This film is almost all exposition. Nearly 80 of the dialogue is either Braveheart style speeches to 10000 soldiers who somehow can hear one man without a microphone or two overacting characters speaking in inconsistent British accents to remind the audience of what's going on and what they're going to do. 6. If you can't get Gerard Butler to perform ANY speaking lines in the film just cut him out completely. It was laughable how many times they did the OH Your favorite character GERARD BUTLER JUST left..you JUST missed him..so here is stock photos from the last movie of him...and oh his wife and this guy were in the last movie...and you know them...so they will speak on his behalf 7. King Leonidas' wife is just as skilled as any Spartan on the battlefield and leads them from the front lines? OK. 8. If Hollywood is going to only make remakes reboots and adaptations of earlier works they should at very least think a bit more on the script before pooping it out. There is no substance in this film no real story no stakes and worst of all no serious supporting actor. 9. On a positive note the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Comedy gold. 10. I cannot take this movie seriously and I am their target audience. Worth a DVD rental for some fun but even in 3D it gets old.Try again Hollywood cashcow Inc.".

If it was its own film it would be one of the worst films ever. But they have the ability to constantly reference Leonidas even in a sign of desperation show Leonidas on several occasions. At one point Themistokles seeks him out. But instead talks to everyone else in Sparta apart from Leonidas. Pointless one would say. The film lacks the passion the originality and the spirit from the first film. And yet again another moneymaker that chooses to replace those characteristics with an overexposure of mimicking and a soulless display of film making.".

And yet again another moneymaker that chooses to replace those characteristics with an overexposure of mimicking and a soulless display of film making.";

I wouldn't want you to watch this on Netflix by virtue of the fact that you spend roughly 8 a month on Netflix and would subsequently be paying to watch this movie.Huge fans of the first '300' my fiance and I went to see 'Rise of an Empire' with another couple on a whim this past Friday. Thirty or so minutes into the film I had to lean over and ask my friend if this movie was a parody as it was impossible to take seriously. It could have been the fact that Xerxes now has a heavy Portugese accent amongst poorly executed English accents used by characters attempting to portray GreeksPersians. Maybe the cartoonish video game fight scenes 85 of the film with a disgusting overuse of the slow motion effect that landed a heavy punch in the first film. Could it be the fact that without any real firepower it's almost impossible to make a naval battle truly interesting? How about the lazy use of stock footage from the original film? Maybe the sex scene which obviously uses slowfastmo fighting graphics and features some Persian chromeface guards glancing at each other comically whilst they hear the lovemaking from outside the room ala Scary Movie. I honestly don't think a parody would do this movie justice.On the other hand I greatly enjoyed the 5 Espresso Chocolate milkshake I got from the Alamo Drafthouse. I rate that an 810 coming in at a close second to the Strawberry Balsamic shake which gets a perfect 1010 every time. I would strongly recommend either of these shakes from Drafthouse to be enjoyed while watching something other than '300 Rise of an Empire'.".

Forgettable CGIpacked action with predictable rhythm of calm and intense scenes from beginning to end. As far as I remember the Persians never destroyed Athens and the rebirth of Xerxes was also a joke not to mention the union of Artemisia and Themistokles. 300 was almost a perfect movie but it has nothing to do with its glorious predecessor.".

The whole get from a to b in a special way at the end was about as unbelievable as it gets. The title is fully misleading as Spartans hardly appear at all except for about two minutes and despite attempting to explain why a godking becomes a godking there is no empire included in this movie save for the few boats.If you enjoy action movies for something to watch this is OK it passes the time. If however you find the original 300 stands apart for the visuals and the fight scenes then do not waste your time you will be disappointed.

I honestly believed that the movie will stand out in this department. Now heres what i observed. Although made on a budget of 100 million the effects were goddarn terrible. At times it felt like i was watching a TV show. Spartacus has 20 times better production value than this mess of a movie. The battle scenes felt like the opposite of epic. Has this director ever shot any action scene before let alone a battle! I think not. I've seen better choreographed fights in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and i believed that about sums it up. 0010The direction Probably a first timer a clueless director just trying to follow a blind man's footsteps.

I didn't actually have high hopes for the film to start as most movies this year have been let downs. Well this one was no different..Where to start... Well the actor that played Testiclees or whatever his name was did not fit the role at all. I did like the back story between him and Xerxes who not only looks like a lady but actually is a lady in this sequel. Wait nevermind I didn't like it at all because it was just ending of the first movie hero didn't kill Xerxes C'mon really did you even try writer. I should have got up and left right there...I even stood up and thought about it before the guy behind me yelled in arabic . The movie just got worse from there... I felt like this movie might have been the rough draft of the first film. Same plot same character story lines with little variation same exact lines.. They even used like 14 scenes from the original film itself. Main character becomes a legend Persians invade One man leads army violence sex scene dad dies this time instead of closet gay son hunchback guy betrayal Spartans still make everyone else look like a wuss and save the day.. The one major change in this movie is Xerxes is a vagina pad in this movie vs. being an awesome antagonist.. And the actual antagonist in the film would have been good if she didn't look like a meth head the entire time... Character was dull shallow and unoriginal.. The strength of her character is detracted by her inability to control her emotions which is actually pretty realistic . Fight scenes didn't do it for me... Just too over the top with the choreographing.. Overall this film just sucked I currently live in the middle east and they cut out the only good part where I can only assume Testiclees tried to put it in Eva's butt and she got upset about it... I don't even review movies but I am so upset by this film that I am trolling it..tldr  This is the bizzaro version of the original 300".

Wait nevermind I didn't like it at all because it was just ending of the first movie hero didn't kill Xerxes C'mon really did you even try writer. I should have got up and left right there...I even stood up and thought about it before the guy behind me yelled in arabic . The movie just got worse from there... I felt like this movie might have been the rough draft of the first film. Same plot same character story lines with little variation same exact lines.. They even used like 14 scenes from the original film itself. Main character becomes a legend Persians invade One man leads army violence sex scene dad dies this time instead of closet gay son hunchback guy betrayal Spartans still make everyone else look like a wuss and save the day.. The one major change in this movie is Xerxes is a vagina pad in this movie vs. being an awesome antagonist.. And the actual antagonist in the film would have been good if she didn't look like a meth head the entire time... Character was dull shallow and unoriginal.. The strength of her character is detracted by her inability to control her emotions which is actually pretty realistic . Fight scenes didn't do it for me... Just too over the top with the choreographing.. Overall this film just sucked I currently live in the middle east and they cut out the only good part where I can only assume Testiclees tried to put it in Eva's butt and she got upset about it... I don't even review movies but I am so upset by this film that I am trolling it..tldr  This is the bizzaro version of the original 300";

	schema:reviewBody "300 Rise of an Empire will be no surprise in delivery other than it is possibly better than the first? There will still be fight scenes reminiscent of flawless dance moves and the great choreography is what lends the film to being a great 'dance' movie hello StepUp 3hundred. The difference in approach comparatively between the two films would be the perverse nature of the second's delivery of the story at hand. The first had a far more romantic predisposition.The story is more or less the same  Persians are descending onto Greece and taking over. The epicenter for the second take on the Persian take over is Athens and its people. The men are not as perfectly ripped as the Spartans. The soldiers are made up of various sized men but there's still a great amount of shiny muscle and not nearly as romantic in appearance as the perfect Spartans.The sex scene is more sadomasochistic and less love making. The passion between King Leonidas and his queen in 300 is filled with affection and attachment whereas the scene in 300 Rise of an Empire is riddled with force power and control. The sexual tension in both scenes are similar in sexual tension but both portray a very different tone one more romantic than the other.The lighting is impeccable and the story lent well to the way in which the 3D was utilized. Instead of aspects 'popping' out at you they seemed to go deep. The landscapes had so much depth that it was hard not to make the correlation between the depth 300 Rise of an Empire was reaching to in terms of the Persian take over. As it was not the next installment of 300 but more insight into the original story as the story goes deeper than Sparta and the army of 300. Eva Green is outrageously good and compelling to watch and to some degree is the Leonidas of Rise of an Empire. Not to say that Sullivan Stapelton was overshadowed but his role was more meticulous and thought out very much like the Queen in 300. The two pull the opposite sides of a war story firmly together. Not to mention how smoking hot both of them are.Like the first Rise of an Empire is undoubtedly clothed in beauty from the moonlighting to the muscled bodies the supple breasts to the eloquent sprays of blood the film is about an aesthetic which is part of the story. Is it masking a lack of story? definitely not it is the story. 300 was ground breaking at the time of release Rise of an Empire merely perfects that first step into a world of a different and maybe more enigmatic way of story telling. 7.510".

The Persians are still attacking Greece but this time we watch from the view point of Athenian Themistocles Sullivan Stapleton while the events of 300 unfold elsewhere. The backstory of some old and some new characters were interesting to watch. The events which take place after 300 were awesome and led to some great battle scenes.And whilst 300 had plenty of fantastic battle scenes Rise has some equally fantastic naval battle scenes. Ships wrecks beheadings one on ones and battles were all awesome and entertaining. Watching Themistocles engage in naval tactics was quite fun to watch. The one on one or multiple combats were a bit better than the original. I found them rougher and just more fun to watch. Eva green as Artemisia was amazing. She was terrifying at times and great fun to watch. However I did find a few scenes felt out of place and unnecessary. In saying that the confrontations Themistocles and Artemisia more than made up for it. The ending of the movie was satisfying and to repeat myself so was the final battle scenes. They were incredibly fun to watch. A very entertaining movie especially since I was lucky to be able to watch them back to back on the big screen.".

I was highly entertained and completely drawn into this world with amazing graphic art scenery and a high Asian Martial Art feel fight scenes. 3D is working during the sea battles but not really required. The introduction of Artemisia Themistokles and Xerxes becoming the GodKing of Persia were cool but might be a bit confusing as it wasn't always obvious that these were flashbacks in the current story.Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles did well not Gerard Butler though. Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo was again a graceful power lady GoTh made her even stronger in character. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes is again hot especially as his younger self. Eva Green as Navy Admiral Artemisia was one mean bad lady strong like in Kingdom of Heaven and occasionally I was more on her side than on the Greek's ... and her costumes are just ... fantastic!If I could rate half points it would rate it 85 because 300 was in my opinion stronger funnier and more dramatic but 9 rates are for films that I will see again ... and I will see this one again mainly due to Artemisia she was awesome.Ps If you don't like bloody scenes it might be not your type of film".

Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek give brilliant Oscarnominated performances as Ed and Beth Horman the father and wife of their beloved one who has disappeared without a trace. The film follows their frustrating search in a country which is Chile even though the movie never reveals that I would not dare live in. Things get more frustrating for the Hormans when they start to believe that the American representatives there are not telling them everything. Directed by CostaGavras Z Missing is an emotional film that keep me interested for its entire two hours. Lemmon and Spacek are great as usual and there are supporting roles for Melanie Mayron and Joe Regalbuto a couple of years before they turned up on TV's Thirtysomething and Murphy Brown respectably. Missing is one of the best strongest political thrillers ever made. 12 out of four".

	schema:headline " Propulsive RealLife Political Thriller Shows CostaGavras and Lemmon at Their Peak";
	schema:reviewBody "Accomplished GreekFrench filmmaker CostaGavras has a compelling way of bringing the emotional resonance out of stories with overtly political themes. He hits the mail on the head with this searing indictment of American involvement in the 1973 military coup that ejected Allende from power in Chile. Facts are not discretely presented even the country in which the story takes place is not disclosed except for specific references to the cities of Santiago and Vina Del Mar. Yet CostaGavras creates an atmosphere of palpable tension that doesn't let up in this 1982 film and the unraveling mystery at the heart of the movie echoes the unsettling political situation surrounding the characters.Adapted by CostaGavras and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's nonfiction book documenting the true case the plot focuses on American expatriate Charles Horman whose sudden disappearance in the days after the Pinochet coup brings together two familial adversaries his wife Beth and his father Ed who has flown in from New York. Charles and Beth had been leading a vagabond existence with his work in children's animation and their relatively passive support of Allende's reform measures. Charles' back story is revealed in carefully constructed flashback episodes that show him to be curious about the presence of U.S. military personnel in the area. Once he disappears Ed and Beth seek help from the U.S. Consulate but face a seemingly insurmountable wall of bureaucracy. Frustrated Ed a highly conservative Christian Scientist lashes out at Beth for what he considers her undesirable influence over his son. However as they absorb the scope of the violence and the culpability of the U.S. government they bond intractably toward their objective of finding Charles.For once Jack Lemmon unafraid to convey his character's prejudices is able to use his neurotically coiled energy in a suitable dramatic role as Ed. The result is a startlingly raw performance that ranks among his best. Sissy Spacek is terrific as Beth though her character does not experience as big an arc of selfrevelation. In the elliptical flashback role of Charles John Shea provides solid support as do Janice Rule as a political activist and a number of familiar TV faces  Melanie Mayron as friend Terry and David Clennon as U.S. consul Phil Putnam both from thirtysomething and Joe Regalbuto Frank from Murphy Brown playing another Frank a possible victim of the coup. There are unfortunately no extras with the 2004 DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this film on television recently and was pulled in and had to watch to the end again. I have probably seen it twice before.Missing is a powerful fascinating movie that captures the hypocrisy and hubris of certain elements of US foreign policy and the reaction of the innocent public who get run over by such policies with searing clarity.Jack Lemmon was never better in a dramatic role than in this film to my mind. The neurotic tics and flip outs that he typically used in a dramatic role are restrained or non existent and his performance is perfect as the upstanding citizen who slowly comes to the realization that his own country which he loves profoundly likely had a hand in the death of his only son. Very very impressive performance from an old pro.Sissy Spacek as his daughter in law is also very good. I find her utterly believable in her role. She exudes a complex blend of strength kindness love and cynicism without ever having a false note. Very good as well.The two leads are important well casted and well acted but the movie wouldn't work without the assorted cast members who play the US embassy officials. Exuding exactly the right amount of bureaucratic indifference disguised with polite helpfulness shady sleaze wrapped in procedural rituals and ultimately blatant ruthless expediency all while making casual jokes this collection of good old boys do a perfect job and are a chilling bunch.I note as well that the film has aged very well. The styles are 70s but the film has taken on more of a documentary feel with the passage of time instead of that 70s flashback feel you get from other thrillers set in that period.In addition the direction is more focused and the story telling better than in some other films of a similar nature I am thinking in particular of Syriana. Bravo. A great film. Watch it. And then wonder if anyone has learned anything in the 35 years since the events documented went down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Lemmon portrays a father searching for his son whom he think has fallen in with a group of naive liberal thinkers. By the end of the movie Lemmon's character realizes he had fallen in with a group of naive conservative thinkers. This movie portrays the odyssey of the father searching for a missing son in an unstable foreign country. He believes in the powers of the American embassy to protect all Americans. He believes everyone who keeps his nose clean is left alone. He believes in the power of the American people. The movie allows us to feel with him with its careful directing and to feel for the other characters close to him and his son. We don't choose sides in the movie. We just hold back the tears knowing that sadness looms and obviously the father knows sadness looms too. The religious beliefs occupation and history of the father are played down and unimportant. We are left to realize how unimportant it all is when looking for a loved one whom we feel is not in good fortune. A lot of movies claim to change a character in their film but they're always left to resort to extreme exposition usually even making the character proclaim that he or she has changed and more often than not it isn't believable. This movie makes you believe. It is the best example ever of a character making a change throughout a movie.".

However they are surprised by the military coup d'tat sponsored by the US Government to replace President Salvador Allende and Charles is arrested by the military force. His father Ed Horman Jack Lemmon a conservative businessman from New York arrives in Chile to seek out his missing son with Beth. He goes to the American Consulate to meet the Consul that promises the best efforts to find Charles while the skeptical Beth does not trust on the word of the American authorities. The nationalism and confidence of Ed in his government changes when he finds the truth about what happened with his beloved son. Missing is one of the most powerful and sharp films of the cinema history and a mustsee for people of my generation raised in military dictatorships in South America sponsored and trained by the US Government. After more than thirty years from the first time I saw it Missing is still impressive with topnotch performance of Jack Lemmon. The first work by Costa Gravas in the American cinema could not be better exposing the hidden wounds about the participation of the American government in Chile bloodshed. Unfortunately and surprisingly this film has only been released on VHS many years ago in Brazil and I had to buy an imported DVD to change the media. My vote is ten.

Well I just saw 'Missing' for the 1st time. It brings back all my previous leftist 'paranoia' about capitalism and national interests. And causes me to wonder why I ever abandoned them. After the movie I cruised certain sites on the Internet one being a series of articles referenced in the misc. section under this movie on IMDb. They chillingly reenforced the truth ? that at the highest levels of our government there was complicity even outright orders to kill thousands including American citizens in the interest of capitalism national interests and socalled 'national security'. I am sorry to say sorry in the sense that with my limited personal intelligence I am never completely sure if I am right and sorry to doubt my own government that I am starting agree with some others that our foreign policy has is and probably will be be based to the detriment of our national security on the almighty dollar. I'm also sorry for the political comments on a movie site but of course the nature of Missing brought this on and its very well directed written and acted scenes. Please don't question things I have said unless you have seen the movie and read some of the articles. 1010 new addition And I completely of course agree with levlafayette. Read the book it is much better. I have read the book 'Missing'. And as with most movies based on books especially 'nonfiction' books the content in the book is more detailed and hits you closer to the bone heart mind and conscience in many ways than the movie. And that is hard to believe in this case because Constantin CostaGavras director managed to create a movie experience that is nearly as moving as the work it was based upon. It wasis a great movie experience....sir. Thank you CCG. For those of you out there who have an easy criticism one I agree with now of the US MY country and I care about it because of Iraq you need to watch this film or read the book. What can go wrong is deep seated human instincts and hard to root out. It can happen to you and your country and government. We are all human and capable of desire greed and religious beliefs overruling true morality and an open mind and heart. Please all of you keep things in perspective.

	schema:reviewBody "During the Cold War 19451990 it was the policy of successive US governments to maintain authoritarian right wing governments in power all around the world if there was a possibility that they might be replaced by one from the left democratic or otherwise. As the US ambassador in this film reminds us  we act in the interests of the United States' not in the interests of the country which happens to be suffering under a fascist dictatorship. We can accept this on an intellectual level  how else can the US government establishment act   but in this movie CostaGavras uses his very considerable skills as a filmmaker to rouse even diehard conservatives to anger over the methods used to ensure Pax Americana.He does this by dramatising the reallife story of one of their number Ed Holman Jack Lemmon a businessman from New York and a crusty Christian Scientist with  faith in Truth into the aftermath of a military coup in an unnamed South American country the capital of which is called Santiago. I think we can safely assume the country is Chile though the locations appear to be Mexican. His son Charles John Shea a vaguely leftwing journalist and writer living in the city with his wife Beth Sissy Spacek has disappeared after being arrested a few days after the coup and carted off to a makeshift concentration camp in the National Stadium. Initially Ed believes the people at the American consulate and embassy really are there to help him but it soon turns out they have an agenda of their own. Ed and his son's wife start out on bad terms but Ed comes to appreciate her bravery in the face of a very unstable situation. He also comes to realise the moral worth of his son who he had previously regarded as a bit of a playboy much as he had loved him.An almost surreal feature of the movie is that  people behave almost normally despite the obvious signs of murder and mayhem going on in the background. In fact the only time the comfortable classes' are disturbed is when there is an earthquake affecting Ed's Santiago hotel. Otherwise the guests are happy to watch from the upstairs terrace the military killing people in the streets. Of course General Pinochet still has considerable support in Chile and in August 2000 your reviewer witnessed a large demonstration outside the Supreme Court in Santiago against a decision lifting the Life Senator's immunity from prosecution. It was a very welldressed crowd.Ed's odyssey through hospitals morgues police stations and the National Stadium is intercut with flashbacks which make it plain enough what has happened. Yet in classic thriller fashion we are kept on the edge of our seats with what will happen next. Politics aside this film succeeds as a thriller involving believable people rather than stereotypes. Jack Lemmon gives the dramatic performance of a lifetime as Ed the fuddyduddy who really does care and leaves no stone unturned to find the truth.Nearly 30 years later Chile has a democratic government Pinochet is too infirm to stand trial Nixon is dead and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is an elder statesman on the celebrity circuit. The only communist regime in Latin America Castro's Cuba is still there. This film reminds us that immoral policy whether or not it achieves its objectives remains immoral. The fact that US foreign policy is regarded as being in the interests of the United States does not make it more moral even if you happen to be a citizen of that country where as Ed reminds us at the end remains one in which you can at least sue for justice. Sadly Ed did not succeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a particularly chilling scene in this movie. It comes near the end in a confrontation between Charles Horman Jack Lemmon and staff members of the American ambassador in postcoup Chile 1973. To this point the staff has sounded polished and professional in their concern for Horman's missing son an apparent casualty of the coup. But in this scene the devious reality of American policy begins to emerge from behind the velvet glove and Horman's passage from credulous liberal to disillusioned skeptic is complete. In a nutshell the scene symbolizes one of the great divides in American political life between the polished propaganda face our government presents to the people and the grim realities that face covers over especially in dealing with Third World countries like Chile. Horman represents the frustration many feel in trying to deal with a cosmetic facade supported by both major political parties when beneath it crouches the murderous policies of imperial rule.The real question the film poses is what Horman will do upon returning home.The film itself remains a gripping eyeopener from first to last. CostaGravas is especially good at recreating the abject terror of fascist rule where long hair is forbidden and women are forced back into skirts where people are present one minute and gone the next where a democratically elected government is present one minute and gone the next and where a Henry Kissinger can do the behindthescenes dirty work and be honored for it not in the movie but true nevertheless. The acting is firstrate and a tourdeforce for Lemmon in particular. Ditto the often overlooked Charles Cioffi who puts the real chill in the confrontation scene. Two complaints the arch symbolism of the riderless white horse conflicts with CostaGravas's documentary approach and why oh why did they have to make Horman's son so cuddly. The audience gets the point without spooning on the sugar. Anyhow this remains a fine piece of revelatory filmmaking and retains as much relevancy for today's audience as it did twenty years ago.".

Despite the movie's length the perfectly crafted dialogue and incidents kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2 hours.This Oscarwinning movie remained as one of Hollywood's best thrillers. 1010 worth watching as long as you're not easily bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I consider nowadays a right winger it is when I see films like MISSING that I tend to feel otherwise. MISSING is an outstanding film depicting the disappearance of American journalist Charls Horman and the desperate search for him conducted by his wife and father. It is also when watching these type of cold war era films that you can't help but wonder why the U.S. has garnered so much hatred from all over the world. U.S. officials after all were involved in Horman's death. Imagine that killing your own!!! And what the hell did the U.S. wanted in Chile? Well as the film clearly states there were over 3000 American companies in Chile at the time of the coup and legitimally elected president Salvador Allende was sought as a threat to those American interests. First of all Allende was no commie yet paranoia has high on the list of the American Officials at the time so they didn't want to have another CUBA in Latin America. Anyway I saw MISSING way back in 1983 on video. I was 15 years old and the movie literally left me feeling hallow I considered it an extremely depressing movie. I lived in Argentina during the 70's and it reminded me of some of the stuff that was going on down there at the time. I recently purchased the movie on DVD and saw it last night. Again it left me disturbed and very angry. Angry at the way U.S. handled the Horman case with lies and more lies. Lying to Horma's wife and lying to his father. They couldn't care less about Charles Horman. I was surprised that the movie was filmed in Mexico. Although politically way more stable than Chile at the time the subject matter of the movie was reason enough for the Mexican Government to avoid it. We were under the PRI regime at the time. I'm glad there weren't any problems. Jack Lemmon's and Sissy Spacek's performances were spot on. Jack Lemmon's was bordering on the supreme. He really is wonderful as the desperate and riddled father. MISSING is an intriguing film extraordinarily crafted and richly deserving of the Academy Award it received. It is also one of the saddest films you'll ever see and hearing Vangelis heartbreaking theme song you can't help but to cry. Watch this film and remind yourselves that American foreign policy hasn't changed much in 30 years. 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Again a wonderful political redhot movie from Gavras who really kicks where it hurts  If  Z  was denouncing an clear tyranny in Greece this one is even more courageous as it denounces an unclear tyranny. If America boasts regularly to be a divine democracy the reality is that they forget easily those ideals. Either they do aggression as foreign policy either they support covert operation to change elected representatives for others usually military that suit them. To put it clearly their interests are not people but their banking and military industrial complex. In Chile the invisible hand of America in the coup is proved  from Nixon   if we let potential leaders in south America think they can move like Chile we will be in trouble. No impression should be permitted in Latin America that they can get away with this that it's safe yo go this way . from Kissinger   Isn't that something ! isn't that something ! I mean instead of celebrating in the Eisenhower period we would have been heroes. We didn't do it. I mean we helped them . So as shown in the movie their two framed portraits in all American offices has great meaning. In all cases this helpful supervision is clearly explained and the puppet masters are famous  one was behind another famous coup and the one is a younger deep throat. I think that the casting of Jack Lemon was best and worthy of his award in Cannes Festival because he is indeed the embodiment of the true candid American. So his search for his son would turn also a a search for truth and his evolution is moving. The Vangelis' score fit this dark and sad reality of loving ones facing an abusive administration. So i recommend this movie and also the book  untold history of the united states  that was very helpful to understand our long time friend overseas.".

In Chile the invisible hand of America in the coup is proved  from Nixon   if we let potential leaders in south America think they can move like Chile we will be in trouble. No impression should be permitted in Latin America that they can get away with this that it's safe yo go this way . from Kissinger   Isn't that something ! isn't that something ! I mean instead of celebrating in the Eisenhower period we would have been heroes. We didn't do it. I mean we helped them . So as shown in the movie their two framed portraits in all American offices has great meaning. In all cases this helpful supervision is clearly explained and the puppet masters are famous  one was behind another famous coup and the one is a younger deep throat. I think that the casting of Jack Lemon was best and worthy of his award in Cannes Festival because he is indeed the embodiment of the true candid American. So his search for his son would turn also a a search for truth and his evolution is moving. The Vangelis' score fit this dark and sad reality of loving ones facing an abusive administration. So i recommend this movie and also the book  untold history of the united states  that was very helpful to understand our long time friend overseas.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Constantin CostaGravas' Missing has this aura of mystery about it and the reason for this is not obvious. There is a military coup in a Latin American country probably based on Chile after Augusto Pinochet came to power in 1973. The American military may be involved. But for Ed Horman Jack Lemmon the coup is only significant because his son Charles Horman John Shea disappears while it is in progress. So Ed Horman goes to Latin America and together with Charles' wife Beth Horman Sissy Spacek begins a long search for his son. The mystery is not over why Charles went missing or even who his possible abductors were. We already have a shrewd idea of what happened. Instead the sense of mystery is derived from the surreal and disturbing world that Ed and Beth enter in their desperate search for Charles. CostaGavras has a wonderful talent for mentioning tiny but crucial details like the father who is hulled away by security forces at an airport soldiers firing machine guns at two youths spray painting graffiti the dead body that drifts down a river without anyone taking notice the sense one gets is that this occurrence happens so often that it becomes normal and the fascinating little testimonies. You get a sense that something deep profound and terrible is going to happen in this movie and you do not know what it is. The suspense is terrifying. The performances in this movie are great but CostaGavras' main achievement is turning the land into a character. The musical soundtrack the soldiers and bodies appearing in the most unlikely places the climate of secrecy and fear all suggest the existence of a sinister force  invisible omnipresent and all powerful  that shapes the destinies of millions. Once you experience this world with Ed and Beth you never want the film to stop because this world that CostaGavras recreates is shocking and fascinating at the same time. Missing is a special film with raw power.".

	schema:reviewBody "Missing tells the true story of Charlie Horman an idealistic writer who disappeared in Chile after the U.S.backed military coup of 1973. It's told primarily through the perspective of Horman's father Ed played by Jack Lemmon who joins up with his daughterinlaw Beth Sissy Spacek to try and find Charlie amidst the chaos of a nation in turmoil. The hunt for Charlie is never particularly engaging or mysterious especially if you know the ultimate fate of their search going in but what the film excels at is adding the human element to this kind of personal tragedy.Directed by CostaGavras Missing is a film that seems to care more about informing the world of this gross injustice rather than do anything particularly entertaining for it's audience. Opening with the statement that the events of the film are true and left unchanged there is certainly an air of importance added to their search always leaving the audience aware of the real life consequences of this crime. It's a condemnation of government and negligence much like Gavras' earlier film Z but it's much more about the emotional conflict of Ed Horman than it is about trying to thrill it's audience.Beth and Charlie were idealists some could even say radical liberals but Ed was a very conservative man who shunned their attacks on the government. He was a man who believed in what his nation stood for and through the beginning of the film he is constantly giving them the benefit of the doubt trusting that they are not being lied to. The brilliant evolution that occurs in this film is in the way that Ed slowly comes around more to Beth's way of thinking they start off on opposite sides but gradually come together as he begins to form a distrust in the U.S. government in Chile and a rage inside of him grows.Lemmon's performance stands among his best slowly developing a more angered and combative streak in Horman but never losing sight of the fact that this is ultimately just a man who wants his son back. There's a scene late in the film where he is pleading for his son practically on his hands and knees not caring if he is dead or alive he just wants his son so he can return home that is absolutely devastating. Lemmon and Gavras succeed admirably in bringing this heartbreaking story to the public eye made even more wrenching when the final truth is revealed or even more so if you read up on the events that occurred after the film was released.".

It is in all actuality the human element that first and foremost for CostaGavras is that Missing is about a young man who just vanishes one night away from a loving but perpetually cynical and liberalminded wife and a conservative ChristianScientist father who too really does love his son with all of his heart.This part of the story which CostaGavras latches on to as the dramatic sail to pivot through the documentarystyle investigation of Horman's disappearance could have been in lessor hands the fodder of a decent but unfortunately forgettable TV movie I imagine something like this coming on HBO to some polite acclaim as opposed to the divided but very strong positions on this film. But he wants to cut past anything too sentimental yes even with Vangelis on score providing some approximately mournful tones on the synthesizer because these are real people and they had to deal with this very real and tragic and horrible moment in their lives and so the filmmaker casts with a particular sense of accuracy Jack Lemmon for vulnerability and an intelligence that pierces through the BS and Sissy Spacek for an acuity with the character that still allows for moments of real sadness. Everything after Horman's vanishing is told from their point of view never cutting to some thirdperson scene with an authority figure.It's probably the closest we'll get to knowing the facts in the case as a young wouldbe writer and filmmaker played by John Shea who has ties to some possibly spiedon targets but is relatively harmless. One night as Sissy Spacek playing his wife doesn't get home in time due to the nightly curfew imposed on the streets of the city Hormon is taken away by some military force and he is nowhere to be found or heard from. His father played by Lemmon flies down from New York and at first is irritant when will that boy learn that this way and that away from home is not the way to be? All of this melts away completely as the fact remains he's missing may be dead or at best injured and the American embassy and ambassador make outright lies really in the face of not really knowing what happened... or rather having ties with the Chilean military force some good questions get raised about America's involvement in the Coup and how other people such as a cocky Italian friend is killed when originally said to have returned safely to Chicago by the State department.There's so much rich detail to the picture that it's hard to describe it all here. Suffice to say that along with Lemmon delivering what might be his best dramatic performance and Spacek giving her all whenever it's needed which is often the direction is exceptional here. If not quite the towering achievement of Z it's still about as close as one could want with the material. By focusing on the physical hazardous nature of this environment of a perpetual street war zone going on where gun shots pierce a conversation out of nowhere or an earthquake doesn't mean that people can go out into the streets cause of the curfew it doesn't become stuck in its time.Like Battle of Algiers Missing provides a stirring sense of what it must be like hell basically to be in a place an time where people are shot openly on the streets and terror runs rampant by military might. But there's also that human edge it's watching great acting and being absorbed in a story one has never heard of before. A shocking one. One of the best films of its year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the frustrating story devices red tape is among the worst of them. You can't see it but 'Missing 1982' is absolutely swathed in red tape invisible twines of lies and empty promises that may keep you momentarily satisfied but ultimately get you nowhere. CostaGavras' 1982 political drama is based on a true story and so as in real life there are no easy answers. Exactly how and why did Charles Horman die? Were United States officials somehow responsible for his death? Ed Horman Jack Lemmon wanders dutifully from hospital to hospital to every prison and asylum centre in search of his missing son gradually becoming disenchanted with the government bureaucrats in whom he'd placed his trust and hope. If the film's conclusion feels somewhat unsatisfying then CostaGavras has succeeded in communicating Horman's confusion anger and exasperation at the immobility of the political machine. Just as the missing man's father and wife were left without closure so too are we. There can be no resolution as long as governments are set upon protecting their own interests.Jack Lemmon was no stranger to frustrating film experiences. 'The OutofTowners 1970' is among the most exasperating movies you'll ever see for it demonstrates a perfect comedic incarnation of Murphy's Law in which nothing goes right and there's nobody you can blame for it. 'Missing' notably differs in that CostaGavras singles out a target for our frustration  the corrupt selfserving government officials  and so our annoyance swiftly turns to anger. Lemmon gives one of his finest dramatic performances as Ed Horman continually haunted by the incomprehensible disappearance of a son he could never understand. Sissy Spacek isn't quite as strong but her Beth Horman is quiet and vulnerable a woman of fierce convictions that she's too small to carry out. Any filmmaker should utilise a soundtrack by Greek composer Vangelis with caution for nothing screams 1980s quite so loudly. However it isn't all bad news for 'Missing' as the electronic musical score does actually add a sad nostalgic element of surrealism to the scenes of violence and bloodshed.I liked how CostaGavras cut directly to flashbacks without exposition or explanation leaving the viewer disorientated and wondering if we are indeed watching the past or the present. This technique recreates the confusion of the characters involved and emphasises that our narrator is not omnipotent but merely like Ed trying to piece together the facts as best as he can. The scenes of military violence with the contribution of Vangelis' soundtrack are oddly and eerily surreal  particularly the striking image of a galloping white stallion being pursued by a volley of bullets. The visitors to Santiago though the name Chile is never uttered are all strangely sedate in response to the bloodshed their schedules unfazed by the nearby murder of local citizens as though their status as Americans somehow places them above all this. At the film's end Ed Horman dejectedly states I just thank God we live in a country where we can still put people like you in jail. There's a deliberate hollowness behind these words as we've just seen America's policies aren't quite as righteous as they'd have us believe.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of all the frustrating story devices red tape is among the worst of them. You can't see it but 'Missing 1982' is absolutely swathed in red tape invisible twines of lies and empty promises that may keep you momentarily satisfied but ultimately get you nowhere. CostaGavras' 1982 political drama is based on a true story and so as in real life there are no easy answers. Exactly how and why did Charles Horman die? Were United States officials somehow responsible for his death? Ed Horman Jack Lemmon wanders dutifully from hospital to hospital to every prison and asylum centre in search of his missing son gradually becoming disenchanted with the government bureaucrats in whom he'd placed his trust and hope. If the film's conclusion feels somewhat unsatisfying then CostaGavras has succeeded in communicating Horman's confusion anger and exasperation at the immobility of the political machine. Just as the missing man's father and wife were left without closure so too are we. There can be no resolution as long as governments are set upon protecting their own interests.Jack Lemmon was no stranger to frustrating film experiences. 'The OutofTowners 1970' is among the most exasperating movies you'll ever see for it demonstrates a perfect comedic incarnation of Murphy's Law in which nothing goes right and there's nobody you can blame for it. 'Missing' notably differs in that CostaGavras singles out a target for our frustration  the corrupt selfserving government officials  and so our annoyance swiftly turns to anger. Lemmon gives one of his finest dramatic performances as Ed Horman continually haunted by the incomprehensible disappearance of a son he could never understand. Sissy Spacek isn't quite as strong but her Beth Horman is quiet and vulnerable a woman of fierce convictions that she's too small to carry out. Any filmmaker should utilise a soundtrack by Greek composer Vangelis with caution for nothing screams 1980s quite so loudly. However it isn't all bad news for 'Missing' as the electronic musical score does actually add a sad nostalgic element of surrealism to the scenes of violence and bloodshed.I liked how CostaGavras cut directly to flashbacks without exposition or explanation leaving the viewer disorientated and wondering if we are indeed watching the past or the present.

While such a film would seem like a natural opportunity for someone from the adult film realm to use as a segue into the mainstream a later production  Steven Soderbergh's The Girlfriend Experience also starring Grey  was released well before Smash Cut making this look like her second mass market role when in fact the reverse is true. All of which is too bad for Grey who is the only member of the cast who displays anything remotely approaching acting talent.The story such as it is is thin and one can suppose that Demarbre was merely looking for a vehicle for tongueincheek humor and gore. A down on his luck director by the name of Able Whitman played by veteran shock horror actor David Hess of original Last House on the Left fame dismayed by the critical reception to his cheap films special effects decides to use real human body parts to impart realism. His first victim turns out to be a relative of April Carson Grey a reporter for a local television station. With the backing of her station manager H.G. Lewis she sets out to infiltrate Whitman's production by responding to a casting call.None of this really matters though as the film's true mission is to emulate the low budget schlock of Lewis' films which it does admirably and is about the only critical compliment I can give this film.Overall the story is poorly executed trash. In keeping with the Lewis factor everyone involved with the exception of Grey seems to be trying to outdo each other on the bad acting scale. Lines appear to be not merely improved but takes are used that show actors struggling on the fly to think them up.Grey whose acting is wildly uneven is the only cast member who shows any potential of being able to believably take on a role whether or not this was by choice or accident given the atrocious performances turned in by the rest of the cast is a matter for further debate.What's unfortunate however is that this movie will be released after Grey's performance in Soderbergh's The Girlfriend Experience and look like a step down from a promising debut.What's not in question here is Grey's acting ability but the projects she chooses to appear in from here on in. Some of this may not be within her control given her ongoing career in the adult realm but choosing to appearing a mainstream film that has all the look feel and production values of a porn film minus the sex can hardly be taken as a wise career move.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two things might attract you to this movie if you're like C it's the prospect of seeing adult film actress Sasha Grey doing something other than swallowing massive meat although why you would want to see her doing anything but that is a mystery to me or you're like myself and want to see a movie that is a tribute to the life and works of the God Father of gore H.G. Lewis....The gore or lack of it is another disappointment. The effects aren't really the problem I realised that they were obviously fake to mimic some of the questionable gore props used in the 60s and 70s however I distinctly remember most of Lewis' gore being quite revolting and of bad taste. In 'Smash Cut' they are all played for a laugh which was a bit of a shame. In addition to this and contrary to much of Lewis' ethos many of the gore scenes are remarkably weak nothing much is shown. On occasion the gore is there with some guts and plenty of blood but certainly nothing which sticks in your head like in Lewis' movies.'Smash Cut' delivers an experience which is occasionally close to the great Lewis movies of old too often though it forces the formula too far with the 'bad acting' coming off a little to camp and many of the jokes coming too close to seeming like a bit of a micky take. There are many aspects of the movie which fall short but overall the main problem remains that for a movie attempting to pay homage to the God Father of gore it's not anyway near gory enough.Read the full review at beyondthegore".

You can see clearly that it is a manikin's arm used or whatsoever but the blood flows on a regularly base and a bit of gore is added. The only thing it lacks from is nudity especially with the scene's in a strip joint and the appearance of Sasha Grey know for her nudity activities and hard core flicks.

The poster is also misleading... what I thought was going to be a film about a killer nurse turns out to be something much less appealing. Bait and switch folks. And never before have I seen so many tiresome characters reciting what I suppose it meant to be witty dialogue. It isn't. It's just nonsensical garbage in service to a imbecilic plot so at least the two go well together.

Sasha Grey is attempting to pull a Connie Mason who was Miss June in 1963 and then started her actual film career by staring in 'Blood Feast' and '2000 Maniacs'. So yea this is like some kind of history repeating itself kind of stuff also the plot sounds like something H.G.L. would make.'Smash Cut' is a pretty good film definitely over looked and underrated the characters are either flat or fun and goofy the acting isn't half bad. It feels like a film completely inspired by the earliest splatter films. A fun schlocky splatter horror comedy and it really holds up. Its a well shot movie and the lighting is good. The writing is decent it's actually funny not too funny but it still has the gore and low budget feel to keep it entertaining. It also kinda feels like a Ryan Nicholson film. It's not a masterpiece but its still cool and a great flick! on the gore meter from one to ten one being something like 'The Corpse Grinders' ten being something like 'Braindead' Smash Cut is a 5 I guess I got this at FYE for 3 and It was definitely worth it hell I'd pay up to 6 for it.

It's up to spunky reporter April Carson a solid and appealing performance by adorable hardcore porn starlet Sasha Grey and suave private investigator Isaac Beaumonde smoothly played by Jesse Buck to stop the lethal lunatic. Director Lee Gordon Demarbre and writer Ian Driscoll lovingly craft a bright witty and energetic ode to blithely lowgrade horror exploitation cinema that makes the grade thanks to an engaging tongueincheek tone nifty homages to the grisly work of legendary goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis who has a neat small part as April's boss Fred Sandy and does a spoton introduction warning folks about the graphic nature of this picture outrageously excessive gore set pieces that really hit the splattery spot a snobby film critic getting bagged with a clapper board rates as the definite wonderfully ridiculous highlight and a wild climax set at a movie theater. As usual it's a total blast to see Hess go gloriously bonkers and bump off various folks in inventively gruesome ways. Popping up in nifty supporting roles are Michael Berryman as shyster producer Philip Farnsworth Jr. Ray Sager as flamboyant hypocritical preacherman Reverend Roscoe Boone and Jennilee Murray as doomed stripper Georgia Carson. JeanDennis Menard's gaudy cinematography gives the film an appropriately garish look and boasts several impressively intricate tracking shots. Michael Dubue's funky lively syncopated score does the righton groovy trick. Enjoyable junk.".

Director Lee Gordon Demarbre and writer Ian Driscoll lovingly craft a bright witty and energetic ode to blithely lowgrade horror exploitation cinema that makes the grade thanks to an engaging tongueincheek tone nifty homages to the grisly work of legendary goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis who has a neat small part as April's boss Fred Sandy and does a spoton introduction warning folks about the graphic nature of this picture outrageously excessive gore set pieces that really hit the splattery spot a snobby film critic getting bagged with a clapper board rates as the definite wonderfully ridiculous highlight and a wild climax set at a movie theater. As usual it's a total blast to see Hess go gloriously bonkers and bump off various folks in inventively gruesome ways. Popping up in nifty supporting roles are Michael Berryman as shyster producer Philip Farnsworth Jr. Ray Sager as flamboyant hypocritical preacherman Reverend Roscoe Boone and Jennilee Murray as doomed stripper Georgia Carson. JeanDennis Menard's gaudy cinematography gives the film an appropriately garish look and boasts several impressively intricate tracking shots. Michael Dubue's funky lively syncopated score does the righton groovy trick. Enjoyable junk.";

Poor Able WhitmanDavid Hessis a filmmaker whose horror movies are rejected as worthless tripeis this loosely based on Uwe Bol?and he drowns his sorrow away in alcoholic pity at the local strip clubwhere he often finds his actresses!. A tragic event yielding a dead stripper's body may just be the inspiration Whitman needs to bring more authenticity to his work! The lingering shot of the dead body at his disposal creates an enthusiasm in his producers demanding product just as presented to them. Desperate for recognition after being long criticized Whitman is so willing to present real he'll draw his own blood for a blood shower set up written on script. Anyway the dead stripper's sister and a detective join forces to find her whereabouts following all the leads which will inevitably lead to Whitman. Meanwhile Whitman descends into madness killing those in his crew in order to further add realism to his bloody horror movie.Someone has done it! Maybe this means little to nothing if you are not an admirer of Herschell Gordon Lewis but for those who love the guy Smash Cut could be worthwhile. I imagine that this movie will be of special interest to the David Hess fan club because he is the star headlining the movie along with gorgeous porn star Sasha Grey . Seeing Hess in clownface alone will be enough I think for his faithful to check this out. That or when he pulls the arm accidentally off a stripper who is killed in a car crash Hess completely distraught. The scene where Hess collapses after the incident where he drew blood is a howler! Oh and Hess even gets so worked up while gathering up his bits and pieces for his moviefrom the car crash victim!that he uses the severed arm's shirt sleeve to wipe his sweaty brow! Jesse's detective Beaumonde is a character of the HGL grand tradition..he's obviously modeled after Frank Kress from The Gore Gore Girlshe even carries a cane and is sure in love with himself. I have to say that this may be the first time the avid horror fan that I am I've actually seen a victim held captive in a film vault. Oh and how Hess' director goes into hysterics regarding how Hamlet is in essence a horror film when this is challenged by AprilGrey as a woman seeking a part in Whitman's new movie so she can follow him more closelyis quite a hoot. Or the macabre scene involving April unknowingly holding her dead sister's decapitated head while quoting a line from Hamlet. Hess has a lot of kill scenes where he follows up his grisly antics with some goofy lineIt's gut check time! I always knew you had a good eye I have final cut!to cement each demented act of violence. Lots of black humor on display. Is there anything more cool than HGL opening the film?! To have the godfather of gore a part of your splatter movie must've been a great honor for both sides the one for which the film is dedicated to and for the director to have his hero present and part of Smash Cut. Michael Berryman in a ridiculous wig is Hess' notsobright producer pairing together two memorable exploitation icons in scenes where they can send up their image. Ray Sager is a reverend who enlists boycotts of Whitman's movies and gets caught with his pants down by Beaumonde during the investigation. The violence is purposely lowtech particularly an absurd scene where canons of blood gusher after Whitman chops off the hands of a screenplay writer with a cleaver. I'm a little kind to this movie because it was such a pleasure seeing Hess having such fun in quite a wacky role..and nope he doesn't rape anybody. While I think the image of Sasha Grey in a nurse uniform covered in blood is an attractive one I found her lacking in personality. Still she's mighty easy on the eyes and I imagine there's a place in the horror genre for her if she ever decides to leave pornography behind.".

Basically the latest film from director Able Whitman David Hess has had many negative comments from cinema goers poor reviews from critics and very low box office takings and frustrated his only entertainment and distraction comes when he goes into a strip club. There he meets and takes home stripper Georgina Carson aka Gigi Spot Jennilee Murray and he is most interested in her that he may like to cast her in his next film a sequel to the one recently getting the negativity but they end up in a road accident killing Gigi and he has to do something with the body. In a moment of madness he remembers cinema goers saying that all his gore effects look fake so he decides in convenience to use parts of the dead body he has and disguise them as set pieces and props to use in his new horror film. Meanwhile television news celebrity April Carson former porn star Sasha Grey Gigi's sister joins forces with private investigator Isaac Beaumonde Jesse Buck to help find her sister and with Whitman being the last person to have apparently seen her she pretends to be a wannabe actress and get a part in his latest film being made. The new set design and the new more realistic props are met with praise by the crew members and studio heads and when more props are needed the madman resorts to going on a killing spree murdering crew members for their blood and body parts and he even drains some of his own blood. Whitman gets going on a return to good form for the film industry finding a long lost film to open the audiences to before his brand new film is presented but obviously his evil plans are discovered and not long before he can finish and premiere his masterpiece he is killed. Also starring The Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Philip Farmsworth Jr. Herschell Gordon Lewis as Fred Sandy  Radio Announcer Ray Sager as Reverend Roscoe Boone Michael Dubue as Alan Dackman and Barry Blake as Armand Parys. Hess is alright as the psychopathic filmmaker Grey at least shows she can act a little  but I'd have to see more of her in acting and flesh terms technically LOL the rest of the cast are hardly worth mentioning especially Buck who was dreadful well actually it was the whole film that was dreadful the plot and story are pointless and not all that imaginative it is predictable and most of the time tiresome no body parts and blood spattering can rescue it I would not waste my time watching it because it is an awful horror comedy.

Judging by the silly nature of Smash Cut I assume it was meant as some sort of horror comedy but fails miserably in both regards not once did I find the oneliners funny or was convinced by the story. Smash Cut is very predictable Smash Cut actually reminded me of the film Color Me Blood Red 1965 directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis who Smash Cut is 'dedicated to' I'm sure he's flattered not!  actually has a small cameo although I think even Gordon may have been slightly embarrassed to put his name next to this with the only difference being that in Color Me Blood Red an obsessed artist killed people  used blood to paint pictures rather than an obsessed director making horror films. There are supposed to be plenty of film related puns  gags but as I mentioned they fall totally flat at only 80 minutes long you would wonder how Smash Cut could end up being boring but it is the story which is obviously light hearted sucks  I couldn't get into it at all or like it. What else can I say? I really didn't like it I thought it was a chore to sit through  it's badly made as well.Smash Cut has a strange look although set in contemporary times some of the clothes  props just check that radio out in the waiting room are obviously 60's inspired which gives it an uneven look  feel I didn't like at all. It's almost as if the makers wanted to make a period horror film yet could only afford a few outfits  the odd prop. Despite featuring several porn stars there is no nudity here at all. The blood  gore is fake looking  not that impressive a guy has his hands chopped off a woman has her fingers  head cut off there are a few dead bodies some severed limbs are seen  there are a few stabbings including one by harpoon but little else besides some terrible special effects work as a guy has his eyeballs poked out with a scalpel but none of it looks any good or is filmed with any degree of suspense or style. Forget about any scares or tension or atmosphere or genuine laughs as there aren't any.Apparently shot in just twenty days on location in Ottawa in Canada this looks cheap from start to finish the production values special effects  grating music are less than impressive. Having made loads of porn films she made her debut in Tight Teen Twats 2 2006 it's on my 'to watch' list the gorgeous Sasha Grey is easily the best thing about Smash Cut genre regular David Hess is terrible  plays it so over the top at times he becomes laughable rather than menacing Michael Berryman turns up in a small role while the original The Wizard of Gore 1970 Ray Sager turns up as well.Smash Cut is a really terrible film with only a short run time  the lovely Sasha Grey to recommend it which ain't enough. Even the title is complete crap I mean what the hell is Smash Cut meant to mean anyway? Do yourself a favour  avoid this one.".

You just stand there watching their lives falling into pieces while the alcohol takes over the control and you cry not by sentimentality but a painful cry by pity and compassion. You are not even able to hate the dreadful father Ville Virtanen and the mother Outi Menp letting this happen to her children whom she loves.Seeing these things through the grown up woman Leena Noomi Rapace gives you the distance that you need to be able to suffer this emotional torture. She has hidden these experiences deep inside of her but a phone call from her dying mother confronts her with her dark past.The young Leena is played by Tehilla Blad and she carries this film with the same depth and intensity as her elder alter ego Noomi Rapace does. Rapace is the star actress in this film but Blad's performance in this film is the biggest remaining impression I carry with me when I leave the theater. ALL the actors make an outstanding work. The acting in Beyond goes beyond many good films and there is no weak link not even the young children. The continuity between the girl Leena and the women Leena is exceptional. Not primarily for their look but for their expression and how you can read their feelings and thoughts in their faces.".

	schema:headline " Probably the best cinematic work on problem about alcoholism";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw so many movies regarding problem with alcoholism especially focused on family issues. I however myself treated with that problem afraid to not become one alcoholic so I am very familiar with alcoholism and problems that it cause in life from first hand.Even I saw at least all of the titles about alcoholism that were published in film industry as well all of the documentaries I never found one that reflects that problem in reality so well.This movie have all of the important elements showing how alcoholism influence life and what consequences it brings.Great performances screenplay and cinematography brings great result as a complete product that shows how alcoholism destructs family life and how terrible traumas it left on the most situations in family life  and most important the children.The main character of the girl in this movie follows her life with that traumas and reflections in her adult life while her strong nature as her father stated in one scene keep her to survive that horror unlike her younger brother who could not.The spoiling would not be inappropriate here as I recommend it for the viewers to see it.This is not just great movie for all of us and for our families surrounded by that silent killer alcohol but as a reference to medical communities that deals with alcoholism and AA and other similar social groups that needs a materials for therapy issues.Personally I would like more constructions on some issues in this movie but I think it is enough as there are probably no any movie title that gave so close picture to the problem about alcoholism.".

	schema:headline " Perfect film about alcohol and related domestic violence. Well told story and believable acting gets us involved from begin to end";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at Noordelijk Filmfestival 2011 in Leeuwarden province of Friesland NL. It stood out between the rest as it gave the audience a topic of discussion afterwards. Living proof could be heard around while leaving the theater where dialogs exceeded the usual What did you think? Good and you? platitudes with other films. Apparently it brings about memories or at least something close nearby. Clearly not an abstract issue from a different part of the world or what only happens to not our kind of people. Apart from the relevance of the issues involved it was also presented in a believable way and with real world characters. Not all of them were coping very well with the problems at hand but that is part of all real life issues. I had every reason to score 5 out of 5 stars for the audience award competition.The story starts with a sudden phone call that Leena's dying mother asked for her. In spite of having lost all contact many years ago their subsequent journey forces Leena to relive memories from her youth. Alcohol and related domestic violence had a severe impact on her life. She never has understood how her mother could get on with it and accepted repeated promises from her husband that he would improve. Her mother also failed to take proper care for Leena's brother mentally handicapped due to an accident caused by her father. We witness a lot of that misery via flash backs showing the gory details and partly explaining her current behavior. Eventually the family was split up due to an intervention from social workers aided by the police. It rescued Leena from the immediate problems at that time but obviously not from the severe impact it had on her life.Towards her mother she is very defensive and unwilling to forgive anything that happened and spoiled her youth. When the mother asks to locate her husband Leena brings an urn. Apparently he died without the mother knowing. Nevertheless the mother lets Leena promise to arrange that they can rest together proving a tight relationship between the couple in spite of everything. It defies our logic and Leena's to say the least but from newspaper articles we learn this to be not unusual.The above is told in well dosed flash backs that interleave with what follows after the phone call that Leena got about her mother in hospital. It all starts with a 600 km journey together with her husband and two children to see her mother. Leena is very reluctant to take part in this trip but her husband insists that it is only human to follow up on that call. After the four briefly speak with the mother in hospital they decide to move into the mother's house for the time being. Of course the objects in this house trigger many memories and Leena does not cope very well in explaining her behavior to her husband and children. Rather than confiding her direct family in what happened during her childhood she withdraws. This does not improve after some heavy meetings with her mother. Sudden outbursts are the result mostly triggered by seemingly trivial things like cloths discovered by her children in some wardrobe.The script arranges above ingredients ingeniously presenting it all in a logical order. It not only tells us step by step what we need to know about Leena's childhood but also shows that Leena rather had let bygones be bygones. Explaining to her husband and children what happened in her childhood is not something that comes easily. While being logical in our view to share your problems with people you trust most it costs her too much pain to even consider bringing it in the open. Her withdrawn behavior combined with several unexplainable outbursts seem to stretch family relations beyond their limits hence the title of this film??. I cannot tell you that all is well that ends well to prevent spoilers.All in all I cannot think of any negative comments about this film. All actors including the children act believably and succeed in getting us involved in the characters even in the bad ones mind the quotes. The structure of the story is next to perfect. Finally as said before the amount of discussion it triggered among the audience is an extra aspect for giving high praises to this film. You should add it to your must see list.".

	schema:reviewBody "Swedish actress and director Pernilla August's feature film debut which she cowrote with Swedish screenwriter Lolita Ray was shot at Ystad studio in Sweden and is an adaptation of a novel from 2006 by SwedishFinnish author Susanna Alakoski. It premiered in Sweden was screened at the 67th Venice Film Festival in 2010 and is a Swedish production which was produced by Swedish screenwriter producer and director Ralf Karlsson and Swedish producer Helena Danielsson. It tells the story about Leena a thirtyfouryearold woman who is about to celebrate Christmas with her husband Johan and their two young daughters when she receives a call from Ystad county hospital. The voice on the other end of the line is her mother Aili whom she has not seen or had any contact with in a long time. Talking to her mother again brings back memories from a past that Leena has carried with her since the day she was separated from her younger brother Sakari and when she learns that her mother is dying Leena has to travel back to the small town where she grew up. As Leena's memories becomes more vivid she begins to show Johan and their children a part of herself that she has kept private.Distinctly and engagingly directed by firsttime director Pernilla August this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view draws an intimate involving and afflicting portrayal of a woman emotionally scarred by her childhood who has to try reconciling with her mother whom is terminally ill and a past marred by her parents' turbulent relationship. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions reverent cinematography by Danish cinematographer Erik Molberg Hansen production design by Swedish production designer and art director Anna Asp and costume design by costume designer Kicki Ilander this narrativedriven compassionate and psychological story depicts an incisive and internal study of character which examines themes like comingofage family relations immigration betrayal and class distinctions and contains a timely score by composers Sebastian berg and Magnus Jarlbo.This moderately humorous atmospheric and deeply moving family drama which is set against the backdrop of a town in southern Sweden in the 1970s and which was chosen as Sweden's official submission to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards in 2011 is impelled and reinforced by its efficient narrative structure and the heartfelt and involving acting performances by Swedish actress Noomi Rapace Swedish actor Ola Rapace Swedish actress Tehilla Blad Finnish actor screenwriter and director Ville Virtanen and Finnish actress and screenwriter Outi Menp. A humane and emotionally gripping independent film which gained among other awards the International Critic's Week Award at the 67th Venice Film Festival in 2010 and the Nordic Council Film Prize in 2011.".

But already on the way there we understand that going back is something of the hardest thing she can do. Through flashbacks we see some of her childhood years in a alcoholic abusive home which really has made her childhood something she rather would have forgotten.Noomi and Ola Rapace plays brilliantly being formerly married they sure know how to find electricity in their relationship but the price for great acting should go to the whole crew. The drunken parents are perfectly depicted in a film which I think maybe is the most brilliantly display of an alcoholic abusive upbringing I ever seen.Filming is bleak dark and very suitable for this story which slowly grips you in a way that when the film ends it's a surprise to you that you just spent two hours in it's company.It's also the best Swedish film I ever saw and therefore I give a 9 in score for this.

	schema:reviewBody "This is really a deep and very sad Noomie's movie but if i have to take one thing it will be that cry from her that i chose for my summary.I think that i have already talked about it in my review for You don't know Jack but watching your old relative in a hospital is so far the more painful experience i lived! Like the movie tells with tact every one knows that this hospital chamber is indeed a death antechamber and this realization is just unbearable for all of us the family in bed as well the fit family. You don't even have to speak the eye says it all and Noomi's ones are extraordinary for that. As you still hope for the unlikely miracle of recovery at a moment you have to leave for the night and as in the movie later you receive that dreadful call that delivers the long expected sad new. That's why Noomi's reaction is so authentic for me because it's exactly the feeling that should get out  i should have been there and as the movie depicts all the surviving family cries in unison bonding together. My experience was to have been raised in a shy family in which those kinds of feeling aren't not expressed with such violence so even if i have a twin brother i just feel so alone with my pain. At nearly 40 now i really crave to experience it at last just hug a loved one and cry all the pain i bottled up...Beyond this sadness the movie really cut another wound when it deals with dysfunctional family. If mine was a Vulcan one at last my parents wed for the better. Still together after 45 years with no real threats like alcoholism abuse or jobless. Sure there had been some rare tension with shouts but never even a small strike! So i realize that in that perspective my brother and me are highly privileged to have such parents while in other family this dream can really turns into a nightmare where kids are even more the victims than the parents. It was instructive to see that it was school that alerts social service as i really expected it was rather their neighborhood. Why? Just because unlike what happens in France where neighbors are totally strangers ghosts you never talk or know. Here everyone welcomed this Swedish family and they just knew i bet what happens beyond walls. So finally kind or distant neighbors remain helpless.If this is really one of the saddest movies I watched at least it's not cruel as the little brother's death isn't put in pictures. It looms heavily all the movie and a bit like in jude hideous kinky you expect it to happen suddenly and you get tenser as the minutes go by. But finally this last ordeal remains in words and the director is kind for that.The cast is outstanding the young Noomi is very talented and wait for the credits to discover 2 great facts 1 this daughter and son are indeed relatives as i found that they were looking alike. 2 this young actress was also the young Lisbeth Salander so also another young Noomi and that's good for them to meet again. As for Noomi she was as always very moving unleashing all her feelings. It was also interesting to see her play with her husband and again dealing with a character in a way speaking to her own personal story with her late father a bit like Bono runs endlessly for the mother he loses as a child....RIP to all the one who departed ! May you be happy forever and wait to rejoice with you Svinalngornabeyond....".

Here everyone welcomed this Swedish family and they just knew i bet what happens beyond walls. So finally kind or distant neighbors remain helpless.If this is really one of the saddest movies I watched at least it's not cruel as the little brother's death isn't put in pictures. It looms heavily all the movie and a bit like in jude hideous kinky you expect it to happen suddenly and you get tenser as the minutes go by. But finally this last ordeal remains in words and the director is kind for that.The cast is outstanding the young Noomi is very talented and wait for the credits to discover 2 great facts 1 this daughter and son are indeed relatives as i found that they were looking alike. 2 this young actress was also the young Lisbeth Salander so also another young Noomi and that's good for them to meet again. As for Noomi she was as always very moving unleashing all her feelings. It was also interesting to see her play with her husband and again dealing with a character in a way speaking to her own personal story with her late father a bit like Bono runs endlessly for the mother he loses as a child....RIP to all the one who departed ! May you be happy forever and wait to rejoice with you Svinalngornabeyond....";

Leena Noomi Pace is the daughter of Finnish immigrants to Sweden whose abusive and alcoholic father is long dead and her mother with whom she has an estranged relationship is in the hospital and dying. A series of flashbacks tell the story. Ville Virtanen is Leena's hard drinking hard living father Kimmo. Outi Menp is Leena's long suffering mother Aili who despite all she put up with in her marriage carries a life long love and sympathy for her husband. With Tehilla Blad is Leena as a child and Pace's real life husband Ola Rapace as Lenna's husband Johan. Based on the Susanna Alakoski novel with screenplay by August with Lolita Ray. Cinematography by Erik Molberg Hansen. This is a great cast and features great directing cinematography a good script and story and sound. It's a dark subject with spousal and alcohol abuse but not presented too darkly but very believably. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joachim Trier's brilliant Oslo August 31st opens with a lovely montage of Oslo Norway showing its quaint cobblestone streets sidewalks where children are playing and a captivating view of a nearby lake. As we watch long shots seen in a car ride from the viewpoint of the passengers we hear voiceovers talking about their memories and impressions of Oslo. Many recollections are good some are bad but all are personal and intimate the stuff of life not of movies. Based on Pierre Drieu La Rochelle's 1931 novel Le Feu Follet Oslo August 31st takes place in a 24hour period following recovering drug addict 34yearold Anders Anders Danielsen Lie as he takes on his first job interview in years after being given a oneday release from a staterun rehabilitation center.All is not going well however. As Anders explains during a group therapy session he hasn't felt much of anything since becoming sober. Two weeks away from completing his rehab in the morning of the interview he fills his pockets with stones and jumps into the water of a lake in an attempt to drown himself. Unsuccessful in his attempt he must confront his job interview that afternoon as an Editorial Assistant for a publishing company. The interview goes well and Anders responses are articulate and quite insightful and the employer seems impressed. When the applicant is asked to fill in the gaps in his resume for the last five years however he is unable to do so admitting that he was a drug addict using cocaine heroin DMT and also alcohol providing details not requested by the interviewer.Anders sets himself up to fail and without waiting to see how his past has affected his chances for employment he grabs his resume out of the employer's hand and walks away from the interview. Rather than return to the center immediately he visits old friends and makes an afternoon date with his sister Nina but unwilling to confront the pain in their relationship sends a surrogate instead. One of the most moving segments of the film is Ander's extended conversation with former close friend Thomas Hans Olav Brenner now a Professor of Literature and married with a young child. In a conversation that is devastatingly real Thomas tells Anders that he would be crushed if Anders did anything stupid and asks how he can support him.He tells Anders however that his parents are selling their home because of his financial debts a fact that no matter how true does not support his friend in regaining his selfimage. Later in the conversation the talk shifts to Thomas' lack of joy in his own relationship as he wonders what happened to the promise of his youth not a reassuring message for the struggling Anders. When Thomas tells him It will get better. It will work out. Anders looks at him with a knowing smile and says Except it won't. Looking like a somewhat hip almost tough young professional with an open leather jacket Anders then walks around the town with a detached look on his face more of an observer than a participant in the world around him.Sitting in an open air caf watching people pass by and listening to other people's conversations there is a palpable sense of isolation so deep and so penetrating that it can tear right into the heart of any viewer who has experienced feelings of alienation. Night clubs parties and raves occupy Anders as he starts to fall back into old habits. Though he tells a young student that he sleeps with after one of the parties Everything will be forgotten it is obvious that he does not believe it. He desperately tries to contact his exgirlfriend Iselin in New York leaving three messages that tell her he has changed and that he still loves her but his calls are not returned.Honest reflective insightful and intimate Oslo August 31st is a powerful and unforgettable achievement and Lie's performance is towering. Trier does not allow sentimentality to intrude on his character study of a lost soul whose pain cannot be hidden nor the hurt he has caused others. We can see the kindness in Anders' heart but not the strength or feelings of selfworth and we just want to reach out to him to tell him to listen to the words of the poet Rilke And if the earthly no longer knows your name whisper to the silent earth I'm flowing. To the flashing water say I am. Sadly we cannot get through.".

Searching for a meaning and a purpose in this new life he finds little in his friends' bourgeois city routines which he neither desires nor feels he could achieve anyway and their claims that it'll all get better fail to move a mind constantly probing and analysing the reality of his situation.He soon undergoes an intense conversation in a park overlooking the city with his closest friend wherein Anders pours out his thoughts of the time the two have spent apart and the precision of their rapport matched with the lead's acting make the whole scene feel horribly real.Anders wanders the oftenempty city like a ghost sitting in a caf surrounded by the hollow dreams of others Plant a tree. Swim with dolphins. Write a great novel and dwelling on the weight of his own existence. In two minds whether to leave the city increasingly desperate and always beautifully shot we follow him through the night until sunrise when Anders appears to us in a sequence at his most unpredictable.Undeniably disturbing yet intimate and tender this is a film that already feels close to my heart one unafraid to bring up difficult questions and brilliantly able to provoke an idea of the absurdity of it all.".

Searching for a meaning and a purpose in this new life he finds little in his friends' bourgeois city routines which he neither desires nor feels he could achieve anyway and their claims that it'll all get better fail to move a mind constantly probing and analysing the reality of his situation.He soon undergoes an intense conversation in a park overlooking the city with his closest friend wherein Anders pours out his thoughts of the time the two have spent apart and the precision of their rapport matched with the lead's acting make the whole scene feel horribly real.Anders wanders the oftenempty city like a ghost sitting in a caf surrounded by the hollow dreams of others Plant a tree. Swim with dolphins. Write a great novel and dwelling on the weight of his own existence. In two minds whether to leave the city increasingly desperate and always beautifully shot we follow him through the night until sunrise when Anders appears to us in a sequence at his most unpredictable.Undeniably disturbing yet intimate and tender this is a film that already feels close to my heart one unafraid to bring up difficult questions and brilliantly able to provoke an idea of the absurdity of it all.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oslo August 31st opens with a montage of the titular city revealing cobblestone streets teeming with cars suburban sidewalks on which children play and even the icy slopes of a ski resort. Some shots are devoid of people. In others distant figures dot the urban landscape. We see a few closeups of faces a long shot of a car ride from the passenger's point of view and a handheld view of a lake. As these visuals unfold random voiceover narrations play on the soundtrack  sound bites of anonymous men and women recalling their impressions of Oslo. Some are pleasant while others are indifferent but all of them are vivid strong and deeply personal. We're not witnessing a celebration of life the filmmakers are acknowledging life's directional axis in a simple direct way. We inevitably move forward carrying memories both good and bad.Anders Anders Danielsen Lie is two weeks away from finishing a stint in rehab for alcohol and drug addiction. He has already attempted suicide by filling his jacket pockets with stones picking up a boulder and wading into a nearby river. He fails to go through with it. We're not all that surprised because as he later explains during group therapy he hasn't felt much of anything since becoming sober. Successful actions even negative ones like taking your own life necessitate both an emotional response and the willpower to act accordingly. He's given a oneday pass for a job interview at a literary magazine where he's being considered for an editorial position. He will also reunite with an old party buddy Thomas Hans Olav Brenner now a husband a father and a professor of literature.Thomas clearly unhappy with his lot in life quotes Proust with restrained yet visible desperation. If Anders went to him seeking encouragement  or at the very least some semblance of stability and familiarity  he most certainly will not get it. This goes double for Anders' sister who made a date to meet him at a restaurant. He instead meets her friend who was sent solely for the purpose of passing along doubts about seeing him again. Anders tries to reconnect with his exgirlfriend who now lives in New York he leaves her several voicemail messages via cell phone all of which are unreturned. He has his job interview which goes just as badly as he thought it would. More accurately he allows it to go just as badly as he subconsciously wished it would go. If he truly wanted that job he in all likelihood would have gotten it.The rest of the film shows Anders wandering through a series of parties bars and clubs. He interacts with various people including his former drug supplier and the man who had an affair with his exgirlfriend but never once does he connect with them. He can't connect with anyone on this side of addiction simply because he doesn't know how to. Perhaps he knew at one time echoing the opening voiceover narrations Anders retreats into his head during one scene allowing memories of his welltodo parents to resurface as spoken recollections. Between his childhood and now is a long stretch in which he willingly forfeited any opportunity to remember something be it happy or sad. Now that his mind is clear he has become aware that he has absolutely nothing and cannot relate to others. He squandered his life before he ever had the chance to live it.Loosely adapted from the novel Le Feu Follet by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle the film does not make any grand gestures in depicting the aftereffects of drug addiction. Directorcowriter Joachim Trier simply observes. He never aims to make Anders a tragic victim of circumstance he's a young man who knowingly chose to walk a selfdestructive path. Perhaps he didn't know it would lead to total apathy. That doesn't matter you don't have to actually experience it to know that addiction leads to nothing good. Although the specifics of Anders' upbringing are never revealed we strongly suspect he came from a home that was at the very least stable so in all likelihood has no good excuse for being an addict.In an early scene of Oslo August 31st Anders sits alone in a caf filled with people. He and the audience catch snippets of various conversations ranging from the suicide of Kurt Cobain to a long list of lofty but positive life goals. They're intriguing in and of themselves mostly because we're witnessing a very realistic portrayal of attitudes and behaviors from sweet and sentimental to flippant and immature. But what I found even more intriguing was Anders' reaction to them. In expressing indifference with only anxious turns of the head and joyless smirks he paradoxically speaks volumes about himself. This is a testament to the brilliance of Lie's performance which even in its nuanced state is emotionally complex and painfully believable. As his character sits there both he and the audience slowly begin to realize that apart from having nothing he has seen to it that he actually is nothing. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

While in Oslo which he has not visited in some time since going to the clinic he meets a number of old friends attempts to reconnect with a former girlfriend and visits some old haunts.That is essentially all in the way of plot. What makes the film so affecting are the conversations he has with these friends about life feelings of regret lost opportunities etc. The conversations seemed so authentic and realistic the writers never gave into the temptation of injecting false notes of sentimentality..Even though Anders is an addict this isn't really an addiction movie. His addiction is always there in the background but the themes that the film explores are far more universal and general. And the lead actor's performance was very poignant and impressive. I definitely recommend this to anybody interested in a strong dialog and characterdriven film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. Though having no personal experience with drug addiction or rehab clinics I heard second hand stories of others who have mostly with alcohol but the dilemma's seem similar. The announcement of the film looked interesting and instructive to learn more about related issues. The openings scenes in and around the rehab clinic including an attempted suicide made not immediately clear in which direction the story was heading. But soon after that we got several chances to get involved with the main character Anders on his first steps back into a normal life.Firstly he visits an old friend. A revealing dialog follows on a park bench away from the friend's wife and kids just the two of them alone while meandering through past present and future. This is the way trusted friends can speak with each other. Of course good intentions all along and some wise advice for the days to come. It all seems to start in an optimistic mood.Secondly a job interview that started off very well. Anders showed interest in the magazine he would write for had formed an opinion about its profile and was very able to put that in words. But there was the inevitable question about some years on his CV that were left blank. He answers truthfully the interviewer seems to accept the answer after am awkward silence and nevertheless tries to restart the conversation. Alas Anders is too defensive and ashamed about his past. He does not take the hint that the interview is not over and runs away.Back on the street Anders decides to sit in a cafe where he hears the conversations around him. It seems an alien world to him. This does not bode well for his rehabilitation and his intentions to make a fresh start. We see him go down hill hour by hour and no sufficient incentives to turn around on his steps. What happens next is predictable. We can only observe and hope that something strong enough is going to happen to put him on track again. I won't reveal how the film ends if only to prevent spoilers.All in all I am very positive about this film adding up the quality of the script and the main actor. It demonstrates very clearly how difficult it can be to pick up the pieces after a few destructive years. Though the main character of this film is very well educated and in no way resembles the average drug addict we see in most films it proves still not easy to return to a normal life. It was very involving how the story line develops and is brought on screen hence I gave the maximum score for the audience award when leaving the theater.".

	schema:headline " Joachim Trier does it again.";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Reprise some years ago I had been eagerly awaiting for Joachim Trier's next film. Loosely based on the same novel Louis Malle's Le Feu Follet is based on by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle Oslo August 31st retells this story for the new age. By no means this movie happens to be a remake. The movie happens to have some similar basic elements here and there as well as different encounters for the main character played this time out by Anders Danielsen Lie who was also happened to be one of the leads in Reprise who this time around plays a wonderful role on his own .This is a story about a 34 year old recovering drug addict who has screwed up his life due to excessive partying doing heavy drugs and alienating his loved ones that at his age he finds himself stuck and unable to move forward in his life. As he's about to finish his rehab stint he's allowed to go into town for a job interview and in the process he decides to use this opportunity to visit old friends and relatives which in a way ends up making matters much worse for him. With all his old friends now married with children and successful careers he feels completely useless and overwhelmed. As he's end up being given the sympathetic pep talks or being lectured at by unsympathetic characters who are trying to protect themselves throughout the day he finds himself challenging their personal views head on while struggling to convey his frustrations that no one seems to fully understand yet take personally.In my opinion there's not much to compare Oslo August 31st to Le Feu Follet. Louis Malle's version 1963 which I am a huge fan of is one of those cinematic gems that storywise packs a punch. Le Feu Follet also stands next to other classic black and white pictures like Fellini's 8  as one of the best looking black and white movies ever made and I highly recommend everyone to see it.Oslo August 31st in itself has an entirely different approach and has a more melancholic feel throughout the film. With almost 50 year gap difference from Le Feu Follet to be told as a modern day tale this story depicts modern day tactlessness that society potentially sees these situations as almost insignificant when dealing with recovering addicts. Sure maybe some people will try to try and understand but the world is also more likely to let a person deal with hisher own demons for they can't be bothered and even distance themselves for they have their own problems to deal with no matter how much a friend or a loved one really needs their help to get through life.Oslo August 31st has been called a Devastating and Heartbreaking Film by some and I agree. If you're expecting to see another Reprise this might probably not be it but it could be just as great of a film depending on the person. I will even go as far as to say this can be a total hit and miss for some viewers. To me this is still a beautiful film that really moved me and made me feel sad watching it. I will definitely be on the lookout for the DVD when it finally comes out for sale. Overall make sure to watch this movie with an open mind then make your own opinion. 7 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "After seeing Reprise some years ago I had been eagerly awaiting for Joachim Trier's next film. Loosely based on the same novel Louis Malle's Le Feu Follet is based on by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle Oslo August 31st retells this story for the new age. By no means this movie happens to be a remake. The movie happens to have some similar basic elements here and there as well as different encounters for the main character played this time out by Anders Danielsen Lie who was also happened to be one of the leads in Reprise who this time around plays a wonderful role on his own .This is a story about a 34 year old recovering drug addict who has screwed up his life due to excessive partying doing heavy drugs and alienating his loved ones that at his age he finds himself stuck and unable to move forward in his life. As he's about to finish his rehab stint he's allowed to go into town for a job interview and in the process he decides to use this opportunity to visit old friends and relatives which in a way ends up making matters much worse for him. With all his old friends now married with children and successful careers he feels completely useless and overwhelmed. As he's end up being given the sympathetic pep talks or being lectured at by unsympathetic characters who are trying to protect themselves throughout the day he finds himself challenging their personal views head on while struggling to convey his frustrations that no one seems to fully understand yet take personally.In my opinion there's not much to compare Oslo August 31st to Le Feu Follet. Louis Malle's version 1963 which I am a huge fan of is one of those cinematic gems that storywise packs a punch. Le Feu Follet also stands next to other classic black and white pictures like Fellini's 8  as one of the best looking black and white movies ever made and I highly recommend everyone to see it.Oslo August 31st in itself has an entirely different approach and has a more melancholic feel throughout the film. With almost 50 year gap difference from Le Feu Follet to be told as a modern day tale this story depicts modern day tactlessness that society potentially sees these situations as almost insignificant when dealing with recovering addicts. Sure maybe some people will try to try and understand but the world is also more likely to let a person deal with hisher own demons for they can't be bothered and even distance themselves for they have their own problems to deal with no matter how much a friend or a loved one really needs their help to get through life.Oslo August 31st has been called a Devastating and Heartbreaking Film by some and I agree.

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts out with voices over the soundtrack telling stories about Oslo the capital city of Norway. The voices tell of loves and their most memorable stories of the city they love dearly  all intercut over various footage of the city itself ending with the demolition of a building. The title card appears and we cut straight to a man's face. This is our main character Anders. He's just had sex with a Swedish women but as we find out later he's void of desire for this act or the woman. He's a recovering drug addict on evening leave from his treatment centre.He leaves and walks back to the centre but on his way there his feelings overcome him. He finds a lake and decides to end his life. He fills his pockets with stones and stands at the forefront of the lake. Finding a larger stone he cradles it and descends into the water. but moments later he reappears crying and gasping for his breath. He goes back to the treatment centre as if nothing has happened and continues his day. This opening sequence sets the scene for Anders. A man who regardless of his drug addictions is riddled with personal problems and has no desire whatsoever to overcome them. The film follows him as he takes a day of leave from the treatment centre for a job interview and to meet old friends. The first thing he does when he leaves is to meet one of his closest friends who is now a father. They discuss an incredible range of topics covering suicide to friendship and worthlessness. The two are clearly at one with each other and as the film goes on you understand why he went to this man to discuss these things with first. There is an incredibly poignant scene where he sits in a caf observing the world passing him by various conversations flutter in and out of audibility but most of what they are talking about relates to him in some way. As the world passes him by so does the elegant camerawork focusing on the things around him more so than the character himself. A brilliant move from the director which really showcases how one man is no better than any other  a trait which the character of Anders is well aware of. As he meets old friends he realizes that whether or not they show it he's no more important to them than their job or their day to day activities. As a result of this he goes and scores some heroin no surprise seeing as he clearly is incapable of conquering any of his own troubles by himself. The film ends with an incredibly pivotal scene with Anders putting a needle into his arm. The camera barely captures it and it is incredibly ambiguous leaving you wondering if he's injected the drug or he hasn't  he keels over into his bed and it really is a mystery as to whether he's under the influence or whether he's emotionally affected by this pivotal moment in his life What has become of me? He could just as well have taken it but it's either here nor there. The film ends with a montage of images as it begun but this time with locations that we've seen Anders visit throughout the movie  a brilliant montage to end on. Oslo August 31st is an exquisite film that really does show how the world will pass you by no matter who you are or what your problems are.httpdestroyallcinema.wordpress.com".

Now at 34 he's in recovery and taking a leave from rehab to interview for a job but despite the fact that he's been clean from drugs for several months Anders is depressed. Stopping by to see old friends and acquaintances he volunteers his sense of hopelessness. He tells a friend that he can't accept being another nobody stuck in a nowhere job. Particularly painful are old friends who are reluctant to accept him back. Lei who is a doctor in reality skillfully captures the spirit of a highly intelligent man who can't tolerate failure. Oslo August 31st is a sensitive melancholic mood piece that flows quietly at a pace of realtime. It's beautifully directed by Joachim Trier and photographed by Jakob Ihre.

The sister doesn't want Anders in the family home alonebut her friend gives him the keys anyway. So real.I loved the truth in this movie. Ander's friend who quotes Proust a nod to the French origins of the story and then his wife chastises this pretentiousness perfectly. This friend then admits his life is not so perfect and he really wonders about itadmits he doesn't sleep with his wifea wonderful one line antidote the typical PC version of marriages.Anders state of mind is partly caused by the depressive blahs of withdrawal but also the stripping away of artifice and pretense from the humiliations of years. The exact truth of everything comes out in this state that is the intelligence of the movie. The scene in the cafe is wonderful....especially the puerile teenage girls wanting to do all these prepackaged exciting thingsswimming with dolphinsreading a great novel you remember parts of all your life...ad nauseum. It exhausts and irritates you listening to it.Of course I knew Anders was going to OD about 30 minutes from the end that was no surprise. The director does clever things thoughyou see Anders playing the piano and can't see his hands so you are dismayed to think this wonderful movie is going use that tired cinema technique of showing only the hands playing but then the camera moves very slowly and nohe really is playing it. That somehow authenticates the movie. This movie works beautifullythe initial drowning attempt then the ending at the swimming pool.Probably the best and most watchable addiction movie I have ever seen. Plus you get to see scenes of Oslo all of it beautifully filmed. As a non sequitur.... WWII started on Sept 1 so August 31 would have been the last day of an era? Probably a coincidence?RECOMMEND HIGHLY".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers! The story tracks one day in the life 34yearold Anders Anders Danielsen Lie ending on the date mentioned in the title. Anders is nearing the end of a drug detox program where he has been in attendance for several months. He has been given an evening leave to go for a job interview.We come to know a lot about Anders and his decision to end it all. On his evening leave and before his job interview he goes to see his old friend Thomas who is married with a child and is a professor of literature. The two sit on a park bench and have an intense conversation. It is from this scene that we see how depressed Anders is and realize that even though Thomas clearly cares for him there is no future for their returning to their old relationship. If an early scene of an attempted suicide does not warn us of what is on his mind then Anders citing the quote If someone wants to destroy himself society should allow him to do so makes it pretty clear. In this conversation Anders wants Thomas to know that if he does commit suicide then it will have been a willful decision and not simply a mistaken OD.Anders is fully committed to his depression making statements like I am nothing. In his job interview for editorial assistant to a literary magazine after holding his own intellectually he preempts the meeting before it is clear that a negative decision is forthcoming. It's almost like he is afraid that he might get the job. Ander's depression is so painfully real that I was left wondering if his depression caused his drug problem or if his drug problem caused his depressionprobably a combination.In one scene Anders walks the streets of Oslo remembering in a voiceover his family life from the time he was growing up. This scene is particularly poignant since we see that Anders came from a good family and was afforded financial and emotional support as a young person. There seems to be some truth in his remarking I'm a spoiled brat who f up. Nobody needs me.It's natural to root for Anders to turn the corner but he thwarts hope at every turn. The woman he loved has moved to New York and after several calls to her getting her answering machine and no callbacks that hope is closed off. In a park Anders looks up at the sun coming through a tree smiles and we think maybe an appreciation of nature will help but I think Ander's apparent appreciation comes from his knowing that this is the last time he will have this bond with the natural world. His sister avoids an arranged meeting his parents have had to sell their house in order to support him. So family support has eroded. Near the end Anders sits down at the piano and plays some bars from a piano sonata. It's impressive to see that Anders Lie can actually play. He is good enough to fake being rusty. After giving a remote hope that maybe music can same him when he encounters a difficult passage that frustrates him he abandons the piano.The film is tightly editedthere are no superfluous scenes the story unfolds in a fluid way as we come to know and understand Anders. The beauty of the movie makes you come to see how Anders sees the world and why he feels at a deep level that he can't go back and nor can he go forward. After a suicide the first question anyone asks is why and usually there are no satisfactory answers but to its credit this movie provides some answers in this particular case.".

After a suicide the first question anyone asks is why and usually there are no satisfactory answers but to its credit this movie provides some answers in this particular case.";

It's about old girlfriends new girlfriends parties where you can't drink family that wasn't adequate and on and on.And the temptation of real drugs beyond drink.It's odd to realize but I think the bottom line is that most young people live in a culture that's on the edge on purpose and for good reason.

	schema:headline " Sublime understated brilliant";
	schema:reviewBody "This has become an all time favourite indie movie well movie generally for me. I can watch and rewatch it for its personable style as well as for the way the supporting characters link to main protagonist Anders so believably that we as viewers are not only empathetic to him but also understanding of the history of his life and how that has affected his surrounding family and friends. I'll cite some scenes as examples of why this film is so personable. The first major one is the scene between Anders and his friend Thomas. We see both of their lives in a nutshell within a 15 minute cross sectional take as they regale regret and retell their shared and individual histories. I love it park scene when they almost row but then accept that they have reached an impasse in the conversation and settle with each others' different pathways in life like only very good friends would. The interview scene is another excellent one. We see Anders showing some aptitude at the interview but he tragically cannot escape his own past and self destructs after the interviewer discovers his CV gap for what it really was. You feel so sad for Anders as you feel like he could have actually got that job. Another fantastic scene is where we are looking through Anders eyes and hearing through his ears other conversations like we are also alone with him listening to everyone else's aspirations hopes and dreams but not able to find them ourselves  which becomes Anders' ultimate tragedy. And that absolutely brilliant spellbinding sequence of scenes after about an hour into the film when we see Anders officially reach a sort of 'point of no return'as he is seduced by the girl he meets from the houseparty  we get that electro style song and then the sound and sight of fire extinguishers transition into the characters cycling through a beautiful Oslo night scene. The short Vigeland Park then later swimming pool scene shows Anders' envy of the girl as she clearly has a life ahead of her perhaps with or without the tragic years he clearly feels he has been through. My only criticism of this film is probably it is a little too short with a final scene that feels a bit dragged out. Other than that nothing else to say other than this is definitely one of the best indie films I've seen and whilst some would cast it off as 'depressing' it is almost pleasantly melancholic in the most relatable and enchanting of ways. Good performances all round great script great job.".

The highlight is the performance from the lead actor Anders Danielsen Lie who carries the whole film on his shoulders and the great washed out handheld cinematography with its fantastic muted colour palette and interesting camera movements. However it does struggle with pace and content at some stages where we just follow the character without meaning and purpose before we get to the interesting moments which don't feel as connected as they could have been.

	schema:reviewBody "Le Feu Follet of the 21st century also based on the same novel basis of the 1963 film directed by Louis Malle is half the sadness half the emotion and a little more positive than the heartbreaking original film. A better result? Sadly no but in no way it could top such a perfect film. It loses in eloquence in rhythm poetry but still manages to present a real portrayal about a desperate young man who is granted a one day release from the rehab where he's been treated for his drug addiction alcohol was the issue in the other movie. His leave concerns about a job interview planned some time ago but his most worrying and decisive plan is his eminent suicide. He can't face himself anymore he's down and out and the only solution is to die or at least that's what he thinks. We follow a day in the life of Anders Anders Danielsen Lie going from his first suicide attempt to his release already worried about the possibility of his need for consuming drugs after being clean for a long time and visiting some old and helpful friends and also trying to contact his exgirlfriend. All the steps along the way seem to indicate that things might get better and he'll be able to continue with his life in a positive way. Is it? Those around him see it that way he doesn't. Just pretend fakes a smile and goes away with the original plan. Why am I more favorable to Le Feu Follet The Fire Within than to this new and free adaptation? The incurable romantic character played by Maurice Ronet although trapped in his mysterious reasons for wanting to die is a more relatable figure his pain was something I could identify with of someone who really didn't have any place to go no one to love he's completely lost in that time and space running at a different speed than everyone else he can't function while Anders is someone with a brighter future a job might come on the way and there's people who like him and miss him Ronet's character also has friends but they're too distant from him the connection is too broken. I watched Le Feu Follet at a time when it was the most needed and that sadness that frightening world and that honorable truthful ending probably saved my life. It was cinema being close to the truth it wasn't a case of movies trying to be positive and inspiring. I appreciated that. In here they left everything dubious tricky at times too positive for something that is a point of no return. Depression isn't so easily curable.And if there's something to be admired in here is the performance of Anders Danielsen Lie although a strange choice because he plays a 30 yearold but could pass as an 18 yearold very easily. He was convincing playing this shattered and helpless young man but the makeup department could leave him a little more weary more deteriorated it doesn't seem like he was into heavy drugs. Technically speaking the slow pace was quite problematic  works better on a Nouvelle Vague treat like Louis Malle classic was. It sure creates some magical moments  the scene where the characters are riding on bikes as the dawn begins  but it doesn't stay on that path for too long the quality of the dialogs is great in its early parts fades away towards its conclusion. For those believing in an open ending trust me that's not the case. The ending is the same as in the original with a small variation.Since ignorance can be a bliss if you haven't touched the magnificence of The Fire Within you can try this generic and enjoy it quite well. It's a mere palliative far from being the cure. 810".

I think it was highly unlikely that two East German guys walked up to the immigration officer at a New York airport and state that they are communists. People in East Germany knew that this wouldn't be a smart move. But hey it is also rather unlikely that a US official asks a German bluntly if he was a Nazi. And there are a few other details that might be historically incorrect. Whatever! Getting into this kind of discussion does not do justice to the movie. I had a great time watching it. Many things reminded me of my own first trip to the states mere months after reunification. Besides it is a road movie with beautiful pictures and sceneries from the American province. And the ending with its twist is indeed quite strong. It turns out that the movie title Friendship! is not only a reference to the official greeting within the communist youth organization in East Germany.

The complex that niuttaenrico suffers from can be healed elsewhere and with different methods not with hatespewing over the web especially not on movies that don't deserve it. But let me get back to the movie. As i said the comedy or the comedic parts if you will in this movie are put there to hide the depressive nature of the movie and sadly our world as it is and it is a perfect example of how should one handle life and living on this planet. We should try to overcome every depressing and negative thing with a bit of comedy otherwise we will all lose the point of life cause there isn't one anyway.Other thing that i liked very much  the director did a really good job to try to explain people's different behaviour on a pretty much strightforward theme i.e. we people form oppinions biasedly as much as we want to think that we are open minded and forwardthinking it is impossible for us humans since we are emotional beings to not get attached to a certain topic based on the tellingsretellings and expiriences of our close ones. Thus it is almost impossible in this vast world to not have hate built in to us for a certain thing. Only when we all get this we will have a 'pink' world. Other thing that was done very well in the movie was the jumping between behaviours as it is in the real life since we are emotional beings it is imposibble to not get in fight with someone that we spend a lot of time with which doesn't mean that we should give up but on the contrary to try to understant our behaviour at the moment ant try to find out why has it deviated and never never give up no matter what the situtation before you is. I should have sad this in on sentence but it would be the cliche line  We shouldn't give up on anything just because some ishes happened but on the contrary we should always have positive state of mind no mather the circumstances and only this will lead us to the promise land  eternal happiness. I would just like to end this calling out the other reviewers and say that i'm very sorry that myself being at least half a life younger then them am grasping the point of life and i should've learned from them... ha... The irony.... With this last sentence i also wanna add  Don't tell anybody dissapoint you in life but try to tasteviewexperience anything and everything before forming an opinion. So just enjoy life and if you haven't please watch this movie especially if you are in bit of a crossover on your life.Shoutout to Markus Goller  You did an excellent job on this one. Keep up the good work and of course no need to tell you to not get demotivated from reviewers like these D.Thank you for this life changing experience ".

	schema:headline " GDR meets USA but no charm";
	schema:reviewBody "Friendship! is a movie from five years ago which runs for 100 minutes without the closing credits and starts like a poor man's version of Good Bye Lenin. Schweighfer is maybe the biggest German movie star right now together with Schweiger and back when this was made he was also already fairly famous. The other central character here is played by Friedrich Mcke and even if he got most of the awards recognition he is barely known at all anymore now. Same can be said about Alicja Bachleda looks a bit like Shakira here the female main character in this one. She has a child from a previous relationship with Colin Farrell but actingwise she has almost sunk into oblivion. Anyway back to Schweighfer I always thought his great success is really more thanks to charisma and recognition value than to great acting skills and I am yet to see a performance where he really wows me. This is certainly not it. The film's director is Markus Goller maybe his most known project so far. He reunited with Schweighfer three years later for making Frau Ella. The writer is Oliver Ziegenbalg. He also did not have a great career yet but he also worked again with Schweighfer on Russendisko afterward.The movie is about two young German men who make use of the Fall of the Wall by making a trip to the United States in order to meet the father of one of them.

	onyx:emotionText "Friendship! is a movie from five years ago which runs for 100 minutes without the closing credits and starts like a poor man's version of Good Bye Lenin. Schweighfer is maybe the biggest German movie star right now together with Schweiger and back when this was made he was also already fairly famous. The other central character here is played by Friedrich Mcke and even if he got most of the awards recognition he is barely known at all anymore now. Same can be said about Alicja Bachleda looks a bit like Shakira here the female main character in this one. She has a child from a previous relationship with Colin Farrell but actingwise she has almost sunk into oblivion. Anyway back to Schweighfer I always thought his great success is really more thanks to charisma and recognition value than to great acting skills and I am yet to see a performance where he really wows me. This is certainly not it. The film's director is Markus Goller maybe his most known project so far. He reunited with Schweighfer three years later for making Frau Ella. The writer is Oliver Ziegenbalg. He also did not have a great career yet but he also worked again with Schweighfer on Russendisko afterward.The movie is about two young German men who make use of the Fall of the Wall by making a trip to the United States in order to meet the father of one of them. They meet a handful strange and entertaining characters bikers cartoon artists... on the way including a beautiful woman which quickly results in the two risking their friendship over her.

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary film follows a Finnish punk rock band whose members have a lovehate relationship with the world and with each other. We see them bickering at rehearsals tired and strungout on the tour bus and pumped up after a triumphant gig. Pretty standard fare you might imagine. What gives The Punk Syndrome its unique edge however is that each of the four bandmates has a developmental disability which finds them in a supported living arrangement in a group home. Using a cinma vrit style devoid of commentary or contextsetting captions the lives of the four band members are slowly revealed to us in a thoughtful sensitive and nonjudgemental way. We find that like anyone drawn to punk anywhere the band particularly main songwriter Pertti use punk rock music as an outlet for their frustrations and anger at a world that sidelines and ignores them. Pertti fills his journal with his observations on life and these are transformed seamlessly into powerful honest lyrics which fit neatly into punk rock's classic recurring themes discrimination for being different the dull condescension of the normal world the lack of dignity equality and respect for those who don't or can't quietly conform.The actual music of the band is classic rudimentary punk  think early Ramones  but effectively arranged and performed. We also get a glimpse into the lives of each of the band members outside of music and it is these parts of the film which are the most emotionally hardhitting. The scenes with the sweetnatured drummer Toni are particularly effective  we watch as his aging parents gently try to confront him with the fact that one day they will die and not be there to support him and we see his unrequited love for a woman who loves another. The scene where Pertti explains to the band's friendmanager that he didn't attend his own mother's funeral as noone thought it was important to invite him is also deeply tinged with sadness hurt and anger.Despite these moments this film never descends into weepyeyed handwringing over the lives of its subjects. The directors keep the tone generally upbeat and energetic and there is lots of humour in the band member's brutally honest but likable personalities. To sum up  The Punk Syndrome manages to be funny and poignant and respectful to its subjects whilst making a powerful case for the liberating power of punk rock music.".

Italy however was a whole different story There Last House and its homegrown pseudosequel Late Night Trains spawned an entire subgenre albeit a pretty small one known as the terror film. These films usually fell into two categories. Some are flatout sexploitation films like Terror Express and Escape from a Woman's Prison that are pretty hard to take seriously where others like Late Night Trains are pretty disturbing but are also usually much more stylized and less graphic than the infamous American film the one exception to all this was Ruggiero Deodato's House by the Edge of the Park which might even be MORE harrowing than the Craven film.This movie falls more into the latter category. It is a moreorless serious film about three fugitive bank robbers who rape murder and generally terrorize a nun and a gaggle of Catholic schoolgirls at an isolated cottage by the beach. The violence is pretty nasty but not especially graphic. There are three rapes including a fatal one involving a walking stick but they are highly stylized andor take place mostly off camera. There is a general lack of character developmenthowever so that even the strongest actors like Florinda Bolkan and Ray Lovelock are not as effective as they could have been having seen Flavia the Heretic and Let Sleeping Corpses Lie I would have expected more from a faceoff between nunheroine Bolkan and bank robbervillain Lovelock. The girls are all nubile but not particularly young or innocent looking Sherry Buchanon for instance had been playing abused schoolgirls since What Have They Done to Your Daughters? in 1974. This is somewhat appropriate however since the movie seems unsure at times whether it wants to pity them or sexually exploit them.The ending is interesting although I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Neither the best nor the worst of its kind.".

This is somewhat appropriate however since the movie seems unsure at times whether it wants to pity them or sexually exploit them.The ending is interesting although I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Neither the best nor the worst of its kind.";

The three hoodlums prettyboy AldoLovelockand his unhinged cohorts WalterFlavio Andeiniand NinoStefano Cedrati often resort to diabolical acts mistreating the girls and Christina making extra efforts to humiliate and frighten their weaker prey. The girls watch as Christina's clothes are ripped away by Walter forced to put on her nun outfit for their amusement. One of the girls chosen by Walter as a victim of constant abuse is held down as Nino penetrates her from behind with their sole purpose being to pop her cherry. It's even shot in slow motion for extra impact as Aldo holds Christina in a position where she's forced to watch without the ability to turn away. When one of the girls is almost raped by Nino she stabs him in the leg with a comb later caught after almost escaping by Aldo and penetrated with a large sharpened stick by the very one who almost sexually molested her. Aldo spends a great deal of time setting himself up as an innocent among two depraved monsters but he's even worse than they with his true self really awakening at the end when the girls revolt out of outrage for their captors' behavior. Thankfully director Prosperi doesn't actually elaborate the evil actions of the cretins in vivid detail finding ways to shoot around the explicit acts such as the vaginal violence which leads to the victim's death or the maid who is bashed across the head by an iron when Walter becomes enraged for no reason whatsoever. The film works off the idea that we will be impacted by who the chosen victims are teenage girls and their nun. The hoods are your typical scumbags relishing their activities watching the victims squirm in fear taking full advantage of them. They are cowards with big weapons who cause harm to those who supposedly pose no threat which always builds up the violent climax where the innocents develop a primal nature getting even with the ones who caused them such harm. Nothing really special about this umpteenth Italian terror film except the fabulous location on a fine piece of property overlooking a beach with a typically fine performance from Bolkan who plays it completely subtle using her eyes as a means for communicating with the viewer and has this strength which is credible and admirable. We understand why she snaps..although it's not a theatrical snap but a very quiet one where she contemplates her actions and can not overcome her hostility after the horrifying murder of one of her girls who almost got away and that also relates back to Craven's infamous film where a very mature and sensitive person can become overpowered with the urge to kill if pushed to the breaking point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wes Craven's 1972 shocker THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT itself inspired by Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING was such a popular and notorious film during its day that it spawned a whole slew of wannabes imposters and imitators particularly in Europe. Some of these movies were actually ripoffs while others merely tried to cash in on the familiar title but actually had little else in common with Craven's film. At one point distributors even tried to pass off Mario Bava's REAZIONE A CATENA aka BAY OF BLOOD filmed a year before Last House as a sequel. There was also Hitch Hike Last House on the Left better known as simply HITCH HIKE The New House on the Left aka NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK 1980 LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET 1977 TERROR EXPRESS 1979 and many others. The formula was pretty simple  have a group of criminalsthugs killerspsychos take a random group of people normally women hostage and proceed to humiliate abuse terrorize rape and kill some of them off before allowing the survivors to turn the tables on their attackers and get revenge. And that brings us to Franco Prosperi's 1978 cashin LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH which was originally filmed as LA SETTIMA DONNA THE SEVENTH WOMAN and was also released under the more generic title TERROR. It follows the above formula paceforpace plot pointforplot point and though it's watchable for the most part it brings absolutely nothing new or all that interesting to the subgenre.Florinda Bolkan who is too talented to be appearing in ripoffs such as this one stars as Cristina a teacher and sisterofthecloth who is spending an extended weekend at a remote beach house preparing for a Shakespeare performance with five female students. Elsewhere three thugs Aldo Ray Lovelock Walter Flavio Andreini and Nino Stefano Cedrati have just robbed a bank and left several dead bodies in their wake. They end up needing a place to hide out for a few days and stumble upon the beach house where they quickly murder the maid with an iron to the head and take Cristina and her nubile students hostage. From then on out the films plays out basically as a series of sexual humiliations gropings beatings attempted rapes and actual rapes. The captors do such nice things as making Cristina strip and change into her nun's habit in front of her students sticking their hands down the girls panties to see if they're still virgins and forcing Cristina to watch one of her students get bent over and raped in slow motion no less. The guys finally send Cristina over the edge when they rape one of the more troublesome girls Eliza Sherry Buchanan to death with a cane. The final revenge exacted by the women is almost as bland as it is predictable.Though numerous scenarios play out in an unpleasant way the film isn't nearly as harrowing or impactful as it could have been. One reason is the stereotypically obnoxious portrayal of the three bad guys which is so frequently OTT and onedimensionally sleazy that it detracts from the overall realism of the film. Another is the portrayal of the anonymous wideeyed schoolgirls who aren't allowed even a glimpse of individual personality. These are simply evil oversexed bad guys versus virginal cowering good girls of the cardboard cutout variety that don't make one care much either way about what's going on to whom at any given time. Bolkan helps out the best she can. She's the type of actress who is able to convey a lot in a subtle quiet way  minus the hysterics  and she did a fair job contrasting the grating OTT male attackers to an extent.So while this film is basically a lesser copy of something better and even sits in the shadow of some of the other lesser imitations it's still fairly well scored and photographed for what it is. The beach house setting itself was pretty good setting and there's enough nudity sleaze and sexual violence directed toward underagelooking teenage girls for those wanting to see that. Personally though I can't say that I was all that impressed. There aren't very many suspenseful or thrilling moments just lots of progressively tedious attacks scenes leading to a predictable and hohum finale.".

	schema:headline " The Last House Left!";
	schema:reviewBody "Well Wes Craven's Last House on the Left sure was an influential film as there's been a barrage of ripoffs released since 1972 and this is one of them. The Last House on the Beach tends to get put down and certainly isn't one of the better ripoffs to be released since Craven's masterpiece but still I've got to admit that I have a penchant for films like this and The Last House on the Beach hits the spot. The only real difference between this film and the rest of its ilk is that as the title suggests the action takes place close to a beach this time around. Director Franco Prosperi seems keen to capitalise on his film's only original element as the beach setting is often sundrenched and the director has seen fit to implement several upbeat poprock songs into the mix...which actually works quite well. The plot is paperthin as you would expect and follows a bank robbery. On the run the thieves decide to hide out in a nice house on the beach which just happens to be where a nun is taking care of a bunch of teenagers rehearsing a Shakespeare play...rape torture and murder ensue.The main thing I like about these sorts of films is that the focus tends to stay on just one idea which means that the audience is allowed to see into the situation. This film doesn't do it as well as say The House on the Edge of the Park did but all the actors play their parts well and considering that there's barely any character on display it is testament to their talent that we are actually allowed to feel for the characters. Then again it's always going to be difficult NOT to feel for someone that is being brutally raped and humiliated. This film never received the notoriety of some of its counterparts and that's hardly surprising as the violence is never particularly shocking and the rape scenes don't go on for long nor do they occur often. The girls in this film are typically young which gives it a lot more shock value but the real problem here is that there isn't a lot of invention and it ponders along which may annoy some. I do have to say that I enjoyed the relaxed style of this movie however and since I personally found the action interesting I am perhaps rating is a little above the rating that many exploitation fans would give it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well Wes Craven's Last House on the Left sure was an influential film as there's been a barrage of ripoffs released since 1972 and this is one of them. The Last House on the Beach tends to get put down and certainly isn't one of the better ripoffs to be released since Craven's masterpiece but still I've got to admit that I have a penchant for films like this and The Last House on the Beach hits the spot. The only real difference between this film and the rest of its ilk is that as the title suggests the action takes place close to a beach this time around. Director Franco Prosperi seems keen to capitalise on his film's only original element as the beach setting is often sundrenched and the director has seen fit to implement several upbeat poprock songs into the mix...which actually works quite well. The plot is paperthin as you would expect and follows a bank robbery. On the run the thieves decide to hide out in a nice house on the beach which just happens to be where a nun is taking care of a bunch of teenagers rehearsing a Shakespeare play...rape torture and murder ensue.The main thing I like about these sorts of films is that the focus tends to stay on just one idea which means that the audience is allowed to see into the situation. This film doesn't do it as well as say The House on the Edge of the Park did but all the actors play their parts well and considering that there's barely any character on display it is testament to their talent that we are actually allowed to feel for the characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Another vile and rapidly edited Italian exploitation effort that just mildly succeeds in cashing in on the enormous 'popularity' of Wes Craven's horror landmark Last House on the Left. Three bank robbers drive up to a remote beach house where they plan to hide from the police after a successful heist. Staying at the house at that moment are an attractive nun and five teenage girls under her supervision. The schoolgirls become the objects of violent torture games vicious rapes and eventually murder. Bloody vengeance by the remaining girls and the nun is the inevitable consequence. What can be said about this type of cinema that hasn't been said a thousand times before? It's meanspirited sickening and not the type of film to watch if you already feel a bit depressed. Peculiar however is that the victims of these rapeflicks continue to get younger and more innocent. I suppose it's some sort of competition among the directors to be the sickest bastard of all? How else do you get the crazy idea of exploiting sexual aggression towards teenage girls? The girls in Last House on the Beach barely look 15 years old so mission accomplished for director Franco Prosperi but the overall tone of the film isn't half as offensive or shocking as Ruggero Deodato's House on the Edge of the Park or Meir Zachi's infamous I spit on your Grave. Not recommended unless of course if you're on a sole mission to watch every raperevenge flick ever made.

In the film a trio of particularly brutish thugs led by the handsome Aldo Ray Lovelock breaks into a hilltop mansion to lay low after a violent bank heist. Too bad that the house they've chosen at random is occupied by a quintet of Catholic schoolgirls presided over by Sister Cristina cult Eurostar Florinda Bolkan. The three goons waste little time before starting to rape and kill the young women until Cristina decides that...well nun or no nun she's mad as hell and isn't going to take it anymore! The vengeance that she and the younger ladies dish out on their persecutors is both a swift and satisfying one. I must add that despite the plot's simplicity this film proved a bit hard to watch at times largely due to the convincing performances by Stefano Cedrati and Flavio Andreini as those other two maniacs they really do make for thoroughly hateful characters. Florinda as usual is impeccable and the film offers up some additional pleasures in the form of lovely oceanside scenery a stark contrast to the ugliness transpiring inside the house wherever did they film this? and a dynamic propulsive score by Roberto Pregadio the piece of music that accompanies Aldo's pursuit of Eliza the prettiest of the girls IMHO down the hillside to the sea is especially dynamite. Prosperi directs his film to ensure a good deal of suspense and in all this is a pretty darn gripping presentation with thankfully little in the way of explicit violence what is suggested is quite terrible enough!. This nicelooking Severin DVD also includes a 12hour interview with the still hunky Lovelock of today during which the Italian confirms that Ray Lovelock IS indeed his real name. The actor's sincerity and charm make the character of Aldo seem if possible all the more monstrous.".

	schema:reviewBody "As its retitling suggests LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH is one of the many ripoffs that came out in the wake of Wes Craven's terrifying shocker LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Each film is caught in a '70s time capsule of sleaze and perversion depicting innocent young women being terrorised by ruthless criminals. There are two types of ripoff in this case the low budget US grindhouse flick and the Italian knockoff. LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH is one of the latter and it's one of the most boring of the rip offs I've seen. I'd admit right away that these films aren't my idea of entertainment anyway I'll watch them for the sake of completeness but I'd rather watch a gore or kung fu flick than see women being raped.Of the ones I've seen the littleknown DAY OF VIOLENCE has been the best and has this one beat hands down. The problem with LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH is that there's a lot of sitting around and waiting around in between the inevitable bursts of violence and there's no tension or suspense to be had during these long drawn out moments. There's a certain repetitiveness to the action which makes this one a chore to watch. For me these types of hostage films should be all about the suspense but there's little to none here.Instead what we do get are a couple of deeply unpleasant rape sequences which are played out in bizarre slow motion. It's as if director Franco Prosperi saw Sam Peckinpah's unique editing during the rape of Susan George in STRAW DOGS so decided to try and make his own rape scenes as unforgettable. It certainly highlights the cruelty of the criminals and one scene involving a woman impaled on a guy's walking stick crosses way over the line of taste and decency. The only good thing is that the film is far from graphic keeping things off screen so the viewer uses their imagination instead but in a way this makes the horrors only more effective. I don't think I'm spoiling too much to say that the trio end up getting their just desserts but this is annoying as the punishment definitely doesn't fit the crime and is over all too soon unlike in the Craven film.A few neat camera tricks  disguising the participants in the robbery to begin with for instance  help to lift this one a little and there's also a good cast of Euro stalwarts doing their bit. Lead Florinda Bolkan subject to much humiliation here was familiar from lots of '70s giallo flicks like Lucio Fulci's DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING as well as playing the title role in FLAVIA THE HERETIC clearly the inspiration for her role as a nun here. Ray Lovelock is well known for his turn as the hero of THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE and he carved out a niche in quite a few crime flicks as well. Victims Laura Trotter and Sherry Buchanan starred in a couple of zombie flicks NIGHTMARE CITY and ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST respectively. Director Franco Prosperi was no stranger to exploitation having been the guy who kicked off the mondo genre with 1962's MONDO CANE. This is far from his best film.".

I've seen a lot of these rips over the years but this one here is without a doubt the worst of the bunch. If you're looking for a watered down version of the Craven film then this is the movie for you as the violence all takes place off screen and we're often just shown the aftermath. The rape sequences are very tame and often don't even feature any nudity. As with the Bergman film this movie tries to use religion as an undertone but it never works. The entire film is very lazy but what makes the film unwatchable are all of the characters who are annoying from the start and only get worse. The performances are what you'd expect from a film like this but the direction is quite horrid as Prosper brings no energy suspense or drama to the film. Florinda Bolkan a Euro Horror favorite to many plays the nun and does a decent job with the role.".

Since Brian and Mia Toretto broke Dom out of custody they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail. Hardnosed federal agent Luke Hobbs never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian he and his strike team launch an allout assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone else runs them down first.";

	schema:headline " Definitely the best Action flick in the series from 2011";
	schema:reviewBody "Fast Five 2011 is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel Paul Walker Jordana Brewster  Tyrese Gibson  Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges Matt Schulze Sung Kang Dwayne Johnson Gal Gadot Tego Calderon and Don Omar the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew Joaquim de Almeida Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script the players the action scenes the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up literally right where Fast  Furious left off. Dom Vin Diesel is on his way to prison when his partner former undercover detective Brian O'Conner Paul Walker and his sister Mia Jordana Brewster stage a daring albeit highly unlikely prisonbus break. On the run from the police the FBI and the media the three hightail it across the border and head even further south all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There they decide to lay down lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do rob a train double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes Joaquim de Almeida and his righthand man Zizi Michael Irby put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Dwayne Johnson and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the ledfoot duo not after Fast Five revved up 600 million at the worldwide box office. Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise. Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic highoctane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone Dwayne Jonson in the movie that was so smart like Dom Vin Diesel was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this allstar allaction movie with outrageous stunts incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto Vin Diesel partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner Paul Walker on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs Dwayne Johnson and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job  an insane heist worth 100 million! Five Times The Action! Five Times the Fury! I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights brawls and the heist of 100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign marketing the film through social media virtual games cinema chains automobile manufacturers and at NASCAR races.".

Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah still the best this franchise had and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest.

Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges Han Played by Sung Kang Gisele played by Gal Gadot. Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Well color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed it's always been big loud and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.Fast Five ditches the street racing that made it's name in favor for being a heist film. In this particular case we pick up right from where we left off with Dom being busted out of his prison bus. They then flee to Rio where they take on a heist that goes haywire and eventually leads to the penultimate heist of the film. In the meantime ruthless Agent Hobbs who specializes in tracking and capturing people arrives to catch out trio of outlaws. The film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action. And in the action department the film delivers tenfold. Far bigger louder and more exciting than any FF film before it action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosteronelaced mix of car and foot action.Now don't get me wrong this is still a FF film. This means that the script is still pretty laughable and the acting leaves much to be desired. However with that said it's still a bit improved here. Vin Diesel still can't play up emotion very well making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable. Paul Walker doesn't fair much better and unfortunately even as a main character takes a back seat to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. As action stars though these three do a great job. In particular the eventual confrontation between Diesel and Johnson is fantastic with it being a brutal WWEesque rumble. The climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission. Though laughable it's still an exciting eyepopping scene that will leave you a little stupefied. Certainly you have to suspend much of your disbelief with your film. If you can't do that you'll just find this entire film laughable and of poor entertainment value. For those who can though this is a very entertaining film. And for fans you'll certainly enjoy the film with a well rounded cast from throughout the entire series coming together to pull off the impossible. It's definitely surprising to see that the fifth film in the series is the best but I suppose that it's merely the evolution of FF. With enough money talent and by pulling out all the stops the franchise has finally capitalized on the overthetop aspects that they had always seemed to go for. Suffice to say action fans with enough suspension of disbelief will enjoy this immensely.".

	schema:headline " Sequels Are Getting Better Through Time";
	schema:reviewBody "Like a fine wine The Fast and the Furious franchise just gets better and in Fast Five my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was highflying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was and then I was starting to give up hope once Tokyo Drift was released yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when Fast and the Furious was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise but Fast Five exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean Lethal Weapon has had very good sequels in its heyday and The Terminator not to mention Rocky as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time it's like an underdog in its own right.The story on Fast Five is well above average. It's like a continuation from where we left off from the previous installment. The story involves Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel and the gang conjures up a way to escape the seemingly endless array of escaping from the law and family issues. There's another subplot that centers on a drug kingpin and a missing computer chip. If you have a DVR you could fast forward those scenes because they're really not worth mentioning. Which is all good but the main purpose to see this movie isn't due to the brilliant performances or a scintillating script. The hell with that! You're here for the exhibition of colorful highenergized cars the endless nonstop action and the attractive ladies. That's why you come to see this kind of movie.As I mentioned before Fast Five won't win any Oscars or Golden Globes but you know what? Who really give a damn?

	onyx:emotionText "Like a fine wine The Fast and the Furious franchise just gets better and in Fast Five my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was highflying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was and then I was starting to give up hope once Tokyo Drift was released yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when Fast and the Furious was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise but Fast Five exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean Lethal Weapon has had very good sequels in its heyday and The Terminator not to mention Rocky as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time it's like an underdog in its own right.The story on Fast Five is well above average. It's like a continuation from where we left off from the previous installment. The story involves Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel and the gang conjures up a way to escape the seemingly endless array of escaping from the law and family issues. There's another subplot that centers on a drug kingpin and a missing computer chip. If you have a DVR you could fast forward those scenes because they're really not worth mentioning. Which is all good but the main purpose to see this movie isn't due to the brilliant performances or a scintillating script. The hell with that! You're here for the exhibition of colorful highenergized cars the endless nonstop action and the attractive ladies. That's why you come to see this kind of movie.As I mentioned before Fast Five won't win any Oscars or Golden Globes but you know what? Who really give a damn? The performers like Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Jordana Brewster and Sang Kang are all out to have a great time. And the chemistry within the characters is quite mesmerizing.Of course it's all about the action in movies like these which will leave you breathless.

The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie like intellectual dialogue solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin who also directed the fast and the furious makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION and you know..In an action moviethat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So  umback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action I seriously have not seen this kind of solid  non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Ohso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films filled with cheesy clich's that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great it's these roles he should be taking not the flying fairy kind he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything and he really does know everything. Frankly that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film that's all you need. So this one is easy folks for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them you should know better you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action  seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars  beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.".

Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel Brian O'Conner Paul Walker and the former's sister Mia Jordana Brewster hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant they decide to assemble a team not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films such as Roman Tyrese Gibson Tej Ludacris Gisele Gal Gadot and even Han Sung Kang whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift hence putting the chronology of the films at 1 2 4 5 and 3 which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment keeping with the usual action laden elements while bringing on new characters into the franchise this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films it's make or break given the character's appeal and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their knowhow to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.And if it's action you're seeking it's action you'll get in this film too putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman Dom Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything and I mean everything along their path that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other this of course would be recommended fare. Stay tuned while the end credits roll and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film with no less than two surprise appearances. But no with the timeline it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys. For an adrenalin pumping high octane entertaining film outing Fast Five is that opener to a very noisy and crowded summer season to come.".

	schema:headline " The fastest and most furious ride yet.";
	schema:reviewBody "Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite  all the fans of the previous films and then disappoint them with a  production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a  remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse   this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this  fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors read on to see why.  Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off with Dominic  sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the  end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was  that they managed to break Dom out of custody dodged every authority  and have fled to Rio de Janeiro where every Brazilian seems to be  portrayed as a guntoting thug. In order to break free they attempt  to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all  become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips  through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs  Dwayne Johnson who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord  Reyes Joaquim de Almeida who wants them dead.  That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances  guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations  and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he  was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE  side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But  Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of  filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular  action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of  The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a  'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than  racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing and for the  record there's even an exwrestler versus action hero fight like there  was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone.  The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the  audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in  process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the  audience knows who what when how and why the team are in Brazil. The  second act revolves around the main plot element of the 100 million  heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew  plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand  would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours longer than all of the  previous films. The 10 minutes after a full two hours weren't really  necessary but show us the aftermath of the third act the hugely  thrilling act. Any who feel frustrated at the pace of the second act   stay for the climactic scene in the third act.  Think of Fast Five as the cinematic equivalent of a mindless muscular  athlete. Can't talk a good game but can surely play a good game. We  have all met that person that guy who failed his exams but took the  football pitch by storm at high school. Fast Five is as absent minded   plain characters and clunky dialogue. But the 'physical' side is where  it amazes  the action scenes of course. It's like the men behind the  camera decided to perfect the action scenes the plot was secondary.  Looking at this year's earlier films The Mechanic and The Green Hornet  it's safe to say that Fast Five has the best action sequences of the  year yet and is the best action film overall so far.  Verdict Forgive the simplicity of the script and get ready for the  fastest and most furious ride yet.".

	onyx:emotionText "Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite  all the fans of the previous films and then disappoint them with a  production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a  remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse   this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this  fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors read on to see why.  Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off with Dominic  sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the  end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was  that they managed to break Dom out of custody dodged every authority  and have fled to Rio de Janeiro where every Brazilian seems to be  portrayed as a guntoting thug. In order to break free they attempt  to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all  become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips  through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs  Dwayne Johnson who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord  Reyes Joaquim de Almeida who wants them dead.  That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances  guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations  and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he  was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE  side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But  Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of  filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular  action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of  The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a  'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than  racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing and for the  record there's even an exwrestler versus action hero fight like there  was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone.  The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the  audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in  process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the  audience knows who what when how and why the team are in Brazil. The  second act revolves around the main plot element of the 100 million  heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew  plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand  would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours longer than all of the  previous films.

Yeah i know it's high octane fun but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No but each one offers nothing new well unless you count drifting and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.I never thought i would say this but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.First they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence you were begging for it. Finally someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script how do you keep your audience entertained? Well the first step is to incorporate another major actor enter The Rock. Next you really need to buff up your script. Okay here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the Ocean 11 films. Yeah it's stealing an idea but it injecting more action into it which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad is because it's still packed with bad cheesy oneliners poor acting and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.Bottom Line okay people here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy packed with impossible action and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films but i like i said earlier it's still fun to watch. So with that being said the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones thats for damn sure. On a time line this should have followed up the original".

	schema:headline " Stop making these! Please";
	schema:reviewBody "OK You know when you're in trouble when the die hard FF fans behind you burst into hysterical laughter at the movie's very first stunt but then againso did the whole cinema.This film is the classic metaphor for the postmodern tripe that Hollywood has had the misfortune of ever getting into bed with since Get Rich or Die Trying.....you'd think they would have taken a lesson.It also is the classic overly used unrealistic stunts like the ones we would usually see in the 80's muscle films. Classic example 5mins into the film Vin Disiel drives a car off a train but hits the ground square on the nose and you see the wheel buckling.......you blink and the car is back to pristine condition......? And it was boring yes extremely boring for a driving film they're was about 15mins max the rest seemed to concentrate on developing love interests and avoiding the occasional rabid mob.In this case  get cars get paid and get lost................that's pretty much how grammatically fluid the script was.Plot  Once AGAIN ex FBI agent and Vin Disiel go about looking for top of the range cars as they're still broke and off the Radar only this time in Brazil one last job etc etc etc. FBI sends they're best man who happens to be a pro wrestler  but out acts all in the film by a long shot and his muscle bound team of trigger happy feds. But there's a Rio business mangangster with all this cash just hanging about in safe houses how convenient which they proceed to rob. Yawn! There are many faults with this film but my top 5 gripes are thus 1. The script  dialogue. Seems to be written by a middle school kid who is flunking at English. 'You Family' 'We Hungry' ' did yo slap or tap that ...........eh? Excuse me? Scripts....and Films like this using the term loosely justify film piracy. If refunds where available who honestly wouldn't demand one after this garbage.We get all the usual propaganda about how it funds terrorism and the other political mantras. This Film justifies the murder of cops stealing cars and excruciatingly bad acting. Please can we have a law in the future which states that actors have to be part of the actors gild or trained to an acceptable standard  by acceptable not hitting out with this urban degeneration of English.2. The cops just switch sides.......yes the cops that have no other goal but to hunt down and bring these men to justice just change sides and help the bad guys out...............seriously now get lost. And more to the point why does the female cop instantly fall head over heels for someone who is in the same circuit that killed her husband I found it was cringe worthy as the two of them swaggered up to the beach house at the end.3. The 'we need a team to pull off this last job' Cant we make films about someones first job instead its exemplifies the person who is sick of their day job in this case nicking cars and getting paid loads of cash.....but you can see the hypocrisy there. The team..........totally being ripped from Oceans 11 and Gone in 60 seconds films. The fringe characters from the previous FF films I never did watch Toyko Drift so I didn't have a clue as to who the Japanese guy was. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I type.4. They manage to rob a police station with more troops on the ground than America has in Afghanistan and Iraq and not take one single causality. Dragging a 10 tonne high security safe along with two medium range size cars??????? Who the hell where the two Brazilian freaks who did...... well what exactly? Jumped around spewing out jokes with would only appeal to someone with the IQ of a demented Badger. The indoor training to beat the cameras where they needed invisible cars. So the highest security office in Brazil doesn't realise that 4 of its muscle cars  yes that's right the Brazilian police instead of Fords have supped up NOS guzzling super cars as basic patrol vehicles are missing? And then it transpires that they don't need them. But just to keep a low profile they drag race them along Rio main intersection.......Yeah sure trying to be inconspicuous.5. The big happy ending for everyone......... laughable. Once again the cinema was in hysterics not at the badly time jokes from Tyrese ' His agent should be shot for war crimes for introducing him to Hollywood' Gibson and his obvious comic relief character as quite Frankly no one can take him seriously. The Japanese guy and the exmilitary bird just speeding around Germany in a supercar. The two Brazilians gambling in Monaco........For a team of people who wanted to just disappear they managed to annihilate a whole squadron of police cars assault Brazil's maximum security police station destroy half of Rio Kill about 40 police officers and then for their retirement buying the rarest cars in the world  always the best way to lie low for a while..........which government in the world wouldn't seriously just unleash the death squads against them after the above.??????? Hopfully this is the end of this terrible franchise and hopefully the end of most actors careers in this steaming pile of you know what.Watch at your own peril".

	onyx:emotionText "OK You know when you're in trouble when the die hard FF fans behind you burst into hysterical laughter at the movie's very first stunt but then againso did the whole cinema.This film is the classic metaphor for the postmodern tripe that Hollywood has had the misfortune of ever getting into bed with since Get Rich or Die Trying.....you'd think they would have taken a lesson.It also is the classic overly used unrealistic stunts like the ones we would usually see in the 80's muscle films. Classic example 5mins into the film Vin Disiel drives a car off a train but hits the ground square on the nose and you see the wheel buckling.......you blink and the car is back to pristine condition......? And it was boring yes extremely boring for a driving film they're was about 15mins max the rest seemed to concentrate on developing love interests and avoiding the occasional rabid mob.In this case  get cars get paid and get lost................that's pretty much how grammatically fluid the script was.Plot  Once AGAIN ex FBI agent and Vin Disiel go about looking for top of the range cars as they're still broke and off the Radar only this time in Brazil one last job etc etc etc. FBI sends they're best man who happens to be a pro wrestler  but out acts all in the film by a long shot and his muscle bound team of trigger happy feds. But there's a Rio business mangangster with all this cash just hanging about in safe houses how convenient which they proceed to rob. Yawn! There are many faults with this film but my top 5 gripes are thus 1. The script  dialogue. Seems to be written by a middle school kid who is flunking at English. 'You Family' 'We Hungry' ' did yo slap or tap that ...........eh? Excuse me? Scripts....and Films like this using the term loosely justify film piracy. If refunds where available who honestly wouldn't demand one after this garbage.We get all the usual propaganda about how it funds terrorism and the other political mantras. This Film justifies the murder of cops stealing cars and excruciatingly bad acting. Please can we have a law in the future which states that actors have to be part of the actors gild or trained to an acceptable standard  by acceptable not hitting out with this urban degeneration of English.2. The cops just switch sides.......yes the cops that have no other goal but to hunt down and bring these men to justice just change sides and help the bad guys out...............seriously now get lost. And more to the point why does the female cop instantly fall head over heels for someone who is in the same circuit that killed her husband I found it was cringe worthy as the two of them swaggered up to the beach house at the end.3. The 'we need a team to pull off this last job' Cant we make films about someones first job instead its exemplifies the person who is sick of their day job in this case nicking cars and getting paid loads of cash.....but you can see the hypocrisy there. The team..........totally being ripped from Oceans 11 and Gone in 60 seconds films. The fringe characters from the previous FF films I never did watch Toyko Drift so I didn't have a clue as to who the Japanese guy was. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I type.4. They manage to rob a police station with more troops on the ground than America has in Afghanistan and Iraq and not take one single causality. Dragging a 10 tonne high security safe along with two medium range size cars??????? Who the hell where the two Brazilian freaks who did...... well what exactly? Jumped around spewing out jokes with would only appeal to someone with the IQ of a demented Badger. The indoor training to beat the cameras where they needed invisible cars. So the highest security office in Brazil doesn't realise that 4 of its muscle cars  yes that's right the Brazilian police instead of Fords have supped up NOS guzzling super cars as basic patrol vehicles are missing? And then it transpires that they don't need them. But just to keep a low profile they drag race them along Rio main intersection.......Yeah sure trying to be inconspicuous.5. The big happy ending for everyone......... laughable. Once again the cinema was in hysterics not at the badly time jokes from Tyrese ' His agent should be shot for war crimes for introducing him to Hollywood' Gibson and his obvious comic relief character as quite Frankly no one can take him seriously. The Japanese guy and the exmilitary bird just speeding around Germany in a supercar. The two Brazilians gambling in Monaco........For a team of people who wanted to just disappear they managed to annihilate a whole squadron of police cars assault Brazil's maximum security police station destroy half of Rio Kill about 40 police officers and then for their retirement buying the rarest cars in the world  always the best way to lie low for a while..........which government in the world wouldn't seriously just unleash the death squads against them after the above.??????? Hopfully this is the end of this terrible franchise and hopefully the end of most actors careers in this steaming pile of you know what.Watch at your own peril";

A few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear when the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage containing the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of but when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars they suddenly get aware of the raid. Another example is when some characters are chased by police officers on some rooftops and vigorously time after time survives 30 feet jumps from rooftops down to the concrete street without a scratch. However the most unrealistic and stupid scene is a car chase in the end of the movie. I wont spoil it for you but trust me you will laugh or cry as all the laws of physic and logic are boldly defied.".

	schema:headline " Not a hint of realism...";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this movie had its strengths... and its weaknesses... First off great acting. All actors were superb. Good action scenes nice action shots and cinematography. The script was a bit shabby.. But I need to vent about my main issue with this title... It doesn't have any realism in the movie at all. None.First example A car drives in front of a bus they were going fairly fast but it should not have had THIS outcome.. The bus hits the back of car. The bus is then propelled 2030 feet into the air lands and is ripped to shreds. No fatalities either and somehow they snuck an inmate out from the scene of the crime without a soul knowing about it. The bus flying through the air from a minor collision like that is what really angered me.Second example An allterrain vehicle speeds along next to a train. Not only does it stay with the train for a good 10 minutes in the exact same spot without any trouble adjusting to the trains speed but it is clamped on with enough stability that a team of 2 can use plasma cutters to cut a wall large enough to smuggle a car out of. I liked the idea but it wasn't put together properly. To make things worse after a few cars are smuggled out a final car with about 2 feet of room to gain momentum with had enough speed to make an enormous leap off of the train and land perfectly with smooth sailing the rest of the way. This is followed by two men in the car flying off of a cliff large enough to kill anybody landing in the water below. In the real world limbs would have been lost. They land like it was nothing.Third example this takes the cake An armored vehicle plows through the walls of a police station.. I'm okay with this. Two Chargers pull up chain themselves to this 10 ton vault and have enough traction and friction to pull the entire vault off of the wall and out of the building. In a real world situation the cars would make no progress and spin out or the chains would break... and they take off! Speeding through Rio with a 10 ton vault wrecking down buildings smashing cars dodging people and smashing everything else in sight. This really irritated me. It even went through a large concrete building the chain being strong enough to tear the building apart. I have no clue how this is even plausible. The vault then flies around smashing everything in its path again still being pulled by these two wimpy cars. Eventually the police catch up. The drivers suddenly have the dexterity to move the vault and fling it to their will. They smash some more cop cars cause more collateral damage and then decide they are going to split up. One Charger takes the vault on its own and another takes off in the opposite direction. This solo driver suddenly has even more dexterity and flings the vault around some more taking out cop cars left and right killing people exactly how he planned it. Like I said earlier if you are pulling a vault the size of a building around in a solitary car the tires would not have enough traction to continue and the car wouldn't have enough horsepower to drag that monstrosity around.It goes on and on I wish I could actually watch this movie without those three examples. It would be great. I loved the rest of it. But save all this junk for a scifi movie... I can stand small amounts of movies being nonrealistic there are exceptions.. But not taking realism into consideration at all is a bit of a downer. Apparently physics don't apply to anybody living in Rio De Janeiro.".

There's more than a hint of irony in this fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and followon narratives. 2009's Fast  Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here  Matt Schulze's Vince from number one Tyrese's bigmouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from FF  with a postcredits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as in addition to the 'who's who' lineup of costars there are references to the previous movies and characters that don't appear and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe along with the marvellously tongueincheek mood notches up a level of interest not before seen in the carcrazy franchise.After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift and failing to impress with Fast  Furious filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition or mere conversation is required however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fastpaced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train with a marvellously ridiculous denouement a Bourneesque freerunning chase along roof tops and a bruising handtohand melee between The Rock and big Vin.Of the major stars it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic badass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny  something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chromedomed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.Thanks to Morgan's decent script Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's toughasnails turn this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.3.5 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Average 3  Good 4  Great 5  Brilliant".

When karate expert Richard Norton steals it Michael Dudikoff is recruited to steal it back. Flying into enemy territory with an SR71 and comedic sidekick Gary Hudson Dudikoff sets out to recover the stolen aircraft finding help from a local villager BAYWATCH beauty Nancy Valen. Sadly that's a body double for Valen during the nude scene. One of my favorite scenes is towards the end when Dudikoff takes on a whole airfield full of enemy soldiers with a machine gun and a couple grenades. The climactic dogfight between Dudikoff and Norton has some cheapo effects especially of that missile flying around but it's all tongueincheek fluff that can turn a rainy Saturday afternoon into something fun.".

For me the worst portion of the movie came via the ridiculous and suicidally dumb Libyan soldiers charging the opposition openly and without proper cover. How stupid can you get Mr Director ? And how is it possible for two guys with handpistols and limited ammunition to fight off several soldiers with machineguns and other automatic weapons...doesn't make sense. Even more so the director finds enough time between gunfire exchanges to allow the hero to say farewell to one of his wounded buddies...ridiculous.On the positive side I must say I've heard alot about Landon Hall and the scene or sceneswhere she struts her stuff makes this film worth the while.

So F16s are shown as US fighter jets. Nothing unusual. To depict the Nova Stealth' a IAI Kfir is used although the intro shows a Mirage 2000. The angular lines of the Kfir do not make a realistic modern fighter. Ok the choice is limited. Using the F16 again as the B3' bomber without any external stores is confusing. It gets even more confusing as the villain pursues our hero using again a F16 supposed to be Libyan. The airfield from which the villain started has a lineup of Kfirs. Why the Libyans have several of this modern stealth Nova' aircraft is not explained. There is supposed to be a single prototype of this aircraft! Maybe the viewer will not recognize the similarity? Ok using a SR71 to pursuit a fighter aircraft is ridiculous but landing this aircraft in the Libyan dessert not shown is probably more science fiction than the supposed stealth technology. The Nova' is completely invisible except the infrared for some minute.The acting is really deplorable. The action non aircraft is worse than done in the ATeam' television series.The aircraft action probably consists entirely of existing footage making this a very cheap movie to make. Some footage as the lowpass of the KfirNova is shown at least three times!This move is definitely a mustsee for aircraft buffs. If only to have a good laugh.".

Only Michael Dudikoff can stop the bad guys. Dudikoff looks surprisingly aged here considering it's only a decade since he first came to fame in the late '80s he looks almost constipated at times and like he needs to go on a diet although not quite as bad as Seagal.

It's a good suspenseful movie with nice effects a decent story and some good performances except for the girl who plays the effects assistant though she's not onscreen a lot. Bryan Brown plays Roland Tyler a freelance special effects artist who seeks revenge after some shady Justice Department guys set him up to be the fall guy in a staged execution they had hired him to pull off. Brian Dennehy doesn't enter the film until nearly forty minutes into the picture but once he does he's as good as always even if his character just sort of moves from place to place and effortlessly picks up clues along the way. I would have liked to seen the two stars have more scenes together but they never even meet up until the final scene of the movie. Cliff DeYoung does his usual weasel villain though he mysteriously vanishes from the film without explanation and Jerry Orbach is good in a supporting role as the mobster whose execution is staged. The effects used by Tyler aren't as spectacular as I had thought they would be disguises to avoid police smoke bombs fake blood etc. but they're used effectively. FX is an entertaining little movie with a fair amount of suspense and some good action. Oh and what I wouldn't give to have that home security system Tyler has inside his front door. The sequel's not bad either.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was something about 80s action movies that recent films in the genre haven't been able to capitalize on. I think a lot of it has to do with lack of originality as the genre has been notorious for an excess of remakes of old action movies or Hollywood versions of foreign action films new or old. But there's just something about them that aren't exciting anymore. At least not all of them. The 80s for me seemed to have some of the best of the genreThe Terminator the Mad Max trilogy etc. FX is one of them. A cool story with good action sequences. Rollie Tyler Bryan Brown special effects genius is hired by the FBI to use his expertise in a setup to fake the death of mobster Nicholas DeFranco who they claim is going to be their informant. However as Tyler will soon become very familiar with the arrangement is a hoax and the agents aren't who they seem. Unfortunately Tyler who thought he was doing something good and reluctantly so he is caught in the middle of a game of cat and mouse because he is considered loose ends. They kill his girlfriend in the scuffle and Tyler soon realizes who he's up against because these guys will stop at nothing until he's dead regardless of who they kill in the crossfire. But Tyler is no dummy. He gets smart and uses his special effects genius to keep one step ahead of the paranoid agents who want him dead. In the meantime our middleman is Brian Dennehy as the smoothtalking detective Leo McCarthy. He's the only one with any guts to sense foul play is afoot and the only one really willing to help out Rollie. The object of the game is to find out what kind of dirty business those crooked agents Lipton Cliff DeYoung and Mason Mason Adams are up to and what it has to do with faking the death of a notorious mobster Jerry Orbach. The movie has some pretty good action and chase sequences and the finale is a cool idea as Rollie Tyler has to use some clever special effects to put a stop to enemies. He's got a pretty big bag of tricks up his sleeves. Though a little slow at first the real fun begins once Rollie is hired by those mysterious agents to do a job. Overall it's a pretty cool movie with a great idea for a story. If you enjoy this movie you'd probably like the sequel FX 2 which is quite similar using the story of Rollie Tyler being set up for another mysterious cop scheme. Only with all the corruption going on in that story Tyler's mishaps in the first look like small potatoes. Plus Dennehy gets a bigger part this time teaming up with Tyler you'll see why in the finale of FX part 1. They're both worth a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie special effects man is running for his life in FX a 1986 film starring Bryan Brown Brian Dennehy Jerry Orbach and Mason Adams. Strangely enough the movie also features two actresses from my alma mater Diana Venora and Josie de Guzman.Rollie Tyler Brown takes on a rush job for the government  they want it to look as if their primo informant Orbach has been murdered to take the danger out of getting him to the courtroom and protecting him afterward. But like Rollie's work things aren't what they seem and Rollie finds himself on the run.Despite its name FX isn't a big movie and the special effects are things you can see on any television show. What makes it unique is the way Rollie uses his wits and skill to elude those after him. One of the most exciting scenes occurs as Rollie in his FX van careens through the streets of New York using every trick he knows to get away from the police. Not your average car chase.Australian actor Bryan Brown who achieved fame and a beautiful wife from the miniseries The Thorn Birds is terrific as the desperate Rollie. Brian Dennehy plays a rogue cop  he's funny and effective and the late Jerry Orbach whose career spanned stage films and television is the perfect mob informant.FX inspired a television show of the same name starring Cameron Daddo and also a sequel. For a little movie it did quite well managing to entertain with drama humor and thrills. It's a lot of fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "A movie special effects man is running for his life in FX a 1986 film starring Bryan Brown Brian Dennehy Jerry Orbach and Mason Adams. Strangely enough the movie also features two actresses from my alma mater Diana Venora and Josie de Guzman.Rollie Tyler Brown takes on a rush job for the government  they want it to look as if their primo informant Orbach has been murdered to take the danger out of getting him to the courtroom and protecting him afterward. But like Rollie's work things aren't what they seem and Rollie finds himself on the run.Despite its name FX isn't a big movie and the special effects are things you can see on any television show. What makes it unique is the way Rollie uses his wits and skill to elude those after him. One of the most exciting scenes occurs as Rollie in his FX van careens through the streets of New York using every trick he knows to get away from the police. Not your average car chase.Australian actor Bryan Brown who achieved fame and a beautiful wife from the miniseries The Thorn Birds is terrific as the desperate Rollie. Brian Dennehy plays a rogue cop  he's funny and effective and the late Jerry Orbach whose career spanned stage films and television is the perfect mob informant.FX inspired a television show of the same name starring Cameron Daddo and also a sequel. For a little movie it did quite well managing to entertain with drama humor and thrills. It's a lot of fun.";

But upon just surfing to cable's AMC channel one weekend morning and finding it having just begun  I watched for a couple of minutes and found myself absorbed in it. After looking at some of the previouslyposted comments in this section of IMDb during commercials I was even more interested. First my regard for Brown is heightened. Anyone married to Rachel Ward for 23 years has to have a lot going for him  even beyond what you see onscreen. And actors with BritishAustralian accents all provide effective menontherun harried dangerbeset characterizations. The acting here is all good. The late Trey Wilson as Denehy's unctuous NYPD colleague evokes memories of his smallbutkey scenestealing roles in Twins and Raising Arizona. Cliff De Young as the even more unctuous pursuerwouldbe killer of the endangered Brown could from this and prior roles be Hollywood's solution to replace Dabney Coleman as the quintessential smarmy horse's ass now that Dabney is getting wellalong in years. As with all his roles Mason Adams gives a good performance  but I can never watch him without expecting that any moment he is going to take a Smucker's jar from his pocket and begin a spiel. Brian Dennehy is always fun to watch and his gruffbutstilllikable persona was never bettersuited to a role than here  he's the only one except for one assistant who has a clue literally and figuratively of the shenanigans occurring and besetting poor Rollie Brown. Give this film a solid 8. Enjoyed the final minutes and the ending. I'm looking forward to getting a copy of the sequel.".

De Young has the kind of face and attitude that makes you want to slap that sucker every time you see him! All three actors are convincing in their roles. Brian Dennehy plays his usual profane tough cop role and Diane Venora is kind of unmemorable to be honest as Rollie's girlfriend.The inventive story is the best part of this film which was even more interesting when it came out because ever since James Bond special effects were still something pretty new to most of us movie viewers and it was fascinating to see how certain things are rigged. Nowadays special effects are something that seems to be a normal part of moviewatching although cool gadgets are always fun. Still there a some very clever things in here and the movie provides good suspense and excellent twists. You never know what to expect. The film was popular enough to spawn a sequel.".

Car chasing shootouts and a theme song concocted to perfectly match with the movie it's for running over the end credits. Not every last one of those are good though they tend to be entertaining. Fortunately this one is both. And quite original and creative too. Brown stars as Rollie Tyler a special effects genius who is hired to help fake the death of a mobster Orbach who's going into a witness protection program. However something goes wrong and our lead now believes that he accidentally did kill him. The plot holds several surprises and twists and it's carefully written enough to keep you guessing without being pretentious or overly difficult to follow and the pieces of the puzzle fit together nicely after you've seen them all. This has great pacing it never slows down or is in a hurry. The suspense is quite excellent and you may find yourself on the edge of your seat numerous times. This is 100 minutes of pure fun and it never fails to deliver. The humor almost invariably works. Acting ranges. This has incredibly memorable moments and dialog you can quote. The DVD only holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of this type of film andor anyone involved in making it. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "There was something about 80s action movies that recent films in the genre haven't been able to capitalize on. I think a lot of it has to do with lack of originality as the genre has been notorious for an excess of remakes of old action movies or Hollywood versions of foreign action films new or old. But there's just something about them that aren't exciting anymore. At least not all of them. The 80s for me seemed to have some of the best of the genreThe Terminator the Mad Max trilogy etc. FX is one of them. A cool story with good action sequences. Rollie Tyler Bryan Brown special effects genius is hired by the FBI to use his expertise in a setup to fake the death of mobster Nicholas DeFranco who they claim is going to be their informant. However as Tyler will soon become very familiar with the arrangement is a hoax and the agents aren't who they seem. Unfortunately Tyler who thought he was doing something good and reluctantly so he is caught in the middle of a game of cat and mouse because he is considered loose ends. They kill his girlfriend in the scuffle and Tyler soon realizes who he's up against because these guys will stop at nothing until he's dead regardless of who they kill in the crossfire. But Tyler is no dummy. He gets smart and uses his special effects genius to keep one step ahead of the paranoid agents who want him dead. In the meantime our middleman is Brian Dennehy as the smoothtalking detective Leo McCarthy. He's the only one with any guts to sense foul play is afoot and the only one really willing to help out Rollie. The object of the game is to find out what kind of dirty business those crooked agents Lipton Cliff DeYoung and Mason Mason Adams are up to and what it has to do with faking the death of a notorious mobster Jerry Orbach. The movie has some pretty good action and chase sequences and the finale is a cool idea as Rollie Tyler has to use some clever special effects to put a stop to enemies. He's got a pretty big bag of tricks up his sleeves. Though a little slow at first the real fun begins once Rollie is hired by those mysterious agents to do a job. Overall it's a pretty cool movie with a great idea for a story. If you enjoy this movie you'd probably like the sequel FX 2 which is quite similar using the story of Rollie Tyler being set up for another mysterious cop scheme. Only with all the corruption going on in that story Tyler's mishaps in the first look like small potatoes. Plus Dennehy gets a bigger part this time teaming up with Tyler you'll see why in the finale of FX part 1. They're both worth a try.".

	onyx:emotionText "There was something about 80s action movies that recent films in the genre haven't been able to capitalize on. I think a lot of it has to do with lack of originality as the genre has been notorious for an excess of remakes of old action movies or Hollywood versions of foreign action films new or old. But there's just something about them that aren't exciting anymore. At least not all of them. The 80s for me seemed to have some of the best of the genreThe Terminator the Mad Max trilogy etc. FX is one of them. A cool story with good action sequences.

In the van chase scene he is oblivious to the public menace he is causing in using his fx tricks. This could have been mitigated with a single line of dialog or a look of concern but never mind. I wanted to like Martha Gehman's character as Brown's assistant but she lost me with her gleeful I wish I could have seen the look on his face when she tricked the pursuing detective into thinking he had run over a woman. Finally the transformation of Brian Dennehy's character into just another corrupt cop left me with a distinct sour taste at the end of the movie. After everything is said and done for Brown and Dennehy it's all about the money. Even Schwarzenegger was never this cynical in his movies. The last thing that bothered me is that I always presumed movie special effects were to keep the actors safe. Since here they are used to kill it seems like a betrayal of their purpose.On the positive side I had no problems with the casting or acting. Maybe things improved in fx 2. I can only hope.".

He designed dresses for Marlene Dietrich Claudette Colbert Kay Francis and Carole Lombard among others.John Webb an attorney Pat O'Brien is invited to a party by Alma Claire Dodd an old girlfriend who is now the mistress of Cushing Edward Arnold. He meets an annoying singer Ann Ruth Terry who he later rescues from the paws of a drunken guest. When Webb finds Alma murdered he determined to square it but can't shake the irritating Ann. Helped by his sassy secretary Eve Arden and dopey associate Broderick Crawford he is stymied by District Attorney Joyce oily Alan Dinehart who is in pretty thick with Cushing. Suspects pile up  Alma's ex husband George Douglas Dumbrille even Ann puts her foot in it by implicating Webb!!! As one of the reviewers implied Ann and Webb would have to be the odd couple of the century. In real life he would never find happiness with an air head like her!!! When Webb's secretary is found dead Eve Arden didn't get much of a chance to strut her stuff suspicion puts Webb on the top of the list. Evelyn Keyes has a bit as the new secretary and Phyllis Brookes also has a small part as Cushing's beautiful daughter. Things come to a head in a little Texas cemetery.The film is excellent because of the superior quality of everyone associated with it. The cast was top notch  aside from Pat O'Brien you have Edward Arnold Broderick Crawford Douglas Dumbrille and Alan Dinehart one of the most suave villains of the 30s. Then on the female side you have the beautiful Claire Dodd Phyllis Brooks sassy Eve Arden and the lovely Evelyn Keyes who would have been excellent as Ann not nearly so annoying as Ruth Terry. Tay Garnett was a real man's director who was at home with action adventures ie China Seas 1935 and Trade Winds 1938.Claire Dodd is definitely my favourite bad girl. When she appeared in a film good girls like Joan Blondell Ann Dvorak and Helen Twelvetrees had some pretty anxious moments  she even played Della Street in a couple of early Perry Masons. Whoever she played she always looked a dream. Phyllis Brooks had been a McClelland Barclay model and although she was decorative her acting skills were almost non existent. Evelyn Keyes was more noted for her wit and racy memoirs but she was extremely vivacious and it was always nice to see her in movies.Recommended.".

A corrupt state politician Vincent Cushing Edward Arnold is the principal target for Webb's reforming urge and when Cushing's mistress Alma Claire Dodd erstwhile flame of Webb is murdered nearly all of the major characters seem to have a motive including Webb who faces most of the heat from the homicide investigation although he perceives himself to be slightly honorable when compared with those about him. The work includes a strong comedic element along with its murder mystery and socially conscious themes. Vivacious Terry with her patented energy and spirit steals the film in what she states is her favourite role a part for which she is promised by producer Walter Wanger and director Tay Garnett that the former night club singerdancer will be spotlighted in a musical specialty number and that she is one that is perfectly woven into the screenplay this while under personal contract to Howard Hughes who loans her to Wanger for this production. A cardinal pleasure inherent with film reviewing is discovery of works that have not received an amount of recognition that they deserve and that is the case in this instance for it is a piece that includes among its attributes sparkling dialogue skillful acting and especially that mastery of narrative pace and rhythm that marks the best efforts from Garnett who here cunningly blends details for his established miseenscne within the script as is his custom.

This film which showcases the underremarked comic skills of Pat O'Brien is a genuine treat which belongs right up there with The Front Page with O'Brien and James Cagney its remake His Girl Friday and the best of the 'Thin Man' series. Director Tay Garnett is probably best known for directing some of the better series in the early days of television Bonanza The Untouchables Naked City Rawhideand at least two film classics The Postman Always Rings Twice  A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. After seeing this film one can only guess that the reason his name is not as well known as that of Sturgess or Capra or even Wilder is that he moved to television at a time when that medium was seen as a real threat to the film industry and thereby encountered some resentment. How else to explain the fact that Slightly Honorable is not mentioned on more 'Best' lists?O'Brien is probably more likable and believable as a semiromantic lead here than in almost any of his other films. Always effective in serious dramas he reminds us of how versatile some of our greatest stars of middle period American cinema Cagney John Wayne Katherine HepburnClark Gable wereswitching effortlessly from drama to comedy in a way that seems to be beyond the scope of some later stars.Much the same can be said for Ruth Terry who would own this film were it not for the strength of her costar's performances. Terry retired before she was 45 years old. By that time she was reduced to bit parts but a look at her work here will have you shaking your head in wonder at how that happened.A great performance from Broderick Crawford and standout supporting turns from Eve Arden and Claire Dodd among others crackerjack pacing and set designsnappy clever and first rate dialogue combine to make for a wonderful hilarious film that deserves a wide audience and a restoration treatment to enhance the sometimes muddy soundtrack and occasional glitch in the currently available print. Do NOT hesitate to rent this one.By the way contrary to IMDb's spell checking feature dialogue is NOT a misspelling. Look it up.".

	schema:headline " A comedy murder mystery with a split personality and the hyperconfident Pat O'Brien as the hero";
	schema:reviewBody "Pat O'Brien to my way of thinking was always an interesting actor. He was one of that breed of Thirties men who almost blasted selfconfidence. He was fasttalking always ready with a quick comeback and a onetwo punch. He was hard to deflate. Think of others such as Chester Morris Lee Tracy and Lloyd Nolan. O'Brien played up the Irish charm like a poster. Unlike those others O'Brien made it to the big time in the Thirties. He was great friends with James Cagney and starred with Cagney in nine films. But with opportunities to be a leading man O'Brien just sucked the air away from anyone else in the room. He was dynamic to a fault in my view. When he tried to do comedy line reading he usually came across as emphatic and irritable. When he was playing tough he could come across as emphatic and unmovable. With Slightly Honorable a 1940 film directed by Tay Garnett O'Brien plays John Webb a strongwilled fasttalking lawyer who is determined to bring down Victor Cushing Edward Arnold the leader of a corrupt political machine a man responsible for rigging highway construction bids and using shoddy materials. Even the district attorney is part of Cushing's operation. Webb's only helper is his law associate Russ Sampson Broderick Crawford. There is the attempted corruption of an 18yearold singer two murders by dagger and two attempted murders and a tense political debate in the state capitol where we learn how much pressure it takes to crumble secondrate concrete. There's even a climactic scene at night in a foggy isolated cemetery with old tombstones being read by flashlight and a thrown dagger coming very close to permanently ending Webb's law practice. And this is a comedy...or at least an attempt at a comedy mystery. The background music is jaunty. The repartee is quick and sometimes witty and sometimes awful Well says Webb it looks like the good old frameroo. the 18yearold lamb chop is cute ditzy and dumb there's a souse on a barroom floor and a black elevator attendant who roles his eyes and does shuffle steps. Eve Arden even shows up as Miss Ater Webb's ironic secretary. The result teeters close to being a mess but a fastmoving one. O'Brien with his high energy line delivery and no nonsense style dominates the proceedings. Even Edward Arnold smooth avuncular and goodhumored as Mr. Big isn't able to steal any scenes from O'Brien. Ruth Terry as Ann Seymour the young singer who wants to be John Webb's girl friend is fine delivering a song and dance but doing young and ditzy she sounds like a motor mouth Shirley Temple on amphetamines. She survives the plot and manages to win Webb but after a while I started hoping she'd be one of the victims. Broderick Crawford does a fine job as Webb's partner younger not as sharp but ready to stand up and be counted. There are two problems with Slightly Honorable. The first is that as a leading man Pat O'Brien can get tiresome. The second is that Tay Garnett couldn't make up his mind whether he was directing a comedy or a crime drama. The movie is often fun to watch but it keeps veering from one style to the other. It's hard to believe that a few years later Garnett would direct one of the most satisfying wellmade and depressing crime noirs ever filmed The Postman Always Rings".

What girl of 18 gets dressed up in a revealing gown goes to a party full of known hoods and then is shocked when one puts the moves on her? Or doesn't have the sense to NOT take her dress off in front of a grown man when she's alone in his apartment? She's either 13 or she doesn't have all of her marbles.I waste so much time on Terry's character here because it distracts from what could have been a very good film. I took off two stars just for the annoyance factor alone. Other than that  and its a big that  the film is a great noir with an interesting twist at the end. Robert Osborne said that director Tay Garnett became ill during filming and Walter Wanger had to finish the film out himself with Garnett very upset at the end result.

There's the mystery O'Brien has to sort out with assistance and frequent interference from partner Crawford from the kid singer Terry and from the copswho may be Arnold's stooges.Bizarre humorous touches distract somewhat from the mystery plot for example the scene in which all of the suspects remove their shoes to be examined for blood stains and Edward Arnold has an embarrassing hole in the toe of his sock. Terry and O'Brien giggle madlyeven though the corpse is still lying in the next room. It just doesn't quite fit. I would have liked to see more of three other women characters Claire Dodd as an early victim intimate friends with more than one suspect Eve Arden as O'Brien's secretary smart and ready and Phyllis Brooks as Arnold's daughter conscience crying out as she learns about her father. All are very good in too small roles. We do get plenty of Ruth Terrywho is actually very good herself except that hers and O'Brien's relationship never really convinces the chemistry never really gels. Unfortunately for her she comes across as rather annoying.One truly chilling moment involves a discovery at a deska shock that is totally unexpected and perfectly executed.

Pat O'Brien is attorney John Webb and Broderick Crawford is his associate Russ Sampson. Crawford's role is particularly interesting because while energetic it isn't as bombastic as his screen persona became in time. Edward Arnold plays their nemesis here in a somewhat muted role. He's a wealthy crime boss Vincent Cushing.The film is billed as a comedy as well as a crime and drama. Eve Arden provides some of the comedy as Miss Ater secretary to Webb and Sampson. Ruth Terry is a bubbly young singer at Pete Godena's Riviera Club Ann Seymour Puss to Webb. She takes to Webb follows him everywhere and provides some of the comedy. Claire Dodd Douglas Dumbrille Ernest Truex and a host of other actors contribute in this mystery mayhem. Before all is through two dames are knocked off. The culprit is something of a surprise but it's a bit hokey how Webb figures it out. The film quality isn't very good. The background music is terrible and very distracting. Fortunately it only plays during moments of suspense. But the story is fair and the film has some good action and lots of commotion that contributes to an interesting movie. The film is based on a 1939 crime novel by Frank G. Presnell Send Another Coffin.Here are a couple of my favorite lines. George Taylor Dumbrille Who's conducting this inquiry  the police or this ambulance chaser?Russ Sampson toasting For the people! John Webb For the 100000 retainer fee.Pete Godena played by Bernard Nedell Let's you and me have a nice little hearttoheart talk huh? Alma Brehmer Claire Dodd What would you use?".

	schema:reviewBody "An attorney and his partner get caught up in a series of murders involving a crooked businessman and his crony district attorney. In fact suspicion is cast on the attorney himself as he threads his way through the thicket.Comedy mysteries were popular during this period. The sophisticated Thin Man series was probably the best though the many amateur sleuth series on lesser budgets also proved popular e.g. Charlie Chan The Saint et al. This movie attempts the same ground but tries to work in too many elements. Trouble is they fail to build in effective fashion. The whodunit part never really gels since little time is given to assessing the suspects while the comedic part fares better with some good snappy lines. However the comedic part is overridden by cutie Terry's antics that are way overblown and finally annoying. Clearly some restraint was needed but a firm hand was lacking. Apparently credited director Garnett took sick and impresario Wanger had to step in. That may account for unevenness of the overall result.Nonetheless O'Brien lends the proceedings what credibility there is while a young Crawford gets to show an uncharacteristic and somewhat comedic side. In fact the supporting cast includes many sinister faces from the periodFowley Richards Dumbrille Dodd. Now I'm as broadminded as most movie fans but pairing 41year old O'Brien with teenage Terry acting like a 10year old appears a risky bet for audiences even now. Plus having her drop her dress moment to moment may be amusing but struggles against the questionable context. Looks like their pairing was trying to get as far away from Nick and Nora as possible.All in all and despite the promising elements the package is simply too unwieldy to hold together. Too bad.".

	onyx:emotionText "An attorney and his partner get caught up in a series of murders involving a crooked businessman and his crony district attorney. In fact suspicion is cast on the attorney himself as he threads his way through the thicket.Comedy mysteries were popular during this period. The sophisticated Thin Man series was probably the best though the many amateur sleuth series on lesser budgets also proved popular e.g. Charlie Chan The Saint et al. This movie attempts the same ground but tries to work in too many elements. Trouble is they fail to build in effective fashion. The whodunit part never really gels since little time is given to assessing the suspects while the comedic part fares better with some good snappy lines. However the comedic part is overridden by cutie Terry's antics that are way overblown and finally annoying. Clearly some restraint was needed but a firm hand was lacking. Apparently credited director Garnett took sick and impresario Wanger had to step in. That may account for unevenness of the overall result.Nonetheless O'Brien lends the proceedings what credibility there is while a young Crawford gets to show an uncharacteristic and somewhat comedic side.

Presnell. Starring Pat O'Brien on loanout assignment from Warner Brothers Studio it offers him a rare opportunity to perform on screen sporting a mustache but being no threat to actor Clark Gable. With mysterycomedies quite popular during the 1930s SLIGHTLY HONORABLE is no different with the exception as to how the mystery gets solved.Opening Title Eight thousand miles to the southland lies a tiny island paradise  far from greed the graft and the corruption that harass our modern civilization  but that's 8000 miles away! The story begins with visuals of radio announcers followed by a car sliding off a curvy road leading to the death of Clarence Buckman corrupt highway commissioner who has fallen victim to the accident. Pallbearers at his funeral are John Webb Pat O'Brien lawyer Russel Sampson Broderick Crawford his assistant and Vincent Cushing Edward Arnold described as the evil head of the state's political machine. During the course of the story John meets Ann Seymour Ruth Terry a nightclub singer who happens to be 18 years and two months!. A feisty yet gabby individual she gets into a rumble with the owner Pete Gordenia Bernard Nedell to a point of having her dress torn with John coming to her defense. After taking her to his apartment John soon offers her 100 for a new dress before sending her home. Alma Brehmer Claire Dodd John's old flame with a jealous ex husband George Taylor Douglass Dumbrille is found murdered at her Fenner Apartment penthouse with a dagger in her back. A series of similar killings involving daggers soon take place. With John attempting to clear his name from being the prime suspect he ends up finding out more than he bargained for during his investigation especially with flying daggers with threatening notes in his office and near arrests from Commissioner Joyce Alan Dinehart Inspector Fromm Addison Richards and Captain Graves Cliff Clark who believe John's the guilty party.Others seen in the cast include Phyllis Brooks Sarilla Cushing the daughter Janet Beecher Mrs. Cushing wife and mother Eve Arden Miss Ater Webb's wisecracking secretary Ernest Truex P. Hemmingway Collins secretary of the Citizen's Better Government League Evelyn Keyes Miss Vilissigen Willie Best Art the elevator operator John Sheehan Mike Daley the drunk among others. Edward Arnold who gave a memorable supporting performance as a corrupt politician in both Frank Capra's MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON Columbia 1939 and MEET JOHN DOE Warner Brothers 1941 resumes a similar character here as a corrupt newspaper publisher with political connections but isn't on screen long enough for an actor whose name comes second billed in the casting credits. Standout performances goes to Broderick Crawford breaking away from dopey characters enacted early in his career and Eve Arden being a welcome screen presence as always. Evelyn Keyes has little to do in a rare comedic role as a daffy secretary. Ruth Terry playing a gabby showgirl could be annoying at times yet she's far from being shy nor modest when it comes to undressing herself in front of a man O'Brien she hardly knowswith the lawyer being embarrassed through the proceedings more than once.An agreeable mixture of comedy and mystery that's not as well known as some other films of this nature. After years of being shown on late night commercial television dating back to the 1950s SLIGHTLY HONORABLE later became a public domain title that was frequently broadcast on public television and available on video cassette in the 1980s and decades later on DVD usually in shorter 75 minute edition. It wasn't until Turner Classic Movies aired a restored and complete 86 minute clearer picture edition of SLIGHTLY HONORABLE TCM premiere December 9 2011 that the movie got to be shown uncut for the first time in years. In complete form SLIGHTLY HONORABLE moves swiftly enough to become satisfactory entertainment for those who may find the movie sightly funny slightly mysterious or slightly honorable. 12 daggers".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this marvellous film again last night I began to think about how peculiar that a film which has so severely dated in so many respects still manages to say something profound today.  In certain respects this film just couldn't be done today.  First of all gender roles have changed a great deal and many of Alfie's birds simply wouldn't be plausible in a modern film.  Second of all sex has changed so much.  Back in the 80s we had plenty of films usually bad ones which took a similarly cavalier attitude toward sex but that's a relic of a simpler preHIV world that's gone forever.   But Alfie still manages to say something even to a modern audience.  On one hand it's got a very funny script and Michael Caine plays Alfie with such an infectious charm that it's impossible not to smile.  But also there's a deeper layer of meaning to the film.  I never mean to hurt anyone Alfie says.  I know says Harry but you do.  Alfie ignores this lovely and rare moment of real honesty but the audience shouldn't because the heart of the film is right here.  Alfie himself is such a fascinating character.  At first he seems like simply a rogue a rascal.  But there's a helluva lot going on under the surface.  His deep deep insecurities his tragic loneliness he wouldn't see it that way naturally his pathological inability to have a real relationship with anyone.  Especially his own son whom he obviously loves very much. While it's easy to see Alfie as a tragic story and feel sympathy for the character it's important to hold onto the hatred.  Alfie is a cruel merciless and heartless man.  He is selfabsorbed utterly insensitive and totally domineering.  He cheerfully holds his birds to standards of loyalty he himself needn't bother with.  He ruthlessly undermines the individuality and autonomy of everyone he is with even when pretending to be a liberating force.  Notice in his scenes with Gilda how his words sound as though he's endorsing freedom independence and selfdetermination but the effect of those words is to keep her right under his thumb where she belongs.  Alfie deserves our sympathy yes but he also deserves our hatred loathing and utter contempt.   Anyway like the DVD box says this is just a sweet frothy little comedy if you like and it's very enjoyable as such.  But if you care to look deeper there is so much more to behold.  The tagline to American Beauty was look closer but all of its profound ideas and insights if any were plastered right across the screen.  Alfie is a film which asks you to look closer and it rewards the effort.".

While its style is clearly confined to that era and England in particular its subject matter is profoundly universal.The subjects of love and devotion or more accurately their opposites philandering and infidelity are treated with a unique sensitivity in the script. Michael Caine is at once both lovable and detestable perfectly characterizing the ageold dynamic between the need for love and the need for physical pleasure. But this is not a feelgood movie it is a movie that explores the difficult decisions that confront a person as they mature in both life and love and it conveys the basic feelings that are present in all human beings regardless of outward appearances.I would recommend this as a thoughtprovoking exploration of human nature.".

As Alfie he is never mean. He is a man who is only interested in satisfying the women he meets. This was Mr. Caine's break through film which indicated even then his potential as the versatile actor one has always cherished.The women in Alfie's life show a lot of different types. Shelley Winters is at her best with her take of Ruby the wealthy American bird that loves her encounters with Alfie. Millicent Martin seen briefly makes a fun Siddie. Vivian Merchant is Lily the married woman who strays when she can't resist Alfie's charms. Jane Asher as Annie is excellent. Julia Foster plays Gilda the only one to give Alfie an heir.

	schema:reviewBody "There were many films that capitalized on the modscene in London during the swinging 60's but very few of them have stood the test of time but this film remains as a solid reminder of how morals and ethics were starting to be portrayed in films and the main reason it still holds up is the unabashed performance of the lead. Story is about Alfie Elkins Michael Caine who is the ultimate ladies man in London and he seems not to just conquer his women but to own them as well. Even when living with someone he still keeps his options open and has a few ladies on the side from Gilda Julia Foster to the American Ruby Shelley Winters who is actually much like Alfie herself.SPOILER ALERTAlfie ends up getting Gilda pregnant and she eventually has a boy that he learns to care for but he doesn't have any aspirations of getting married and Gilda later marries another man. Alfie ends up in the hospital with an infection and while there he meets Lily Vivien Merchant who's the wife of his roommate and later starts an affair with her. He also meets a hitchhiker named Annie Jane Asher who tries to make him feel more domesticated but Alfie gets fed up and forces her to leave but he also gets Lily pregnant and helps her get an illegal abortion and it's at this point that Alfie starts to think about his life and where he's going.This film is directed by Lewis Gilbert who is a very talented and respected director who would work with Caine again in the future with Educating Rita. This script is from Bill Naughton and his play and at times the film has a stage feel especially when Caine turns to the camera and talks to the audience about his inner thoughts. The character Alfie is depicted in a brutally honest manner and the best way to describe him is either as a cad or a rogue but this is partly why Caine's performance is so riveting. Caine was a working actor but after this film was released it made him a worldwide star and gave him a celebrity status where he never had to look back. Caine's screen presence is part of his performance and the way he can look at the camera and stay in character can be hard to pull off but Gilbert's intuition in casting Caine was correct and ultimately vital to the film. This is Caine's first great performance and he does add many layers to his character from being incredibly selfish and cynical to moments of remorse and disgust of his own actions. The supporting cast is also excellent and actress Merchant is nothing short of memorable with her role as a vulnerable middle age woman. This film is almost 40 years old and was made when morals and ethics were being questioned and along with Caine's unflinching performance this still holds up very well after all these years.".

	schema:headline " The Dark Side of the Sexual Revolution";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Caine made several good films in the sixties and early seventies such as Zulu The Ipcress File and Get Carter but in my opinion Alfie is his best from this period and only equalled among his later films by Hannah and Her Sisters and Educating Rita. It is set in what might be described as the kitchen sink end of swinging London. The antihero Alfie Elkins is a young workingclass Cockney who works as a mechanic and driver for a carhire company. In some respects the film looks back to the socialrealist school of the late fifties and early sixties. Alfie is in some ways a very traditional character. He lives in the sort of drab seedy flat familiar from kitchen sink realist films and hangs out in oldfashioned East End pubs rather than discos. He dresses smartly but conservatively at one stage even sporting an RAF blazer. Not for him the long hair sideburns bellbottom jeans loud shirt and kipper tie which constituted the uniform of the sixties trendsetter.In one respect however he is very different to the traditional socialrealist hero. The angry young men from films such as Look Back in Anger Saturday Night and Sunday Morning The Loneliness of the LongDistance Runner and Room at the Top were characterised by anger and resentment against the Establishment. Resentment is an emotion quite alien to the happygolucky Alfie whose main preoccupation is not settling scores with the system but rather scoring with women. He is a practised seducer and the film introduces us to a number of his conquests. The nearest thing he has to a steady girlfriend is Gilda the mother of his young son Malcolm but even she tires of his infidelity and refusal to commit to her. Eventually she leaves him to marry her longtime admirer bus conductor Humphrey. Humphrey is everything Alfie is not he is far from handsome but is caring faithful and deeply in love with Gilda. Alfie suffers a setback when he is taken into hospital with a suspected lung infection but he is soon well enough again to go back to his old ways taking advantage of Lily the wife of a fellowpatient. Among his other victims are unhappilymarried Carla homeloving Northerner Annie and wealthy older woman Ruby.Halliwell's Film Guide describes the film as a garish sex comedy which strikes me as a misconception. Despite a certain superficial similarity in plot to the likes of Confessions of a Window Cleaner the film is actually a deeply serious one. Certainly Alfie himself is a bit of a comedian who sees life as one big joke always endeavouring to look on the bright side. Cheerfulness can in some cases be an admirable attribute but in Alfie's case it goes handinhand with a crass insensitivity to the problems and emotions of others. What he wants out of life is commitmentfree relationships which will enable him to find sexual satisfaction with as many women as possible. Perhaps the most telling detail about his character is that he habitually refers to women as it rather than she.Only at the end of the film does it start to dawn on him that there might be more to life than a series of onenight stands and he starts to ponder the question What's it all about? The question is enshrined in the famous song which we hear at the end of the film as Alfie stands by the Thames pondering his future. There are three key moments in Alfie's gradual enlightenment. One comes when he wanders into a church where Gilda and Humphrey are having their first child baptised and he realises that he is missing out on family life. Another comes when he discovers that Ruby has dumped him in favour of an even younger toyboy. For the first time he is being used in the way he uses others and he doesn't like it. The most moving comes when after Alfie has bullied Lily whom he has got pregnant into having an illegal abortion he is shocked by the sight of his dead unborn child.Caine gives one of his best performances as the cheerfully immoral hero and he receives good support from a number of others especially Vivien Merchant as the tragic Lily Alfie Bass as her invalid husband Harry and Denholm Elliott as the cynical abortionist.The film is firmly rooted in the workingclass London of the midsixties and reflects the Zeitgeist of that period. It was a time when the Pill was a recent invention when the sexual revolution was just beginning but when older conservative attitudes towards sex were stronger than they are today. Although Alfie's conquests are played by some of the bestlooking British actresses of the period such as Shirley Anne Field Julia Foster and Jane Asher they are not miniskirted dollybirds but basically oldfashioned girls conservatively even dowdily dressed. All of them except the sluttish Ruby are looking for love rather than sex and he is smart enough to know this and cynical enough to exploit it.In some respects the film was a progressive one for its period both in its stylistic devices such as having the hero speak direct to camera and in its frankness about sexual matters especially the highly controversial topic of abortion still illegal in Britain in 1966 although it was to be legalised the following year. In its view of social matters however it is more conservative its attitude towards abortion for example is more prolife than prochoice. The film can perhaps be seen as a critique of the sexual revolution showing how greater sexual freedom was giving irresponsible philanderers like Alfie more opportunities to seduce women. The irony is that Alfie ends up ruining his own life as effectively as he has ruined theirs. Beneath its permissive surface Alfie is a devastating exposure of the dark side of the sexual revolution. 910".

It is set in what might be described as the kitchen sink end of swinging London. The antihero Alfie Elkins is a young workingclass Cockney who works as a mechanic and driver for a carhire company. In some respects the film looks back to the socialrealist school of the late fifties and early sixties. Alfie is in some ways a very traditional character. He lives in the sort of drab seedy flat familiar from kitchen sink realist films and hangs out in oldfashioned East End pubs rather than discos. He dresses smartly but conservatively at one stage even sporting an RAF blazer. Not for him the long hair sideburns bellbottom jeans loud shirt and kipper tie which constituted the uniform of the sixties trendsetter.In one respect however he is very different to the traditional socialrealist hero. The angry young men from films such as Look Back in Anger Saturday Night and Sunday Morning The Loneliness of the LongDistance Runner and Room at the Top were characterised by anger and resentment against the Establishment. Resentment is an emotion quite alien to the happygolucky Alfie whose main preoccupation is not settling scores with the system but rather scoring with women. He is a practised seducer and the film introduces us to a number of his conquests. The nearest thing he has to a steady girlfriend is Gilda the mother of his young son Malcolm but even she tires of his infidelity and refusal to commit to her. Eventually she leaves him to marry her longtime admirer bus conductor Humphrey. Humphrey is everything Alfie is not he is far from handsome but is caring faithful and deeply in love with Gilda. Alfie suffers a setback when he is taken into hospital with a suspected lung infection but he is soon well enough again to go back to his old ways taking advantage of Lily the wife of a fellowpatient. Among his other victims are unhappilymarried Carla homeloving Northerner Annie and wealthy older woman Ruby.Halliwell's Film Guide describes the film as a garish sex comedy which strikes me as a misconception. Despite a certain superficial similarity in plot to the likes of Confessions of a Window Cleaner the film is actually a deeply serious one. Certainly Alfie himself is a bit of a comedian who sees life as one big joke always endeavouring to look on the bright side. Cheerfulness can in some cases be an admirable attribute but in Alfie's case it goes handinhand with a crass insensitivity to the problems and emotions of others. What he wants out of life is commitmentfree relationships which will enable him to find sexual satisfaction with as many women as possible. Perhaps the most telling detail about his character is that he habitually refers to women as it rather than she.Only at the end of the film does it start to dawn on him that there might be more to life than a series of onenight stands and he starts to ponder the question What's it all about? The question is enshrined in the famous song which we hear at the end of the film as Alfie stands by the Thames pondering his future. There are three key moments in Alfie's gradual enlightenment. One comes when he wanders into a church where Gilda and Humphrey are having their first child baptised and he realises that he is missing out on family life. Another comes when he discovers that Ruby has dumped him in favour of an even younger toyboy. For the first time he is being used in the way he uses others and he doesn't like it. The most moving comes when after Alfie has bullied Lily whom he has got pregnant into having an illegal abortion he is shocked by the sight of his dead unborn child.Caine gives one of his best performances as the cheerfully immoral hero and he receives good support from a number of others especially Vivien Merchant as the tragic Lily Alfie Bass as her invalid husband Harry and Denholm Elliott as the cynical abortionist.The film is firmly rooted in the workingclass London of the midsixties and reflects the Zeitgeist of that period. It was a time when the Pill was a recent invention when the sexual revolution was just beginning but when older conservative attitudes towards sex were stronger than they are today. Although Alfie's conquests are played by some of the bestlooking British actresses of the period such as Shirley Anne Field Julia Foster and Jane Asher they are not miniskirted dollybirds but basically oldfashioned girls conservatively even dowdily dressed. All of them except the sluttish Ruby are looking for love rather than sex and he is smart enough to know this and cynical enough to exploit it.In some respects the film was a progressive one for its period both in its stylistic devices such as having the hero speak direct to camera and in its frankness about sexual matters especially the highly controversial topic of abortion still illegal in Britain in 1966 although it was to be legalised the following year. In its view of social matters however it is more conservative its attitude towards abortion for example is more prolife than prochoice. The film can perhaps be seen as a critique of the sexual revolution showing how greater sexual freedom was giving irresponsible philanderers like Alfie more opportunities to seduce women. The irony is that Alfie ends up ruining his own life as effectively as he has ruined theirs. Beneath its permissive surface Alfie is a devastating exposure of the dark side of the sexual revolution. 910";

The look on Caine's face when he returns to his apartment and sees the aborted fetus visual confirmation of his callous disregard was enough on its own to earn him the Oscar nomination he received for this film.Much of the marketing for Alfie positions it as a gay romp through the swinging 60s but it's actually quite a bitter little pill to swallow and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.With Shelley Winters as a blowsy American who's as good at playing Alfie as he is her.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "A superb film. Michael Caine is Alfie a workingclass Londoner who weaves his way in and out of episodes with various birds referred to using the neutral it as in it's all in love and ghosty now and the consequences grow more dramatic.Alfie waltzes through all these sequential affairs with aplomb. Nothing bothers him. He's on the hedonic treadmill. He interrupts the goings on from time to time in order to deliver a wisecrack to the camera or sometimes a soliloquy with philosophical content such as a man and a woman talking' about things is intimate. You know what? Sometimes I think it's more intimate than the other. Those consequences though rather accumulate and begin to distress him. Not for very long. He's incapable of being genuinely depressed taking advantage as he does of Kierkegaard's unfolding moment. What I mean is  the guy is pretty shallow.His first problem comes when one of his girl friends gets pregnant. Quite an inconvenience when she insists on having the baby. She names the boy Malcolm Alfred and Alfie manages to stick around without marrying her for two years or so. The woman Gilda saddled with a child an irresponsible lover and financial expenses marries someone she doesn't love but whom she respects. Goodbye Gilda and little Malcom.Not that it bothers Alfie naturally. There is a crisis though when he's called back to the doctor's office after a chest Xray. Oh he's carrying on flirting with the nurse winking at the camera telling us how he's not doing anything any other bloke wouldn't do when the nurse interrupts him to tell him he has two shadows on his lungs. This doesn't penetrate his denticles either. He scoffs that there's something wrong with the picture. And then he glances out the window and glimpses a funeral across the street. SHADOWS! Oh me God! I'm being eaten up inside! And he faints. You see he has to be hit over the head with representations of the future before he can grasp what's going on.There isn't space to go into this. Another ex girl friend shows up three months pregnant and Alfie arranges for an illegal abortion. Well it was the least I could do. The woman pays the abortionist. And the end result is a tiny wellformed fetus which causes Alfie to cry and run away. When it comes to women's troubles I don't know and I don't want to know. He tells an acquaintance that the sight of the dead fetus made him feel sorry a queer emotion for him. Sorry for the baby? No  he was past it. Sorry for myself. He never does fully grow up. This is a movie for adults and in real life superficial people don't undergo epiphanies. I just don't have me peace of mind. That's the best he can do.Nobody could do a better job in this role than Michael Caine. He's an extraordinarily likable actor for one thing. For another he has respectable range. His native workingclass accent here contrasts with his upperclass puton accent in Zulu. And the other performances could hardly be improved upon.The script is extremely effective. Alfie's asides to the camera in no way interrupt the flow of events we witness on screen. The speech of people of Alfie's class is captured precisely. Alfie is given no easy excuse for his careless attitudes towards the feelings of others. I don't mean to hurt people really I don't he tells a friend. Ah but you do Alfie you do. He's boffing the guy's wife. He wasn't abused as a child. He isn't haunted by a tragic love affair. The women Alfie picks up are no more and no less attractive or sexy than those one might meet in a supermarket. Here I must register a complaint. I don't know why it's so easy for Alfie to pick up his birds so much more difficult than it was for me. He just looks like Michael Caine whereas I looked like a reincarnation of Cary Grant. Well  the perfect film is not yet with us. I attribute his success to pheromones.Nice appropriate score too. Sonny Rollins.You know something love? You really ought to watch this if you have a chance.".

Alfie's asides to the camera are plentiful and revealing of his character. We're taken into his confidence even as the women are taken.The film is very 60s in its view of things.

Asher was an actress from her pre school days but she may be best known as Paul McArtney's longtime girlfriend. She's said to be the inspiration for the songs And I Love Her All my Loving Here There and Everywhere among others. There's also the sad Lily wife of a longterm patient in a nursing home who is an acquaintance of Alfie's. Lily is very well played by Vivien Merchant. Merchant had some sad times of her own I understand. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role and she was in many other plays and movies.

She said she couldn't understand a word Michael Caine said and that the movie was redubbed for American audiences to soften Alfie's cockney accent. At least that's my recollection and I'm sticking with it.I haven't seen the later version with Jude Law. My impression is that the two versions cannot be compared. Don't let your like or dislike of the later version sway you in seeing the 1966 Alfie.".

The other is how it is made which was impressive at the time and equally so noweven more so considering how it has aged so well. I truly tells a story and Michael Caine is brilliant subtle chilling and believable in the starring role of Alfie.On the first score there is something unsettling really really funny and daring about the subjecta true cad a British young man who has his way with women but only it seems in the most superficial way emotionally. You want to hate him for it but he's so likable and so honest and fresh and frankly charming to the gills you can't help but have mixed feelings. Caine defines the role so thoroughly in the remake you feel Jude Law trying not to be Alfie but be Michael Caine and it doesn't work nearly as well.On the second the way the movie was made with many long takes and with the main character and no one else narrating directly into the camera but often in the middle of real action is uncanny and virtuosic. Everyone involved had to have been sharp as a tack to get this right the timing and feel the light and the deadpan acting I saw a crack of a smile during the long clinic scene. It makes for a dry approach in a way and it forces detachment from the plot proper. But it draws you into Alfie's plight and flight and complicated character. There are other movies made in the mid 1960s that are about the early and mid 1960s in working class London without trying to be but this is among the best like Easy Rider is clearly about the later 1960s in America. The new mores of the fresh sexual revolution are just being sorted out by cast and character and audience almost before our eyes as we watch. It's quite remarkable really. There's a lot of talk and if you don't get into that pace right away you'll be doomed. But if you connect and see the brilliance of it you'll be blown away. Singular and special.Notice also the terrific music by Sonny Rollins and of course the famous title song sung by Cher. And though Michael Caine steals the show the rest of the cast is spot on serious and authentic. Oddly this is roughly the same time as the recent An Education and it has a little echo in some ways. But oh how much more true Alfie is from top to bottom. This may be fiction but it gets to what matters very much.".

Alfie is a visually nicelooking very 60s in some ways entertaining blend of comedy and drama  a tough mix to succeed making a good movie from. There are no laughoutloud moments but the movie kept me interested for the twohour duration which actually became closer to three hours because I had to keep rewinding due to the occasionally incomprehensible cockney mumblingslang. Alfie at one point refers to his housegirlfriend hence all women as it which almost made him appear like a David Attenborough type describing a couple of lizards on Animal Planet.I can only imagine what a mess the new Alfie version must be.".

In fact throughout the film he stops to talk to the audienceto discuss his philosophy about women marriage and relationships. Now MOST of what he says is pure drivela guy coming up with 1001 reasons why it was okay to use women and why emotionally connecting with any of them was a BIG mistake. However as the story unfolds Alfie discovers that staying that emotionally distant is very difficult. I could easily say morebut don't want to give away the plot twists.I really loved this film. Michael Caine was at his best as a lovable but emotionally stunted rogue. But what really impressed me was the writing. This film would be WONDERFUL to show to young menespecially since there are so many 'Alfies' out there and seeing how lonely this sort of life could be is a great lesson for young folks.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent pretty frank and evenhanded look at the life of a mid1960s womanizing single man. The story and acting are excellent utterly convincing and interesting.Alfie's character is very welldeveloped and portrayed rather than being a singledimensional icon or stock generalization he is complex. Alfie is sympathetic and unsympathetic at the same time. He is a chauvinist who cares little for the people primarily women in his relationships avoids emotional attachments or longterm relationships with women who seem to want them lives in the moment for himself uses women has them cook for him etc. Yet at the same time he also shows some consideration for them and at least appears to want them to do what they want be free etc. He in some ways wants or at least truly thinks that he wants the women to live by the same rules he does. He also clearly never has any intention to hurt people which he also states quite clearly. However he clearly does not think about how his actions do hurt people and he is too focused on himself while he may at first think that he wants the women to be as free as he but in reality he doesn't as he realizes only too late how hurtful it is when women treat him the way he has treated them. This dichotomy in his character is handled with great subtlety and care and the way he comes to realize how hurtful it is to be in a relation with someone like him is perfect. It is also developed excellently with his firsthand look at how his actions hurt women whom he professed never to want to hurt when he sees the pain that he admits he never wanted to know about. Meanwhile throughout the movie he is slowly very slowly at first beginning to realize what he is missing by shutting the women out and cutting his ties with them when they get too close. The final scenes of the film where each of these realization hits home one after the other is handled perfectly.The film is also an excellent look at the time on the cusp of radical social change with respect to gender and sexuality and the specifics of the story appear utterly out of place and unconvincing in the modern remake. There is moreover no real point in remaking such an excellently executed classic as this.Finally I want to add that although the comparison never seems to be made I find this film to be somewhat similar to La Dolce Vita in some of the overall themes pointlessness pain etc. of superficial relationships and living solely in the moment yet this film is handled far better. Obviously the films are not entirely on the same points with La Dolce Vita dealing with other elements as well and in a different country etc. but some of these basic points are very close and the approaches are also very similar showing the stream of changing empty relationships and the failure to grasp at the chances for a full meaningful relationship that in the end ultimately leave the character without any meaningful life or direction lost and lonely. I also find Alfie to be more gripping and watchable as La Dolce Vita for all its strengths sags pretty badly in the middle and never really quite hits things on the head.".

His monologues to camera are simply staggering and are still some of the finest pieces of acting I have ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen a Michael Caine movie or if you only know him from his whitehaired roles you need to start with Alfie the movie that propelled him to stardom and made him an instant heartthrob. He made his Cockney accent famous and inspired thousands of imitations through the decades and even though he actually toned down his naturally thick accent for the movie his costar Shelley Winters didn't know what he was saying while they were filming! Ladies if you don't drool over him in his film you need your head examined.In Alfie Michael Caine plays the ultimate cad. He has an endless supply of women at his disposal even though he treats them like garbage and refuses to commit to any of them. He's a sarcastic flippant young man and even when he gets one of his girlfriends pregnant he refuses to marry herwhich in 1966 was not respectable behavior. However as villainous as he seems he manages to charm the audience with his constant talking to the camera and adorable aura. The audience thinks he's despicable but desperately wants him to see the error of his ways and repent so they're invested in him and the film.It's a very adult story so even though Michael cracks jokes to the audience it's a pretty heavy film. I don't want to give anything away but particularly religious audiences might want to avoid this movie. If you do decide to watch it you'll probably be very glad you did. Not only is it one of the most famous flicks of the 60s but you'll get to hear the origin of Burt Bacharach's memorable title song and you'll gain a new celebrity boyfriend. I actually wrote Michael Caine a fan letter when I was in high school and told him I thought he was exceptionally dreamy.Kiddy Warning Obviously you have control over your own children.

	onyx:emotionText "If you've never seen a Michael Caine movie or if you only know him from his whitehaired roles you need to start with Alfie the movie that propelled him to stardom and made him an instant heartthrob. He made his Cockney accent famous and inspired thousands of imitations through the decades and even though he actually toned down his naturally thick accent for the movie his costar Shelley Winters didn't know what he was saying while they were filming! Ladies if you don't drool over him in his film you need your head examined.In Alfie Michael Caine plays the ultimate cad. He has an endless supply of women at his disposal even though he treats them like garbage and refuses to commit to any of them. He's a sarcastic flippant young man and even when he gets one of his girlfriends pregnant he refuses to marry herwhich in 1966 was not respectable behavior. However as villainous as he seems he manages to charm the audience with his constant talking to the camera and adorable aura. The audience thinks he's despicable but desperately wants him to see the error of his ways and repent so they're invested in him and the film.It's a very adult story so even though Michael cracks jokes to the audience it's a pretty heavy film. I don't want to give anything away but particularly religious audiences might want to avoid this movie. If you do decide to watch it you'll probably be very glad you did. Not only is it one of the most famous flicks of the 60s but you'll get to hear the origin of Burt Bacharach's memorable title song and you'll gain a new celebrity boyfriend. I actually wrote Michael Caine a fan letter when I was in high school and told him I thought he was exceptionally dreamy.Kiddy Warning Obviously you have control over your own children. However due to some upsetting adult content I wouldn't let my kids watch it.";

Indeed Mrs. Eagleton who happens to be a friend of Seldom's is a haughty and unsympathetic woman who also stifles her daughter Beth. At the university things do not fare much better as Martin is put in his place by his idol during one of Seldom's lectures. But his private life changes for the best as he starts an affair with Lorna a beautiful girl he met during a game of squash.

	schema:reviewBody "I was optimistic that The Oxford Murders would be a clever and interesting story. Unfortunately it was as far from this as possible.I have never written a film review before and was so deeply unimpressed by this film that I was compelled to share my views. I find it very upsetting to think that the amount of money that was spent on this film could be wasted in such a manner.The film struggles on every level. Bad acting coupled with a poorly written script and ill thought out plot plague this film from the offset. It simply fails to capture the imagination.The film is based in the English town of Oxford famed worldwide for it's university and intellectual breeding. The plot centers around the relationship between a American exchange student martin and a lecturer at the university. The pair somewhat oddly become entailed in a series of pointless and quite pathetic 'murders'.A theasaurus happy writer has quite obviously engineered this film for Hollywood and it is largely for this reason that the film is so bad. The film tries to link complex mathematics and murder apparently the murderer is leaving some kind of mathematical sequence at each murder. This is a common theme throughout the film however it is quite sad that the writers think the viewers of this film will mistake basic secondary level concepts for nobel prize winning intellect.Painful examples of this lurk round every corner like in one scene Martin and his Tutor are in the police station they are talking about the murders and a symbol left at the first crime scene. Martin explains the fibonacci series word for word and is giving a impressed look from his tutor who is apparently a famous theoretical mathematician. Most children in England learn the Fibonacci series before they are 16.It appears as if no research has been carried out either. English characters are displayed whith such stereotypical generalism and it appears as if all extras that are in the film are in fact deformed in some way. Oxford is a village and it is quite apparent that this version of Oxford looks like a cross between medieval england and the last of the summer wine english country drama.From the thick police inspector and his daft side kick to crazy Russian I say Russian but you would have no clue what nationality he actually is based on the appalling acting of this character mathematician. In fact the majority of characters in this film are completely irrelevant and actually serve nothing towards the plot.Being obviously aimed at Hollywood with every single basic academic principle being completely explained for the obvious benefit of the 'stupid' public they obviously needed female relationships to complete this film. The sex scene is especially haunting Elijah Woods pale and childlike figure is something which I would not wish on any man or women.The acting is of the lowest standard bar the performance of John Hurt who is makes the best of an awful script and plot. The extras and cameo characters are so bad and Elijah Wood can only act in films which are special effect and fantasy based as they take the emphasis off of the actual acting.These issues are really only sub issues in comparison to the main problem. The plot.It really is sad to watch the plot embroil from the detective inspectors who seem to share case files car lifts and murder evidence with apparent murder suspects or perhaps maybe the strange cello playing daughter who falls it is later explained fell in love with Martin after meeting him once briefly for ten minutes and sharing a conversation. It could be the beautiful foreign student who is Martins main love interest who it is explained used to be in a relationship with a 70 year old looking lecturer before hand although she cannot be over 20 in the film. Or perhaps it is the murder sequence which developed which apparently took 2 police officers a super intelligent student and world famous lecturer a age and a day to solve which was eventually one of the most basic and simple series i think i have ever seen.In one impossible scene a man dies whilst playing a musical instrument and falls off of the stage in front of a packed crowd in which police were sat. It is later explained with the cheesiest cut scene i have ever seen that after this guy fell of the stage and died someone sneaked onto the stage in full view of everyone and apparently snuck a clue into the music book on the bandstand! Even though it is explained that at that the time the character in question is being followed and watched by police and the police officer who is watching the suspect is even shown as the camera moves over to him! I think I have had my rant and am finding it to painful to continue conveying the endless flaws which stalk this film so I will stop now. To be honest I am not really discouraging anyone to watch this i am more upset with the quality of films which talent writers drill out in the quickest possible time because they think they are above everyone else. Please do not waste money on rubbish films like these it is very depressing.".

As far as the comment goes on how everything is old perhaps they've never seen a movie that was made to be in older style. Clearly doesn't watch a lot of movies nor should be posting on a site like this. They were probably baffled and tried figuring out which country had the flying cars and 2D world after seeing the Jetson's cartoon. Anyway enough ranting about people who can't grasp the depth. The acting wasn't bad at all I found. Of course Elijah acts different which I see not everybody likes but you need to respect the fact he's an actor. We all got to know him as the guy from Lord of the Rings. Well newsflash in his defense he won't be acting the same way in this smart movie as he did fighting off monsters with a smaller vocabulary. He plays an intelligent role this time around. I can't say I know of 'anybody' who could figure out what happens in the end. It 'is' indeed a very deep plot they twist your mind so much into understanding what's presently going on you don't have a lot of time to think of what's going to happen. Well I'm tired bedtime.

	schema:reviewBody "Fresh out of the cinema I have a very good feeling about the movie. My first impression is that it is definitely worth seeing. Alex de la Iglesia the director of for instance El Dia de la Bestia or La comunidad makes this time a mystery movie following the classical parameters. A nice plot specially for those who like mathematics or logic in general with intricate moves and very nice dialogs by John Hurt and Eliah Wood who by the way looks like a pretty solid actor. I had only seen him playing Frodo and was a bit worried about him getting stuck on that character not at all who basically follow the classical thoughts about the perfect murder and in the philosophical search for absolute truths.Being a fan of de la Iglesia whose sense of humor is well known and pretty easy to recognize I am quite happy to see that he is also able of making a genuine mystery film with everything you expect to see on it twisted arguments funny characters Podorov and of course Dominique Pinon from among others Delicatessen and a extremely good filmmaking nice sequences good mystery music etc.To me being a bit of a geek the mathematical references are too obvious the series shown are too well known they are nice nonetheless but for instance why to talk about Fibonaci numbers which were also in the 'Da Vinci Code' when one can talk about many other nice and funny series? On the other hand being a mystery movie's lover one always enjoys the sequences which are clear homage's to previous classics pay attention and you'll enjoy.Let me end up by mentioning the very nice work of Leonor Watling you may have seen her before in for example Almodovar's Talk to her her meaning she who apart from being a really good actress of being extremely beautiful and attractive is also a pretty good singer! It was quite a pleasure being Spanish myself to see her playing an important role with such a great casting! So watch it by yourself the first serious Alex de la Iglesia movie and he does a pretty good job!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film would appear to be a case where a wellintentioned producer or enclave of producers noticed a public interest in conceptually hightoned and seemingly erudite subject matter combined with more staid pop story elements like serial murder Se7en or overcoming emotionalpsychological issues Good Will HuntingA Beautiful Mind.The problem appears to be that they turned the screen writing job over to hacks.I know that's a brutal thing to say but it really does appear to be the case.The film tries to wed serial murder and academic philosophical musing but fails. Actually it tries to bring quite the plethora of de rigueur elements together and mismanages the whole affair. You have all kinds of messy stuff and an absence of any really compelling myth to bind it together or even to effectively humanize the characters. You have John Hurt striving valiantly to imbue each scene he works with warmth and sensitivity but he fails against the tide of bad overall conceptiondevelopment. Suddenly Wood is dallying with his hostess' daughter. Where did that come from? Then she's mad at him for arriving home late. Was she expecting him? Later she apologizes and they seem to have arrived at some kind of cozy platonic status quo. Why? And she plays the cello. Uh are we supposed to assume that an interest in contemporary orchestral ensemble work functions as a hedge against emotional irrelevancy? This was all fast senseless and just one example of many many instances where presumably emotionally resonant moments float in a mutually disconnected vacuum.And speaking of resonant moments it's possible that some directorial stringency might have redeemed the script somewhat though I'm not sure. It appears to be a case where the director accepted the script asis directed individual scenes as best as possible then handed the footage over to editing maybe they could make sense where he couldn't. There really seemed to be only the faintest glimmer of an understanding of any kind of move toward a redemptive overall storyline. I guess I'm saying that the narrative buck needed to have stopped with the narrators but instead got passed ineffectually along the line in the process until we see the buck being passed right out our screens and into our laps The narrators didn't know what they were afteror didn't have the craft to pull it offcould the director handle it? The director couldn't handle it could the editors make up for the oversight? The editors tried as best they could if they can't make gold out of shite footage could the viewer kindly oblige and dig something meaningful out of this morass of disconnected emoting interlaced with disconnected pedantry? By now I think you get the idea. Seriously If you're an aspiring screenwriter WATCH THIS MOVIE. I daresay it's a textbook case.I'm just having one more thought. It is just possible that the script is OK but we're actually witnessing a combination of bad direction and editing mangling it. I would guess it's unlikely but it is possible.".

Suddenly Wood is dallying with his hostess' daughter. Where did that come from? Then she's mad at him for arriving home late. Was she expecting him? Later she apologizes and they seem to have arrived at some kind of cozy platonic status quo. Why? And she plays the cello. Uh are we supposed to assume that an interest in contemporary orchestral ensemble work functions as a hedge against emotional irrelevancy? This was all fast senseless and just one example of many many instances where presumably emotionally resonant moments float in a mutually disconnected vacuum.And speaking of resonant moments it's possible that some directorial stringency might have redeemed the script somewhat though I'm not sure. It appears to be a case where the director accepted the script asis directed individual scenes as best as possible then handed the footage over to editing maybe they could make sense where he couldn't. There really seemed to be only the faintest glimmer of an understanding of any kind of move toward a redemptive overall storyline. I guess I'm saying that the narrative buck needed to have stopped with the narrators but instead got passed ineffectually along the line in the process until we see the buck being passed right out our screens and into our laps The narrators didn't know what they were afteror didn't have the craft to pull it offcould the director handle it? The director couldn't handle it could the editors make up for the oversight? The editors tried as best they could if they can't make gold out of shite footage could the viewer kindly oblige and dig something meaningful out of this morass of disconnected emoting interlaced with disconnected pedantry? By now I think you get the idea. Seriously If you're an aspiring screenwriter WATCH THIS MOVIE. I daresay it's a textbook case.I'm just having one more thought. It is just possible that the script is OK but we're actually witnessing a combination of bad direction and editing mangling it. I would guess it's unlikely but it is possible.";

	schema:reviewBody "This review does contain spoilers.Although it is difficult to know what could spoil this film as it is already extraordinarily bad. It is truly dreadful. The film opens with Wittgenstein writing a philosophical work called The Tractatus. It is well known that part of this was penned whilst Wittgenstein was fighting on the Eastern front during WW1. In this film they have him sitting crosslegged in No Man's Land scribbling into his notebook. From such an absurdly low starting point it might be thought that the film could only improve but unfortunately this does not happen.Wittgenstein is only mentioned so that leading academic Arthur Seldom John Hurt could engage in some philosophybabble about truth. It is not even good philosophybabble. Everything that purported to be mathematical or logical in this film reminded me of a hospital porter I once knew who had read a couple of books on popular science. After a few pints he would try to impress the nurses with his erudition.We are asked to believe that Hurt an expert on logical series devises a series so mystifying that brilliant American maths student who has travelled specifically to Oxford to work with Seldom cannot work out what it is  although he eventually discovers it in what appears to be a children's book in the local book store. Quite why he had to rush to the local bookstore at closing time and abuse the staff who were asking him to leave when he was a postgraduate at Oxford university and might presumably have used the library like anyone else was not explained.But then nothing is explained in this film. There is no character development. Each character arrives fully formed clichd cardboard cutouts the lot of them. Lorna Leona Watling is largely irrelevant to anything in the film although fortunately as a nurse she does of course know that the Pythagoreans also experimented with organ transplants! Her main role seems to be to provide a sexscene. In any other film such an obviously gratuitous sequence would have been an irritation but in this film it was a welcome diversion. I suppose if you are going to cook a postcoital meal of spaghetti bolognaise it is sensible to stand at the stove wearing nothing but a plastic apron  although she probably wouldn't have bothered if she had known that Martin Elijah Wood was moments later going to take a handful of the stuff and drop it onto her breasts.There are many films with a completely ludicrous story line that have been saved by a clever and witty script. There is nothing clever or witty about the script of this film. There isn't a single believable conversation at any point in the film. Everyone just stands around delivering exposition or pseudointellectual nonsense. Jim Carter playing Inspector Peterson must be delivering the worst lines of his career. They wouldn't have been so bad if this film had been a spoof whodunit. The direction is ponderous. There is no pace there is no momentum. An occasional surge in the music even when accompanied by fireworks yes the score is as clichd as everything else in this film fails to generate the least excitement.For a film that is meant to be about a logical puzzle it is unfortunate that it doesn't even hang together on its own terms. At one point Seldom tells the police that before he finds the body he had received a note from the mysterious serial killer but threw the note away. Indeed we see him throw the note away. Sadly we later discover there is no serial killer and he is making it all up  so why was there any note to throw away? A crucial point towards the end of the film if a film this bad can have any crucial points is when Martin discovers there is nothing written on the napkin. It is explained that Seldom had to carry out this deceit so that he could convince Martin that he knew what the next symbol in the series was going to be even though he didn't really know. Quite apart from the fact that the series of symbols turns out to be trivial it also transpires that Seldom is making the whole thing up so it wouldn't have mattered anyway.If the film says anything at all it says that small and apparently inconsequential things can have a large a dramatic effect on the outcome. Yes yes as any half aware teenager will be able to tell you it's the butterfly effect. Who knows what consequences this review will have? Hopefully it will encourage one or two of you to find a more entertaining way of spending your evening.".

It creates a certain mood to the movies. However 'The Oxford Murders' basically does its everything to destroy that mood by cinematography that just makes me want to look away. The takes are very much too rapid and hectic. I don't think it suits here at all. This American guy played by Elijah Wood also has some sex in the film which I personally find too intensive for a British detective story. It just doesn't fit there. It felt awkward in this particular film. The movie was directed by a Spanish guy but I believe he knows much stuff about British detective stories if he makes one. The new stuff he tries to pull here doesn't work though. Of course there is some good here too. I love John Hurt's performance. Also the strange mathematics are intriguing everything I do understand about it whatsoever. All in all I'm not sure what kind of game the film makers are playing here. Everything happening on screen is happening too fast and oddly for this genre. I'd love to like this movie more but many details are too out of place and the whole movie is like a terribly played discord with an otherwise beautiful instrument.510".

Burn Gorman the Russian if you can tell was a constant eyesore whose character seems to have served absolutely no purpose in the story.

And then of course there's the main plot which is full of plot holes. Just to mention one if the series is common enough to be mentioned in a diagram that takes up half a page of a textbook how convincing is it for Elijah Wood supposedly a nerdy mathematician not to figure the pattern out upon seeing the second symbol in the series? I mean I don't do maths but hell I knew the second I saw the 'fish'.John Hurt was excellent and that's all the good things I can say about this movie. Seriously if the plot of a murder mystery sucks you don't expect the movie to go anywhere near greatness.

Being a short story is does lack in depth and this is where this movie has taken this story and expanded on it. For those who are concerned that maths is not their thing don't worry.

	schema:reviewBody "The Oxford Murders is one of a very rare type of movie I'm not even sure what you would call it. Intellectual Thriller or maybe Nerd Mystery. Whatever the category it's one of those thrillers where the leads are so intelligent and inquisitive that they often fly into uncontrollable excitement because of some new bit of mathematical code that just popped into their minds. It starts out with a great hook  a professor is telling a story to his class about a man who in the midst of a heated battle sat down amidst all of the gunfire around him and wrote feverishly in his notebook because he absolutely had to write down what was in his mind at that very moment. What was so important that he would risk his life?Much of the first part of the movie is a philosophical discourse which asks us generic existential clichs like Can we know the truth? And how do we really know anything? Elijah Wood stars as Martin a young American so eager to achieve the answers to these questions that he travels to England with the sole purpose of picking the brain of a Professor Seldom whose name sounds like it belongs in a Harry Potter story the man who was giving the lecture at the beginning of the movie.You see Martin believes that if we uncover the secret meaning of numbers we'll know the secret meaning of reality. I'm going to just come right out and say that the movie pretty much lost me at this point. I'm not sure how the meaning of numbers is connected to the meaning of reality or if the meaning of reality means the meaning of life or just the true nature of our surroundings and most importantly I didn't know there was a secret meaning of numbers. In fact until I saw this movie I thought that mathematics was a universal language. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention in my college philosophy classes.Regardless questions like these soon become of the utmost importance as a series of murders begin happening that seem to be driven by an intellectual motive. At this point you'll notice that every character's behavior and background is designed to make them a suspect and the movie literally turns into a game of Clue. During their investigations Seldom and Martin actually discuss the similarities to Clue and how best to solve the mystery using that format. To muddle things even further the movie uses philosophy to stretch reasonable doubt to the absolute extreme. Seldom explains to Martin in dramatically hushed language that no matter how certain and clear and obvious the evidence we can never be ABSOLUTELY certain who the killer is. This is the kind of nihilism that leads to the logical conclusion that we should just open all of the prisons and let everyone run free and maybe even dismantle the entire legal system because following that logic it clearly serves no purpose. But one thing I did love about the movie is how Martin shows up from America this gigantic math geek if ever there was one and immediately makes friends with two beautiful girls who immediately fall in love with him. I hate it when that happens! One of them who he met while playing racquetball is so stunningly beautiful that it makes no sense when she falls for this guy. She makes Elijah Wood look like a little kid! I think there's a good sex scene in the movie where you can see her naked but I missed almost the entire thing because I fainted when she took her shirt off.There is a complicated and unnecessary back story late in the film about a past student of Seldom's who drove himself insane with his strenuous efforts to answer some of the some of the questions of the universe until he ended up helpless on a hospital bed because his body couldn't keep up with his mind. He loses his legs and his mobility and his sanity and then can't even do better than a hospital that has so little respect for its patients that they would leave a legless man lying naked on his stomach for all to see. Nice.But in the movie's defense despite all of the mumbo jumbo throughout the film the climax is actually pretty good. You may feel completely lost for a good part of the running time unless you have a little background in mathematics and philosophy yourself I don't. But unfortunately they still can't resist handing us a nicely packaged philosophical sound bite to wrap everything up at the end which creates a little problem. The mystery in the movie has been allowed to solve itself and to do so in a pretty impressive way but then they give us an entirely different solution through dialogue  a crazy solution.I'm willing to bet that this story looked great on paper but on the screen there is a little too much nonsense to deal with and FAR too much highbrow intellectualism. It's safe to assume that a large portion of the audience will feel pretty alienated. I personally have a tough time relating to characters that get uncontrollably excited about things like historical philosophy and math theory and an entire movie based on things like this is even more of a challenge.On the other hand in a time when our movies are overflowing with stupidity we should cherish the ones that really try to give us something to think about. But personally I prefer the ones that are just a little more accessible".

The whole film is so botched you wish they could do it over again.This is based on a Spanish novel of the intellectual thriller sort where grand ideas supposedly go hand in hand with crimesolving. Maybe it worked better on the printed page but literally transferred to the screen it's all pretty silly. Especially ludicrous are all the red herrings that get slapped in our faces like wet fish. What's with the amputee lying naked in the hospital bed? I suppose this was to add a grotesque absurdist touch to the intellectual proceedings but it had me whooping with laughter. Very lame and cringeinducing like large patches of the intellectual dialog.One problem both the screenwriter and director are Spanish and I am wondering how proficient they are in the English language. The script is tonedeaf no actor could say some of these lines without sounding ridiculous. And could the director even tell the difference between American and British accents? Maybe not. The Brit actors are all such pros they just grab the ham and run with it but poor Elijah needed some help here and the director was not there for him I suspect because he simply couldn't hear how wooden Elijah sounds.All in all a nearly total misfire but inanely entertaining enough to watch all the way through.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Oxford Murders' is utterly ridiculous yet strangely fun. American student Elijah Wood is not the only person here who seems out of his depth and the adaptation would definitely play better as a television drama where expectations might be less. Martin Wood admires Arthur Seldom John Hurt in an exceptional performance  perfectly adrift yet somehow attentive concurrently so much that he plans his Oxford study around a chance to have Seldom oversee his work. Thus he moves in with Anna Massey a bitter landlady and friend of Seldom and her daughter Beth Julie Cox who looks astonishingly like Wood here with the wide eyes and bone structure. While playing mathematical tennis he meets Lorna Spanish actress Leonor Watling who dressed to impress putting her sweat patches aside takes an instant like to Martin and he returns the favour. Before long Lorna  who looks a bit like TV show Baywatch's aunt  and Martin are tearing at each other clothes in a way that the film would have you believe people in Oxford never behaved because Oxford is a stifling city and the people all a little too serious. Lorna cooks breakfast naked but for an apron fitted to show off her curves though breakfast ends up on her chest anyway. There is a ludicrous and completely pointless subplot  as it adds nothing to the tension regarding an erratic student who shouts a lot and acts like a killer. There are a few surprises along the way and the oxford footage is good though edited in a way that it barely resembles the real Oxford at times there are no houses next to The Sheldonian Theatre. The movie does little to advertise Oxford and instead chooses to present it as a separate universe where unpleasant things happen and everyone is slightly nauseating. Unless you are a youthful and slightly brash American man then Oxford offers little. If you are like Martin then Oxford might show you your first corpse but will also give you excitement intrigue and attractive available women at every turn. An okay film but a true shame that okay was merely the order of the day.".

This movie does this in spades.The major weight of carrying the film rested squarely on the shoulders of Amanda Seyfried. Other than being very lovely shoulders she did an excellent job of portraying her character. She has a great range of endearing expressions. I've seen her in a couple of other films that I enjoyed her in but none better than this even considering the broader production values of Mama Mia. She was radiantly beautiful and added just the right note of intelligence warmth and charm. In one scene where her character described her excellent education it didn't seem ludicrous coming from her as it has in the past from other actors. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her  and not just because of her radiant beauty either.The rest of the cast did an admirable job as well. Gael Garca Bernal did well in his role of Seyfried's distracted workaholic fianc. Later in the film the arrival of Christopher Egan as counterpoint to Bernal was handled with better than average skill by Egan. His grandmother played with subtlety by Vanessa Redgrave was the focus of the story and has never seemed more sensitive and caring. But hey fellas whoever was wrangling the script RiveraSullivan she wasn't believable saying she was 65 when she's 73. But that was the only off note to me. Finally Oliver Platt added an enjoyable aside as Seyfried's boss.Finally the rest of the productions elements sets costumes locations etc are all right on the money for the theme and feel of the film nothing out of place of awkward looking. Excellent entertainment all around.".

She meets the old lady and they decide to search her former love together. There are seventyfour Lorenzo Bartolini in Italy but true love does not have expiration date. Meanwhile the estranged relationship between Sophie and Charlie changes.Letters to Juliet is a delightful romance highly recommended for romantic viewers. I have seen the trailer that is a spoiler indeed and I postponed the DVD to watch it later. But the movie is worth specially watching the performance of Ms. Vanessa Redgrave who is still a very elegant and beautiful lady and gives credibility to Claire Smith. The witty and sparkled Amanda Seyfried seems to have fun performing Sophie and Christopher Egan completes the charming young lead couple. For those like me that have never had the chance to visit Italy the journey of Claire Sophie and Charlie is an awesome sightseeing in this beautiful country. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Cartas para Julieta Letters to Juliet".

But the movie is worth specially watching the performance of Ms. Vanessa Redgrave who is still a very elegant and beautiful lady and gives credibility to Claire Smith. The witty and sparkled Amanda Seyfried seems to have fun performing Sophie and Christopher Egan completes the charming young lead couple. For those like me that have never had the chance to visit Italy the journey of Claire Sophie and Charlie is an awesome sightseeing in this beautiful country. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Cartas para Julieta Letters to Juliet";

	schema:reviewBody "Aspiring writer Sophie Amanda Seyfried and her fianc go to Verona for a preweddingbusiness trip but he's obsessed with work and leaves poor Sophie to sightsee alone. She visits Juliet's famous house where for generations lovelorn women have left letters asking for advice in Juliet's brick wall. The locals who answer the letters on Juliet's behalf invite Sophie to join them and her response to a 50year old letter will change several lives forever.This has all the makings of a charming chick flick telling an idealistic love story in a stunningly beautiful place. Verona and the Tuscan countryside are so gorgeous I was ready to pack my bags and go. Seyfried makes a likable enough heroine but she's paired with wooden Christopher Eagan who lacks depth looks too young and is a total cheeseball. The two share no romantic sparks whatsoever.The movie is saved by Vanessa Redgrave as the woman who wrote the letter decades ago. She's classy confidant and doesn't look like she's acting. Her reunited lost love is played perfectly by Franco Nero who commands the screen even though his part is small. Their obvious chemistry is for real they were in love in the sixties parted and only recently reunited and married  what a good plot for a movie! It's a shame the story has such a Disneyish fairy talefeel to it. One knows immediately everything that will happen and how it will end. It was too unbelievable and silly for me although I think younger people would like it. Recommended for those who love picturesque Italy.".

It shows two women one longing to find a lost true love and another that longs to find the true love. Their desire for true love is well portrayed one can see that they do not just want love but they want the kind of love that transcends and sublimes. And to wait for 50 years for that adds further emotional depth making it a tearjerker.

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with gratuitously romantic films is that they often tend to alienate those audience members who have a lick of common sense! While there is nothing wrong with a film wearing its heart on its sleeve it is quite something else to try to embrace an airyfairy heroine with no sense of maturity whatsoever.Sophie Seyfried is in her mid20's working as a factchecker for New Yorker magazine living in Manhattan and engaged to gorgeous passionate chef Victor Bernal. Victor is just weeks away from opening his own restaurant and is unfortunately rather busy in the runup to his launch. When they go on holiday to Verona he drags her around beautiful vineyards and gourmet food tastings very difficult to sympathise and she moans and groans until they decide to do their own thing. Sophie visits Juliet Capulet's house where women flock from all over the world to bring love letters which they leave on the wall outside. The plot thickens when Sophie meets the women who reply to the letters known as the Secretaries of Juliet. She soon joins in and becomes involved in a 50 yearold love story involving an elderly British lady Redgrave in search of her true love much to the chagrin of her snooty grandson Egan.The plot is silly but rather fun. The Tuscan countryside is incredibly beautiful which makes the film pleasant on the eye and the plot moves along at a good pace never leaving the audience bored. However it is very difficult to villainise the unromantic fiance who only seeks to live life with his feet on the ground. The term true love is tossed around constantly but the fact is Sophie has no concept of working through problems or allowing her partner space during a stressful time. She has no time for his passion for food but gets in a strop when he doesn't listen to her nonsense love stories.This is a silly fluffy film with a small amount of charm which comes in the form of the enchanting Amanda Seyfried. Her love interest Christopher Egan is thoroughly unlikeable and they certainly don't have enough chemistry to suggest that she should give up her whole life to be with him. However Vanessa Redgrave's search for her long lost love proves infinitely more affecting and this part of the story is sweet and seems to have more of a grownup sensibility. Letters to Juliet will probably delight diehard romantics but it is difficult not to be annoyed by its simplistic and downright naive view of what true love really is?".

Two things got in the way. 1 The story was just a little too light seems like they were trying too hard to make a romantic comedy instead of letting it be what it was  probably the money people were responsibly for that one. 2 The two leads were somewhat unlikable with zero chemistry. She was OK but he was a Hugh Grant caricature. The pacing of their relationship was way too fast to be believable.

Amanda Seyfried and Christopher Egan simply do not develop any chemistry on the screen which gives Gael Garca Bernal a clear lead in the acting department. Amanda Seyfried is a wooden actress with no acting in her eyes and both she and Christopher Egan are painfully slow with their meantto besharp dialogs.

Amanda Seyfried plays as a sweet young engaged woman named Sophie who finds a note written over 50 years ago by Claire portrayed by the amazing Vanessa Redgrave who talks of her one true love Lorenzo and Sophie replies.The film starts off strong and doesn't let up. It's brilliantly played out by the actors and actresses and it becomes more entertaining with each second.

The characters while not the most excellent characters ever conceived are very believable and likable to an extent.

I always enjoy Amanda Seyfried's performances and the movie itself is a really adorable and amusing adventure. I laughed I felt compassion and I walked out of the theater feeling refreshed and rejuvenated because of how sweet it was and how much it moved me. Really the only downside is that there was a Taylor Swift song used around the end.While it's certainly not a masterpiece I praise it for being able to go way past the average rom com or tearjerker and just be a simply pleasing experience with very fun scenes and a great sense of romance and happiness that I was touched by. It was a job well done and a breath of fresh air from a lot of trash heaps that are passed off as Romance films nowadays. I suggest anyone who can enjoy this lighthearted fun and delightful adventure see it right away!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophie Amanda Seyfried is a fact checker for New Yorker magazine although she longs to be a bonafide journalist. Her boss Oliver Platt knows she does a great job in her present position but has no clue concerning her writing aspirations. Lucky gal she is also engaged to a very handsome chef Gael Garcia Bernal and they are about to embark on a journey to Verona Italy. But how genuine is her luck really? Her fianc rarely devotes his full attention to what she is saying or wishing being utterly wrapped up in the new restaurant he is about to open. Even the trip abroad a supposed prehoneymoon gets sidetracked when future hubby only wants to go to wine auctions and such. No sightseeing which is what Sophie is keen to do. Therefore she lets her mate go off on his own while she looks over Verona especially the Juliet Wall where folks leave letters to Juliet for advice on love. Sophie discovers that a team of older ladies compose the return letters and they let her help one day. It is then that Sophie finds a letter tucked behind a loose brick. What a find! As it turns out it was written by a young lady named Claire Vanessa Redgrave fifty years ago. She wanted to know if she should follow her heart and become attached to an Italian named Lorenzo Franco Nero or should she go home to England. Sadly no one found the letter and Claire returned to Britain. Now Sophie writes a reply to see what occurs. Ho ho ho! Claire and her grandson Charlie Christopher Egan are in Verona in a matter of a few days with Charlie giving Sophie a tonguelashing for upsetting his grandmother's life. Instant dislike reigns. But given the fact that fianc is still on the run this new trio Claire Sophie and Charlie begin a search through the surrounding countryside for Lorenzo. Will they find him? And will Sophie and Charlie stop fighting long enough to gaze into each other's eyes? I say go see this beautifully made film soon. The cast is wonderful with Seyfried and Egan making a talented and goodlooking pair and the lesser cast members doing nice work as well. Redgrave is very touching as the older lady looking backwards and Nero well not only is he charming he still looks most handsome! The scenery naturally is dazzling and so are the costumes and cinematography. The script has some originality as well as predictable events and the direction though slow at times seems secure. In short let yourself off the hook from more mundane tasks and trot off to the cinema for this little gem romance fans.".

Her boss Oliver Platt knows she does a great job in her present position but has no clue concerning her writing aspirations. Lucky gal she is also engaged to a very handsome chef Gael Garcia Bernal and they are about to embark on a journey to Verona Italy. But how genuine is her luck really? Her fianc rarely devotes his full attention to what she is saying or wishing being utterly wrapped up in the new restaurant he is about to open. Even the trip abroad a supposed prehoneymoon gets sidetracked when future hubby only wants to go to wine auctions and such. No sightseeing which is what Sophie is keen to do. Therefore she lets her mate go off on his own while she looks over Verona especially the Juliet Wall where folks leave letters to Juliet for advice on love. Sophie discovers that a team of older ladies compose the return letters and they let her help one day. It is then that Sophie finds a letter tucked behind a loose brick. What a find! As it turns out it was written by a young lady named Claire Vanessa Redgrave fifty years ago. She wanted to know if she should follow her heart and become attached to an Italian named Lorenzo Franco Nero or should she go home to England. Sadly no one found the letter and Claire returned to Britain. Now Sophie writes a reply to see what occurs. Ho ho ho! Claire and her grandson Charlie Christopher Egan are in Verona in a matter of a few days with Charlie giving Sophie a tonguelashing for upsetting his grandmother's life. Instant dislike reigns. But given the fact that fianc is still on the run this new trio Claire Sophie and Charlie begin a search through the surrounding countryside for Lorenzo. Will they find him? And will Sophie and Charlie stop fighting long enough to gaze into each other's eyes? I say go see this beautifully made film soon. The cast is wonderful with Seyfried and Egan making a talented and goodlooking pair and the lesser cast members doing nice work as well. Redgrave is very touching as the older lady looking backwards and Nero well not only is he charming he still looks most handsome! The scenery naturally is dazzling and so are the costumes and cinematography. The script has some originality as well as predictable events and the direction though slow at times seems secure. In short let yourself off the hook from more mundane tasks and trot off to the cinema for this little gem romance fans.";

This film could have been a light and enjoyable romantic comedy but Miss Redgraves shines like a very welcome sun giving us plenty of warmth and love like in the classic comedies of the 30's. Everything was possible back then...Christopher Egan and Amanda Seyfried are not bad at all and they have enough chemistry to enjoy the secondary story line but she does deserve a better partner in her next time out. Back to Miss Redgrave after all she is back and much like the story line she has been around forever but she hasn't been a romantic lead for a while and this character is not pretending to be another age or too hip or too different or none is revisiting the genre and looking at the complexities of the mind. What we get is a romantic fantasy about two people who might get to have their dreams come true.What is special about this entry is that the leading lady is charming and wise tender and understanding that she has a grandson and sees beyond what the others see. She understands what is like to be in love what is like to lose a great love and what it feels like to have a second chance with the true love of your life. In fact when we see how she has some near misses in the film our hearts nearly break.The film is handsomely photographed. It is after all Italy and there is much to enjoy as the story unfolds. There is no secret and surprising ending but a very sweet film with a fantastic performance and with much to offer a public that longs for some fulfilling story lines.May Ms. Redgrave live on...".

Because of her intrusion his grandmother Claire is in Italy foolishly attempting to find her one true love.I was put off by how the character of the grandson Charlie was written. He was rude which made him very unattractive. The character arc attempted to portray how he is very guarded after his parents' untimely death. It even goes on to mention how he works as a pro bono attorney. He is intended to be gruff on the outside with endearing qualities on the inside. Whatever even after his back story I still couldn't get past the initial first impression  jerk.As the story line continues the trio of Charlie Claire and Sophie traipse around Verona trying to find Claire's long lost love. All they have to go on is his name Lorenzo Bartolini which they find is quite a common name and that fact that Claire believes he is still living in Verona. This should have been a vignette instead it took way too long. I found myself fast forwarding through each meeting with a Lorenzo Bartolini. I was bored.The yawns continued with the Sophie and Victor her fianc scenario. It was predictable early on the audience is shown how distracted her fianc is with his own life and aspirations. The fact that it took almost the entire movie before she dumps him is amazing.A more interesting story would have been of Juliet's secretaries the group of women that answer the letters of the distressed confused and heartbroken. Who were these women and what brought them to the table to now be in a place to give advice to others?

The movie is full of simple and innocent moments with breathtaking locations of Italy watching the stunning locations will leave you in Awe and desire to visit Italy immediately. Amanda Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and her chemistry is very enchanting with Christopher Egan. Though her chemistry with Goal Garcia Bernal is very flat may be it also required for the script. Christopher Egan is one hell of sexy and adorable Aussi Lad though in the movie he plays British. His charming personality and chemistry with Amanda Seyfried is worth watching. Goal Garcia Bernal was OK. Vanessa Redgrave is truly elegant and graceful in this age. Franco Nero suited really well as the ultimate Lorenzo of Vanessa Redgrave. By the way Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero are couple in real life as well isn't that amazing. Taylor Swift's song Love Story was a perfect fit for the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "The acting was second rate except for Redgrave the plot was unnatural and the characters were unbelievable  and not remotely appealing to the extent that they were coherent.The entire film felt patched together. Rather than developing the characters their motives and the audience's investment the film simply told you who to root for and expected you to take it for granted. Perhaps worst the main character exhibited no laudable characteristics there was nothing in her actions or intimations that suggested any reason to find her charming intelligent or otherwise desirable. Moreover the male characters were simply cardboard cutouts  you're supposed to like this one and not that one based mainly on the reactions of the female main character. Unless you are a teenager that is able to project heavily upon the film to derive your enjoyment I suggest you let this one pass you by. The movie was forced shallow and ultimately a waste of 90 minutes.".

Italy is a beautiful backdrop for a load of tosh. The acting was wooden and totally implausible. However it may be that noone could have made much of the plot and script. It looked as if someone had managed to secure Vanessa Redgrave and then set about finding a suitable vehicle for her. I have seen this actress over the years on film and the stage and found her to be exciting and intelligent in her performances. This was a total waste of her talent. There are far too many films coming out and more is definitely less as this shows.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sorry but I've really got to roll my sleeves up on this one  and it's not because it's a chick flick or as I prefer to describe a sheila's movie I have been known to enjoy the odd one of them over the years it's just because it's a bloody awful movie.Now I've always been of the opinion that 99 out of a hundred people can act it's not that hard and it's basically actors' looks that get them through. Well if that is the case then Aussie soap opera's Christopher Egan is that one in a hundred who can't act. As an Australian I am able to make the observation that his remarkable lack of acting ability put him in very good stead to be cast for Australian TV soaps  and he was. Egan's upper class English accent playing the male protagonist Charlie reminded me very much of Lee Evans playing Tucker in Something About Mary  and Tucker was meant to come across as a fake. If anything Charlie's accent fell well short of Tucker's in authenticity but unlike the character of Tucker whose accent was funny Charlie's accent was just plain laughable.However to be brutally frank I don't think the accent detracted from Egan's performance because in all other facets that was just plain nauseating. It was just sooooooooo unconvincing that it inflicted a mortal wound for the movie. If the producers had cast one of the 99 of the world's male population who was suitably aged suitably handsome and who could act the movie may have otherwise clawed itself up to have been fairly described as mediocre. Unfortunately it was impossible for the story to recover from this miscasting blunder.Again to be frank I believe that the only way Christopher Egan could have been more miscast was if he was given the role of Claire played of course by Vanessa Redgrave. However I reckon Egan could have actually done a better job of playing Sophie than what he did of portraying Charlie.Beautiful scenery and reasonable acting by the two female stars as I say who can't act? the storyline is clichd and consequently extremely predictable.It's one of those movies that I could not possibly have sat through but for the fact I was reading a book at the same time. Overall I give it an Uggghhhhhhhh rating  410 and the producers should think themselves bloody well lucky I even scored it at that!".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie on a plane and I had hoped it would at least bring forth some mildly credible sweet love story. But no. The plot is really stupid and the main character is unbearable. The movie is a complete waste of time.Spoilers Here's what I didn't like about the movie...Sophie Amanda Seyfried is such an unlikeable character. She is an immature young journalistwriter who has no interest in her fianc's life and work and somehow expects him to lavish her with attention anyway. Because he doesn't she falls in love with another man with whom she shares no interests and whom she will probably cheat on pretty soon. Strangely enough this character  who is completely unable to have a relationship of her own  is going around Verona telling people what love is and how they should behave... Hello? Is this supposed to be romantic? It is sooo dull!!! Another thing I think was absurd was how Sophie Seyfried is supposed to fall out of love from her fascinating good looking fianc Victor Gael Garcia Bernal and fall for the flat and fully boring Charlie Christopher Egan. I think that made Seyfried's character seem even more obnoxious.I did not like Seyfried's acting but considering how bad the script was I guess it is hard to expect anything good would come out of it. What I don't understand is why an excellent actress like Vanessa Redgrave agreed to play the role of Claire. By the way the fact that Claire's husband is conveniently dead and she ends up finding her teenagebeau in Italy whose wife is ALSO conveniently dead is really beyond corny... Honestly I think that the scriptwriters could have been able to work out a better story out of the letters to Romeo's Julia left behind in the streets of Verona...".
