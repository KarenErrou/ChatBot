At least that's what they think until that morning on July 16th 1942 when their fragile happiness is toppled over. From the Vlodrome D'Hiver where 13 000 Jews are crammed to the camp of BeauneLaRolande from Vichy to the terrace of the Berghof La Rafle follows the real destinies of the victims and the executioners. Of those who orchestrated it all. Of those who trusted them. Of those who fled. Of those who opposed them. Every character in this film has existed.

I recommend this movie at all both for its educational aspect historic for its great evocative power.

Their story is based on evidence recounted by survivors and witnesses to the events and as is often the case truth is stranger than fiction especially when it comes to stories of humanity.What is unique about this film is how the relationship of Jews and nonJews and how the sympathies of Parisians to their Nazi occupiers is conveyed. Every shade of humanity is depicted from an antisemitic neighbourhood baker and bullying police to acts of kindness shown by firemen and neighbours and of course the main character a nurse who volunteers to care for the interned Jews. Interspersed with this story are snippets of Hitler and Eva at Berchtesgaden with Adolf shown alternatively as a loving 'uncle' to the children of the Nazi elite or as a madman planning the destruction of the Jewish people.This is an extremely well written directed and acted film.

In July 1942 the French police at the direction of the Nazis rounded up thousands of Jewish citizens and detained them in appalling conditions in the Paris velodrome for several days. The detainees were then shipped to a camp outside Paris for a period of time before they were subsequently transported to the extermination camps in Poland. This incident was the backdrop for the recent Sarah's Key which starred Kristen Scott Thomas. But here the subject matter is far more powerful harrowing and ultimately poignant. There is no doubting the anger and disgust felt by writerdirector Rose Bosche at these events. She handles some of the gruesome brutalities and atrocities in an unflinching fashion that heightens their impact on the audience. A note at the start of the film informs us that all the events depicted here actually happened even the most extreme. The film also occasionally cuts away from the depravities endured by the Jews to shots of a smiling and laughing Hitler Udo Schenk enjoying his retreat high in the picturesque German Alps. The events largely unfold from the perspective of elevenyear old Jo Weismann Hugo Leverdez who managed to escape from the camp before his family was sent East. Of the 4500 children sent to the camps none survived and only 25 adults survived. Jean Reno lends his formidable presence to the role of a sympathetic doctor who worked amongst the prisoners. Melanie Laurent is also deeply affecting as a dutiful nurse who is appalled by what she witnesses and tries to inform the authorities to little avail. Not to be missed!".

The acting in general was excellent and the child actors were superb with such a difficult storyline. The music fitted well to the story and allowed the feel of the movie to shine through. In all a great film which stirs the blood and makes one feel ashamed to be human. It is important to remember what happened and why we should never let it happen again however it seems that it happens now and we do nothing about it. Long live the French film school with a tear in my eye I end this review and think again of the many who died without a cause.".

My main points are twofold1. The comment made that The Roundup left the viewer in a state of severe depression is lamentable. Perhaps heshe felt a sense of despair not depression but I'm not sure anyone would want to watch any such film and come out feeling full of joy. The ending certainly allowed one to feel a certain sense of happiness for the few individuals who survived but the fact that so few did so is reason enough not to sugarcoat events through unnecessarily focussing on one or two good moments for a few individuals. This is what might have happened had character development gone beyond what is required of a film of this type. The storyline is grim because the events were grim. 2. The reviewer seems to have missed the main point of the film. The interest for me in seeing such films is the light they shine on those who collaborated with the Nazis in various countries in Europe and the varying reasons and motives that drove this collaboration. For me this film gave an interesting look into the attitudes of the Vichy French and the antisemitism that pervaded their thinking.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this film because it was a cheap DVD and it sat on my shelf for sometime until one night with nothing else to watch I selected it and spent the next couple of hours transfixed by this amazing tale of just about every human emotion. The film shows how prejudices come out during such times as previous neighbours turn on those they have lived with for years. Sadly nothing has changed as we have seen in more recent conflicts. Also France itself is still very antimmigrant in it's attitude in fact against anything that isn't French. Udo Schenk perfectly captures Hitler with his conflicting personalities loving children at the same time exterminating others just because they are Jewish. Hugo Leverdez as Jo Weismann will melt even the hardest heart and this brilliantly shows just how heartless those involved must have been. Jean Reno is excellent as the Jewish doctor who worked amongst the prisoners doing whatever he could. Melanie Laurent is also brilliant as the nurse who slowly comes to realise the full extent of what is actually going on! As others have said all the actors who portrayed children were really good. This film should have won Oscars but sadly did not. I believe it is much better than Schindlers List as it does not really on graphic depictions of violence although there is some it rather shows the horror through the eyes of those involved. If you have the DVD watch the making of to be moved yet again.".

I am a huge fan of Jean Reno and I became a fan recently of Melanie Laurent who I met through the film Inglorious Basterds. I knew I wanted to watch this film based on these excellent actors and the fact that it was a French story surrounding the Holocaust which I'd never seen before  a French story regarding the Holocaust. The fact that it is a true story of the events of July 16 1942 sealed the deal. This story is heartwrenching and heartbreaking and is so well told that as a human you are feeling everything each Jewish person and family goes through in these events. As a human you are reminded how evil and cold hearted the Nazi machine was and how there are some people who refuse to give up their humanity no matter the costs. While we say that we don't want this to ever happen again I am reminded of news stories where these things are happening again. Ethnic groups killed with machetes or chemicals like sarin gas or restriction of water and food so they starve or die of thirst. I think this film should be watched by every high school student in any country so that they see what really happened that day. Maybe if we all share the same vision that this should not be repeated then perhaps it won't. It is a naive dream I know. I think evil will always be here.

This movie highlights the children's fate more than the rest and the actors in those roles did a pretty good job. Because we see children being torn from their parents and being brought to be killed as they were it is a difficult movie to watch how can it not. Some reviewers complain about the numerous movies on the subject of the holocaust there have been genocides before WWII and more even since so as long as there are there must be movies on the subject. Books and encyclopedias can relate facts etc. but motion pictures about genocides do a far better job at conveying the horror and the evil it is.

It's the continued narrative perpetrated by Israeli's who have already selfishly and greedily hijacked the holocaust as an ongoing justification for their current foreign policy which is criminal. However in this film the audience's intelligence is insulted beyond comprehension as the protagonists are almost caricatures and history is told through the eyes of saccharine viewing children. The Nazi's of course are bloodthirsty removed bureaucrats while the French jews are portrayed as harmless benevolent life loving people who simply love one another and may as well be angels. This narrative is told time and again giving the viewer no reason or context with which to view the history of antisemitism. The intelligent filmgoer will feel manipulated even though the question of good vs evil is intact. The point that is constantly airbrushed out of history is that Germany was not simply a nation of 'Nazi's' just as Jewish people were not all Zionists's. But to please the politically correct thought police is once again the more important virtue than representing a complex and comprehensive historical event. This may as well be Batman vs insert villain.".

	schema:headline " The Holocaust in France";
	schema:reviewBody "Man the Holocaust was depressing. And this movie faithfully shows real life events of Jews in France in about the most depressing way possible.The main focus is one family and their various neighbors who escaped Poland and came to Paris to avoid the Germans. Through the course of a pretty much hopeless two hours you follow them and a French Protestant Nurse as they go through the various horrible things that the Germans and with compliance from the French did to them.A lot of the other reviews are calling it a French Schindler's List. It isn't. Schindler's List is beautifully directed and acted this is not. The direction always feels like you're watching a documentary and aren't actually feeling a lot of the things that the characters are supposed to be feeling. Then it cuts to something else completely like backroom dealings and you almost feel like some voice over guy says Meanwhile in a dark dusty room in Paris. I think the director's main goal was to try to convince you that the French government was no better than the Germans and it didn't matter if that story fit his film or not.My biggest issue with movie was actually the plot. At this point pretty much everyone knows that the Holocaust was absolutely terrible. We see small moments of ordinary people being heroic and either hiding Jews or doing little things to help them. But then they're gone and there's no hope. Most of the other Holocaust movies focuses on a denouement of something good happening. Schindler had a list. Life is Beautiful spoiler ended the war. Not in this film. In this film you knew that basically everyone was going to die since it gave the time frame of when it started. Sure a couple individuals survived. But you knew that basically all of the things that were done would lead to the death of hundreds of characters. It just doesn't make the film that much fun to watch. It's tough to get attached to someone you know is going to die for no good reason.If you want to see a movie about Jews in occupied France sure. If you want to be depressed for a couple hours with almost nothing breaking it up or giving hope then La Rafle is for you. If you want to watch a movie about the Holocaust or the plight of Jews in that time period there are some better films that actually give you some amount of hope about the whole situation. This one just didn't focus on that instead going through the step by step ways that people were lead to their deaths.".

Melanie Laurent and Hugo Levedez are incandescent as the nurse and young boy who endure the horrors of the Vel D'Hive roundup in Paris during 1942. I was surprised that this movie did not get a higher rating on IMDb possibly attributed to the small number who have seen it in the U.S. Of personal interest to me is the fact that I wrote a short story Black Thursday on the same subject in 2011. I'm willing to make it available to anyone who wishes to read it by contacting me at bfp13108yahoo.com. On another personal note I am repulsed by the racist ignorant and hateful remarks made by so many on the various comment boards located on the internet. I often wonder how these people would react if they were in the same situation as Jo's family. I rarely rate a movie as 10 on IMDb reserving it for the finest of cinema. However I did rate this 10 based on it's artistic dramatic and superb representation of one of the most horrific events in the 20th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bought this film having read good reviews and have always been an admirer of Jean Reno in the films I have seen him in. I also don't mind watching a film with subtitles.I wasn't expecting the film to be better than what I thought and was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes when you know a film is supposed to be emotional you subconsciously prepare yourself and don't quite get the emotion but this film did it for me.The story of thousands of Jews and their families taken from their homes in Paris and placed in war camps where many are later killed is a powerful one. Never before has this particular episode in French history during the war been told. We see the effect through various Jews eyes of being forced from your home because you happen to be Jewish and how families and friends are torn apart. Those that try to escape who succeed and those who don't those that cant even face their fate and those that bravely believe that one day again they will be free. It is through the children that much of this story centers the innocent ones which also carries much of the emotion the very young children too young to understand what is happening and going to happen to them and the slightly older children that show bravery beyond their years. Also through the eyes of a brave nurseMelanie Laurent and a dedicated Doctor Jean Reno we see a triumph of the human spirit to never give up and to try and stay united. The emotion in the film never lets up from start to finish and their is a constant mixture of cruelty and horror impending dread yet tinged with hope and belief. Special praise must go to Melanie Laurent who plays the part of a nurse you can really feel the connection she has with the children as if she is mother to them all. Jean Reno is not in the film as much as I expected but his presence is still felt and he can convey great emotion with just his face alone. The child actors are all good and Udo Schenkwho plays Adolf Hitler is also very good. The music in the film is perfect for the story and the film is just the right length to keep you gripped.A very good retelling of a surprisingly neglected story highly recommended.".

Mathieu Kassovitz who also played the male leading role in 'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain'is very convincing in his role.I think this movie is highly underrated. CostaGavras has made an important movie with 'Amen.' which looks at the holocausttragedy from another point of view which is seldom showed. The movie gives a true although unbelievable answer at one of the most important questions concerning the holocaust didn't anyone saw this coming? Couldn't anyone prevent this from happening? If you really want to know the answers to this questions you certainly have to watch 'Amen.'. This movie should at least have an 8 and I'll give you two reasons why one because the story is unique and magnificently told and two because the two leading actors are giving the performance of a lifetime.

	schema:headline " Gavras film is an excellent depiction from a unique point of view";
	schema:reviewBody "I think I am the first person from the USA to comment on this film.  We saw it as part of the Pittsburgh Filmmakers festival.  There were only maybe 50 people at the screening we attended and there were only two screenings. This is so unfortunate.This is an excellent film and exemplifies I think the role of the arts in raising society's level of conscience and effecting social change.   It galls me that a mind set is growing sixty years later that refutes the occurrence of the holocaust. All the pictures names and movie footage in the world will never change these people's minds convincing them is not the issue.  But when you take on the large institutions of society when you make them accountable and demand that they fess up to their inadequacies and that they not allow it to happen again then you get the kind of permanent positive change that is not eroded by a capricious shift in the political winds.The amazing thing about this film was the powerful effect it achieved with very little if any shocking footage.  We are conditioned to look away from all the standard holocaust images  the drawn faces the gaunt skeletons the bones in the ovens the piles of shoes and personal effects. Instead Gavras uses Gerstein's involvement with the engineering side of the issue and paints a chilling picture of the magnitude of the killings.  The project management meetings where they discuss the efficiency improvement strategies for gassing people and cleaning out the chambers are eerily similar to meetings I and many other Dilberttypes attend on a regular basis.  The final scene at the camp where all the SS facilities officers chorus their concerns over decreased KILLING efficiency is ridiculously chilling. These guys could be whining about their bottom line numbers at a board meeting for any major corporation.Gavras hammers home the numbers with the repeated scenes of empty trains going and full trains coming  and you never see a person in the full ones only closed doors.  Think about the numbers.  A million people a year is nearly three thousand a day. Instead of making his point with stark images the way so many other films have Gavras keeps hammering the shear logistics the size of the camps the amounts of the gas needed the HUGE numbers of people that had to be transported. Think of how big a train with a thousand people is  that's over three times the capacity of the biggest airliners.  Gerstein's confrontation with his old friend the transportation officer points out how people could vilify certain nazis SS and Gestapo and yet remain conveniently ignorant of their own complicity.The Vatican issued a watered down apology in 1998 admitting partial culpability and asking forgiveness.  There are still many who believe that the diplomatic tightrope the Vatican walked was the best course.  The conversation between Cardinal Maglione and the German ambassador is accurately taken directly from the Vatican archives.  But Gavras makes a valid case that the arguments against outing the German killing machine were weak. That other protests had yielded positive results look up the 1943 Rosenstrasse uprising and that the motivations for not acting more decisively were based in part on antiSemitism along with diplomatic prudence.Gavras trys to show that many people who could have acted knew all the facts and chose not to act.  I remember around the time Gavras' released Z how the protesters at the 1968 democratic national convention chanted THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING!   It didn't matter then and Gavras makes the case that it didn't matter during the holocaust the political powers of the world move at their own pace.Now sixty years later we have the last of the actual participants dying off.  WWII veterans here in the USA are dying at a rate of 1500 a day and their ranks are dwindling.  There are fewer and fewer left to tell the story or be held accountable.  It is incumbent on us however to uncover the coverups identify the systems or methods that allowed such atrocities to happen and make the changes in our society's structure to ensure they don't happen again.  Gavras' film effectively does this. Like the principals in the film we now know the real story.  Like the principals in the film how we act with this knowledge will be judged by future generations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amen a film based on the largely accurate account of German SS officer Kurt Gerstein's multiple attempts to alert the Vatican to the ongoing highly efficient mass slaughter of Jews and others  for which he bore no small responsibility as a technician facilitating efficient genocide  is well done with excellent acting.  Yet in the end CostaGravas's film is somewhat unsatisfying and not sufficiently responsive to the viewer's need to know what Gerstein was all about.  Why?Amen begins with the Nazi euthanasia program aimed at murdering retarded and mentally ill Germans.  A campaign spearheaded by both Protestant and Catholic clerics and their flocks forced the regime to end the killings. Some have argued that this sole widespread public rejection of Nazi homicidal machinations might well have been repeated if Germans were alerted  internally or through specific denunciations by the pope and foreign leaders  of the fate of deported Jews and those rounded up in conquered territories.  Amen's Kurt Gerstein and his priest friend both believe that would have happened.That argument is at best questionable and more likely reflects the human need for the wish to spawn the thought.  Whether one accepts the Goldenhagen thesis of mass complicity by Germans in the Holocaust the fact remains that when the slaughter began Germany was at war and as a character in Amen notes defending the Reich and winning the war to say nothing of staying clear of what would be seen as treasonous ideas was the only realistic option.Kurt Gerstein is a mystery.  As Hannah Arendt wrote of Eichmann as an example of evil's often banal incarnation historian Saul Friedlander described Gerstein years ago in terms of the ambiguity of good.  Gerstein sincerely and at risk to his life tried to warn the Vatican of the Nazi death camps.  But he also worked efficiently to make those camps operationally efficient.  Amen's Gerstein is tortured but also highly compartmentalized.  He gives quick and accurate advice to improve destruction of the units as the Jews were referred to and then tries to prevent use of the Zyklon B gas he helped develop with almost unbelievable declarations that shipments are defective and must be buried.This film owes its origin not so much to Friedlander's compelling account but to Rolf Hochhuth's controversial still so after many years The Deputy presented as a play to the outrage of many.  Hochhuth portrayed Pope Pius XII as insensitive and unwilling to use his moral authority to challenge an extermination program he knew to be in progress.In the film Gerstein is aided by a young Jesuit priest whose remarkable moral and physical courage was demonstrated by a few or perhaps too few clerics who knew what was happening.  The pope is shown as a remote unemotional figure.  The now standard explanations for the Vatican's unwillingness to take on the Nazis are included in catalogue format.  Allied unwillingness to bomb the death camps or take in refugee Jews are recited almost for the record.  Complex questions still debated are reduced to the equivalent of sound bites. They need no repeating here.Hochhuth's thesis which outraged many decades ago and which still brings angry denunciations has been partially rehabilitated by scholarly works such as John Cornwell's provocatively titled study Hitler's Pope an exaggeration which belies the serious research and analysis within the book's covers.Cornwell's pope is personally unpleasant haughtily autocratic rabidly fearful of Communism at least mildly antiSemitic and certainly emotionally and politically proGerman if not proHitler he wasn't that.  The Pope Pius of Amen lacks the depth a more accurate and compelling portrayal would have provided.The strongest moments in the film are those briefly showing the efficiency of the death camps focusing less on the victims most of whom aren't shown but rather on the chillingly competent technicians and logisticians without whose efforts millions could not have been murdered.Director CostaGravas deserves much credit for bringing a difficult to tell complex story to the screen.  Ultimately however we know less about Kurt Gerstein than we need to and the Vatican from pope to bureaucrat is too colorless.  Was Gerstein a victim or a collaborator with a schizophrenic sense of morality?  Even scholar Friedlander couldn't answer that question. Did the Vicar of Christ shame his church's vision of Jesus by putting political expediency ahead of moral imperative?  That is a very alive issue today but Amen gives us a largely onedimensional Supreme Pontiff.The cast is unknown to American viewers but all act with varying but generally strong ability.  Gerstein and the Jesuit priest are especially well portrayed as men of deep conviction.710".

	schema:reviewBody "The film offers an openended answer to this popular question. It begins with a graphic portrayal of the Nazi euthanasia programme which killed 50000 'mental defectives'. This links us to the main protagonist Kurt Gerstein an SS scientific officer who develops the Zyklon B gas which allows massmurder of Jews and Gypsies to proceed on an industrial scale. Gerstein's niece is a euthanasia victim. Gerstein is a committed evangelical Christian with an antiNazi past who normally would not be allowed into the SS. Gerstein's father is an enthusiastic Nazi who pulls strings to get his son into the SS presumably seen as a safer option than the army and also as the elite corps of the Nazi state. Entirely plausible as many evangelical Christians became enthusiastic Nazis. Gerstein's expertise in developing water purification and antityphus procedures for the German army allows him to prosper within the SS despite his multiple treason.The murder of his niece and the Jews appalls his Christian conscience. His wincing reaction whilst looking through the gas chamber spyhole is wellacted. He alerts the Swedes and the Catholic Church hoping that international pressure will awaken the German conscience. Catholic opposition has stopped the euthanasia programme and this can be mobilised to help the Jews.In reality Gerstein's options are limited. His own church leaders react mutely to his news of massmurder. They caution restraint. Nazi indoctrination is trying to turn everyone into a rabid antiSemite  as shown comically with Gerstein's youngest son giving annoying Hitler salutes. Most Protestants agree to join the new Nazisponsored 'Reich Church' happily reconciling faith with Nazism. Similarly the 1933 Concordat with Hitler gave the Catholic Church a precarious protection as long as it stayed out of politics.Carpetbombing of German cities is killing women children and babies. German forces are engaged in a titanic struggle against the 'forces of international Jewry '  Russian Communism and American Capitalism. Facing this kind of mindset and mass paranoia the Jews needed a miracle. Saving mentallyhandicapped members of German families is one thing. Saving a longdespised race thought to be the root cause of every world problem is very much another.Gerstein's attempts to alert the Vatican are channelled through an invented character a young Catholic priest who symbolises the conscience of thousands of individual Catholics who risked their lives to help Jews. He eventually sacrifices himself at Auschwitz a Christlike figure who 'redeems' his religion in the face of a terrible evil.The controversial Pope Pius XII is portrayed in a curiously anodyne way  to the distaste of those who regard him as a Nazi sympathiser. The Vatican's fear of Communism its efforts to hide Italian Jews and its selfpreservation instinct in facing the Nazis are all clearly demonstrated. As is the help it gave to individual SS men on the run after the war. One is left to make up one's own mind about the Pope.In truth neither the Church nor the SS were monolithic organisations. Both were composed of individuals good and bad. One reason for death factories was to save SS men from the horrors of massshootings. They offered a 'sanitised' method of killing just as the 1933 Concordat offered a sanitised way for Nazism and Catholicism to relate to each other. Problems arose for individuals who had to make moral choices in carrying out these policies. The controversial Roman lunch scene depicts the American ambassador discussing the fate of the Jews with Vatican bigwigs. Against a wonderful panoramic backdrop of the eternal city they enjoy an excellent sea food meal. The American points out that finding an alternative home for millions of Jews would cause great problems. Nazi retaliation would only make things worse counters a Vatican bigwig. A far cry from the cattle trucks rolling to and fro emptying Europe of its Jews. This is a 'cheap shot'  decisionmakers usually enjoy better material conditions than the rest of us. One can imagine Churchill discussing sensitive topics in a coldblooded way over many a fine meal. It makes for good cinema though! This is an excellent film which covers a vast topic in 2 hours. It does not make judgements about Gerstein or the Christian churches. The Gerstein character is a complex one as is the Christian response to the Holocaust. It shows how difficult it is to 'buck the system' during wartime. Gerstein arrives at Auschwitz with the comforting knowledge that the allies 'never bomb the camps'  they know they are full of 'POW's'. Would prolonged bombing of the railways to the death camps have made a difference? Many Jews believe that this could and should have happened.Should the allies have redirected their military efforts to save Jews rather than merely fight the Nazis? Unfortunately the 1930's and World War 2 had desensitised people to civilian suffering  newsreels from China Abyssinia Guernica the Nazi bombing of Warsaw Rotterdam London Coventry the V1 and V2 attacks of 1944. World War I blurred the line between soldiers and civilians. World War 2 completely obliterated this distinction  on both sides of the conflict. Axis forces brought death to millions of Chinese and Russian civilians. The Allied bombing of Germany Japan and northern France all produced heavy civilian casualties. Is there an essential difference between massbombing and the Holocaust?European antiSemitism aided the Holocaust. The miracle is that so many individual Gentiles did so much to aid Jews. Nazism put new ideas about human rights to the test. Governments and organisations may have been found wanting  especially Vichy France. Individuals  including many brave Germans  responded magnificently. This is the 'positive' side of the Holocaust which we should remember and treasure. Gerstein did his best to sabotage and stop the killing machine he became part of. The film allows us to make up our own minds about whether he and the Catholic Church did enough.".

It is hard to believe that a man of conscience could actively participate in something he found so entirely heinous.  But the amazing work of Gavras and Ulrich Tukur who plays Gerstein succeeds.  It is very difficult to play a noble and virtuous man and not become a saintly characature.  Tukur succeeds in rounding out a believable character who inspires us to believe in man's innate goodness.  Indeed Tukur pretty much has to carry this film and he does.  Kudos.  Mathieu Kassovitz as the young Jesuit priest is not as strong but his character is less central to the story.This film is very powerful.  In it's veiled presentation of the holocaust it manages to convey the horror with as much emotional impact as any previous film dealing with this dark history.  The real sorrow for me is to watch our protagonists struggle believing that if only the world knew there would be an outpouring of outrage that would put a stop to the atrocities. Unfortunately these good men don't seem to grasp the darker side of human nature that can turn a blind eye.  In the final chapter a brilliant plot twist brings home the horror in the most personal of ways to all of those Vatican diplomats.A powerful horrible and beautiful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Amen' is a recent release examining the relationship between the Vatican and Nazi Germany. We follow Kurt Gerheim an admirable performance by Ulrich Tukur a perfectly Aryan protestant SSOfficer who tries to speak out against Nazi attrocities and Ricardo Fontana a young catholic cleric played to the utmost by the marvellous Matthieu Kassovitz who joins him in his fight. Ricardo's dissolusionment in the Church which acts more as an institution for selfpreservation than for good in this film leads him to irrational and useless acts which do not conflict with his morality rather than to more useful acts which do. The interest lies with the deterioration of Ricardo's faith in the Church's moral station and that of Gerheim's faith in his fatherland. Both find solace in the hope that they will put an end to the holocaust.This is noticeably a continental European film with brilliant direction and dazzlingly good acting more Gosford Park than Schindler's List in terms of pace. Indeed this slow pace only highlights the frustration felt by the two main characters as they are continually beaten down by the wellmeaning leaders of their Churches.Frustration interestingly is the only lasting emotion inspired in the viewer. Dr Germaine Greer attributed this wrongly I believe to the fact that the film doesn't seem to go anywhere highlighting the leitmotiv frame of a socalled 'goods' train on its way to an unseen destination as a representation of this lack of direction. I would venture to suggest though that a conclusion is precisely what the director the justly renowned Costa Garvas was trying to avoid  he does not straightjacket his characters plainly as either heroes or villains and the film closes with the issues of morality it has raised left openended. It is meant to be thought provoking not moving the viewer is meant to conclude for himself what was morally correct and what was not.At the end of the film I found myself wondering which of the characters was most right  for none it would seem have a sole handle on the moral highground and there are arguments that promote each character's actions over another's. Whatever way you see this film and whatever conclusion you draw it is a production which will not let you sleep easy until you have been challenged on many issues of morality.".

It now falls to John Paul and his successors to take the next step toward full acceptance of the Vatican's failure to stand squarely against the evil that swept across Europe. Editorial The New York Times March 18 1998How the timesand the Timesdo change. During the second world war Pope Pius XII was lauded for his singular efforts to halt the carnage. And for years after he was praised for the church's efforts in saving an estimated 700000 Jews from the Nazi death campsmainly by issuing false baptismal certificates to Jews disguising some in cassocks and hiding others in cloistered monasteries and convents. But last week after the Vatican issued its longawaited mea culpa for failing to do more critics of the church greeted the Vatican's statement with the sound of one hand clapping. As the Times's editorial suggests they are demanding nothing less than a moral outing by the Vatican of Pius XII.Something shameful is going on. That Pius XII was silent in the face of the Holocaust that he did little to help the Jews that he was in fact proGerman if not proNazi that underneath it all he was antiSemiticall are monstrous calumnies that now seem to pass for accepted wisdom. Most of these accusations can be traced to a single originating source The Deputy Rolf Hochhuth's 1963 play that created an image of Pius as moral coward. That Golda Meir later a prime minister of Israel and leaders of Jewish communities in Hungary Turkey Italy Romania and the United States thanked the pope for saving hundreds of thousands of Jews is now considered irrelevant. That he never specifically condemned the Shoah is all that seems to matter.In fact Pius XII was neither silent nor inactive. As the Vatican's secretary of State in 1937 he drafted an encyclical for Pope Pius XI condemning Nazism as unChristian. The document was then smuggled into Germany secretly printed there in German and read from Roman Catholic pulpits. The Nazis responded by confiscating the presses and imprisoning many Catholics. In his 1942 Christmas message which The New York Times among others extolled the pope became the first figure of international stature to condemn what was turning into the Holocaust. Among other sins of the Nazis' New Order he denounced the persecution of hundreds of thousands who without any fault of their own sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race are marked down for death or progressive extinction.The Nazis understood the pope only too well. His speech is one long attack on everything we stand for declared the Gestapo. Here he is clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews. He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.In February 1942 Protestant and Catholic leaders of Nazioccupied Holland prepared a letter condemning the deportation of Jews to death camps in the East. But only the Catholic bishops following the path indicated by our Holy Father read the letter aloud from the pulpit despite threats from the Nazis. As a result occupation forces swept Holland's Catholic convents monasteries and schools deporting all Jews who had converted to Christianitysomething they had not done before. When word of this reached Rome the pope withdrew a fourpage protest he had written for the Vatican newspaper and burned it. As the 11 volumes on the war years published by the Vatican archives make clear Jewish as well as Christian groups pleaded with the pope not to make a public protest because it would only intensify the Nazi persecution.The pope's crimeif that is what it isis that he chose the role of diplomatic peacemaker rather than martyr for the cause. Both the Allies and the Axis powers pressured him to take their side. It was clear as the Times reported and the Nazis complained that Pius XII stood for Western freedoms. But the pope refused to sign an Allied condemnation of Nazi atrocities against the Jews and Christians if he could not also condemn the slaughter of Jews and other religious believers by Stalin then an ally of the United States. As it happened about 5 million of the 6 million Jews who died came from Russia and Poland where the pope had no power to command anyone. Historian Christopher Browning is right in concluding that the Holocaust is a story with many victims and not too many heroes. I think we are naive if we think one more hero could have stopped it.It is also naive to complainas The New York Times did last weekthat Pius XII did not encourage Catholics to defy Nazi orders. He could hardly direct others to court certain death and remain politically neutral himself. Moreover in the Roman Catholic Church that kind of pastoral leadership rests with the local bishops. Rightly the hierarchies of Germany and France have recently confessed the failure of wartime Catholics to oppose the Holocaust. That is where resistance was called for but sorely wanting. Those righteous Gentiles who did risk their lives to save Jews are rightly honored they put themselves to the test an ordeal the pope could not demand from Rome.No one person Hitler excepted was responsible for the Holocaust. And no one person Pius XII included could have prevented it. In choosing diplomacy over protest Pius XII had his priorities straight. It's time to lay off this pope.".

Gerstein contacts a Jesuit priest Mathieu Kassovitz who's related to a Vatican Cardenal Michael Duchaussoy and his father results to be Pope's assistant . He denounces and explains Pope Pio XII Marcel Iures the situation of the Jews's genocide .The pic is correctly based on historic deeds and famous personages as Pio XII and Nazi chiefs who don't appear in the film but they're continuously named as Goering  Goebbles  Himmler  Eichmann thus as notorious events as Stalingrado 1943 where Nazis have the first important defeat and the bombing strikes over the Germany cities Berlin  Dresde . The movie is based on a play by German playwright Rolf Hochhuth which started a lot of heated discussions and arguments after its first release in 1963. The film blends drama  tension  historical events and in spite of the runtime is two hours and some isn't boring  nor dreary but happens enough interesting deeds . The Vatican did not give a permission to shoot the film in their buildings. After searching a scenery of adequate size for the scenes taking place in the Vatican CostaGavras finally chose Europe's largest building the House of the People in Bucharest . Some of the outdoor scenes were shot in Mogosoaia Palace some fourteen kilometers northwest of Bucharest. The movie attained quite polemic but there's an accusation to Catholic Church for passivity on the crimes and mass slaughter . I really think that didn't have but lack of forecast . The motion picture was well directed by Constantine Costa Gravas who at all his films always gets controversy and dispute . Rating  Above average . Well worth seeing .".

	schema:reviewBody "In the mid 1960s Ralph Hochhuth's play The Deputy hit Europe like lightning. Its story about the attempt of two people to inform the early 1940s world about the Nazi death camps accused Pope Pius XII of failing to speak out against the removal of Jews from Rome when his doing so might have saved thousands of lives. The drama sparked controversy and debate. When The Deputy arrived in the United States about 1965 the five act four hour play had been cut to a more manageable two hour length but didn't lose any of its punch. For this film CostaGavras has based his screenplay on the full version. It follows two major characters. The first is Kurt Gerstein a real life individual an SS Officer scientist and Christian who risks everything to get the word out about the camps. The second is a fictional character Father Ricardo Fontana whose aristocratic family has connections with the Vatican. He meets Gerstein and begins a personal crusade to get the Pope to denounce the killing of Jews. I can attest to the power this material has. It was my privilege to play Pope Pius in a college production U.S. version in 1966. The two final scenes  Fontana's confrontation with the Pope and his encounter with the Auswitz doctor in the harrowing finale  are enough to shake even the most complacent person to the core. Somehow CostaGavras has managed to drain off every volt and watt of energy and left us with a lethargic draggy melodrama that goes for the easy irony rich diplomats feast on fancy foods while regretting the bad things that are happening in the world. This should be dynamite and the legendary director seems like the person who could light the fuse. Unfortunately the explosion never comes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amen is a moving and disturbing account of the attempt of an SS officer and a young Jesuit priest to inform the Vatican of the atrocities committed by the NAZIS against the Jews and to persuade the Vatican to speak out. Despite its disturbing theme the film is long and tedious. Those looking for a similar film with more action should rent Gregory Peck's superb performance in The Scarlet and the Black. Amen is a historical fiction meaning the film is based on some actual historical events but is meant to be interpreted as a fictitious account of those historical events. The film is based on Rolf Huchhuth's 1963 play translated as The Representative or The Deputy which was indeed highly critical of the Vatican's response to the Holocaust. However this is an incredibly controversial topic one on which historians still do not agree. Pius XII and the Vatican made a number of extraordinary efforts to resist the NAZI persecutions during the Holocaust including converting Castel Gondolfo the pope's summer residence into a refugee home signing approximately 850000 false baptismal records for Jews and providing food and money for Jews in Rome during NAZI occupation. Additionally Pius XII wrote an encyclical entitled Mit brennender Sorge With Burning Anxiety which he had distributed all over Germany informing German Catholics of their duty to resist atrocities and perform their Christian duties. Furthermore his first papal encyclical Summi Pontifutus written in response to the NAZI invasion of Poland condemned dictators treaty violators and racism. Following the war the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra came to play at the Vatican for the pope that did so much for them Gertrude Stein praised him as a voice against evil and Israel planted 850000 trees in his honor. Additionally the current pope initiated an effort to canonize Pius XII and thus criticism of his actions during the Holocaust should be critically examined for their root in historical fact. Amen speaks to the power of one voice against a sea of opposition but it should not be viewed as a documentary of the Vatican's response to the Holocaust. If you are interested in this topic I have read a number of books on the topic and will be happy to discuss Pius XII and the Vatican's response to the Holocaust via email .".

This movie is telling us Warning don't trust in politicians they always are lying to you. And in the other side a priest who is a symbol of human dignity a man who is a real hero because he is a hero even when he doesn't want to be one. Brilliant in all ways  a real improve from Gavras's later films he is back with his proved militancy and compromise with real themes of our time.";

The actor who played Kurt Gerstein was quite excellent likewise for the guy who played Riccardo the priest I think he was in that movie Amelie.I believe that this film ranks up there with Schindler's List The Pianist Night and Fog and Escape from Sobibor.

It is an excellent movie that shows us the brutality and cruelty of the Nazis and the silence of the Vatican and some Protestant churches in the Holocaust. As a Catholic it shocked me how the Vatican lots of priests and nuns helped the Nazis in their madness of killing Jews mostly and other people such as gipsies homosexual persons etc. It is not an offense to the Catholic church to say the truth about what was going on during those terrible years this is why I do not agree with the reaction of the Vatican towards this film. Everybody must know that the Pope Pie XII and lots of priests cardinals and nuns kept silent althoug I must admit that other Catholics really helped the Jews. Finally the perfomance of the German actor Ulrich Tukur was wonderful. He should have won the prize of best actor in the European movie festival celebrated in Rome because he expressed very well the feeling of horror when he found the killings of the Jews. The rest of the actors are good too but Ulrich's perfomance was the best one without the slightest doubt. Moreover he is very attractive in uniform!!".

I thought it was the cat's pajamas.But even back then my young and usually trusting mind could detect a strong whiff of baloney from this movie. I had difficultly believing for example that every Allied soldier in World War II was an incompetent nitwit except for the allknowing allseeing Henry Fonda. Throughout the course of this movie Fonda's character predicts the battle rather like a psychic or someone with access to the script uncovers every weakness in the German plan and then finally plays a key role in stopping the entire German offensive. What a versatile guy huh? And yes even my inexperienced childself found it rather weird that in this movie the Americans are depicted as being utterly incapable of fighting the Germans. The film suggests in a somewhat insulting fashion that in point of fact the Americans did not win this battle in the traditional way  we only won it because the Germans ran out of gasoline and decided to walk home! What complete rubbish. Anybody with even a vague understanding of the real battle knows that the Americans won simply by counterattacking  what a novel idea! Some commentators on this site have argued that the film's historical inaccuracies don't matter and that only World War II nerds will be offended by the script's tinkering with history. However I would argue that Battle of the Bulge is SO inaccurate that such a defense doesn't hold water. And it's not as though the inaccuracies make the film better in fact I'm confident that a more realistic portrayal of the battle would have made the film far more exciting evenhanded and worthwhile.And yet... and yet... I still like this stupid movie! The tank battles are fun the music is great and the cast is really topnotch. Here's a general rule of thumb that I apply to the film as a whole  the scenes with the Americans are stupid and the scenes with the Germans are good. For example  Robert Shaw is simply awesome as the fictional German commander. He has a fascinating series of moral debates on the nature of the war with his aide a longsuffering corporal played by Hans Christian Blech these scenes are a real highlight of the film and their intelligence makes for a stark contrast with the general idiocy of other scenes.There's also a very good scene when Charles Bronson tells Fonda that his men are so angry because of the war that they want to completely annihilate Germany and its people. This somewhat sinister note always gets my attention but it pretty much amounts to nothing.Perhaps the best thing that I can say about this movie is that it got me curious about the real battle and the war in general. Because it's reasonably cool and exciting the film is a pretty good vehicle for generating interest in the events it depicts so carelessly. Also the script is perhaps not quite so inaccurate as some people claim  the early forest battles are somewhat like the real thing and the general nature and goals of the German offensive are accurately portrayed.It's just that too many dumb Hollywood moments spoil the movie for any serious aficionado of history andor cinema. That's a shame really. I wouldn't mind seeing a more accurate remake which presumably would not involve an omnipotent Henry Fonda singlehandedly foiling the last great German offensive of World War II.".

	schema:reviewBody "December 1944. The Germans launch their last major offensive in the west. The plan is to break through the Allied lines at several points in the hilly densely wooded Ardennes region of Belgium and make an all out drive to recapture the port of Antwerp thereby cutting the Allied forces in two. The Allies cannot use their air superiority due to dense fog covering the region. The task of stopping the vast armoured advance falls to small groups of US soldiers making a stand wherever possible.   I really have mixed feelings towards this film. In terms of historical geographical and meteorological accuracy it's an utter shambles from start to finish. All the characters are ficticious some are obviously composites of real participants in the battle. A fact already well documented is the use of '50s'60s US tanks to represent the German Tigers and US Shermans. There is no mention whatsoever of the fact that General Patton managed to basically turn the advance of his 3rd Army through 90 degrees then head north to break through to the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. Finally to suggest that the Germans ran out of fuel and simply 'walked back to Germany' is plain insulting. The geographical errors are also quite glaring. During the first half of the film these errors can be largely overlooked. However from the artillery train sequence onwards to the climactic tank battle the terrain looks more like Arizona than the Ardennes! vast desert like plains. Then as if all that isn't bad enough there's the weather. The winter of '44'45 was one of the worst in recent history. In the Ardennes that meant deep snow freezing temperatures and thick fog. Apart from some snowy scenes early on there isn't much evidence of any of this!   Considering all the inaccuracies catalogued above I should despise this film but I don't. Taken on its' level it's quite enjoyable. It has a strong cast Robert Shaw  and Hans Christian Blech are both very good Charles Bronson was an old hand at these all star extravaganzas and Henry Fonda exudes his usual quiet dignity. The script if a bit hokey is no worse than others from the period and the cinematography and score are fine. The battle scenes are professionally staged and comparison with modern war films would be unfair.   A point worth noting is the fact that this film has been cut in recent years. The missing scenes are briefly 1. The introduction of the Germans dressed as US MPs. 2. Shaw inspecting his tanks. 3. A conversation between Fonda and Bronson. 4. A lengthy sequence in Ambleve with a conversation between Shaw and Bronson followed by an attempt on Shaw's life by a young boy. The boy's life is spared but his father is executed. The missing footage accounts for roughly 10 minutes of running time. The quoted running time on most reference works is 167 mins. which I assume includes the overture intermission music and exit music. This would seem to be correct for if my old widescreen VHS copy contained the missing scenes the music is all present it would run approx. 160 mins.running time is speeded up on PAL. But I digress.   Overall then a film with some very major flaws. If you're expecting a film in the same vein as 'The Longest Day' or 'A Bridge Too Far' you'll be terribly disappointed. If you can accept it as a fictional account of the battle however and can view the complete version then it's well worth a look.".

It has a strong cast Robert Shaw  and Hans Christian Blech are both very good Charles Bronson was an old hand at these all star extravaganzas and Henry Fonda exudes his usual quiet dignity. The script if a bit hokey is no worse than others from the period and the cinematography and score are fine. The battle scenes are professionally staged and comparison with modern war films would be unfair.   A point worth noting is the fact that this film has been cut in recent years. The missing scenes are briefly 1. The introduction of the Germans dressed as US MPs. 2. Shaw inspecting his tanks. 3. A conversation between Fonda and Bronson. 4. A lengthy sequence in Ambleve with a conversation between Shaw and Bronson followed by an attempt on Shaw's life by a young boy. The boy's life is spared but his father is executed. The missing footage accounts for roughly 10 minutes of running time. The quoted running time on most reference works is 167 mins. which I assume includes the overture intermission music and exit music. This would seem to be correct for if my old widescreen VHS copy contained the missing scenes the music is all present it would run approx. 160 mins.running time is speeded up on PAL. But I digress.   Overall then a film with some very major flaws. If you're expecting a film in the same vein as 'The Longest Day' or 'A Bridge Too Far' you'll be terribly disappointed. If you can accept it as a fictional account of the battle however and can view the complete version then it's well worth a look.";

I mean my God would you film a movie about Eskimos in Venezuela? And some reviewers here struggle to make apologies for all this saying in essence So what? It was a fun war movie. Who cares if it was filmed in a desert instead of the Ardennes forest? Who cares if they made the Germans into cartoonish Nazis and the Allies into G.I. Joe and Sgt. Rock comic book heroes? Who cares if almost nothing is as it was during the battle?Well then why bother to make a movie with the specific title Battle of the Bulge at all? Why not just call it Clash of the Panzers?

I know all that.But it was an insult to the vets who fought and died there. They said it at the time it was made. I can't get beyond that. I have walked the forests and fields around Bastogne where my father endured such an ordeal he would not ever speak of when he was alive. I've walked among the white gravestones of men who died there. I can't bring myself to get to So what? It's just a movie.

I guess the producers had a thought that no film about the Bulge would be accepted without it no matter how forced.It would have been nice if a straight dramatic narrative approach had been used like The Longest Day. With of course the names of the real people. Part of the Bulge story was told in MGM's Battleground and in Patton.In this film the best performances are that of Robert Shaw as the fanatical Nazi Panzer commander and his war weary aide Hans Christian Blech. Honorable mention should also go to George Montgomery as a tough American sergeant and his lieutenant James MacArthur who grows in stature thanks to Montgomery's example.For a film that is more than two and a half hours in length I'd have liked to have seen the real deal though.".

It's also one of the most entertaining war movies to grace the big screen. The combination of heroics and history shouldn't work as well as it does.Writers John Melson Philip Yordan and Milton Sperling remain faithful to the broad outlines of the real battle and then fill their story with several important fictional characters and director Ken Annakin uses a combination of Hollywood heroics and historical accuracy to deliver an entertaining tale. The film relies solely on the excellentlyshot action sequences and superb acting by the leads to hold it together.Veteran director Ken Annakin knows how to make this film work. In the lead Henry Fonda Midway seems to be having plenty of fun as Colonel Kiley. He gets to argue with people shoot at Germans fly in a plane and even help fend off a Panzer attack  not bad for a civilianturnedsoldier eh? On the flipside Robert Shaw Force 10 from Navarone is fantastic as the fanatical Colonel Hessler a devoted Panzer officer who will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Hessler brings new meaning the HollywoodNazitype he's brutal nasty and dedicated despite the fact that he knows Germany cannot win the war.The supporting cast is filled with the familiar faces of Charles Bronson Ty Hardin James MacArthur and Telly Savalas  but the real star is Hans Christian Blech The Longest Day. As Conrad the warweary aging German Corporal it's his best work in a war film. Conrad wants to go home and is devoted to Hessler until he realizes that his commander's dedication sits precariously on the edge of madness. His facial expressions  bugeyed outbursts sad frowns frightened glances at strafing airplanes  have never been more convincing.This epic was shot for the big screen using Cinerama and the only way to appreciate the action sequences is to see this movie in widescreen. Panandscan prints cut it down from a 2.71 ratio to 1.331  that's losing more than half of the image! It was shot on the vast plains of Spain and although it looks nothing like the brutal winter in the Ardennes forest this scenery makes from some very impressive landscapes for which to shoot colossal battle scenes. Annakin shows tanks facing off with each other on the plains and in the snowencrusted woods and shows handtohand fighting in the streets of a French city. These scenes are set to an excellent rousing Ben Frankel score which only adds to the excitement. There are hundreds of extras running about as well as several dozen loud clanking tanks. Annakin often places his camera on the front end of a tank train or moving car to give the viewer a youarethere perspective a technique which is ruined with the panandscan process.The dramatic effect of the serious scenes is severely hampered by preposterous Hollywood heroics and some incredibly poor special effects. Quite often the combat and destruction look incredibly real but there are some truly laughable shots of exploding model tanks and roaring model trains too. The battle scenes notably a huge tank vs. tank battle and a conclusion involving an attempted German capture of an Allied fuel dump are incredibly corny and falselooking  first for their falselooking special effects which looked bad even in 1965 and secondly for their placement in a desert rather than a snowy forest  which really destroyed the credibility Annakin had been working up to. A strong subplot involving an American tanker Guffy Telly Savalas The Dirty Dozen and another centering on the Malmedy Massacre help to offset this cheesiness.Battle of the Bulge is a true Hollywood epic in every sense of the word. It may not be historically accurate but it's probably the most entertaining and engaging war film I've had the pleasure to watch. The characters are main fleshed out enough to keep the viewers interested the scope is amazing and the direction often borders on brilliance as often as it fails miserably.".

	schema:reviewBody "The years between The Guns of Navaronne and Patton saw the release of a number of World War II epics and wouldbe epics some good and some like Anzio pathetic. The Battle of the Bulge is about in the middle with nothing much to recommend it and no outrageous flaws.I hated to click on the Contains spoiler box above because this is after all a pseudohistory of one of the major battles that took place towards the end of the war in Europe and he or she who does not know the outcome has been living on the distant planet of Ymir. But so be it. A poll taken some years ago indicated that a substantial number of America's youth didn't know which side of the war Japan had fought on. So here it is kids. Spoiler alert.The Allies were at war with Japan and Germany and by the end of 1944 A.D. the Germans were running out of everything especially fuel. Hitler organized and implemented a lastditch counterattack against the British and American lines in the mountainous Ardennes forest near the German border.Those thick and snowy woods were considered unsuitable for tanks and deemed a quiet sector where infantry already exhausted by combat elsewhere could be sent for rest and an area where newly formed and unseasoned units could be safely stationed and get used to conditions in the field.Nobody expected the Germans to roll through these mountains with massive tanks and hordes of infantry but that's what happened. Everyone was caught unprepared except Patton. But the Germans were so short of fuel that the success of the attack depended on the capture of American stores. That didn't happen. The bulge created by the attack was squeezed by Montgomery from the north and Patton from the south and eventually disintegrated.This movie doesn't give a viewer a clear sense of what happened. The Germans' fuel shortage isn't even mentioned until the climax when it is discovered by Henry Fonda who plays an intelligence officer. Fonda's figure is a familiar one in war movies. He's the only guy who can figure out what's going on  and nobody upstairs listens to him or believes him. Most of the other characters are familiar too. The dumb young lieutenant James McArthur who learns to develop character and leadership from his tough top sergeant George Montgomery. There's one of those tough avaricious Brooklyn characters Telly Savalas who manages to have a romantic encounter with Pierangeli in the middle of this hailstorm of battle. Robert Ryan is wasted as a general. Dana Andrews is Ryan's chief of staff who delights in ridiculing Henry Fonda's warnings with cutting sarcasm. None of the characters are real historic figures. General McCauliffe who was surrounded in Bastogne isn't named either though he's identified as the figure who responded to the German demand for surrender with nuts. Some have argued that his real response was a single word that in Samoan would be rendered turu in Selozi masipa and in French merde. The most complex character and the most challenging role is that of the German colonel who led the Panzers in the attack played by Robert Shaw. He's so ambiguous he's almost real but unfortunately Shaw plays him as some kind of a frozen tree stump who eschews the company of easy women and whose only passion is victory. The most endearing performance is that of Hans Christian Blech who plays the German corporal who is both Shaw's servant and sidekick. His lines like all the other lines may be stilted but he makes the sentiments believable. A good actor here and elsewhere.I've watched this twice now and my opinion of it hasn't changed much. The overall dynamics of the battle are lost amid the tumult of charging tanks dueling infantrymen arguments among officers and faceless figures diving into muddy ditches. There are three or four different plot threads mostly unrelated to one another. And only one simplified map to tell us where we're headed.There are better cinematic descriptions of the Battle of the Bulge available Battleground Band of Brothers but the incidents are seen from the grunt's point of view and none gives us the more general textbook picture. This one has a grandiose title and aims high but it loses the battle.".

The bulge created by the attack was squeezed by Montgomery from the north and Patton from the south and eventually disintegrated.This movie doesn't give a viewer a clear sense of what happened. The Germans' fuel shortage isn't even mentioned until the climax when it is discovered by Henry Fonda who plays an intelligence officer. Fonda's figure is a familiar one in war movies. He's the only guy who can figure out what's going on  and nobody upstairs listens to him or believes him. Most of the other characters are familiar too. The dumb young lieutenant James McArthur who learns to develop character and leadership from his tough top sergeant George Montgomery. There's one of those tough avaricious Brooklyn characters Telly Savalas who manages to have a romantic encounter with Pierangeli in the middle of this hailstorm of battle. Robert Ryan is wasted as a general. Dana Andrews is Ryan's chief of staff who delights in ridiculing Henry Fonda's warnings with cutting sarcasm. None of the characters are real historic figures. General McCauliffe who was surrounded in Bastogne isn't named either though he's identified as the figure who responded to the German demand for surrender with nuts. Some have argued that his real response was a single word that in Samoan would be rendered turu in Selozi masipa and in French merde. The most complex character and the most challenging role is that of the German colonel who led the Panzers in the attack played by Robert Shaw. He's so ambiguous he's almost real but unfortunately Shaw plays him as some kind of a frozen tree stump who eschews the company of easy women and whose only passion is victory. The most endearing performance is that of Hans Christian Blech who plays the German corporal who is both Shaw's servant and sidekick. His lines like all the other lines may be stilted but he makes the sentiments believable. A good actor here and elsewhere.I've watched this twice now and my opinion of it hasn't changed much. The overall dynamics of the battle are lost amid the tumult of charging tanks dueling infantrymen arguments among officers and faceless figures diving into muddy ditches. There are three or four different plot threads mostly unrelated to one another. And only one simplified map to tell us where we're headed.There are better cinematic descriptions of the Battle of the Bulge available Battleground Band of Brothers but the incidents are seen from the grunt's point of view and none gives us the more general textbook picture. This one has a grandiose title and aims high but it loses the battle.";

	schema:headline " Mostly fictitious but actionfilled war movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Battle of the Bulge opens with a scripted prologue that says that the fictitious account of the last major battle of World War II is intended to honor all the men who took part in the battle. Several reviewers have decried the film for that very reason. Most have noted the historical record available and said the film is a disservice for not using some real characters and following the historical event. I agree with that sentiment to a point. For instance Robert Ryan's General Grey might have been one of the real generals in command of the American sector at the time. Yet fictitious characters could be some of the main action people as they are here in the film.But I suspect that Warner Brothers decided it might be more ludicrous to include the names of a few real people when the story is so fictitious in its action accounts. For instance Henry Fonda is Lt. Col. Dan Kiley an intelligence officer who flies reconnaissance planes to take photos behind enemy lines and then winds up all over the place wherever there's action. Not only was there no such person but those very actions and incidents are unbelievable if not impossible.Then there is the fictitious account of the German Panzer leader Col. Hessler played superbly by Robert Shaw. The film has him making a run for the Allied fuel depot and being killed in his tank when it explodes. Col. Meinred von Lauchert was a real decorated Panzer leader who spearheaded the German assault. His unit penetrated the deepest through the Allied lines during the battle but he was not killed. He was promoted to general and fell back when they ran out of fuel and the Allies counterattack beat the Germans back. He lost most of his tank force and with no place to cross the Rhine River he swam across and then quit the war and walked back to his home at Bamberg.The film title is the popular name that this operation received from press reports about it. The Germans called their offensive Operation Watch on the Rhine. The French called it the Battle of the Ardennes and the Allies called it the Ardennes Counteroffensive. One plus of this film is that it shows the German infiltration of the American forces. As part of Operation Watch on the Rhine the Germans had some smaller operations. For Operation Grief they recruited English speaking Germans to go behind Allied lines. Their mission was to capture one or more of the bridges over the Meuse River before the Allies could destroy them. They wore captured British and American uniforms and used captured Allied vehicles. The movie shows them holding a bridge and later having taken a huge fuel depot. In reality they never achieved the goal of securing any bridges. They were able to cause some confusion and hamper Allied communication for a while as the film shows.Another true event that the film includes is the Malmedy massacre. Here it shows about 80 American POWs being murdered. The Malmedy massacre consisted of several such incidents with a total of about 750 American soldiers and 111 Belgian civilians being killed. In July 1946 73 members of the SS Panzer group were tried for war crimes in the Malmedy massacre. The trial took place at Dachau Concentration Camp. Of those tried 43 were hanged and 30 were given prison sentences of from five years to life.Perhaps the biggest negative of the film is the tank battle. While it's one of the biggest action scenes it almost detracts from the film because of the setting. The fact that almost everyone notices this about the film says that the studio goofed in not staging it more realistically. The tank battle was filmed in the open barren fields of the central arid region of Spain. But the Battle of the Bulge took place in the heavily forested areas of the Ardennes in Belgium Luxembourg and France. I suspect that this bit of glaring unreality hurt this film more than anything in the minds of most viewers. This is a clear example of when a studio chooses to go for action in a fictitious setting  thinking that that will appeal most to people instead of going for reality.All of these matters considered I give the film eight stars for its cast its action the accurate things it does show and the reality of some of the gritty fighting. The defense of the town as the headquarters pulls out is especially good combat action. Rather than having the Panzer commander killed I think the film would have had much more appeal showing him quitting at the end and walking away to his home.All of the cast are very good in their roles. Others not mentioned already are Charles Bronson as Major Wolenski George Montgomery as Sgt. Duquesne Telly Savalas as Sgt. Guffy James MacArthur is Lt. Weaver Ty Hardin as the German MP in disguise  Schumacher Dana Andrews as Col. Pritchard and Hans Blech as Conrad.This is a good combat action film that most people should enjoy. But I think it's important for one to know that it's a fictitious account that looks at some real events within the Battle of the Bulge.".

I came across a quote for the film that said it was 101 war film making for children. Never has a used quote been so apt as that one for a war film. The actors either look bored or turn in wooden performances the latter probably prompted by the insipid script from Philip Yordan  Milton Sperling.

It also unsuccessfully tries to blend humour with its serious intents a blend that just comes off as confusion. There's some worth in this being a film about tank battle a mighty piece of weaponry indeed but no this really is a poor genre offering that can't even be saved by the star wattage meant to propel it forward. 310".

BATTLE OF THE BULGE does this  but it doesnt warn you how bad it all becomes later on. Ill warn you this is one bad war film.The worst thing about BATTLE OF THE BULGE is that its based on the real life Ardennes campaign of December 1944 when the Nazis threw the last of their reserves into trying to beat the allies in Western Europe  and this film is a lost opportunity to show the facts.  I need to look inside one of those tiger tanks  says Henry Fonda . But theyre not Tigers  as everyone else has noticed theyre American tanks from another generation. A German tiger tank has a very distinctive square shape . Couldnt the script have been changed so that they could have been Panther tanks ? At least Panther tanks had roundish angles like the ones used in this film.And the editing is extremely suspect. One scene features a wooded forest covered in snow then the next scene features a landscape devoid of trees and without a flake of snow ! Worst of all in the final scenes when characters walk on the ground dust can clearly be seen following their footsteps the terrain they are walking hasnt seen snow or rain for weeks ! Its like the director and editor have been splicing scenes from another film . This is bad enough but what makes it so bad is a line spoken by a German General at the start of the film when he mentions fog hiding the German advance so that the allies cant use their massive air support to slow down the advance  but up untill the last half hour theres been nothing but bright blue skies to be seen !  If you enjoyed this film may I also recommend THE PRODUCERS which features SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER  the true story of Adolph Hitlers all singing all dancing stormtroopers".

So be it until there is no enemy but peace. Amen.  USMC Rifle CreedThis film was part of a group of war films released between 1962 and 1977 A Bridge Too Far Tora! Tora! Tora! The Longest Day The Battle of Britain Battle of the Bulge Cross of Iron Patton 633 Squadron etc all of which tried to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of the military as possible. Politicians generals soldiers sergeants medics lieutenants Army personnel Navy personnel Airforce personnel nurses doctors civilians etc all came together in a kind of narrative cocktail the entire military body working together to achieve some goal.Unlike the platoon genre these heirarchal films thus aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the spectacle of history viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part.Significantly the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster Pearl Harbour being attacked Britain being blitzed Dday going awry the German advance in the Battle of the Bulge etc. These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds against an overwhelming savage superior foe only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure.The last film in this cycle was A Bridge Too Far 1977 by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised culminating in the angry sermons of Rambo and Platoon.610  Covertly all these films succumb to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free and that the cost of freedom is blood which must periodically be sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the government and that we should be grateful for it and turn an unquestioning devotion onto the government and the military.Worth one viewing.".

The Longest Day The Battle of Britain Battle of the Bulge Cross of Iron Patton 633 Squadron etc all of which tried to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of the military as possible. Politicians generals soldiers sergeants medics lieutenants Army personnel Navy personnel Airforce personnel nurses doctors civilians etc all came together in a kind of narrative cocktail the entire military body working together to achieve some goal.Unlike the platoon genre these heirarchal films thus aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the spectacle of history viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part.Significantly the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster Pearl Harbour being attacked Britain being blitzed Dday going awry the German advance in the Battle of the Bulge etc. These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds against an overwhelming savage superior foe only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure.The last film in this cycle was A Bridge Too Far 1977 by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised culminating in the angry sermons of Rambo and Platoon.610  Covertly all these films succumb to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free and that the cost of freedom is blood which must periodically be sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the government and that we should be grateful for it and turn an unquestioning devotion onto the government and the military.Worth one viewing.";

It's a small break from reality and portrayed in a seemingly fictional but real technically campaign in WWII. It's also a great movie if you like allstar casts and A list actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Blockbuster is one of the biggest war films ever made. It's a magnificent film recreating the known offensive by Nazi Panzer tanks on the Belgian front during 194445 .What happened during those desperate days that could have changed the course of war is now history . It's well recreated by Ken Annakin for Warner Bros in Cinerama production with Technicolor cinematography by Jack Hildyard. The producer Milton Sperling was wellqualified for his job but he was a marine officer and he had 10 combat cameramen covering three battles during the war and made three documentaries out of those events. Sperling tells that making this film recalled his owns experiences in the war and made it quite possible for the sound effects you heard today to be as realistic as those he heard when was listening to them whining overhead.The making was a logistical problem as almost that of setting up a campaign and putting a film together under any circumstances was very difficult because working under very bad weather conditions. So this whole film was put together photographed and edited scored and prepared for release in a matter of about eight months. We scoured Europethere are places where such tanks do existsometimes in junkyards sometimes in existing armies and just by chance one finds a cache of tanks gunsold planes and various other relics .The equipment managed to assemble these great numbers of tanks after looking about for months and months. So what we see on the screen are truly the Tiger tanks that were fought in the battle and the Western Front no wonder the battle scenes looked so authentic .Robert Shaw with his blue eyes blazing is the fanatical tank commander he was chosen because he can play virtually anything that's given to him.It was rather an obvious choice  there are so few good actors and he's capable of doing anything. Henry Fonda is terrific as obstinate officer who finds vital German attacking position. In the remaining supporting cast appear Telly Savallas as a roguish sergeant James McArthur as an unexperienced young lieutenant George Montgomery as a valiant veteran sergeant among others.The Battle of Bulge film is based on true events about the Ardennes offensive the real deeds are the following  It was a Hitler's plan codenamed Watch on the Rhinefor a breakthrough by Field Marshal Von Rundstedt aimed at the US line in the Ardennes 16 Dec 1944 . Hitler aimed to isolate the Allied forces north of the corridor which would be created by a drive through the Ardennes creating a German salient or bulge. There were 77.000 Allied casualties and 130.000 German including Hitler's last powerful reserve of elite Panzer units. Although US troops were encircled for some weeks at Bastogne the German counteroffensive failed. Three armies were deployed in the operation Dietrich's 6th Panzerthe 5th Panzer and the 7th Panzertogether with a 'Trojan Horse' force of Englishspeaking in US uniforms under Otto Skorzeny. The offensive opened 16 Dec along 113 Km of the front  aiming at the US 1st Army and General Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. Initial progress was good as the Allies were unprepared for action along a section of the front hitherto so quiet it had been nicknamed the Ghost Frontand bad weather grounded Allied air support. However the Germans failed to capture vital fuel dumps and the dogged Allied defense of St Vith and Bastogne seriously set the operation back. Bastogne was an important road junction lay in the path of the German advance and was held by the US 101 Airbone Division. It was besieged by German forces 18 Dec and strongly attacked  the defenses were breached in two places . However the attacks were repulsed and was relieved by the US 4th Armored Division though fierce fighting continued in the area for some days. The Allies quickly recovered from the initial shock and while north of the Bulge General Bernard Montgomery blocked the German advance at the Meuse to the south Bradley's forces also struck back with General Patton breaking through to relieve Bastogne 26 Dec. By the end of Dec the weather improved allowing the Allied air forces to play a part in the battle and by 3 Jan 1945 the Allies took the offensive  by 16 Jan the Bulge has been eliminated.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few years before this was released there was The Longest Day  a movie version of the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. That was a very good movie with a starstudded cast. I'm guessing that Battle of the Bulge was an attempt to unofficially follow up on that movie. It's not as starstudded although there's a bit of cross over in the cast most notably Henry Fonda. Truthfully though this movie is nowhere near as good as The Longest Day.It's supposed to be an account of The Battle of The Bulge which took place in December of 1944. It was the last significant German offensive of the war intended to break through the Allied lines and re capture the port city of Antwerp Belgium  thus throwing Allied supply lines into chaos. The movie gets some things right. The Germans did indeed get troops disguised as American MPs behind the American lines and they were able to cause confusion and chaos. The Germans were also woefully short of fuel and had targeted an American supply depot which would have given them access to a huge amount of gasoline for their tanks. The famous demand for the surrender of Bastogne and the reply of the commanding American general to that demand  NUTS!  is accurate. But there are also a lot of problems with the historical accuracy of the film. First is that all of the characters are just that  characters. Composites perhaps but there's no portrayal of anyone who actually fought in the battle. There's also no mention at all of General George Patton's 3rd Army dramatically saving the besieged Americans at Bastogne. That's one of the better known incidents of the Battle of the Bulge and why you wouldn't even mention it is beyond me. Many of course note the problem that the tanks used in the movie were of a much later vintage and were't an accurate representation of the tanks that would have been used.At best I'd say that this movie was OK. Terrible if you're thinking that you're learning much history from it but OK as a movie that's somewhat dramatic and I thought it was a reasonable portrayal of the ugliness of war  the Malmedy massacre the cold blooded murders of Americans who had been taken prisoner by German SS troops was portrayed for example. I'd definitely say that if I were going to watch either again I'd take in The Longest Day. It's the better movie. This one gets a 510 from me.".

Laugh because this movie has nothing to do with what went on in Belgium in December 1944. Cry because it did a tremendous disservice to those on all sides who participated in that battle and to other infinitely better depictions of that campaign and period of the war e.g. Battleground Band of Brothers. From the Tigers US M48 tanks painted gray with German crosses to the lack of anything resembling actual military deportment or tactics to the filming locations Fort Hood Texas just doesn't look like Bastogne  Pennsylvania would have been a better choice this movie is every bit as much a stinker as Battle of the Last Panzer.Battle of the Bulge is typical of other big concept novelbased movies like The Longest Day another travesty especially when compared to the likes of Saving Private Ryan. I vote this as a contender for one of the worst movies ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Presented in Cinerama this epic war film has the proper scope with which to detail the pivotal battle of its title but unfortunately it muddles quite a bit with history and also manages to come across as dull for certain stretches of time despite a heavyduty cast. In this fictionalized account Fonda flies on reconnaissance and spots German Colonel Shaw causing him to believe that Shaw is about to stage a major tank offensive. This is something his superiors Ryan and especially Andrews disbelieve. Eventually Fonda is proved correct when Shaw utilizing an assemblage of unseasoned and very young soldiers unleashes the might of a secret tank force on a largely unprepared American contingent. In the meantime various U.S. soldiers experience their own trials and tribulations with Savalas operating a black market supply business with his lover Angeli Montgomery and MacArthur risking capture on a ground mission and Bronson tangling with various folks over the handling of his men. In a preposterous move western star Hardin is cast as a Nazi agent posing as a United States Military Policeman! Fonda has a few decent moments Ryan even fewer and Andrews is saddled with a silly cheaplooking moustache as he essays his rather prissy part. The bulk of the acting honors go to Shaw who manages to create a multidimensional and captivating character. He also looks very good redisplaying his From Russia With Love blonde hair. Angeli has one scene and attempts to inject some heart into it while Werle has only one as well as a knowing prostitute hired for Shaw. Montgomery and Bronson aren't given enough to do in order to shine. This film strives to be momentous and important with bombastic music and panoramic vistas but only succeeds in part because of a banality in the scripting and some questionable plotting in contrast to the actual events not to mention the use of equipment and tanks which are anachronistic and which have rankled more than a few viewers over the years  many uninitiated viewers will not be able to distinguish a lot of this however. It's not a bad movie but it's a pretty forgettable one except for the committed work of Shaw and a few vignettes that linger in the memory.".

So let me tell you this This movie is absolutely horrific! Never have I ever seen a war movie as bad as this one. You have to know about me that I'm really a great amateur of war movies. I've got several movies of this kind in my private collection and I'm planning to buy even more war movies but 'The Battle of the Bulge' will not be one of them. This is just too bad for words.For a start Since when do olive trees grow in the Ardennes??? I'm a Belgian I used to work in the region and I think I can say with 100 certainty that there are a lot of trees but 99 of them are pines. And there's certainly nothing that looks like an olive tree to me.Second When you are watching the movie one moment you see tanks rolling through a landscape with a lot of snow. Then all the snow magically disappears the tanks seem to drive through what I might describe as some kind of desert just to see the snow come back a few moments later.Third The acting! I'm not talking about the main actors Henry Fonda Charles Bronson Robert Shaw ... They didn't even do it too bad. It's the rest. How obvious can overacting be? Normally when a soldier gets hit he doesn't make a few pirouettes before falling to the ground. They do not fall in a heroic but oh so theatrical way. No they just fall down the way the impact of the bullet or whatever hits them makes them fall.I could go on like this but it would take us too far. All I want to say is this Don't believe a bit of what is said and shown in this movie. It's all fake. And the makers of this movie knew that too. At the end of the movie they give you the message that it is 'generalized'  as well as 'synthesized' to convey 'the spirit and essence of the battle' in which a million soldiers fought. Nice way to say that you know that you made a bad and historically completely inaccurate movie.If you really want to see what the Battle of the Bulge was like watch the episodes 6 Bastogne and 7 The Breaking Point of Band of Brothers! You'll see that war isn't about heroism and all that stuff which they are trying to make you believe with this movie. It's hell it always has been and always will be!!! They should have known and told that in 1965 it was only 20 years after the war and not 60 like today! Today a lot of kids have forgotten what World War II was like and they'll get a wrong view on it when watching a movie like this one. I give it a 110.".

But other scenes show cloudy skies snow and trees. Come on...you can't have it both ways!It can't be a spoiler to say that the Americans won the Battle of the Bulge. That's history. But without revealing the stupid ending all I can say is that the supposed top German tank commander's brigade gets stopped by a ragtag bunch of guys using a MacGyver technique. For heaven's sake!Henry Fonda is a likable hero but here he is the only one who's correct about the upcoming German offensive taking the flack for his lone opiniona standard clich. Later he's the only one who can actually find the German column and of course he gets to play MacGyver. It's just too much. How would you like a movie about the great WWII naval battle Midway in which the hero is the only one to think that the Japanese fleet is on the way the hero barely survives the initial attack the hero commissions a plane to fly off to find the Japanese battleships and spots them himself then the hero pulls a MacGyver to stop the entire Japanese attack.Robert Shaw his more interesting. As the German commander he has some depth to him. Is he going to be the quintessential honorable German or does he have some other motives?Listening to Shaw and his aid discuss Shaw's desire to fight forever I thought of Karl Malden's Bradly accusing George C. Scott's Patton of almost the same thing. But where Patton was the thinking person's war movie this Battle of the Bulge is for people who leave their brains behind. At least the writer and directors had little regard for their audience's intelligence.Skip this movie.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable adaptation of Jack Higgins' novel.";
	schema:reviewBody "After the successful rescue of Mussolini by German Paratroopers Col.Max Radl is asked to prepare a feasibility study on an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill. At first this seems a preposterous idea until a message arrives from an agent in Britain which reports that Churchill will spend a weekend in the picturesque Norfolk village of Studley Constable which is only a few miles from a deserted stretch of coastline. A plan is formulated to drop Col.Kurt Steiner and his highly experienced unit into Norfolk to carry out the mission aided by IRA man Liam Devlin and respected local figure Joanna Grey who is a German agent and the source of the original message.   This film has been a personal favourite of mine since I first saw it on its TV premiere around 1979 aged 12. It is of course the screen adaptation of Jack Higgins bestseller. I must admit to never having read the book so I can't testify how closely the film follows it. Produced by ITC in 1976 it boasts an impressive cast in Michael Caine Donald Sutherland Robert Duvall Donald Pleasance and a preJR Larry Hagman. Veteran Hollywood Director John Sturges was at the helm  the man responsible for 'Bad Day At Black Rock' 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Great Escape' to name just three. The production values and technical credits are uniformally good.   As to the film itself it remains an entertaining romp. Your interest is held throughout and you find yourself half wanting the Germans to get away with it as Michael Caine and his men are such decent chaps. Donald Sutherland is full of Irish charm as Devlin Larry Hagman is intentionally funny as the incompetent Col.Clarence T.Pitts Robert Duvall is convincing and sympathetic as Radl and Donald Pleasance quite chilling as Himmler. Good though the film is it might have been better. In his autobiography Michael Caine talks about the fact that after shooting had wrapped Sturges headed back to California and never returned for any of the editing or post production. Caine felt let down by this for as he correctly states a Director can do some of his most important work at this stage. However he also remembers the shooting of the film as a very pleasurable experience. At that time he lived at Windsor and much of the filming was done nearby on the beautiful Mapledurham Estate during the longest hottest summer that most of us remember.   I paid a visit to Mapledurham recently during the fine summer that we've just enjoyed. It's instantly recognisible  the watermill the church the manor house Joanna Grey's cottage  all as they appear in the film and well worth a visit. It always amuses me that the events are supposed to take place in November  a truly miserable month here  and yet its clearly midsummer on screen.   I have one major gripe. Not with the film itself but its availability on DVD. The UK version is to be avoided like the plague. Cursed with being distributed here by Carlton its in 1.331 and worse is missing some 12 minutes of footage. The US version is at least in 2.351 but is still missing 3 to 4 minutes of the film. Thank heavens that I still have my complete version recorded from the BBC some 12 years ago before they decided to cut some brief moments of violence. Its really annoying when a good film that did reasonable business at the box office gets such shoddy treatment on DVD. There really is no excuse for it.   When all is said and done this is a good entertaining yarn and an intriguing idea even if it does have echoes of 'Went The Day Well'. Maybe not a classic but always good fun professionally mounted and with some lovely locations. Give it a try if you haven't already seen it just avoid that Region 2 DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "OK to respond to the review from Richard WA.The movie is of course based on Jack Higgins' bestseller of the same name and like many debut books is by far the best book he wrote  being written over a period of years as Higgins worked as a schoolteacher. It is meticulously researched and a fine read.Now the film.First Of course an historically illiterate US teen would barely comprehend that history existed pre World War II or understand that the USA doesn't have a monopoly of the eagle as a national symbol. I read the book back in the mid70's and never even thought about moon landings. For war moviesbooks eagles are forever associated with Germany  that the USA also uses an eagle as a national symbol is purely coincidental. Richard WA can relax in the knowledge that few outside his peer group experienced his confusion.Second By telling the story from the German perspective we get a new appreciation of the German fighting man's view. Just as Das Boot gave us an insight into the German mind so too does this. A similar experience can be had watching the WWII POW camp movie The McKenzie Break where German POW's try to escape from a British camp  quite interesting really. But I guess if you're only interested in rooting for the Red White and Blue this is not your thing.Third The accents are brilliantly done. It was decided for the movie that the comical Hollywood German accent would not be used. The Ve haff vays of making you tork you schweinhund is nowhere to be seen instead the German characters use perfect accentless English to great effect.Fourth Sutherland's Irish character Devlin is not a Nazi sympathiser. He agrees to support the operation because the Germans offer to pay him a fortune to do so. Money for the cause etc.Fifth The preoperation phase of the movie is actually too short  as the producers wanted more of an action flick than the book delivers. In the book the planning of the operation is analysed to infinite detail down to the uniform details and relative attributes of allied versus German parachutes. I guess if your experience is computer games then exposure to any kind of preoperation detail is not something you're used to.Sixth A newcomer in WWII Britain would certainly raise suspicion and Sutherland's character certainly does do that  not really a flaw of the bookmovie but an operational problem that the Germans just had to accept given the timeframes involved.Seventh Jenny Agutter's character is completely unbelievable. Try to ignore that part of the movie  thankfully she's there for purely aesthetic purposes.Eighth The 5th columnist who already lives in the English village is actually a South African survivor of the British concentration camps  as explained in the movie. Perhaps Richard WA thought they were a German invention or more likely he's never heard of the Boer War and sleepwalked through that part of the movie.Ninth The battle scene is deliberately short to emphasise the gulf in class between German paratroops and National Guards. When the Germans are confronted by real soldiers they're defeated in short order. Larry Hagman's character is a poor caricature and serves only to supply a comic element that's not needed  something the movie suffers from as if the producer was scared to make the movie too gritty. Richard WA's last point is most revealing. Why should Germans fight for Germany when everyone knew that they were going to lose and were on the wrong side anyway. Who ever heard of a brave German soldier fighting to the end anyway? Despite what many think Americans don't have an monopoly on patriotism either  I doubt if he ever wonders why Steve McQueen never settled for a comfortable life in a German POW camp!Tenth Yeah the tunnel is something of a contrived device...it's not in the book BTW.Eleventh The reason for not spiriting Churchill away after the attempt to kidnap him was precisely because the British wanted Germany to think he was there and not in Tehran! The whole point of a decoy is that it's visible and attracts the attention while the real principal is concealed.In summery the Eagle has Landed is a solid attempt to film a great book. I doubt given the plot that a universally appealing movie could've been made but the greatest movies ever are not universally appealing. Movies you love as children are not regarded in the same way in adulthood.The Eagle has Landed is in many ways like The Day of the Jackal. Most of the action goes on inside the principals' heads. Deception mental thought processes and subterfuge don't make good cinema. However the movie has some very good pointsGreat locations. Great actors doing good jobs Jenny Agutter excepted  especially Donald Pleasance doing the best ever spinechilling portrayal of Himmler. Good twist at the end. Challenging portrayal of the enemy.I recommend it  it's not A Bridge Too far but it's pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Partially thanks to my father I've always been a fan of war movies and that's how I already saw several of them as a kid. But of course as a kid I wasn't as critical towards them as I am today. Several of the war movies from the sixties and seventies now seem dated and very unbelievable think for instance of Where Eagles Dare from 1968 which many people seem to like but which lacks all realism as the Allies seem impenetrable by German bullets. But that doesn't mean that they all are bad. Take for instance Cross of Iron All Quiet on the Western Front the TV remake A Bridge Too Far... which are one by one excellent movies. If I have to give this movie a place in between these two categories than I would say right in the middle. It isn't the best war movie from that time period but it's far from bad.Based on the novel by Jack Higgins this movie tells the story of Colonel Steiner a German parachute unit commander who has been courtmarshaled for opposing the SS in rounding up Jews. To avoid further imprisonment and certain death he is offered the chance to go on an assignment in England. He and his unit will have to kidnap the British Prime Minister Winston Churchil on a covert mission. They decide to go for the seemingly impossible assignment and dressed as Polish soldiers on a training maneuver they soon take over a small English town waiting for the visit of the Prime Minister who will take his vacation there...Even though I have read the book I'm not really able to tell you whether the adaption to the movie has been a success or not. I read the book about ten years ago and it's impossible for me to remember all the details. However as I already said this certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting for instance is very nice. People like Michael Caine Donald Sutherland Robert Duvall... all did a nice job. Especially Donald Sutherland stole the show playing the IRA militant and full time playboy Liam Devlin. What I also liked was that the 'Germans' didn't speak with some funny accent but spoke fluent English. I prefer to hear the Germans speak German but when that it isn't possible this option is the best to go for. There is nothing more hateful than a wellknown Hollywood actor who tries to make you believe that he speaks a language other than English it never works and only brings down the quality of a movie.Overall this is a good WWII movie that shows the war from a different perspective namely from the German side. For some that will probably make it uninteresting as they see the Germans as the stupid bad guys unable of doing some daring operations but for me it works. I really liked this movie and all its aspects. The story is nice the action scenes look more than OK the acting is very good... I really liked it all and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

They decide to go for the seemingly impossible assignment and dressed as Polish soldiers on a training maneuver they soon take over a small English town waiting for the visit of the Prime Minister who will take his vacation there...Even though I have read the book I'm not really able to tell you whether the adaption to the movie has been a success or not. I read the book about ten years ago and it's impossible for me to remember all the details. However as I already said this certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting for instance is very nice. People like Michael Caine Donald Sutherland Robert Duvall... all did a nice job. Especially Donald Sutherland stole the show playing the IRA militant and full time playboy Liam Devlin. What I also liked was that the 'Germans' didn't speak with some funny accent but spoke fluent English. I prefer to hear the Germans speak German but when that it isn't possible this option is the best to go for. There is nothing more hateful than a wellknown Hollywood actor who tries to make you believe that he speaks a language other than English it never works and only brings down the quality of a movie.Overall this is a good WWII movie that shows the war from a different perspective namely from the German side. For some that will probably make it uninteresting as they see the Germans as the stupid bad guys unable of doing some daring operations but for me it works. I really liked this movie and all its aspects. The story is nice the action scenes look more than OK the acting is very good... I really liked it all and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.";

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a bestselling tall story by Jack Higgins and featuring an allstar cast that must've cost half the budget just to get to sign up for the project The Eagle Has Landed is an enjoyable but slightly overlong wartime actioner. German soldier Max Radl Robert Duvall comes up with an audacious plot to deliver a devastating blow to the Allied forces by kidnapping Winston Churchill from a Norfolk village. A team of deadly German spies led by Kurt Steiner Michael Caine are smuggled into England to carry out this sinister scheme. Aided by an Irish mercenary Donald Sutherland the German forces rapidly and ruthlessly close in on their target. Only an inexperienced American garrison posted in a quiet corner of Norfolk can stand in the way of a devastating German victory. The Eagle Has Landed is one of the few films where the allstar cast doesn't have a detrimental effect. In films like A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day the presence of so many stars actually results in a game of starspotting and this diverts the audience's attention away from important plot developments. In The Eagle Has Landed each actor brings depth and charisma to their strongly written roles especially Sutherland as the devious Irish rogue and Duvall as an eyepatch wearing Nazi. This film's faults lie elsewhere. The opening hour and a quarter goes on rather too much and ought to have been trimmed by at least fifteen minutes. Also the plot rides its luck with increasingly less likely less plausible developments especially the unpersuasive twist ending. For these reasons The Eagle Has Landed isn't quite the excellent film you might be hoping for. What it is however is an enjoyable wellacted and very watchable slice of escapism.".

For whatever reason John Sturges had Hagman play his character as comic relief. It's completely out of place and really harms the mood of the movie. A straight performance would have been much more preferable.The second thing I find distracting about the movie is very difficult to explain but it has something to do with the overall look of the film. Other than a few shots of gore as the American soldiers are being hit by bullets much of the movie has a cheap madeforTV look to it that also takes away from the tone of the movie. It's not as gritty looking for lack of a better word as it should be. The battle scene doesn't look as real as it should.

Not being much of a student of history I have no idea how much is true but it certainly seems feasible as presented. And finally I really enjoy the Nazi operative played by Jean Marsh.

It might not be as entertaining and good as other WW IIaction movies meant as entertainment such as Where Eagles Dare Kelly's Heroes and The Guns of Navarone but it does have some great moments in it which still helps to make The Eagle Has Landed a bit of a must see for the fans of the genre.The story is just great and its interesting to see a movie for once from the perspective of the German side. For once the Germans are not portrayed as ruthless villains but as soldiers with valor and courage instead. The movie is perhaps a bit moralistic in the first halve of the movie basicly every German soldier shown in the movie openly hates Hitler and is against the deportation of Jews to the concentration camps. It feels too forced all but nevertheless the perspective the movie is told from is great and works good for the movie. It's too bad that the movie is told needlessly slow at times while it could had been a great fast paced actionmovie.The movie has a great cast but this is not really an actors movie meaning that the movie wouldn't had been any better or worse with some other lesser known names in it. It was weird to hear Donald Sutherland talking in an Irish accent and Robert Duvall with a German one. Also Treat Williams in one of his first movie roles was horrible as the American soldier Capt. Clark. On the other hand it was great to see Donald Pleasance as Heinrich Himmler. Other big names in this movie are Michael Caine Anthony Quayle and Jean Marsh.The action sequences are good and definitely the best part of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I almost gave up on this film after the first hour. It was just too slow for me and I was having difficulty picking up some of dialog with the foreign accents no subtitles are offered on the DVD.However once the invasion started the film was very interesting. The only ridiculous part was the role played by Larry Hagman. Liberal Hollywood loves to portray every Southerner as a gungho outofcontrol military freak. If I was from the South I would have been highly offended at this stereotype.What's really different about this film is that it's a World War II story told from the German side where the Germans are pictured as humane people. You don't see that too much from Englishspeaking filmmakers.Michael Caine is the most likable of these people one of those given the assignment of kidnapping Winston Churchill interesting premise off the best selling book by Jack Higgins. Donald Sutherland plays an Irishman recruited to help in the kidnapping and he's fun to watch.This is really a man's movie something like The Guns Of Navarone but they inserted Jenny Agutter in here to give the viewers a pretty face and some romance even though it has absolutely no bearing on the story.Robert Duvall Jean Marsh Treat Williams Donald Pleasance and Anthony Quayle are some of the other name actors who contribute. All in all a pretty good movie if you can get by that first hour!".

It was just too slow for me and I was having difficulty picking up some of dialog with the foreign accents no subtitles are offered on the DVD.However once the invasion started the film was very interesting. The only ridiculous part was the role played by Larry Hagman. Liberal Hollywood loves to portray every Southerner as a gungho outofcontrol military freak. If I was from the South I would have been highly offended at this stereotype.What's really different about this film is that it's a World War II story told from the German side where the Germans are pictured as humane people. You don't see that too much from Englishspeaking filmmakers.Michael Caine is the most likable of these people one of those given the assignment of kidnapping Winston Churchill interesting premise off the best selling book by Jack Higgins. Donald Sutherland plays an Irishman recruited to help in the kidnapping and he's fun to watch.This is really a man's movie something like The Guns Of Navarone but they inserted Jenny Agutter in here to give the viewers a pretty face and some romance even though it has absolutely no bearing on the story.Robert Duvall Jean Marsh Treat Williams Donald Pleasance and Anthony Quayle are some of the other name actors who contribute. All in all a pretty good movie if you can get by that first hour!";

	schema:headline " Great fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1975 novel of the same name by Jack Higgins this is an extremely enjoyable Boy's Owntype adventure thriller concerning a Nazi plot to kidnap Churchill in 1943. I first saw the film in 2006 and I did not particularly enjoy it. I think that the major problem that I had with it then was that I was expecting it to be on the same level as the director John Sturges' previous films The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape my fourth and fifth favourite films respectively then and now and it most certainly isn't. However I was unfair to it on that occasion. On my second viewing of it today I enjoyed it considerably more for what it was as opposed to disliking it for what it wasn't. There was a few rather silly moments but it has a cracking script by Tom Mankiewicz. I would praise Sturges' direction from what I saw on screen but according to Mankiewicz and Michael Caine most of the editing work was done by Anne V. Coates so it is a little hard to gauge it in the way that I normally would for such things. This was Sturges' final film incidentally.Michael Caine is characteristically excellent as the highly decorated but disgraced protagonist Oberst Kurt Steiner. He is introduced while trying to save a young Jewish woman from being rounded up by the SS in Poland saying that he does not have any strong feelings about the Jews one way or the other but he has seen too many people die in the war already. Steiner is a comparatively honourable man who at times is even sympathetic in spite of the fact that he is leading the mission to kidnap the Prime Minister. In fact most of his men are honourable as one of them gives his life to save a little English girl from being crushed by a waterwheel. He meets that unpleasant fate himself. His Free Polish uniform is torn and it is revealed that he is wearing a German one underneath and consequently that they are Germans. Steiner insisted that he and his men be allowed to wear their German uniforms one of the aforementioned silly moments.I said in my review of Ordinary People last week that Donald Sutherland is one of the best actors of his generation and I stand by that. However he was badly miscast as the Germans' IRA accomplice Liam Devlin. He does the best that he can with the role but his Irish accent is not great and the character is a little clichd his second line being Top o' the mornin' to ya. Bar one year in Edinburgh I have lived all of my 28 years in Ireland and I have yet to hear anyone say that unless they were mocking Irish stereotypes! Richard Harris was strongly considered for the role and he would certainly have been more suited to it as aside from his nationality he often played rough and ready characters. However perhaps he was too suited to it. The producers decided that it was a bad idea to cast him since he was known for making proIRA statements in real life. Considering that this was a British film made in the 1970s I don't think that it was a great idea or a very tasteful one to make Devlin a lovable rogue essentially. His love story with Molly admittedly played very well by Jenny Agutter is nice but it doesn't really add much to the film.The film has a very strong supporting cast overall such as Robert Duvall as Oberst Radl Anthony Quayle as the Cassandraesque Admiral Wilhelm Canaris who was executed for treason in 1945 a suitably creepy Donald Pleasence as Himmler Jean Marsh as the sleeper agent Joanna Grey SvenBertil Taube as Hans John Standing as Father Verecker a very young Treat Williams as Captain Clark Michael Byrne as Karl Siegfried Rauch the most prominent German cast member as Brandt and last but not least Larry Hagman as the blustering buffoonish US Army Colonel Clarence E. Pitts. Interestingly he played a somewhat similar character in his cameo in Superman likewise written by Mankiewicz. The film also features nice small appearances from Maurice Roves Judy Geeson Jeff Conaway Roy Marsden and Denis Lill.Overall this is not a heavy hitter when it comes to World War II films but it's great fun. Oh and what a twist at the end!".

	schema:reviewBody "There be spoilers ahead...I tend to love movies like this  high adventure and a ripping good yarn especially when fact and fiction is blended unfortunately that's also a feature of most Hollywood films that purport to be factual  and the book upon which it was based was one of my favorites when I was in my early teens.  This excellent and entertaining movie still holds up well and is a classic of its genre.Actors like Michael Caine and others  some known and some lesserknown to most  anchor a simple but strong storyline that's nicely paced.  The acting's good from all involved and Donald Sutherland plays his role as the sardonic Irishman to the hilt perfectly but if there's one standout performance in this film my vote would go to Robert Duvall whose Colonel Radl is the most complex and conflicted of all of the characters most of the principals being similarly conflicted one way or another and his acting is paradoxically stunning yet subtle.  A recent graduate of The Godfather Duvall would go on to evergreater heights with his work in the magnificent Apocalypse Now and beyond.  This movie's not quite the caliber of either of those two hallowed ventures but it's well worth catching if you're a fan of Duvall too.The plot is entirely plausible in both its big picture and in its details. One of the most refreshing aspects of the film is that the German characters are not portrayed as Nazi fanatics.  Indeed all of the film's German characters are portrayed as being decent people contemptuous of the Fuehrer and his Nazi hierarchy except for Himmler and his SS men.Steiner Michael Caine's character is a paratrooper decorated with a Knights Cross and subsequent  honors and his men are a collection of combat veterans.  The contrast between these 'good' Germans and the 'bad' Germans is established from the start with the showdown between Steiner's group and SS who were 'liquidating' a Polish ghetto and shipping Jews off to the death camps.  Steiner's stand results in he and his team being assigned to a penal unit for which life expectancies were very low.  The planned kidnapping of Churchill at first dismissed by Duvall's Radl and his superior Admiral Canaris a historical figure chief of German intelligence played well by Anthony Quayle who even looks like the Abwehr head begins to seem possible in light of a random intelligence note regarding the British Prime Minister's impending visit to a remote seaside town.  A special team would be needed and herein lay the road to salvation for Britisheducated Steiner and his crew.  The actors who play Steiner's men are believable as elite forces who have seen it all yet still have retained their humanity.  Included among Steiner's men is a face briefly shown clearly familiar to viewers of 1978's Grease  Jeff Conaway.The ubiquitous Donald Pleasance whose lack of discrimination in film projects is rivaled perhaps only by that of Michael Caine wallows in the role of Himmler perfectly capturing the former failed chickenfarmer's look and unnerving normality a normality that barely concealed a seriouslydisturbed megalomaniac.  He's perfect as Himmler turning the small role that the ReichsfuhrerSS has in this film into a freaky and haunting performance.  A gray little man with no personal charisma or physical ability Pleasance's Himmler is ruthless and emboldened by the power that he wields and it shows.  Scary.Larry Hagman is great if greatly annoying albeit intentionally as the aptlynamed Colonel Pitts a gungho but combatgreen US Ranger officer who injects a bit of comic relief amidst the serious action of combat.  I think that Pitts has seen too many John Wayne movies.  He also plays to certain stereotypes about the Ugly American that have become firmly entrenched in the UK and elsewhere  our sympathies lie more with the Germans of Steiner's unit than with him.  His foil  antidote really  is the AllAmerican Treat Williams playing a junior Ranger officer who does actually appear to know what he's doing.  Still the firefight between the relatively raw Rangers and their seasoned opposition  Steiner's men are veterans of the Eastern Front Crete Norway and may other nasty war zones  is something of a study in contrasts.Michael Caine who gets to wear the cool leather jacket is really the main character in the movie but the piece is such an ensemble effort that he is far from the movie's focus in terms of time.  I wouldn't be surprised to find that Donald Sutherland's sly character actually gets more screen time. Donald Sutherland's always excellent and this film's no exception.  He's also got some of the film's best lines and his character progresses the most as the film goes on.Michael Caine's always a pleasure to watch even in his most dire films and several have been pretty dire.   He's well cast as Steiner and embodies his warweariness style knowing humor and gentlemanly conduct very well. Colonel Steiner is the calm in the center of the storm in this film and is the kind of leader that most soldiers would probably love to serve with.If you want to see a movie that's not too heavy and not too cerebral but still not lacking intelligence in combination with a good rollicking storyline that includes a few satisfying twists this one's a good one to sit back and enjoy.  It's a tribute to the filmmakers' breaking away from the stereotyped Nazi that the viewing audience and the German characters' American and British adversaries feel sadness at the film's end with the decimation of what remained of Steiner's men.  Ultimately the film's further testimony to the futility of war even more directly in this case because of the ersatz Churchill  a nice sad twist to the tale.They don't make movies like this any more and that's a pity.".

Maybe he's not the worst writer to make millionaire status since there's a lot of competition for that tag like Harold Robbins  Jackie Collins or even that dreadful hack called Rowling who has conned a lot of children out of their pocket money by publishing the same mediocre book year after year  but certainly as a writer Higgins is rather poor and it's no surprise that for many years film producers are totally disinterested in buying the movie rights to his stories THE EAGLE HAS LANDED is a typical Higgins story  Clichd and with a ludicrous plot . What's it about ? A bunch of German paratroopers disguised as Poles drop into Norfolk in 1943 on a mission to kidnap Winston Churchill thereby bring about a negotiated settlement with the Western allies ? Can anyone see a flaw with this plot ? If you wonder what I'm talking about please read a history book on the second world war . Found it yet ? You might notice that Churchill was never kidnapped by German paratroopers which leads even the most ignorant audience member to have a rough idea of how the movie will end . On top of all that you find yourself comparing the movie to the far more superior Graham Greene adaptation of WENT THE DAY WELL which features a very similar plot But it's the clichs that really get me with this movie . I don't doubt that from 193945 many Germans disliked Nazism and were disgusted by the genocidal policies of the party  but watching this movie you'd think EVERYONE was physically opposed to Nazism . Kurt Stiener  A banal German name but better that Schmidt I guess  assaults a totenkopf officer and vainly tries to save a Jewish woman from a death squad in Poland . Yup happened all the time I imagine  while Liam Devlin is mistaken as a gestapo member in a bar  has whisky poured over him and thrown through a window . Yes I'm sure if someone has the power of life and death over you and your family and you slightly disagreed with their racial politics you too would want to give them a piece of your mind . Oh I've just looked up a history book called History Of The Second World War And Why Germany Lost by Jack Higgins that fails to mention the lack of resources Germany had  or the slow degradation of its industrial power by allied bombing or massive loss of manpower suffered on the Eastern front  instead he states Germany lost the war because the average German hated the Nazis more than they hated the countries they were at war with ! If the clichs aren't bad enough we also have to endure some ridiculous plot devices . IRA man Liam Devlin  Who wants to overthrow the British empire without blowing up innocent passers by  Yawn  embarks on a relationship with a local girl within five minutes of landing in Norfolk . I guess this is to lull a potential female audience into the story  but would any woman be interested in a Jack Higgins story ? Would anyone with any common sense be interested in a Higgins story ! Oh and not wanting to be shot as spies the German wear their Luftwaffe uniforms under their Polish uniforms . Let me see now  they don't want to be shot as spies so if they wear their own uniforms under their disguise this will protect them under the terms laid out by the Geneva convention ! Actually it won't because they're spies  assassins . Of course this is another plot device  another daft plot device This is a really stupid movie but I have no hesitation in awarding it six out of ten simply because the cast go out of their way to rise above the material . Michael Caine was infamous in the mid to late 1970s to taking on roles that were obviously just to pay the rent but he manages to make Kurt Stiener as well rounded and as affable as a thinly written cypher can be . Donald Sutherland steals every scene he's in but it's Robert Duvall who gives the stand out performance as a German Oberst . It's a very subtle performance in which his body language says far more about his character than the written dialogue . Uanfortunately Larry Hagman gives a terrible performance as an American officer . Remember the sheriff in THE DUKES OF HAZZARD ? I'm sure that was inspired by Hagman's performance here".

	schema:headline " Perplexing war movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "No it's not about the first moon landings although it sounds as if it should be. It's about a group of German soldiers led by Michael Caine and aided by Donald Southerland as an Irishman who parachute into England in an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring an end to the war. They fail which can't be too big a surprise.The movie's plot is all over the place. Caine and his men are disguised as British paratroopers and they more or less take over a small British village claiming to be on an exercise. But they wear their German uniforms under their fake British uniforms and one of the men while saving the life of a young girl dies and has his true identity revealed. This happens rather early in the movie so the whole disguise business lasts only about 15 minutes. After that the movie becomes routine. The Germans strip to field gray and hole up in a church. They are surrounded and outnumbered by American rangers and fight to the death although it's not clear why they just don't surrender. The war is nearly over.What lifts the movie a bit above the expectable  and this may be completely accidental  is that it's not easy for the average viewer used to watching less complicated material like Funniest Home Videos to figure out which side to root for.The Germans of course have been fighting for an evil cause. Yet in this instance at least they are men of probity and honor.

	onyx:emotionText "No it's not about the first moon landings although it sounds as if it should be. It's about a group of German soldiers led by Michael Caine and aided by Donald Southerland as an Irishman who parachute into England in an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring an end to the war. They fail which can't be too big a surprise.The movie's plot is all over the place. Caine and his men are disguised as British paratroopers and they more or less take over a small British village claiming to be on an exercise. But they wear their German uniforms under their fake British uniforms and one of the men while saving the life of a young girl dies and has his true identity revealed. This happens rather early in the movie so the whole disguise business lasts only about 15 minutes. After that the movie becomes routine. The Germans strip to field gray and hole up in a church. They are surrounded and outnumbered by American rangers and fight to the death although it's not clear why they just don't surrender. The war is nearly over.What lifts the movie a bit above the expectable  and this may be completely accidental  is that it's not easy for the average viewer used to watching less complicated material like Funniest Home Videos to figure out which side to root for.The Germans of course have been fighting for an evil cause. Yet in this instance at least they are men of probity and honor. Their goal is not to assassinate Churchill if that can be avoided but to put the snatch on him and try to negotiate a settlement with the Allies. And you can tell the people who made the movie did not want a horde of hairy Huns playing goosestepping Nazi types because the soldiers look like young men.

	schema:reviewBody "John Sturges' World War II adventure hit of the 1970s still works somewhat decently within its genre. The story deals with a group of German soldiers who are sent on a nearly impossible mission of kidnapping Winston Churchill when he comes to visit a rural English village. Compiled by a frustrated Colonel Radl Robert Duvall the team consists of a Britainhating Irish militant Liam Devlin Donald Sutherland and the loyal men of a righteous hero soldier Kurt Steiner Michael Caine who has been dishonoured and imprisoned for his lack of respect for his superiors. Devlin is sent to infiltrate the coastal village of Studley Constable and to contact a German sleeper agent Joanna Grey Jean Marsh in advance while Steiner prepares his troops to pose as friendly Polish soldiers and arrives in Britain later. Having reached the village the team finds a settlement of American soldiers nearby and as expected things don't go neatly according to the plans.The movie doesn't go for an analytical meditation on the nature of war and focuses on the personal level instead. The tone stays somewhat light for the most part and especially Devlin's antics while getting to know the English locals such as Molly and Arthur Jenny Agutter and Terry Plummer approach comedy at points. The pacing is very leisurely action scenes are only seen during the last third of the runtime and while they are entertaining enough for what it's worth they are not spectacular enough to carry the whole story alone. Even though we know from history if the team's mission will be successful or not there is a small twist at the end that adds a sense of sadness to the mood  the message about the futility of war efforts from a grunt's point of view culminate in Steiner's final scene somewhat effectively even if the big payoff doesn't ultimately feel quite worth the wait.The emphasis being on the characters' onscreen chemistry the importance of the actors becomes even bigger than usual. Luckily most of the cast does a good job throughout. Particularly the always creepylooking Donald Sutherland suits his role formidably conveying a feel of joviality and menace at the same time. The quiet and mousy Himmler is also portrayed with natural ease by Donald Pleasence and the calm Robert Duvall is at home as the eyepatchwearing Radl. Larry Hagman's role as the American Colonel Pitts brings humour to the mix while avoiding overly annoying bumbling. The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to see Michael Caine as a German officer even if his character is explained to have studied in England  Caine is such an archetype of Britishness that a German uniform is not enough to make his legendary persona disappear.In addition to the performances some of the scenery of the windy beaches and the surrounding areas look very nice and Lalo Schifrin's score fits in with the mood well. However tighter pacing and writing would have been needed to raise The Eagle Has Landed to the master class. As it is now it is a watchable war flick but not among the best of its ilk. Fans of the stars should find it enjoyable though.".

When dealing with nonfiction true historically correct stories you have to make an effort to keep it true to facts however you still have to make it entertaining otherwise everyone but the historians and storyloving audiences will find it less than worth their time and that is exactly what went wrong here. As far as I know this film is fairly historically accurateapart from the main plotline which I'm not entirely sure about. It's also wellacted and the locations and costumes are authentic. Thing is that's all it is authentic historically accurateto a certain extent at least and wellacted. The film has little to no entertainment value. I realize that a war film shouldn't be a hilarious or something to cheer atlike an action flick for example but it can at least show it's audience the courtesy of being slightly interesting apart from the plotwhich I think to some extent deviates from what really happened in a typical Hollywood fashion which seems predictable and is easily figured out from the very beginning simply due to it obviously trying hard to be historically accurate which negates the tension that the last scenes are trying to build. Even in the very end which contains a twistobviously designed to build tension is predictable and almost immediately figured out. The plot is somewhat good it's just too predictable and virtually everyone will figure out how it's going to end save for the historically ignorantwho probably won't see the movie anyway. The pacing is bad unless once again you're interested in seeing this for the historical accuracy. The film never really seemed to take off until the last half hour or so when you've stopped caring about the plot. The acting is very good pretty much the only thing worthwhile in this movie. The characters are wellwrittenI guess but they are based on real people so there's not much room to go wrong there and mostly credible. The cinematography is nothing memorable. The costumes and locations are very authentic and well done. All in all not a particularly good film but worth watching for fans of fairly historically accurate war films and fans of the various actors since they all give great performances. Anyone else should avoid this. There are far better war movies out there. 710".

The movie itself was fun and exciting. The shots taken in Mapledurham were brilliant because it didn't look like the village at all.

The movie itself was fun and exciting. The shots taken in Mapledurham were brilliant because it didn't look like the village at all. But I love the movie and if you are into old war movies this is a good one to watch. Enjoy!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Birdy is a difficult film to describe. It's about the developing friendship between Al Nick Cage and Birdy Matthew Modine but it's also about a descent into madness and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.The film starts in the late 60's in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded and has had reconstructive surgery on his face but he's been brought in because Birdy is here. He's uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.The story is mostly told in flashbacks either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or later Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar  Al is athletic outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted  a typical nerd. The two are paradoxically brought together by Birdy's love of birds and the stupid things they do  making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons climbing on and falling off factories trying to capture more birds.Al tries to set Birdy on a 'normal' track they buy a wrecked car and fix it up and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work and it's a wonder he doesn't alienate Al with his strange behaviour.In the 'present' the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond if he doesn't then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue and it becomes clear that Birdy's love of birds has turned into an obsession and then into the darker realms beyond that.The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end they both go off to fight in the war Al gets his injury while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out but Al decides he's not leaving.The ending of the film is incredibly powerful and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it 'appropriate' to the rest of the film? I dunno  but I thought it was pretty damn good.The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine  and for me it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role capturing the bravado of his character perfectly but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably but it's the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession it is crystal clear that he's not squatting in his cell but perching wishing to fly.Alan Parker has made some great films this might just be his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note this is best read after having seen Birdy as it contains some general spoilers.As scary as a bird's life may be they always have that.  They can fly away.'Birdy.To say that Birdy is a film about a young man obsessed with birds and flying is to oversimplify a great deal.  Birdy is an extraordinary film that deals with the longing to fly and everything that such a yearning entails about a person.  It's about people who weren't meant to live in this world this society who don't belong who don't fit in and don't really want to fit in.  It's about the overwhelming frustration of not having asked for any of this' yet constantly being reminded that no matter how much one doesn't want to be a part of it all just by being human there is no escape the world will not let you do as you want and one cannot fly away. In director Alan Parker's vision these feelings that are so hard to put into words are articulately and beautifully expressed.I'm not going to focus on plot details as much as on what Birdy is about' but I will just say that Matthew Modine gives an incredible performance as Birdy.  At moments his greatest power simply comes from his eyes and facial expressions especially in his scenes in the military asylum.  This is a perfect example of superb casting and an actor just disappearing into his role. Obviously the character of Birdy is central to understanding the film and his fascination with birds and particularly their flight is his way of trying to deal with a cold insensitive world while being a sensitive individual.  His growing obsession with his birds and disassociation with the outside world comes with his realization that he is alone and no one understands him even Al Nicholas Cage his best and only friend.Birdy doesn't care about the outside world and his ideas of what is truly important and what freedom is couldn't be further from the society that tells him to be concerned with superficial things. He is pure to the highest extent in that he is not in the least tainted by the constant pressure the world places on him to fit in and be normal'.  Al connects him to the outside world and allows him to share some of his dreams to a certain degree but Birdy more or less continues to live in his own little world.  And even though Birdy isn't disturbing anyone it seems that just the little things that mean so much to him are what are constantly threatened to be taken away.  His own mom always threatens to get rid of his birds and uses this to force Birdy to go to the prom which he has no interest in. This serves as an example of a relatively trivial matter that is looked upon as some major event in every young person's life.  Here Birdy is  more or less being told 'fit in or I'll take away the one thing that you have that truly matters to you'.  Similarly all of Birdy and Al's chances of fun and freedom are taken away throughout the filmtheir car for example the closest thing they have to being able to get up and take off. And they get into trouble when they haven't really done anything too bad showing the ways the uptight unreasonable society tries to force everyone into line.  How it sucks the life out of people is also shown especially through adult characters like Birdy and Al's parents. While it's true that Birdy's parents just want better for him they could never understand what would be better for him.  This idea of losing any sort of idealism and settling down is shown in Birdy and Al's father's jobs.  Birdy's dad is a janitor at his school and Al's is a garbage man.  I think I can honestly make a judgement that no one grows up dreaming of or even expecting to become one of the above jobs.  But time and time again the world crushes ideals and hopes and dreams and forces everyone into some kind of role.Birdy and Al's going off to Vietnam is not only the ultimate example of being forced to do something one doesn't want of no escape and no choice but also shows the irony of war for people like Birdy who doesn't want anything to do with this world anyway and the antiauthoritarian Al. Supposedly they are fighting for freedom yet is this really freedom for people who never even wanted to be part of this society in the first place? Freedom for the very society that crushes their souls and determines how they will live to continue to exist? The film is brought to its climatic height in the scene that shows what sent Birdy over the edge.  As bombs explode and men die around him there is nothing he can do but sit and watch as all sorts of species of birds fly away from the horror.  Birdy is sent over the edge with this realization that he can't fly like a bird he is not free and will never truly be on this earth as a human being.Finally I guess at this point it's practically mandatory to comment on the muchdebated ending.  I personally like it and happen to think its one of the funniest moments in film I've ever seen. But besides it also fits into the context of the film.  Here we have a whimsical film about quirky people doing quirky things.  So why should a quirky ending suddenly be considered a cheap gag? Sure it's abrupt but the entire film has been unconventional and has also had its share of  humorous moments. Furthermore I've noticed a great deal of symmetry throughout Birdy especially with the jumpfly' scenes where every time Birdy gets himself in trouble and it looks as though he's about to fall to his death and Al gets all worried  Birdy manages to be okay and land on his feet sort of. If you watch closely and also listen to the music which seems  to signify these scenes a lot more than you may have expected  will fall into place. I also just want to quickly mention how beautifully and poetically shot some of the scenes are a great moment is when we fly from a bird's point of view.  Obviously  a lot more can be said and be gotten out of Birdy and I didn't use many specific examples because there are just too many to choose from but here I just tried to best sum up what strikes me the most about this film.  Anyone who's ever felt absolutely out of place in this world and frustrated with being stuck on the ground here will almost certainly be able to make a connection with this film.".

	schema:headline " Birdy flies away into cinematic greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "I was flipping through the channels one quiet evening at home when I stumbled across this picture Birdy.To some the character Birdy Matthew Modine has an unnatural and quite unhealthy obsession with birds. Well he spends most of his time with birds has dreams of flying away from his realworld troubles and his only friend is a neighborhood tough named Al Nicolas Cage. So because of his obsession with birds Birdy has to be crazy right? So is Al even crazier for befriending him well isn't he?It is these questions and many more that make up the central theme of Alan Parker's superb 1984 drama Birdy adapted from William Wharton's novel a film about two crazy guys whose friendship is ultimately tested by each other's mental sicknesses. Both of their lives take drastic turns before and after they have done tours in Vietnam and ultimately wind up in opposite ends of the psyche ward of a state mental hospital with Al who's been left virtually unrecognizable by his facial bandages and Birdy who's stuck in a catatonic state as a result of an accident out on the killing fields.It is also the feelings of isolation between the two that brings them together as flashbacks during their stay help to emphasize their emotions. Birdy feeling like he is the only one that understands his bird dream may in actuality be the only sane character in the whole film. Al who is injured from a shell explosion questions who he is because he's not even sure who it really is underneath the bandages on his face. And it is liberation whether it be physical or mental that is expressed greatly by the film's ending and Birdy's eventual coming to grips with his own current predicament.Director Parker has always made it a point of capturing human suffering on celluloid and this has been the main subject in a number of his films including Midnight Express 1978 and Angel Heart 1987. Here his subject matter is fairly lighter than those films since the audience is spared the really intense mental anguish that accompanied Express and the graphic carnage of Angel.There's a kind of deep spiritual undercurrent flowing through Birdy which is most apparent by the lead character's fascination with his quarry  birds. To him birds represent freedom a kind of freedom that can only be obtained by literally taking to the skies and soaring high above all his problems fans of Terry Gilliam's political satire Brazil should take notice here. This of course leads to the film's profound ending on the mental hospital's rooftop where Al and Birdy must make a desperate choice  choose freedom or choose confinement  of the body or of the psyche.I won't reveal any more than those close details but you'll have to see what happens for yourself. It really caught me off guard and in a lesser movie might seem tacky but the way Parker and the actors handle just makes the onscreen action that much more moving. But you can be sure of this Birdy flies. And Birdy does fly into underrated classic movie status because of its performers and director Alan Parker's direction.1010".

	onyx:emotionText "I was flipping through the channels one quiet evening at home when I stumbled across this picture Birdy.To some the character Birdy Matthew Modine has an unnatural and quite unhealthy obsession with birds. Well he spends most of his time with birds has dreams of flying away from his realworld troubles and his only friend is a neighborhood tough named Al Nicolas Cage. So because of his obsession with birds Birdy has to be crazy right? So is Al even crazier for befriending him well isn't he?It is these questions and many more that make up the central theme of Alan Parker's superb 1984 drama Birdy adapted from William Wharton's novel a film about two crazy guys whose friendship is ultimately tested by each other's mental sicknesses. Both of their lives take drastic turns before and after they have done tours in Vietnam and ultimately wind up in opposite ends of the psyche ward of a state mental hospital with Al who's been left virtually unrecognizable by his facial bandages and Birdy who's stuck in a catatonic state as a result of an accident out on the killing fields.It is also the feelings of isolation between the two that brings them together as flashbacks during their stay help to emphasize their emotions. Birdy feeling like he is the only one that understands his bird dream may in actuality be the only sane character in the whole film. Al who is injured from a shell explosion questions who he is because he's not even sure who it really is underneath the bandages on his face. And it is liberation whether it be physical or mental that is expressed greatly by the film's ending and Birdy's eventual coming to grips with his own current predicament.Director Parker has always made it a point of capturing human suffering on celluloid and this has been the main subject in a number of his films including Midnight Express 1978 and Angel Heart 1987. Here his subject matter is fairly lighter than those films since the audience is spared the really intense mental anguish that accompanied Express and the graphic carnage of Angel.There's a kind of deep spiritual undercurrent flowing through Birdy which is most apparent by the lead character's fascination with his quarry  birds.

A young Nicholas Cage plays his best friend Al.It's not a particularly pleasant story. In fact it's downright depressing many times. It also had an unusual ending one the critics seemed to all pan but I liked. I thought it was neat.The movie does keep your interest so it gets decent points for that and it certainly presents a unique character study.

It doesn't seek to use the war as a means of creating the identities of the characters the war and the present situation in the film most of the film is flashbacks are more background to the story of two crazy Philly kids growing up together.The movie is full of laughs that don't occur at the expense of the characters but rather bring you closer to them. I personally identified with Matthew Modine's character and found myself laughing in spite of myself at some of his mishaps and wondering how did I ever survive being a teenager?Modine plays Birdy flawlessly. His character while strange is certainly believable and definitely likeable. He's like the visionary mystic friend I never had! Nicholas Cage is equally good as Al Birdy's more downtoearth lady's man friend. Their friendship seems unlikely on the outside but powerful and inevitable by the end of the movie.I think it's strange that some people didn't like the ending to Birdy. I think it's one of the best movie endings for a buddy film ever. It accurately reflects the tone of Birdy and Al's relationship more than any other ending possibly could. It ties their characters in the present in perfectly with the growingup characters of the flashback sequences. Perfect!".

This is what haunts a teenager's mind whose name is Birdy. This one devotes all his free time by inventing stratagems or ways so as to be able to fly in the sky. he also has an interest in birds' social life with their habits it's not a fate that his name is Birdy because there's the word bird in it. Even if he didn't win his best friend's adherence concerning these odd likings they succeeded in striking up a strong relationship.

Parker films this relationship with its joys its sorrows in a hearty way and make the two actors friendly. Birdy is also a wellregulated movie where Parker knows how to sustain the interest in the past sequences as well as present sequences Birdy's room hospital. Furthermore there's not a sequence where one of the two main actors is stealing to the other the spotlight. But the movie seems easy when it denounces the atrocities of war and its disastrous consequences on young people Cage's long monologue with Modine in his arms towards the end of the movie. These sorrowful consequences are concrete Cage's face full of bandages and abstract Modine has become dumb and stays immures in his silence. Nevertheless emotion prevails in the end and you sympathize to the two teenagers' helpless after the war. A beautiful movie and the revelation of two great actors".

He and his friend Al are sent to fight in Vietnam but are shipped back with both physical and mental wounds. As Birdy withdraws into a silent catatonia can Al bring him out of his dream world ?Based on a book by William Wharton this tender character study of friendship madness and the haunting effects of war is extremely well written and directed and beautifully played by the two leads. How much you empathise with Birdy depends very much on your experiences I guess but I find his devotion to learning to fly and his bewilderment at many of the ridiculous qualities of people very easy to identify with. He is a lunatic in the pure sense that as his obsession deepens the gulf between reality and his dreams doesn't matter to him but he's a welladjusted lunatic who understands other people but simply isn't interested in behaving like them. His concept that birds fly more through selfconfidence and a respect for the properties of air as opposed to more mundane issues like weight and velocity is incredibly seductive and thoughtprovoking. The movie really makes you think about the damage society does to people both on an everyday suburban level Birdy's mother Al's father and a historicalglobal level the horrors of combat. If it has a flaw it's that the lengthy scenes in the military sanitarium are grey talky and inevitably onesided in sharp contrast to the vivid sliceoflife sections in Philly all of which are full of humour and pathos the doghunting sequence is particularly gleeful and horrible. Overall however it's extraordinarily beautiful  Michael Seresin's photography is haunting and absorbing lingering over dark blue spaces and dirty backyards or soaring skyward as Birdy escapes into his fantasies. Equally powerful is Peter Gabriel's brooding rich esoteric sequencer music which uniquely in film scoring history I think was culled reconceived and rerecorded from samples of songs from his previous two studio albums. The music lurks around every scene mewling and pulsing like some animated force providing a voice for Birdy's voiceless inner state. Cage and Modine are both excellent with a fine support cast and a great troupe of animal actors who duly receive prominent credits  this must be the only film to employ a stunt canary. There were a slew of 'Nam films made in the mideighties Hamburger Hill Platoon Gardens Of Stone and whilst this fits that category it's about much more than just what's now referred to as posttraumatic stress disorder. It's about searching for an escape from everything a point of view which brings extreme clarity and which noone else can attain. A fine drama.".

Modine brings a gentle sensibility to the title role of a bird lover so traumatized that he no longer speaks or acknowledges anyone. In what was at the time his biggest role Cage is dynamic as Birdy's friend displaying a volatile combination of empathy and anger. There are some very funny moments such as Birdy's awkward prom date.

I had no idea what the movie was about and therefore had no preconceptions which I believe is the best way to go into a movie  especially a good one! What I saw was incredible. The fact that Nicolas Cage had virtually his entire face bandaged through the current scenes of the film and yet could still evince the feelings of a man suffering with postwar trauma said a great deal about his acting prowess. What really moved me about Birdy was its atmospheric quality. From the Brooklyn mean streets where the boys grew up to the asylum to the first person view of Birdy's pet parakeet Alan Parker's direction filled these experiences with life and verve. Of course combine this with a Peter Gabriel soundtrack that was both familiar and alien to the Peter Gabriel fan and you have one excellent film.".

Their parents the police the dogcatcherbutcher and finally the army all trying to use or control them in some way. Each finds a way to escape the pressures Cage by immersing himself in typical boyish pursuits like weightlifting and girls and Modine in his fantasies of flight a typical metaphor for freedom. For Modine the inability to fit into the predefined roles becomes so overwhelming that the lines between fantasy and reality blur.In the end they find that the only real way they've coped so far is to draw strength from each other to say screw the world and grab a few precious moments of shared insanity and freedom liberating the dogs attempting to fly using manmade wings and a bicycle and of course the final scene.All in all a touching and funny movie who's message is sometimes lost on people.

The leading line is a story about perfect friendship of a pair of opposites and this friendship seems so weird to me because of a great contrast between 2 different persons but maybe it is attraction of opposites there. But this story is only general background for unveiling such global problems an individual and society and their conflicts the meaning of dreams for human freedom humanity types of love human faith and one of the key ideas about People need each other homo homini amicus est. I don't like making a distinction between Birdy and El as introvert and extrovert or a man with poor in spirit and a man with a willing spirit cause both sides had fears and were weakling thinking that they would run away. Nicolas Cage's character was trying to escape from himself Matthew Modine's character wanted to shelter from a cold reality under his solitary shell. Unfortunately they both were egregiously wrong that's why I reckon that no one was mentally stronger and consequently they were in need of support from each other. Towards the end of the movie it becomes more and more depressive  Cage's final monologue is totally hopeless 2 crazy men having no way out. However the final scene so purifies that you will be feeling a huge relief after all despite a constant exertion throughout the ending. There's nothing to say about brilliant playing of Modine and Cage  they did awesome work really young geniuses. The Alan Parker's movie is a kind of trip from highstate dreams into the core of the hell called life sometimes .".

	schema:reviewBody "Birdy is one of my favorite films from the 80's one that slipped mostly unnoticed as far as award recognition goes. Though it has a lot of the 80's feel in it especially in Peter Gabriel's wonderful soundtrack it aged far less than many films of its time and while it plays around with various clichs it refuses to go all the way with any of them and so manages to be fresh and surprising even now.A lot of that originality may be missed when referring to Birdy as a war film or a story about PTSD. The film follows two friends and Vietnam vets before and after the wars through intersecting flashbacks  a familiar tool in war films. But this time the flashbacks are as important as the scenes taking place in the present the war experience surprisingly is only one example  maybe the ultimate one  of society bringing down people that live on its fringes which is what Birdy is all about. It's a buddy film a psychological drama a social critique a film about friendship and madness and nonconformism and maybe a comingofage story or a notcoming of age story but war plays a much smaller part than might seem at first and wisely 'Nam flashbacks which we've seen so many of in so many films are few and saved till the very end.Special attention should go to the two lead actors  Nicholas Cage and Matthew Modine both in the very early stages of their careers and both supplying one of the definitive performances of their careers in Modine's case probably the peak of his career. They create real full flawed characters aided by Alan Parker's sensitive directorial work and by poetic beautiful cinematography. The film deals with some difficult and very dark questions but it manages to keep the audience interested and even entertained without compromising its message. The 80's feel does popup every now and then and some of the flashbacks to the 50's and early 60's rely too heavily on welltried clichs of period films most jarringly the use of La Bamba and other hits of the time period in certain scenes clashing with the beautiful score. But all those little flaws don't make Birdy anything less than a classic.".

The ending could have been worse Spoilers I actually liked that Birdy didn't fly to his death even though that would have been a rather fitting way to end the character it would have been depressing and just made the movie seem like an even bigger waste of time. End SpoilersMainly this movie annoyed and bored me. I was unable to relate to much of anything. Certain animal scenes disturbed and troubled me. I don't feel there is much point to this movie.

It is amazing how Omar Sharif was a great actor in the 1960's. The story has war mystery crime romance drama and thriller in right doses. Further the character of Omar Sharif as an ethic man who believes and pursues justice no matter the price is exciting.  The reconstitution of the period is also fantastic specially the scene of the madness of General Tanz in a block of Warsaw when he burns and destroys many buildings.

	schema:reviewBody "Well if nothing else we can agree that they don't make 'em like this any more. A cast of superprestigious actors including a reunion of Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif from Lawrence of Arabia is employed in a huge unwieldy Europudding of a production about Nazis murderers and a Nazi murderer.This isn't an easy movie to summarize since there are at least three major plotlines going on at the same time. In one someone is killing prostitutes in occupied Warsaw and Paris and Omar thinks the murderer is one of three leading Wehrmacht generals. In the second plot various highranking officers are conspiring to overthrow Hitler and bring the war to an end. And in a third plot Tom Courtenay's corporal is getting very close to the daughter of Charles Gray's untrustworthy General Gabler.All three plots intersect sort of but I can't help wishing that someone had made up their mind just what sort of movie they wanted to make and stuck with it rather than trying to make three at once. Courtenay's romantic subplot is entirely redundant and should have been cut out completely thus shortening the movie to a manageable two hours or so. And was there really any need for Christopher Plummer to saunter on in a minuscule cameo as Rommel? His appearance adds nothing to the story and the only reason for him being here at all was presumably in order to employ every great British actor alive at the time. I'm only surprised that Laurence Olivier didn't turn up as Goebbels or Himmler or someone.And yet despite the bloat despite the stunt casting despite the fact that Philippe Noiret is more wooden than the Black Forest it works. I watched it for two and a half hours without getting bored and I loved a lot of things about it  the characters interact beautifully the tension in the conspiracy sequences builds up to nearunbearable levels and the look of the thing is sumptuous in the extreme. You really feel you're there with these people and you can't help but care about them and how the story comes out. In the end that's what movies are supposed to do isn't it? Night of the Generals is a long way from perfect but it just about forced me to like it.".

I watched it for two and a half hours without getting bored and I loved a lot of things about it  the characters interact beautifully the tension in the conspiracy sequences builds up to nearunbearable levels and the look of the thing is sumptuous in the extreme. You really feel you're there with these people and you can't help but care about them and how the story comes out. In the end that's what movies are supposed to do isn't it? Night of the Generals is a long way from perfect but it just about forced me to like it.";

I do however understand why it's there  it's because by attaching the good German generals to the plot of killing Hitler they let the audience not feel bad for rooting for them. Simple trick but all in all detrimental to the momentum of the story.The film is brimming with exceptional acting  O'Toole turns in a particularly vicious and strong performance as General Tanz but everyone holds their own. It's rare to find a villain so distasteful and yet so intriguing  most filmmakers just content themselves with giving the villain an evil shtick without much character development  not so here.I saw a newly mastered DVD in full 2.351 widescreen presentation and the the cinematography by the late Henri Decae is wonderful in all its glory.Very interesting movie please see it.".

An eyewitness who caught a glimpse of the perpetrator through a crack in a door reveals that the killer wore grey trousers with a red stripe down the side  the uniform of a Wehrmact General. Grau quickly narrows the suspects down to three men whose whereabouts on the night in question cannot be accounted for.Having been aware of this film for many years I finally managed to catch a rare screening of it last night on British TV. Part of my curiosity to see it was due to the sheer weight of the cast Omar Sharif as Major Grau Peter O'Toole Donald Pleasence and Charles Gray as the Generals plus Christopher Plummer Tom Courtenay Philip Noiret Gordon Jackson John Gregson Harry Andrews Nigel Stock and Patrick Allen  phew! The film itself starts quite promisingly as a murder mystery and maintains the interest while based in Warsaw. It features an impressive sequence involving the flushing out of Polish Resistance fighters in the city. An interesting sidenote at this point is that the armour used here appeared to be either real Tiger tanks or pretty good replicas. This attention to detail was quite unusual for a film made in 1966. Usually contemporary armour was used in war films of this vintage  I'm thinking particularly of 'Battle Of The Bulge' 'The Bridge At Remagen' and even 'Patton'.However once the scene shifts to Paris in the summer of 1944 the film starts to lose focus meandering off on subplots about the Hitler assassination conspiracy and Tom Courtenay's character's love life. For long stretches Omar Sharif disappears altogether and the momentum is lost. Another distraction is the way the film jumps forward at intervals to the '60's where we find Philip Noiret's Policeman interviewing some of the secondary characters in an attempt to solve the mystery. But by this point the killer's identity has become all too clear.The film is by no means a total waste. It is in part an interesting study of German senior officers. The acting is good throughout and to see stalwarts of British war films like Harry Andrews and John Gregson playing Germans is both curious and original. The script is literate production design handsome and the 1.781 presentation on ITV3 gave a tantalising glimpse of how good Henri Decae's photography would look in it's full 2.351 Panavision frame. But overall I was left feeling that with tighter handling regarding the killer's identity and more emphasis on the central plot the film could have been a far more satisfying whole.".

One of the characters we've been following remarks that these damned Spaniards and Italians he now has working for him in his factory don't know how to make Volkswagons. Back to the occupation of Europe there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among some of the officers to eliminate Hitler a movement about which Major Grau Omar Sharif investigating the slaughter of a prostitute observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning. The French police officer who is helping him the eversympatico Philippe Noiret asks Major Grau why he is obsessed with tracking down the murderer of a whore in the midst of mass demise and Grau says he resents the murderer's thinking he can play God. Noiret asks And you can? Grau replies neatly My blasphemy is on a smaller more secular scale. Some of the dialog is pretty nifty. Omar Sheriff gives what may be his finest performance on film. He may have been all masculine in Lawrence of Arabia but here he is effete suggestive in the most delicate way of homosexuality. It's in the way he holds a cigarette the way he dances up a flight of stairs.The search for the murderer whose identity is stupefyingly obvious shortly into the picture provides a police procedural that forms the movie's spine or at any rate its notochord. There is even a romance that is not simply thrown in but is fairly well integrated into the plot and important to the outcome. The cast is good  and what a caste! Peter O'Toole has been criticized for repeating his neurotic tricks from Lawrence of Arabia but I didn't find it derivative at all. Lawrence was subtly mad. General Tanz is completely screamingly eyetwitchingly dripping with sweatly NUTS. There are two scenes in which Tanz enters a locked room to view decadent art. One of them is a self portrait of Van Gogh. In each scene Tanz and Vincent stare back at one another two psychotics and I know exactly who you are seems to be written all over Van Gogh's scowling face. Both times Tanz is overcome and seems to dissolve into a myoclonic fit. The novel by Hans Helmutt Kirst was a lot funnier than the movie taking advantage of every opportunity to poke fun at German military precision. But there are still amusing incidents left in the film. When Grau meets Tanz at a fancy reception and begins to query him Tanz leans forward with an expression of distaste and asks Are you wearing PERFUME? Grau never flappable replies I use a rather strong cologne. I don't understand though why Tanz wears the uniform of a Wermacht general through most of the film then shows up at his last confrontation with Grau dressed as an SS officer. Maurice Jarre was writing effective scores in the late 60s. His crazy music sounds like an accompaniment to a marionette show that when one thinks about it isn't entirely inappropriate. The murderer meets his just end while sensibly drunk as a skunk in the novel but the story is fundamentally a tragic one. Too many deaths of good people. Too many lives ruined for nothing. What a shame the Hitler plot didn't work. It should ideally have been mounted back in 1938.".

I found the constant shift in emphasis to be irksome as the film didn't seem to know which setting it was focusing on. In addition the story about a German officer who investigates the murder of a prostitute in Nazi occupied Poland took a backseat to what was really a general look at army life amongst the Nazis. Peter O' Toole doesn't really take centre stage as he should have done. He is out of the film for many minutes at a time and that disappointed me. The same applies to Omar Sharif as the officer investigating the murder. Luckily the film does maintain my attention and interest thanks to a brilliant supporting cast. We have Tom Courtenay Donald Pleasence Charles Gray John Gregson Harry Andrews Christopher Plummer and others. Peter O' Toole  when he is in the film  gives an outstanding performance as the cold and ruthless killer in Night of the Generals. His blue eyes look almost piercing.

The who done it in wartime was a great plot touch. The color the psychology used with O'Toole's character of General Tanz gives the movie a touch of learned discourse. And murdering prostitutes gave it as close to SEX boobs and legs as could be done in 1966 when the film was lensed.  SPOILER  And here's where it makes the viewer hate it O'Toole literally kills the movie the audience and Sharif's Major Grau when he guns down Omar in a climatic confrontation and with about 20 minutes left for dates and viewers to squirm their seats. It was as if Holmes were torn apart by the Baskerville hounds on the moors. Sharif as Grau was everyman. He is even likable as a German pressed into wartime service because he was a policeman in civilian life and was needed for the war effort. Everybody loves the detective cop. But O'Toole simply dispassionately guns him down. It is a cheap shock for the audience but the act destroys the one person the viewer identified with. I mean there may have been a few fellows in 1967 Rio or Caracas who were pulling for the Generals but those guys were not the money paying target audience. Spend two hours building a character and then gun him down and the audience will hate the movie. They did and they still do. Well a guy who was an enlisted man in 1967 Vietnam said they showed this movie to the soldiers and it was sort of popular for the girlsthe sex killing and the fact a few generals sort of get it. This could be remade today. Throw out the bit about killing Hitler make it a straight psycho general with common hang ups and keep Grau ALIVE until after the war when he brings justice to Tanz and it would work. It could even work with some sort of anti moral twist ending such as Grau killing Tanz and keeping the cycle of violence open. But it CANNOT work with the hero figure murdered before the closing act. So great film if you like 1960s talent and faux psychology. If you like straight murder mysteries or simple crime plots  SKIP IT.".

	schema:headline " Murders within Murders within Murders";
	schema:reviewBody "When the novel THE NIGHT OF THE GENERALS by Hans Helmut Kirst was published in the 1960s it was a best seller. It has a very clever devilishly clever theme  when is a murder considered heinous? The plot is basically three levels or intertwined murder.1 The organized murder both normal and war crime of World War II as practiced by the Nazi German Government.2 The activities of a select band of German Generals led by Field Marshall Erwin Rommel to assassinate Adolf Hitler during a conference at Raustenburg in July 1944 seize the German Government and negotiate an end to the war with the British and Americans probably not with the Communist Russians.3 A series of apparently random prostitute killings across Europe first in Warsaw that appears to be linked to one of three leading German Generals General Kallenberg Donald Pleasance SeydlitzGabler Charles Gray and Tanz Peter O'Toole. The crimes are being investigated by Major Grau Omar Sharif who is as determined to solve this case as Inspector Javert was to capture Jean Valjean a century earlier.Now one can make a general statement and it has been seriously made that warfare is organized killing and murder and is no different from Jack the Ripper's activities which resembles the activities of the prostitute murderer here. Yet while abhorring or supposedly abhorring the Rippers Christies Mansons etc. in our society people do still glorify and reward the officers and soldiers of armed forces for the most part who serve their countries. Rommel for example by his eleventh hour switch to support the Stauffenburg bomb plot was technically committing treason  and was forced to commit suicide to protect his family from Hitler's full anger. But today the Desert Fox is one of the few Axis generals to be regarded as great by both sides for his abilities and a hero by both sides for his trying to get rid of a really evil madman. Yet that bomb plot actually killed two others in the bunker with Hitler who were closer to the bomb itself. Doesn't that even if we don't want to think it make Rommel an accessory to two murders? Rommel is no more blamed for the deaths of Allied and Axis soldiers in his battles in North Africa than say George Washington and Lord Cornwallis are blamed for deaths at Yorktown. Yet their plans and orders set things up for such deaths  but we tend to ignore these. If people are blamed for wars it is the civilians or governments heads who are usually blamed.And what happens with crimes that are government policy at the time. The issue is still cropping up in the U.S. actions in Afghanistan Pakistan and Iraq. With the Nazis you have the Holacaust and various battleground horrors i.e. the Malmedy Massacres during the Battle of the Bulge that are not considered normal if any warfare is normal actions in war. Are the soldiers involved in such activities true criminals or are they considered doing their duty. The answer depends on whether the country involved is willing to coverup for them and also successful in the war. Don't forget we live in a post Nazi defeat world. Had Hitler won the war criminals would have included Churchill F.D.R. and Eisenhower not Goering Hess and Von Ribbentrop. Survivors in Nazi controlled Europe no Jews or Slavs or Gypsies or Communists or enemies of the Nazis would have barely heard of the death camps and the Holacaust.Here Major Grau is determined to find which of his three suspects is the murderer of the prostitutes. He has followed them across Europe. Tanz is the most ideological of the generals  a favorite of the Fuhrer. We see him destroying a section of Warsaw presumably the ghetto while being questioned by Grau. Tanz looks disdainfully at the Major and remains in his tank during the interview looking downward at the Major. Kallenburg is the most secretive and mysterious of the three suspects  and we realize he is not as cooperative as he pretends to be. Seydlitz  Gabler is in a loveless marriage and seems to hide behind his aristocratic lineage. Grau does get some help from a French inspector Morand Philippe Noiret when the generals turn up in Paris. Morand actually makes some headway  he finds a crime being planned. But it is the bomb plot against Hitler. Grau hears this and laughs it off calling the plotters traitors which again makes us wonder when is a crime no longer a crime and a murder what it is supposed to be. Seydlitz  Gabler's daughter Ulrike Joanna Pettet is having a love affair with Corporal Hartmann Tom Courtenay. Her parents are not thrilled by her romance with this untitled nobody. Hartmann is assigned to chauffeur Tanz around Paris while he is on vacation there. They go to one of the forbidden museums of impressionistic art there and Tanz discovers a somewhat kindred spirit in Vincent Van Gogh's art style. In fact Tanz keeps returning to the museum day after day. Tanz's reaction to the paintings is one of the most effective moments of the movie. In the end the case cannot be solved in wartime  it requires 20 years for the solution to emerge.

	onyx:emotionText "When the novel THE NIGHT OF THE GENERALS by Hans Helmut Kirst was published in the 1960s it was a best seller. It has a very clever devilishly clever theme  when is a murder considered heinous? The plot is basically three levels or intertwined murder.1 The organized murder both normal and war crime of World War II as practiced by the Nazi German Government.2 The activities of a select band of German Generals led by Field Marshall Erwin Rommel to assassinate Adolf Hitler during a conference at Raustenburg in July 1944 seize the German Government and negotiate an end to the war with the British and Americans probably not with the Communist Russians.3 A series of apparently random prostitute killings across Europe first in Warsaw that appears to be linked to one of three leading German Generals General Kallenberg Donald Pleasance SeydlitzGabler Charles Gray and Tanz Peter O'Toole. The crimes are being investigated by Major Grau Omar Sharif who is as determined to solve this case as Inspector Javert was to capture Jean Valjean a century earlier.Now one can make a general statement and it has been seriously made that warfare is organized killing and murder and is no different from Jack the Ripper's activities which resembles the activities of the prostitute murderer here. Yet while abhorring or supposedly abhorring the Rippers Christies Mansons etc. in our society people do still glorify and reward the officers and soldiers of armed forces for the most part who serve their countries. Rommel for example by his eleventh hour switch to support the Stauffenburg bomb plot was technically committing treason  and was forced to commit suicide to protect his family from Hitler's full anger. But today the Desert Fox is one of the few Axis generals to be regarded as great by both sides for his abilities and a hero by both sides for his trying to get rid of a really evil madman. Yet that bomb plot actually killed two others in the bunker with Hitler who were closer to the bomb itself. Doesn't that even if we don't want to think it make Rommel an accessory to two murders? Rommel is no more blamed for the deaths of Allied and Axis soldiers in his battles in North Africa than say George Washington and Lord Cornwallis are blamed for deaths at Yorktown. Yet their plans and orders set things up for such deaths  but we tend to ignore these. If people are blamed for wars it is the civilians or governments heads who are usually blamed.And what happens with crimes that are government policy at the time. The issue is still cropping up in the U.S. actions in Afghanistan Pakistan and Iraq. With the Nazis you have the Holacaust and various battleground horrors i.e. the Malmedy Massacres during the Battle of the Bulge that are not considered normal if any warfare is normal actions in war. Are the soldiers involved in such activities true criminals or are they considered doing their duty. The answer depends on whether the country involved is willing to coverup for them and also successful in the war. Don't forget we live in a post Nazi defeat world. Had Hitler won the war criminals would have included Churchill F.D.R. and Eisenhower not Goering Hess and Von Ribbentrop. Survivors in Nazi controlled Europe no Jews or Slavs or Gypsies or Communists or enemies of the Nazis would have barely heard of the death camps and the Holacaust.Here Major Grau is determined to find which of his three suspects is the murderer of the prostitutes. He has followed them across Europe. Tanz is the most ideological of the generals  a favorite of the Fuhrer. We see him destroying a section of Warsaw presumably the ghetto while being questioned by Grau. Tanz looks disdainfully at the Major and remains in his tank during the interview looking downward at the Major. Kallenburg is the most secretive and mysterious of the three suspects  and we realize he is not as cooperative as he pretends to be. Seydlitz  Gabler is in a loveless marriage and seems to hide behind his aristocratic lineage. Grau does get some help from a French inspector Morand Philippe Noiret when the generals turn up in Paris. Morand actually makes some headway  he finds a crime being planned. But it is the bomb plot against Hitler. Grau hears this and laughs it off calling the plotters traitors which again makes us wonder when is a crime no longer a crime and a murder what it is supposed to be. Seydlitz  Gabler's daughter Ulrike Joanna Pettet is having a love affair with Corporal Hartmann Tom Courtenay. Her parents are not thrilled by her romance with this untitled nobody. Hartmann is assigned to chauffeur Tanz around Paris while he is on vacation there. They go to one of the forbidden museums of impressionistic art there and Tanz discovers a somewhat kindred spirit in Vincent Van Gogh's art style. In fact Tanz keeps returning to the museum day after day. Tanz's reaction to the paintings is one of the most effective moments of the movie. In the end the case cannot be solved in wartime  it requires 20 years for the solution to emerge. And although the audience does know who did it long before the conclusion the end of the film shows that the sometimes a sense of disgrace can be brought about by the type of killing one gets tangled with.";

	schema:reviewBody "Great acting from Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif a fascinating if overly complex plot and fine attention to detail make Night of the Generals a compelling film. O'Toole gives arguably the best take ever on a Nazi nutcase character.I agree with those who feel that the romance and Hitler assassination subplots weigh the movie down. The corporal's character has the necessary purpose of incriminating O'Toole's General Tanz not to mention highlighting Tanz's borderline comically obsessive behaviors but the girlfriend just gobbles up minutes without adding much interest. Also as interesting as the assassination plotattempt is it also ends up adding extra characters and scenes irrelevant to the main murder mystery. At first it seems that General Tanz is too obvious a suspect he's an habitual sadist. Torching whole blocks of Warsaw as an exercise while promising the local children candy is just the kind of Santa Clausfromhell persona that spells out sociopath. The other two generals depicted as more or less 'good Germans' are not nearly so interesting as Tanz. It might've been a better mystery if either Donald Pleasance's or Charles Gray's character had been the murderer. Surely O'Toole's Tanz could fill a whole toolshed with his personality disorders. Of course he's a murderer killing the three women was just a sideshow for him.What was an interesting matchup was Omar Sharif and Philippe Noiret their characters understood each other. In a way their shared interest in solving the murders shows ironically that there's more going on than the war more important things that involve the civilized world of the rule of law.The frame story set in contemporary 1965 times gives a bit more perspective and actually complements the main plot. Except for Tanz civilization has returned. It's strange that he survives twenty years imprisonment as a war criminal but can't deal with his capture as an ordinary murderer. Perhaps he's more afraid of losing status than losing his life.There's a lot going on here Night of the Generals is worth repeat viewings. Despite the piggybacking of plots great performances give us a memorable movie.".

	schema:headline " Veru unusual WWII movie  murder mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "Even more than some mid' 60s to early ' 70s ones this is a WWII film that plays around with all the rules. In the murder investigation it gives you a proHitler general who might not be the killer the detective is seeking and an antiHitler one who MIGHT be. And a third one who's a semicomical character. It's also full of surprisingly funny lines especially from the Donald Pleasance character of the understated kind  Do you really think anyone's going to believe you? Naturally. I'm a general.  Yes he wasn't a wholehearted soldier. I imagine he's deserted.  I'm shattered. What is the point of being a general when corporals wish to remain corporals? And of course it has Omar Sharif as Grau a genuinely admirable character even though he's too reckless about his own safety as in the last 1944 scene. And of course it's sort of left to the viewer as to whether he's right to be completely caught up in a single murder for two years of WWII itself. But as he himself says he's concerned with the small scale rather than the large. In the book Grau WAS more concerned with things like the plot against Hitler but I think the movie handled things in a more original way as in the scene where he and Morand discuss the subject for a few moments then Grau movies on to something else! And Philipe Noiret as Morand who doesn't care that Grau is a Wehrmacht officer any more than Grau cares that HE'S in the French Resistance not just because they're colleagues but because they're not just colleagues in a grudging way the way it is in many similar stories. In fact the scene I just mentioned ends with a sort of warm moment between Grau and Morand. And even though some people say that Peter O'Toole is miscast he really draws you completely into the Tanz character. In one scene Tanz even seems to enjoy perplexing Corporal Hartmann  he smiles slightly and says Any conclusions you may draw from my behavior are false. And every other actor in big or small parts seems to fit the character very well  Charles Gray Coral Brown Joanna Petit John Gregson Philp Noiret and of course Tom Courteney as Hartmann.".

She challenged sexual conventions and became a screen seductress like no other  not through the traditional devices of the femme fatale but rather through her bold kittenish innocence.This portrayal of innocence is largely what makes her performance both powerful and unique.  She's outrageously excessive and provocative but because she engenders such sympathy we cannot fail to identify with her. In a sense she seduces us as she seduces the men whom she encounters. That identification despite her destructiveness is much of what makes this film so compelling we love her despite ourselves.There are three films that permanently altered my sense of the power of the silent cinema  Sunrise Murnau The Passion of Joan of Arc Dreyer and this triumph.This film reaches the highest pinnacle of the cinematic experience it transforms the viewer through its indelible images and hypnotic captivation.I can only wish that the first time viewer has the pleasure of experiencing this film and Brooks' immortal performance in a theater with live accompaniment as I did at the Virginia Film Festival.".

She's outrageously excessive and provocative but because she engenders such sympathy we cannot fail to identify with her. In a sense she seduces us as she seduces the men whom she encounters. That identification despite her destructiveness is much of what makes this film so compelling we love her despite ourselves.There are three films that permanently altered my sense of the power of the silent cinema  Sunrise Murnau The Passion of Joan of Arc Dreyer and this triumph.This film reaches the highest pinnacle of the cinematic experience it transforms the viewer through its indelible images and hypnotic captivation.I can only wish that the first time viewer has the pleasure of experiencing this film and Brooks' immortal performance in a theater with live accompaniment as I did at the Virginia Film Festival.";

Rather despite portraying its characters in a largely unfavorable light it neither exploits them nor glorifies them.  These persons are shown simply to be what they are and while there is a certain inevitability about many of the things that befall them there is a thoughtfulness as well.

The Pandora's Box image for her character is appropriate in that Lulu is never illintentioned nor malicious and yet she often puts the other characters in difficult situations just by being who she is and acting naturally.  All of the other significant characters are defined largely in terms of their responses to her and relationships with her and all of the characters including Lulu have very evident faults and make some very preventable blunders.  The result is an unusual and very interesting movie.  Director G.W. Pabst deserves the credit most of all for creating the atmosphere putting everything together and making it work so well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the silent dramas of the '20s perhaps none is as compelling and inherently watchable as Pandora's Box of 1928. Amazingly despite its age and completely different cinematic conventions this G.W. Pabst picture continues to influence filmmakers worldwide. Made in Weimar Germany it stars Louise Brooks an American actress now considered the quintessential symbol of the flapper era. If not for her presence the film would probably never have its incredible durability and cult status. She is the inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's Mia Wallace in both personality and sheer appearance. For the source of that chic haircut look no further than Lulu the protofemme fatale played by Brooks. In a plot that could have come right out of a modern daytime talk show she manages to destroy the lives of virtually everyone who loves her. Lulu an aspiring actress is simultaneously involved with Dr. Schoen a prominent highsociety man and his son while being pursued by a lesbian admirer. To make matters worse she is supervised by a rather disgusting shady pimplike creature impersonating her father. And that's only the beginning. The girl's circumstances become even more bizarre as the action progresses. Obviously given such a juicy storyline the audience could well have been treated with a dose of laughable high camp. But Pabst through brilliant cinematography and incidentally silence manages to retain dignity and generate powerful emotions as opposed to sarcasm and mild amusement. Precisely because the characters do not speak we have an opportunity to witness their expressions and gestures. The camera spends much time on Brooks' face showing the wide range of her emotions from playfulness to rebellion to despair and back again. That face is one of the most versatile not to mention the most beautiful in the history of cinema. At the conclusion of the film's best scene as Dr. Schoen's fiancee catches him red handed in Lulu's dressing room her competitor slowly dismounts him with a momentary smirk full of hurt and disdain yet somehow ballsy and triumphant. Such precious and sophisticated details make Pandora's Box a masterpiece. The title itself is mentioned in an inevitable courtroom scene midway through the story by a prosecutor who crudely accuses the girl of being the root of all evil. This is where the film's sociological implications make it stand out from many of its contempories. Louise does not portray a conniving temptress. On the contrary the people around her fall prey to their inhibitions delusions and obsessions. Essentially she is only an indirect cause of their demise and never fully responsible. Lulu's representation as a victim of nothing but her own zest for love and life in a stagnant repressive society is an example of humanist cinema at its finest. Brooks' personal life was no less turbulent than her character's after a potentially prosperous career and scores of lovers from Chaplin to Pabst himself she quit the business refusing to cooperate with its humiliating limitations and rigid standards. Fortunately for us her name has been immortalized in an impeccable movie.".

So I was very surprised at and fascinated with the naturalism of G. W.

Pabst's direction is essentially modern even without the use of sound. While sometimes the direction and acting in even Caligari and Metropolis provoke laughter from the bemused audiencePandora's Box holds the viewer spellbound and its not infrequent humor is intentional.      Like other German Expressionist silent films Pandora's Box has a dark message. From the beginning however it is far less stylized and the settings look like they might actually have existed in the 1920's instead of only in someone's dream world. Nevertheless the film makes excellent use of Expressionistic lighting and chiaroscuro which highlights the visions of fruitless and immoral frivolity desperate gambling and unhealthy sexuality.   Altogether this film is beautiful and absorbing and even if nothing else it should not be missed for Louise Brooks' superb performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film with a great weight of expectation which was crushed by the rather more pedestrian reality. It remains famous chiefly on account of its reputation as a great film stoked by Kenneth Tynan's famous New Yorker article of 1979. However it is not great only very good.To begin with it is rather too long  it could have lost thirty minutes or so with little ill effect. It also suffers because the relationship between Lulu Louise Brooks and the two main male characters Fritz Kortner as the elder Schon the press baron and Franz Lederer as his son lacks real feeling. Not long after her sensational trial  where Lulu poses to great effect she winds up in London's East End. I found this coda really rather bizarre and perhaps inadequate. There is only perdition and no redemption to be found in the flop house to which she has condemned herself. Of course G. W. Pabst was to revisit Limehouse Stepney and Whitechapel in Brecht's Beggar's Opera. I haven't read Frank Wedekind's two sensationalist Lulu plays so I don't know whether the screen version is faithful to the original story. The plays Erdgeist  1895 and Die Buchse der Pandora  1902 scandalised Europe and were for a long time even after 1918 only known by reputation. They had the effect of branding Wedekind as 'the least popular major dramatist of the twentieth century' as Thomas Mann put it.Everyone performs well particular mention should be made of Lulu's 'father'  probably pimp  a brilliantly vile and sordid Carl Gotz as Schigolch. The production values are exemplary and photography in customary expressionist mode is as fine as we have come to expect from German films of this era  by Gunther Krampf.Brooks snubbed Paramount's B. P. Schulberg when her adviser George Marshall not the general told her that she could get 1000 a week with Pabst as opposed to the 750 that Paramount were offering. Unbeknownst to her Marshall had received an offer from the great Flo Ziegfeld for a lead part in Show Girl. Marshall sent the Follies a letter of refusal from Brooks which Brooks had never seen or written. Ziegfeld never forgave Brooks this refusal and handed the part to Ruby Keeler.Marlene Dietrich desired the part of Lulu but Pabst felt she wasn't right Dietrich was too old and too obvious. One sexy look and the picture would become a burlesque. I think this was right. Brooks has just the right combination of fauxnaive innocence and shameless promiscuity. Dietrich looks as though she has been round the block a little too often. Dietrich who was enraged by the refusal was also too well known in Germany whereas Pabst and NeroFilm could engineer a massive publicity campaign on Brooks' behalf because she was said to be a great American star who hardly anyone had heard of in Europe and was the Acme edition of a stateside flapper. The market for Dietrich was already saturated. In fact the market for Brooks would become saturated pretty quickly as well. Pandora's Box bumped along in Germany and failed to do well elsewhere. Brooks' career in Europe was destined to be brief.".

It is often called intoxicating and shimmering and people get this impression of it because of its light.A colourful cast of decadent misfits accompany showgirl and prostitute Lulu Louise Brooks who has an incredibly charismatic presence was forever nicknamed Lulu after this role in her major misadventure her love for a married man which is what opens pandora's box in this tale. Each character has such a wonderfully suggestive face due to the way they are lit. And they are all introduced really well so that they have a really distinct character and you remember all of them. Each character has a distinctive persona which borders on caricature. Most of the band of misfits seem like broad comedy characters but then they turn around and surprise you with a serious moment. Note beware music which is not Timothy Brock's scoreUnfortunately the art gallery who were playing it were playing it at sound speed which is way too fast and almost makes farce of what was dark comictragic action  and it had the single worst attempt at capturing the mood of a silent movie in music. Timothy Brock The Last Laugh Sunrise has done a score for this one and i expected to here that since Brock has a real feel for silents and writes incredible moody scores  but instead I was presented with a cliched piece of utter garbage which patronised every subtle element of this movie. I had trouble ignoring the music  but i did constantly feel like the action onscreen was not well summarisedgeneralised by the happysad plonking of the piano accompaniment which pulled out of its hat every cliche tune to characterise a mood you ever heard.

Hollywood probably took this up from Dietrich's persona in another German film Blue Angel from the following year the heartless diva who presents herself in a way that will satisfy her capricious whims.This is different though and it is more stunning for this the trick being that we see the world from the eyes of an innocent woman as she becomes shaped into a femme fatale.

Film noir as we came to know it was about all these desperate efforts.It is still however film noir in the most incisive essential way. Dual worlds linked by the turning of karmic wheels from inside a cheerful innocent woman who we know to be basically good and trying to live life but who at the same time appears provocative alluring exuding sex and therefore by her very nature by the fact that she is the person she was born to be seems to lull men into the kind of stupor where they can dream only her a dream so intoxicating that in turn traps her in her image. The result is that she inhabits a different world than she weaves around her and almost without exception it's the jerk from one world to the other that yields the anxieties  from the private to the public where a person is no longer himself but only the sum total of other peoples' views and so an object of collective scrutiny or as in our case sexual paroxysm.So from her end life as a series of spontaneous often inexplicable 'nows' but which we understand to be structured around her and unwittingly powered by herself. But from the other end life organized and from their own ends again seemingly spontaneous with the sole intent of having her. Men suddenly crave her  they don't know why she doesn't  and will do anything but who she also provokes without realizing by simply being herself.This dual perspective that reverberates across the film as much about the woman herself as both temptress and angelic swan she can fit in both these roles as well as she actively pursues them as about the swarm of men who surround her at first pretending moral uprightness but finally more or less powerless before her charms is ingeniously rendered in two scenes in particular.The first is set at the courthouse where she's at trial for murder upon being pronounced guilty her admirers quickly stage a commotion by setting off a fire alarm that allows them to extricate her. From the outside a chance emergency the crowd dashing clamoring pushing for the exit and from her end as well unwitting dumbfounded in the middle of all this crowd being carried outside but which we know was all orchestrated by the men who'd like to have her. Of course the fire alarm is about the fires of desire.The other is at a bar or gambling house where she has fled and is hiding for safety. A reward out on her name various parties conspire to exploit the situation for a quick dime. Here it is she who is spinning the most dazzling web of deceit  now improvising the role of the femme fatale on the spot but out of pressing need. The most revealing game concocted by her she petitions a man to gamble for her fortunes on a card table. He is winning but of course is revealed that he was cheating all along.It ends with all these lives finally released from the grip of the karmic energies that have clasped them so tightly the self instructed destinies each according to his own decree. The man who wishes he could eat Christmas pudding one more time gets to.Pabst orchestrates the finale as a dance of symbolic gestures the most symbolic perhaps being that the woman had a heart of gold all along.

The fact that it has a female lead certainly separates it from the classic Expressionist works. And shadowing and landscape techniques are much more modernized reflecting Weimar's embrace of technology and immersion into consumer culture. Even today there are few female actors that represent such a powerful will and dominant presence as Louise Brooks did in her masterful performance. The film was not very popular at its time of production and I wonder how much that has to do with this strong female presence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pandora's Box is a 1929 German silent film about the life of Lulu a beautiful lively gregarious but opportunistic and manipulative woman who gets everything she wants with her seductive charms. Her life takes a positive turn at first when one of her lovers' a wealthy editor in chief Mr Schon agrees to marry her and she is able to break into show biz. But after she kills Mr. Schon in retaliation her life disintegrates till she is reduced to go back to her old profession as a streetwalker.  A lot many viewers today regard Louise Brooks' uncanny performance as bold uncompromising and naturalistic. However in 1929 soon after the film's release a reviewer from New York Times had said that her expressions were 'hard to decipher at times'. After watching the film twice in two days I too had similar question about Brook's character Lulu what is her ultimate aim? Sometimes we find her confident and heedless of her actions but at others she radiates warmth and sympathy which contradicts her former emotions.  Take Lulu's relationship with Mr. Schon for instance. At the stage show in Act 3 Ludwig Schon along with his fianc oversee the backstage happenings. When Lulu finds her lover with his fianc she flips out. The camera pans on her face and she genuinely seems heartbroken in that frame. That act made me believe Lulu despite her promiscuity and love for money truly loved the rich editor in chief. But during act 4 and especially in Act 5 after the ruckus in the courtroom scene I found myself confused about Lulu's character. I remember Natasha's character from War and Peace who took some reckless decisions driven by instinct but that character despite being unpredictable at least had consistency. Therefore we could anticipate to an extent what she might do and become more curious about the situation. I could not say the same about Lulu at points in the film and this may be partly attributed to the fact that the movie is silent and therefore doesn't have rather advantage of dialogs.Had there been dialogs I would've probably got a better insight into Lulu's personality. But I should credit Brooks for giving her best shot and making her character starkly different and almost contemporary for that time her killer looks are something to die for seriously.  I also didn't find some cohesiveness in the storytelling as well. Gustav Diessl's character a brutal motif serving as a resolution to Lulu's life should've got more screen time. In fact I was under the impression she would ditch Alva the son of Late Schon and Lulu's hapless lover and make off with that waiter whom she was flirting for a moment at the 'hospitable and discreet' gambling den. I also felt the character of Schigolch could have had more development it was ironical when Lulu ends up at a garret  she had mentioned before that she wouldn't want to go back with Schigolch to his old garret but the initial scene when Lulu danced as Schigolch played his mouth organ could've been brought back towards the end  like showing Lulu putting on an entertaining act along with Schigolch on the streets trying to fetch some money or attracting some bawdy men perhaps. For some reason the initial unimportant scenes though entertaining enough are unnecessarily stretched. For example when Lulu refuses to perform the skit the director could've showed her running straight into the property room instead of having Schon coming to her pressing her arm in front of the crew and ordering her to perform ending with Lulu telling Rodrigo that they'd do the skit they had planned before getting into the room with Schon.The film's take on lesbianism is praiseworthy and Alice Roberts deserves credit for not shying away from the role. In fact I heard she had pitched the idea of making the character of Countess Augusta a lesbian. She displays her affection so naturally understanding the essence of her role. I remember an episode from the reality show Top Chef when one of the female contestants was highly appreciative of a fellow lady contender and was extremely upset when the latter was eliminated. It was later told during the reunion episode that the two women had pursued a relationship after the show. And I saw the same behavior from Roberts' character  two thumbs up for her performance.Even though chiaroscuro is heavily used to the point that sometimes characters lose their facial features I didn't think there was any purpose to the lighting whereasin movies like Citizen Kane the lighting created depth style and personality. The background music is flat and for most part inconsequential and the reason I could not find a connection with the film could be attributed to this element it seemed to say 'watch the film like you watch any other film and when the movie finishes you leave'. For a movie that included controversial subjects couldn't the background music be more radical and risky instead of a generic orchestra? Pandora's Box seems to have gained critical acclaim over the years. But apart from Louise Brooks' risky performance and the fact that controversial subjects were tackled I did not know what I was supposed to feel after the movie. Is Pandora's Box really worth the curious peek or is it just an empty box?".

This is a silent film worth seeing.The myth of Pandora is heartbreaking and this movie actually follows it rather closely. Louise Brooks plays Lulu a rather naive prostitute beloved of Professor Schon. Dr. Schon is engaged to a proper lady but he cannot escape the lure of Lulu. He marries Lulu but he cannot control her and she continues her erotic behavior with others. In a rage he attacks her she struggles she kills him. She is convicted for the crime but escapes before she goes to prison. She has seduced Dr. Schon's son Alwa who takes her away.For her escape they go to other countries and Alwa's money is soon exhausted. Thus begins the spiral into sordid tragedy. Lulu supports Alwa and her pimp by prostituting herself again. Eventually Alwa sinks so low he comes to himself and leaves her as she takes a john to their room. At least Alwa ends up better off than Professor Rath in The Blue Angel. Ironically the lover is Jack the Ripper who murders Lulu  a circumstance of which Alwa remains oblivious as he walks away down the street. He has given up everything he had for the love of her. She has lost her life another prostitute victim of a serial killer. Perhaps there is hope for Alwa. Or maybe not. Who knows what's left in Pandora's Box as the curtain is drawn on Alwa's wretched life?The direction is fabulous. G.W. Pabst was at the height of his talent in 1930 and this movie shows it. All the actors were topnotch Fritz Kortner as Professor Schon Francis Lederer as Alwa and Carl Goetz as the scummy Schigolch the pimp who pretends to be her father. Louise Brooks is one of the most beautiful women of the 20th Century and her acting here is flawless natural. Her power over Schon and his son flows from her face and her body. This film may be the first to show a lesbian relationship between two women Lulu and Countess Anna and the version I saw was missing the scenes that show the end of their relationship leaving a puzzling gap in the story line.It's interesting to contrast this movie with The Blue Angel with Marlena Dietrich as Lola. Dietrich steals the show of course with her iconic characterization of the woman of easy virtue but Lola is never a person we sympathize with. Lulu on the other hand has our feelings from the beginning. Lulu is much more complex than Lola and Brooks inhabits the role completely. Dietrich inhabits Lola too of course  but Lola has no heart.Prometheus brought mortal men fire making them more nearly like gods. To punish Prometheus the gods created Pandora the first woman. Each god gave her a virtue which she was made to carry to Prometheus in a box. I understand that Pandora means all gifts. Prometheus which means foresight wary of women bearing gifts from the gods sent her away and he changed all those virtues into evils. Prometheus's brother Epimetheus hindsight fell in love with her Prometheus forbade Pandora and him ever to open the box but curiosity overcame her. And when she opened the box all evils were loosed upon the world leaving her and mankind with only hope in the box. There are other similar stories about a woman loosing evil upon the world because she failed to follow her instructions.Interestingly the costumes are current for 1929 the year of the movie and not the times of Jack the Ripper. In this regard it is similar to Mating Call a Twenties film set before the time of its making but showing flappers in all their glory.".

This film is probably the most famous film including Louise Brooks in collaboration with German director Pabst. Anyway this film is done at a time in Germany before Hitler's rise to power and the second World War. The film itself is always worth viewing because the story of Pandora's Box is about Louise Brooks' character and the fate that awaits her.

This film is probably the most famous film including Louise Brooks in collaboration with German director Pabst. Anyway this film is done at a time in Germany before Hitler's rise to power and the second World War. The film itself is always worth viewing because the story of Pandora's Box is about Louise Brooks' character and the fate that awaits her.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most forgotten actresses has slowly but surely emerged from being only known for her famous black bob to one of the most naturalistic performers of all time. Louise Brooks the actress who had started out as a dancer and evolved into the quintessential flapper of the Jazz Age probably didn't enjoy the smashing enduring success that other flappers including Joan Crawford did and mysteriously her silky throaty voice was deemed unsuitable for talkies but like many actors who at their time were considered too hot to handle she's enjoyed a tentative reevaluation of her career to the point that now she's considered a formidable actress whose career was cut short by her own strong personality.PANDORA'S BOX is a revolutionary movie that even when it looks tame it's not. Choosing not to exploit as more erotic dramas of today have done it's focused on the effect Lulu brings to the people around her. She's this magnet of sensual energy that may not be completely conscious of her own carnality until one scene when she smirks at the son of the man she's seduced smashes any possible innocence she could have had. Then again Lulu has always been a synonym of dangerous females and here she's no less moving from disaster to disaster and emerging unscathed she is a femme fatale full steam ahead. She has it all over every other femme fatale that film noir brought into life. Not Phyllis Dietrichson not Kathie Moffat not even Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Lulu has it all is all. Lulu escapes conviction tantalizes another woman Alice Roberts in what may be the first lesbian character on film and meets her match in none other than Jack the Ripper a handsome Gustav Dissel who as a male phallic symbol is the only one who winds up smothering this uncontrollable ball of fire that she is.Lulu's fate is relevant in more ways than the obvious because this is a PreCode movie made in the more tolerant Europe. It's almost as if Lulu's death on camera seen in her beseeching hand as Dissel strangles her would come to represent a lot more than just a character's expiring. On a parallel level Louise Brooks career would also come to a crashing end shortly after the Depression would take over talkies would be the way of cinema from the year of this movie's release on and the Jazz Age would be no more. It's for this reason that PANDORA'S BOX is a time capsule of sorts a way of revisiting a time when rampant amoral hedonism was the order of the day. Watching an older Louise Brooks talk about this movie and her own career I get the hint that even while she may have been as talented as she obviously points at her fate as Lulu's was preordained but crucial only as to serve as a step to the modernization of woman in general.As an endnote I saw this movie last Wednesday evening at the Film Forum and I have to note Steven Sterner's fantastic kinetic score playing live to the action in PANDORA'S BOX. His is also a conscious guest star whose presence manages to bring forth the minute details of Louise Brooks' performance and the highs and lows of the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen the highly edited 180 minute version of Ludwig available in the US. However I am lucky enough to have seen the full 4 hour and 7 minute version available on DVD in Germany. Alas there are no English subtitles or soundtracks but my mother is fluent in German and so I was able to get a line by line translation!And my GOD was it worth it. Although I felt it was a little slow in places I was utterly drawn in to Ludwig's world as the film progressed. I can't speak for the US video version but the full cut is divided into 5 parts. As each part comes and goes we are steadily immersed into the world of Ludwig II Helmut Berger in compelling form once more as he was in Visconti's The Damned 1969. Ludwig has often been dismissed as mad but this film really lets you identify and understand the tormented man's life. One cannot help being on the verge of tears in sympathy towards the end of Part IV when Ludwig is hiding in his absurdly decadent and expensive castle and Elisabeth Romy Schnieder tries to visit him. Wagner's Tristan und Isolde blazes on the soundtrack and he cannot bear to be seen by her in his state. He cries out her name repeatedly and sinks down on the ground. Some people have criticised Berger for being too melodramatic Helmut 'Ham'Berger one review once said but he is perfect in this role. Not only does he strongly resemble the original Ludwig but his acting is spoton for capturing Ludwig's romantic and highly emotional personality.This film deals with many themes that Visconti continually returned to in his career. It was made after his planned film based on Proust's epic masterpiece 'In Search of Lost Time' fell through and what wouldn't I give for Visconti to have made that film!! and might be seen to contain similar themes. There is decadence decay decline homosexuality and music. Not only is this film a fine study of historical events the 'wars of Unification' in 1866 and 18701 but also of art and music Ludwig's relationship with Wagner and the influence of Wagnerian art on his life and of Ludwig's own highlystrung personality.In short this is yet another Visconti masterpiece. It's a CRIME that noone has given this film a DVD release in its restored or even any other form in the US or the UK. The film was also filmed in English but no English soundtrack is available on the German DVD or subtitles. Again this is another example of Visconti's work being overlooked and ignored  the sound quality is also not what it could be the sound quality on the German track being DIABOLICAL as opposed to the good Italian track. This film TRULY deserves a proper DVD release  music direction acting and script are superb and this film deserves a far wider audience than it is allowed to receive. At least the German DVD is in the correct aspect ratio 2.35  1 as this film deserves to be seen in it's full glory sets  most the real locations  and costumes are utterly stunning. I urge anyone who reads this to see Ludwig  even if one must resort to a horribly cut VHS version how can you loose a whole HOUR from this film?!!. This is another Visconti masterpiece and cries out for a better and more widely available DVD release.".

	schema:reviewBody "This long and lavish biopic of the mad Mittel European monarch is both Luchino Visconti's grandest and  oddly enough  his most intimate and personal film. Visconti's autobiography in all but name it tells the story of a cultured aristocrat who ruins himself through an obsessive love of art luxury and handsome young men. The film paints King Ludwig as a wellmeaning but hapless victim of his grasping courtiers artists and lovers. If Visconti himself was an archmanipulator and a bit of a sadist well...Ludwig is one of those films where life and art never do quite match up.Most revealing is its portrayal of the aging king's obsession with a pretty but nonetootalented actor Joseph Kainz. It is tempting to view their romance as a mirror of Visconti's own passion for the exquisite Helmut Berger who  a twist within a twist  actually stars as King Ludwig in this film. In the roles he played without Visconti as his Svengali Berger is barely competent. In Ludwig as in The Damned he gives a staggering performance ranging from freshfaced idealism to homoerotic heartbreak to bloated waste.Shot just after the collapse of Visconti's longcherished film of Proust Ludwig is rich in characters who reflect whether consciously or not the gilded Belle Epoque monsters that haunt the pages of A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu. As the Empress Elisabeth of Austria poor Ludwig's magnetic but manipulative cousin Romy Schneider might just as well be playing the Duchesse de Guermantes. The opportunistic composer Richard Wagner Trevor Howard and his scheming wife Cosima Silvana Mangano stand in as the vulgar socialclimbing Verdurins. The king himself is a kindred spirit of the Baron de Charlus  a doomed aesthete who refined tastes are at odds with his sordid lovelife.With its majestic cast and flawless photography and design Ludwig has all the makings of a screen masterpiece. Alas it falters badly in its last hour  which depicts the bourgeois conspiracy that topples Ludwig from his throne. Perhaps Visconti who identified so closely with the mad monarch could not face up to the waning of his own powers. He suffered a crippling stroke after finishing this film and would never again attempt work on such a scale. Ludwig stands as a flawed testament  as a portrait of one enigma by another.".

	schema:headline " Masterful Journey Into Fairy Tale Eccentric's Mind";
	schema:reviewBody "Being offered something common no matter if it is a painting a musical bit a play or a movie one can praise it criticize it evaluate it according to some standards. Yet what happens if one encounters something elaborate something that knows no limits of standardized conventions something that follows no paths of shallow commonness? This seems to be the case with a few pearls of artistic cinema including LUDWIG 1972 by great aristocratdirector Luchino Visconti 19061975. As Visconti's most underrated work this is the film that I have owned for 5 years the film I have seen a considerable number of times yet the film I have found so hard to fully understand. Nevertheless a rhetorical question seemed to help me in such a lack of understanding is it possible to fully understand a human being is it possible to fully understand oneself? The similar idea appears to be hidden in this film.LUDWIG as it is well known tells the story of the 'eccentric' for some or 'fairy tale' for others king of Bavaria Ludwig II 18451886 who is now famous mostly among tourists who visit the elaborate almost dreamlike castles in the southern Land of Germany. While getting to know his psyche we realize that Ludwig was an extraordinary psyche someone filled with contradictions absorbed in struggling for the sublime beauty living seriously within the illusive walls of an unfulfilled reality. Meanwhile Ludwig with certain characteristics appeared to be 'much ahead of his time.' Visconti having deeply analyzed the phenomenon of that man not only develops these aspects but brings them back to life by means of three miracles on screen flawless direction breathtaking sets and talented cast.Although some people may detest Mr Berger for some opinions expressed in public we cannot deny the fact that the film owes much to him. Berger appears to give one of the most sublime performances in the leading role. He makes LUDWIG a genuine analysis a must see for all movie buffs by portraying a unique sophisticated man threatened by fears filled with dense emotions carnal pleasures suffering from the quest for the blissful and illusive reality an eccentric experiencing the storms of mind an artistdreamer gradually disillusioned by the mute world of contemporaries. How modern and yet how universal the character appears to be in his search for the individual world! All this is so well manifested that the viewer is not merely watching being an observer of the character's hard states of mind heshe is experiencing a slow perhaps sometimes tedious but exceptionally claustrophobic journey with the main character yet not so much the journey of tearjerking sweet compassion but something far more than this something revealed in the selfreflection. Berger and Visconti allow us to experience this journey into the mind of a human being that aims at being uncommon rather than decent. Gradually we are led into the strange world of the king and unexpectedly into the unknown perceptions that we ourselves own. We get to know Ludwig as the feminine moon rather than the masculine sun. He is not ready to make love to women because his feelings occur to be the personally peculiar inventions of his mind. Therefore he turns to homosexual pleasures being in this way a reflection of Visconti himself. Extraordinary images of lavish elegance subtle imagination throughout the film besides the aforementioned Berger's exceptional talent and Visconti's excellent direction help us in this journey.When we consider other performances Romy Schneider seems to be the other 'treasure' of the film...not as beautiful yet saccharine Sissi but as delicious disillusioned mature Empress Elizabeth. Her strongest point here is the cold attractiveness. She is the absolute female beauty the 'dove' Ludwig is impressed by yet a woman he finally does not let into his castle. Although I very much appreciate her role in Marischka's SISSI trilogy 1955 1956 1957 I must admit that here at last under the direction of great maestro whom she highly respected Romy was able to interpret Elizabeth in the accurate manner. She perfectly portrays a very independent yet contradictory character who is already aware of the fact that history forgets us and the bitter conclusion that the world does not care. Her appearances in the movie are astounding including her looks her acting and her wardrobe mostly black which is inspired by the later photos of the Kaiserin Von Oesterreich.The great performances are also given by the supporting cast in particular Trevor Howard as king Ludwig's idolcomposer Richard Wagner with his destructive manners extravagant nature yet powerful illusion resembled in 'a figure' so much glorified and appreciated within the mind of the king. I also liked Silvana Mangano as Cosima Wagner's wife whom he offers an unusual Christmas gift in the memorable scene...However it would be highly unjust to claim that only performance make the movie an elaborate cinematic production. It is much more it is foremost VISCONTI his unique style focused on single important details and the entire psychology of the character's development. Besides it is the clever script and authentic sets including Neuschweistein Castle Herrenchiemsee Bad Ischl etc. It is finally the musical score that appears to be beautifully fitted within particular scenes that one cannot omit. Therefore any shortened version does not make sense at all as Wolfram Schtte nicely put it 1975 referring to omissions Who has seen the film in Germany has in fact never seen it. Highly recommended movie and a must DVD release! 910Du Warst Ein Maerchenkoenig Die Freiheit Das War Dein Tron...Koenig Ludwig Wir Vergessen Dich Nicht you were a fairy tale king and freedom was your throne...king Ludwig we won't forget you. So says a German 'Lied' song by singer Bianca. Utopian as it may seem isn't that after all something we really don't forget?".

	onyx:emotionText "Being offered something common no matter if it is a painting a musical bit a play or a movie one can praise it criticize it evaluate it according to some standards. Yet what happens if one encounters something elaborate something that knows no limits of standardized conventions something that follows no paths of shallow commonness? This seems to be the case with a few pearls of artistic cinema including LUDWIG 1972 by great aristocratdirector Luchino Visconti 19061975. As Visconti's most underrated work this is the film that I have owned for 5 years the film I have seen a considerable number of times yet the film I have found so hard to fully understand. Nevertheless a rhetorical question seemed to help me in such a lack of understanding is it possible to fully understand a human being is it possible to fully understand oneself? The similar idea appears to be hidden in this film.LUDWIG as it is well known tells the story of the 'eccentric' for some or 'fairy tale' for others king of Bavaria Ludwig II 18451886 who is now famous mostly among tourists who visit the elaborate almost dreamlike castles in the southern Land of Germany. While getting to know his psyche we realize that Ludwig was an extraordinary psyche someone filled with contradictions absorbed in struggling for the sublime beauty living seriously within the illusive walls of an unfulfilled reality.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know whether to give it a 7 or an 8 so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and scored it 8. VERY nice film though somewhat longish about a very artistic but also paranoid ruler of the 19th century. The period settings seemed to me anyway authentic. For example it shows the interior glass lamps of the 1860s burning to produced light then showing how by the late 1880s these lamps being the electric lamps that we today are familiar with. Ludwig II was an early advocate of the use of electricity which was a new technology in his day and age. Other settings are definitely authentic to that day and age and it is interesting to see how people did things in the 19th century. Having said that it is unfortunate that medical technology was not then near as advanced as today. Ludwig could certainly have been treated successfully for his paranoia with some drugs that we have today but were not available then.Helmet Burger is simply speaking Ludwig. He very closely physically resembles the historical figure and I have no doubt that his behavior does also. One gets the nagging impression that Helmut Berger was the reincarnation of Ludwig!! Romy Schneider reprized her role as Empress Elizabeth of Austria at first with some trepidation then with tremendous enthusiasm. By the time filming ended she certainly felt that her portrayal as a more mature Sissy was the ideal role for her. In fact the only picture of herself in costume that she displayed in her apartment was of the role she played in this movie. The major problem with this movie and the reason why this film was never popular in the United States is that you have to know quite a lot of European 19th century history to really appreciate it. Until the advent of DVDs which gave one the opportunity to play and replay this movie at will and of online encyclopedias that allowed one to do some quick historical research most of the movie was probably unfathomable to most Americans. Today with the tools that I mentioned this movie can be appreciated by the average viewer. Watch out for the language problem in this movie it is certainly a little disconcerting at first as this movie has German actors in roles set in Germany speaking not German but rather Italian!".

BUT with LUDWIG it seems like there is just too much padding and dry scenes that could have either been excised or shortened. For example the first scene where we see Ludwig is when he is about to be crowned. Instead of simply showing the crowning we see the members of the delegation slowly enter the room and we see them wait for Ludwig while he gets dressed. Was this really necessary? Plus although too much of the bland is included there is a major omission that seems inexplicable. Ludwig was a homosexual and had a long series of sexual encounters followed by internal contrition and selfloathing. But none of this was directly dealt withonly very mildly implied. In fact although we know he was gay the movie instead implied that he was sexually attracted to his berfamous cousin Empress Elisabeth of AustriaHungary a VERY strange woman in real life who appears very normal in this movie. My assumption is that because the film was made in 1972 they were afraid to broach the issue of homosexuality but considering the emotional toll it took on Ludwig it seems dishonest to ignore it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being the final part of Italian director Luchino Visconti's German Trilogy which also including 1969's The Damned and 1971's Death in Venice. This film about the life and death of King Ludwig II Helmut Berger of Bavaria was very disappointing. Honestly I came out from watching the movie knowing the same things about the man when coming in. This movie doesn't seem to want to show anything new about the guy. Nor does it seems to wants to analyze the reallife character at all. Its skips and gloss over a lot of the most information parts of his life such as his childhood's relationship with his father Maximilian II his brother Prince Otto John Moulder Brown and Prince Paul. Not only that but the movie doesn't show why he was so obsess with composer Richard Wagner Trevor Howard and medieval German folk tales. It would be nice to hear more about Castle Hohenschwangau's history or see more of the Gothic Revival style with many frescoes of those heroic fantasy sagas like Tristan and Isolde. Maybe play more of Wagner's music in the background rather than walking around the castle in dead silence. I would love the movie to show how he was able to have a close friendship with the composer only to overstalk and praise him until his lost but the movie doesn't do that. It rarely focus on them at all. So you never get to see the true emotional depth of Ludwig's relationship with him. Another thing that really bug me about the film is how they don't show much of the AustroPrussian War. For a war that was a big deal of Bavaria's history you would think they would show some battle scenes. Sadly they do not. Instead they focus on the King hearing bad news from the front lines. You really can't tell how important these battles were by being in the sidelines. One thing the movie focus way too much of is the relationship he had with Empress Elisabeth of Austria Romy Schneider. While it's nice to see Romy Schneider reprises her role as the Empress Elisabeth from 1955's Sissi and its two sequels. In truth the reallife Elisabeth rarely was able to hang out with Ludwig due to her duties and standings in her own country. I get that the movie wants to establish that he loves Elisabeth more than Duchess Sophie Charlotte Sonia Petrovna but gees that far from accuracy. Ludwig did love Sophie and both were very entertained with each other. They were known to often make jokes with each other make poetic and had a deep interest in the arts but we rarely see that. Instead we get tiresome no chemistry shots of them walking around the castle rooms or going horseback riding in the pitch dark. It sucks because these parts takes most of bulk of the first 2 hours of the film. If they did show some chemistry maybe these scenes would be so boring. If anything save this movie from being a total drag. It would be the second half of the film. It's here where the movie gets good because it kinda show the signs of his so call madness. I love all the scenes with Ludwig and his protg Joseph Kainz Folker Bohnet because it shows how the king declines further in decay and resignation. Even if the events depict here are somewhat grotesquelystaged and almost out of sync incorrect emphasizing that Ludwig's indeed seem confusion and mentally ill. While it's clear that he's peculiar and irresponsible in truth the question of his clinical insanity remains unresolved even today. Another unresolved issue is the mystery of his own death. While I like the film love to show the conflict with his people it wasn't as dramatic as it shown in the film. In reallife Ludwig barely displayed any violent tendencies and although he had mentioned suicide he wasn't that suicidal. So I don't know where the film is getting that from. In reallife nobody knows if he was murder or suicide but the movie acts like he did commit suicide when clearly there is no prove of that. However it's pretty clear by historians that the majority of people around him also knew that he was a closet homosexual. Because of this I think this is where the movie fail to exploited. For a film about a notorious homosexual. The movie doesn't explore Ludwig's sexuality enough. You would think that the movie would show more of his relationship with the samesex. Instead Visconti's film became a romantic tragic primarily intended to arouse heterosexuals than homosexual because how much they focus on his lost on the relationship with women rather than with the men in his life. Because of this it made love story relationship seem so bland and generic. Rather than engaging for both sexes. Despite that I do like how the filmmakers were able to film at his reallife castle locations. It made the film seem so authentic. I have to give director Visconti props for that and also doing all the filmmaking even after suffering a stroke. I just wish the movie would be shorter. There was no need for this European cut film to be nearly 4 hours long. Even the English version is a hard watch with 3 hrs. It was so bloated and badly paced. Just way too much padding and dry scenes that could have either been excised or shortened. Nevertheless the movie's greatest pro is the acting. Everybody did alright however Berger appearance as Ludwig stands out. He was amazing. He was perfect for the part. Overall While this movie isn't as bad as directors Marie Noelle  Peter Sehr 2012's film 'Ludwig II or 1972's Ludwig Requiem for a Virgin King. It's extremely boring running time ruin what could had been a good epic film. Can't recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "For many many years I wanted to see this movie a film you never get to see on TV or at a Visconti retrospective at the NFT or one of the Curzon cinemas here in London. Perhaps it is so because this film has been so much underrated by critics and public that it drags far behind the director's most famous and praised works The Leopard Rocco La Terra Trema etc. I read in a biography of the director that Ludwig was a mammoth project that took four production companies from different countries to put up the budget it obsessed and consumed Visconti to the the extent of almost killing him when he suffered a stroke as a result of long working hours and too much mental strain went well over schedule and budget and finally was taken away from the author's hands by the producers and butchered and reedited in order to make it shorter simpler and more viably commercial. The result was a mess almost half of the length of the original and with a lot of key scenes missing presenting an inconsistent story full of plot holes and with characters appearing now and then from nowhere. It took several years after Visconti's death for his usual collaborators d'Amico Nanuzzi to gather the missing sequences and reedit the film into a cut as close to Visconti's idea as it could be. The result is a a DVD edition of 228 minutes. This movie visually speaking is with Death in Venice probably Visconti's most beautifullavish and rich in colours and small details. As to the story I agree with other viewers on the fact that it is a bit too overlong and it drags at places and some sequences could have been shorter without the plot missing anything. But then it seems like Visconti deliberately wanted to give it that sedate pacing in order to suit the dreamlike mental state of the protagonist during his reclusion in his castles and his lapses into his own fantasy world. In order to understand better Ludwig's personality I read one of his many biographies after watching the movie for the first time and then I watched it again and I could appreciate better Visconti's approach to the character. I think this is a movie worth of its director and even with its flaws and extreme length it deserves better criticism and appreciation than it unfairly got since it first came out in 1972.Helmut Berger is quite good here and has a remarkable resemblance to the real Ludwig Romy Schneider is as beautiful as ever and the real Bavarian locations are breathtaking. The night sequence with Ludwig and Elizabeth riding in the snowy forest in the moonlight is one of the most beautiful and romantic I have ever seen in film. The cinematography alone makes Ludwig worth watching if you like beautiful things. Hopefully this movie has gained some appreciation and seems to be getting better reviews nowadays that it did in the past. Many call it Visconti's lost masterpiece. Although I don't think it is one of his greatest works thematically speaking it surely stands among the most beautiful and lyrical and it is one of my favourite choices for a long winter evening.".

Perhaps that is how Ludwig imagines her when he sleeps at night. Sissi hates to be taken for granted she avoids family gettogethers and official engagements and makes her presence always a cherished unannounced surprise. She speaks loosely of sexual encounters with her grooms whilst encouraging a certain intimacy yet always maintains a distance from serious discourse or lovemaking. She is the worst nightmare of every man. Ludwig is stretched out on tenterhooks. The introductory scene is my favourite Sissi playing dressage in a circus ring delighting in the control of her horse her face lost amongst pastel lights a part of her life that encapsulates the whole of her life.Ludwig's relations or lack of relations with women during the film is crushingly sad. It seems finally a bewilderment with them that leads him into the arms of beings he can understand  men. Stricken and alone finally he even refuses to meet Sissi for once come not to tease and it made my heart break.With a government content to do without him Ludwig withdraws into a fantasia of his own rejecting materialism seeking to live beyond bestial factuality to transcend via the golden barque of the arts. Alongside several architectural commissions he also became a stream of golden coins flowing into the coffers of Richard Wagner who he set up in a house of unbelievable opulence and provided finance to for the building of the great opera house at Bayreuth and the staging of several operas. The scenes with Wagner become almost a film within a film although Ludwig appears the more extraordinary if only via an accident of birth.I was au fait with both the idea and the execution of Italian dialogue in the mouths of Germans however I was uneasy going into this movie that it would feel Italian. Luckily Visconti does manage to keep an authentic feel though one notable lapse for me is Count von Holnstein who the credits confirmed to me was played by an Italian Umberto Orsini. Holnstein is the minister who was largely responsible for orchestrating the downfall of Ludwig. In this movie Orsini's manner of speaking his delivery and facial expressions are quintessentially Italian even his lines have all the pomposity and false sincerity that Italian officialdom can muster. Only a quibble in a film that I felt like I was living.Quite an astounding experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lasting for more than four hours Luchino Visconti's Ludwig is an exhausting and unrelentingly gloomy film on the life of Bavarian king Ludwig II the Mad. There is interesting subject matter to work with here. Ludwig's mania for Wagnerian operas and then castles resulted in him bankrupting his kingdom. Then he was forced to abdicate and seek treatment in an insane asylum where he died along with his psychiatrist under mysterious circumstances. Nevertheless Visconti succeeds in making the life of Ludwig II Helmut Berger boring. A big reason for the film's problems are the overly long and slowmoving scenes of Ludwig II's coronation enigmatic conversations with Elizabeth of Austria Romy Schneider Richard Wagner and his operas the king's relationships with attractive males and so on  all meticulously detailed. You would be forgiven for thinking as I did that these overly long scenes were somehow important because otherwise what is the point of dedicating four hours to figuring out what is going on in this movie. Yet the film's details just accumulate rather than amount to any payoff. In fact a movie goer can arrive late miss the scenes with the coronation and Elizabeth of Austria and still get as much out of this movie as the person who sat in his seat for four hours. These scenes do not contribute to the plot and are only related in so far as they happen in the life of Ludwig. Ludwig also has scenes which seem unnecessary to the plot. Was it necessary to show that many Wagnerian operas or to show Wagner performing music for his mistress Cosima? Did we really need to know that Bavaria lost the war to Prussia when Visconti does not seem that interested in explaining what consequences this defeat had for Ludwig or Bavaria? Lastly there is also something very self indulgent about this depiction of Ludwig's life. Ludwig's obsession with building opera houses and then castles must have brought considerable hardship to his own people but this theme is never explored. Instead Visconti seems content to film Ludwig living in complete isolation of his people and getting swindled by favourites. The message of the film does not seem to be that Ludwig impoverished his people to satisfy his own obsessions even though such a message would be consistent with Visconti's Marxist beliefs but rather that living in damp castles is a lonely and depressing experience. It's obvious that Visconti tried to generate some sympathy for Ludwig but the problem is that the Bavarian king decided to make his own life miserable by indulging heavily in these obsessions in the first place. As a result it becomes impossible to identify with Ludwig or any of the other characters in this film. Like other Visconti films Ludwig also has truly beautiful visuals. Yet so what when the the story was not interesting enough to justify this fantastic cinematography? There are few people who can film a coronation scene as well as Visconti could but that does not change the fact that I do not want to watch a coronation that shows no sign of ever ending. There are few people who illustrate ostentatious luxury with the same meticulous detail as Visconti but watching Ludwig gradually deteriorate emotionally and physically in gilded prisons i.e. castles of his own making is not my idea of entertainment. What this movie required were film makers willing to make the tough choices about which scenes to keep and which to let go of long before the screenplay went into production.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ludwig is the final film in director Luchio Visconti's German Trilogy. But though it purports to be about Ludwig II the Mad King of Bavaria this mammoth film 4 hours long is far more interested in examining the nature of national idealism Visconti treating Ludwig II as a closeted homosexual whose private fantasy life must be suppressed and destroyed in order to preserve a Bavarian national fairy tale.And so rather than a powerful ruler Ludwig is portrayed as man ruled by others and constantly manipulated by myth makers. Moulded into an archetypal King straight out of a fairy tale Ludwig is forced into arranged marriages pressured into signing policies and is constantly belittled for showing no interest in women.To compensate for both his political impotency and his inability to give in to his sexual temptations Ludwig begins to passionately support the famous German composer Richard Wagner. He convinces himself that it is his primary purpose to bring culture to his people to enrich their souls through art but then gradually accepts that his support for Wagner is merely a form of self delusion. No great work will justify the lie he lives. No opera will supplant his caged desires.Ashamed of both his homosexuality and his fairy tale facade he's impotent as a king and impotent as a man he believes Ludwig becomes increasingly isolated. Paranoid and behaving more and more like a child he locks himself in a private castle gives orders to build ornate palaces indulges in whimsical pursuits has secret orgies with many hunky men and gradually begins to lose his mind. Worried that he may bankrupt the country various politicians and aristocrats plot to remove Ludwig from power. Sensing assassination Ludwig flees to a forest and commits suicide. Never before permitted a wild creature's freedom during the brief moments prior to his death Ludwig achieves some measure of independence. A bullet ends his bliss.Sex and nationalism often intersect in the works of Visconti. The Damned for example links the growth of Naziism to a crisis of masculinity. Here the masculine ideal comes under threat by feminism the literary and artistic AvantGarde socialism and sexual deviancy etc and so resorts to the fascist repression made possible by violent father figures all of whom repress sexual excess and transfer it instead to a kind of violent machismo. See too Visconti's Death in Venice in which homosexual longings represent a crisis in which the old Venice slowly decays unable to mate with new regimes.Ludwig does something similar. While Visctoni's The Leopard and Senso dealt with the unification of Italy Ludwig deals with the unification of Germany's states the infamous Otto Von Bismarck of Prussia defeating Bavaria and unifying it with other squabbling principalities in the name of a greater Germany. A new Germanic nation which it was promised would be able to organise industrially and administratively and so successfully enter the modern period. Ludwig's homosexuality is thus indicative of the passing of a monarchical system reliant upon hereditary and therefore compulsory heterosexuality. This is a common Visconti theme. As history ramps up toward industrial capitalism patriarchal systems based upon physical reproduction and genetic bloodlines have become outmoded and unstable leading to the formation of a new form of patriarchy to achieve stability. For Ludwig to express his desires even as a monarch means to regress from the social reality of the moment and only when his country has been subjugated by Prussia who offers to leave a token monarchy in place though the country is now officially ruled by other means can Ludwig act out his personal desires albeit in a limited fashion.

	onyx:emotionText "Ludwig is the final film in director Luchio Visconti's German Trilogy. But though it purports to be about Ludwig II the Mad King of Bavaria this mammoth film 4 hours long is far more interested in examining the nature of national idealism Visconti treating Ludwig II as a closeted homosexual whose private fantasy life must be suppressed and destroyed in order to preserve a Bavarian national fairy tale.And so rather than a powerful ruler Ludwig is portrayed as man ruled by others and constantly manipulated by myth makers. Moulded into an archetypal King straight out of a fairy tale Ludwig is forced into arranged marriages pressured into signing policies and is constantly belittled for showing no interest in women.To compensate for both his political impotency and his inability to give in to his sexual temptations Ludwig begins to passionately support the famous German composer Richard Wagner. He convinces himself that it is his primary purpose to bring culture to his people to enrich their souls through art but then gradually accepts that his support for Wagner is merely a form of self delusion. No great work will justify the lie he lives. No opera will supplant his caged desires.Ashamed of both his homosexuality and his fairy tale facade he's impotent as a king and impotent as a man he believes Ludwig becomes increasingly isolated. Paranoid and behaving more and more like a child he locks himself in a private castle gives orders to build ornate palaces indulges in whimsical pursuits has secret orgies with many hunky men and gradually begins to lose his mind. Worried that he may bankrupt the country various politicians and aristocrats plot to remove Ludwig from power. Sensing assassination Ludwig flees to a forest and commits suicide. Never before permitted a wild creature's freedom during the brief moments prior to his death Ludwig achieves some measure of independence. A bullet ends his bliss.Sex and nationalism often intersect in the works of Visconti. The Damned for example links the growth of Naziism to a crisis of masculinity. Here the masculine ideal comes under threat by feminism the literary and artistic AvantGarde socialism and sexual deviancy etc and so resorts to the fascist repression made possible by violent father figures all of whom repress sexual excess and transfer it instead to a kind of violent machismo. See too Visconti's Death in Venice in which homosexual longings represent a crisis in which the old Venice slowly decays unable to mate with new regimes.Ludwig does something similar. While Visctoni's The Leopard and Senso dealt with the unification of Italy Ludwig deals with the unification of Germany's states the infamous Otto Von Bismarck of Prussia defeating Bavaria and unifying it with other squabbling principalities in the name of a greater Germany. A new Germanic nation which it was promised would be able to organise industrially and administratively and so successfully enter the modern period. Ludwig's homosexuality is thus indicative of the passing of a monarchical system reliant upon hereditary and therefore compulsory heterosexuality. This is a common Visconti theme. As history ramps up toward industrial capitalism patriarchal systems based upon physical reproduction and genetic bloodlines have become outmoded and unstable leading to the formation of a new form of patriarchy to achieve stability. For Ludwig to express his desires even as a monarch means to regress from the social reality of the moment and only when his country has been subjugated by Prussia who offers to leave a token monarchy in place though the country is now officially ruled by other means can Ludwig act out his personal desires albeit in a limited fashion. Ironically when Ludwig has finally escaped the duties of the monarchy and allows himself to indulge in homosexual activity he is punished dearly for his transgressions. Kings are now subjects to be controlled by the new management and unless they conform to the national fantasy unless they adopt the party line they will be crushed.810  At four hours long this beast is best watched in hourly instalments. Like most of Visconti's later works it's a lavish but stiff affair. Worth one viewing.";

When the king neglects his country's problems to finance his artistic protgs and build sumptuous castles? When the king's mental faculties are clearly degenerating? When the country's independence withers and its public debt increases? What's a country to do with such a king? These are some of the questions Luchino Visconti's Ludwig poses. The final instalment of Visconti's Germany history trilogy which includes The Damned and Death In Venice Ludwig is about King Ludwig II of Bavaria also known as the Swan King the Moon King the FairyTale King and what is arguably the fittest nickname the Mad King of Bavaria.The theme of madness runs through most of the movie in a languid pace demonstrating the slow mental breakdown of Ludwig Helmut Berger. A young idealistic aristocrat he assumes power with the intentions of practicing only good and serving his country God. But the young King obsessed with arts and especially Richard Wagner's music has a quaint vision of his duties. For him spiritual regeneration is more important than material matters so his first decision is to bring Wagner Trevor Howard on the run from creditors to Munich to stage his magnificent and expensive Tristan and Isolde.From the beginning Ludwig constantly clashes against his ministers who dislike the king's aloofness and squandering of the public treasury. In their defence Wagner is portrayed as a grovelling greedy sycophant who constantly exploits the king's idealism for personal gain. Trevor Howard does a great job playing the legendary composer.Ludwig's alienation from his people is clearly portrayed during when Bavaria takes the side of Austria against Prussia during the Seven Week's War. While his people his younger brother included fight and suffer humiliating defeats Ludwig retreats to a palace refusing to accept that a war is raging on. Years later when Wilhelm I of Prussia unifies the German kingdoms into the German Empire Ludwig by then completely oblivious to what went in around him Ludwig is forced to sign away the independence of his kingdom in the new empire.Ludwig can be pretty hard to follow without a reasonable grasp of East European history and Visconti tries to cram so much into the movie that most events are barely developed but the second half of the movie dealing with the construction of Ludwig's famous castles with underground lakes for swans is more interesting and dramatic. With his mental collapse obvious Ludwig now inhabits a fairytale world separated from reality any chances of marrying and bearing an heir pretty much over indulging in orgies and hiring actors to represent for him his favourite monologues. It's at this time that the ministers plot to replace the king with someone else.Helmut Berger who was outstanding as an extravagant hedonist in Visconti's The Damned plays essentially the same role but with less charisma. Berger is quite good but he can't carry on his own a movie with very little story. Visconti could have chosen to concentrate on a specific period of Ludwig's short reign to condense the dramatic power of his life. Instead the viewer is asked to stand repeated scenes of Ludwig discoursing about art of ministers worrying about public debt and of beautiful people sitting in beautiful couches surrounded by beautiful decoration. This is the movie where Visconti's sense of design and art direction takes over the importance of drama. This takeover slowly asserts itself through the trilogy with Death In Venice already barely keeping the balance between the story and Visconti's love for Venice's derelict buildings and dirty streets.In spite of Visconti's preference of costumes and buildings over people Helmut Berger does a great job as Ludwig. His transformation is impressive. He starts as a cleanshaved angelic youth and progressively assumes a more demonic look growing his hair and beard letting his teeth rotten until his mouth looks like a piece of coal growing paler and developing sunken eyes. In fact most of his acting is done with his eyes always showing a lot of emotions and mental activity going on as befits a man diagnosed with paranoia. Berger's performance is one of the main reasons to watch this movie.This is perhaps Visconti's ultimate achievement in design and art direction and few movies can boast of being prettier than Ludwig. Although I was less than pleased with the glacial pace of this movie  not that I have anything against glacial paces just unjustified ones  it deserves a watch when one has four hours to spend without regrets.".

The film has extravagant settings which could easily amaze everyone in spite of different backgrounds. I have to say only Visconti has this privilege as he has blue blood running inside his veins. Ludwig is a proud black swan noble and pure maybe reflects the image of Visconti himself. His tragedy is that he is not suitable to be a king he pursues art more than politics and his homosexuality does offend some people. At his position his demise is destined and nothing he could do to avoid it it's so cruel to see how he suffers all the way the ultimate death is the best way to save his dignity as a human being. The film is almost 4 hours I have to watch it separately which helps a lot to digest it. And Helmut Berger is so vulnerable and convincing in his role as Ludwig plus at that time he was also Visconti's muse. I wonder how come he hasn't become more famous as he unfurls a unisex fascination from this film even could defeat Alain Delon at his peak youth. Watching Visconti's film is a totally different experience from watching Antonioni's. They both excel over each other in their own ways by far I still can not figure out I like whose films more need to see more films from both of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel Die Angst des Tormannes beim Elfmeter by Austrian existentialist writer Peter Handke The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is a powerful and unnerving film by the great German director Wim Wenders Wings of Desire Paris Texas. As the film opens the goalie Joseph Bloch Arthur Brauss is suspended from a soccer game in Vienna for missing a penalty kick. Seemingly not upset he goes into town then commits an unplanned and seemingly unmotivated murder of a cinema cashier.Presenting us with a world that does not fit our picture of what constitutes rational behavior Wenders refuses to explain the goalie's senseless action. Bloch simply continues his life in a matteroffact way although a great deal of emotion seems to be churning under the surface. He retreats to a country inn to find his old girl friend. Nothing much happens. He goes to the movies converses with the local residents drinks a lot gets into a fight and ostensibly waits for the police to close in. His expression remains the same no matter what he is doing. As stated by Adam Groves in his review in The Cutting Edge He may be a homicidal sociopath but Joseph seems to fit in quite well with the world around him which seems to be the whole pointBloch talks about his life as a goalie throughout the film. At the end he wanders into to a local soccer game and explains to a visiting salesman the thoughts that go through a goalie's mind during a penalty kick for example how the goalie must outguess the shooter. Perhaps dramatizing the dehumanizing effects of modern society Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is a strange intriguing and complex film that definitely deserves repeated viewing to unlock the puzzle. A possible hint involves a repetitive theme of a lost boy who drowned because he couldn't communicate.".

Seemingly not upset he goes into town then commits an unplanned and seemingly unmotivated murder of a cinema cashier.Presenting us with a world that does not fit our picture of what constitutes rational behavior Wenders refuses to explain the goalie's senseless action. Bloch simply continues his life in a matteroffact way although a great deal of emotion seems to be churning under the surface. He retreats to a country inn to find his old girl friend. Nothing much happens. He goes to the movies converses with the local residents drinks a lot gets into a fight and ostensibly waits for the police to close in. His expression remains the same no matter what he is doing. As stated by Adam Groves in his review in The Cutting Edge He may be a homicidal sociopath but Joseph seems to fit in quite well with the world around him which seems to be the whole pointBloch talks about his life as a goalie throughout the film. At the end he wanders into to a local soccer game and explains to a visiting salesman the thoughts that go through a goalie's mind during a penalty kick for example how the goalie must outguess the shooter. Perhaps dramatizing the dehumanizing effects of modern society Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is a strange intriguing and complex film that definitely deserves repeated viewing to unlock the puzzle. A possible hint involves a repetitive theme of a lost boy who drowned because he couldn't communicate.";

While it may seem evident to us accustomed to Hollywood's conventional plots that the main character of The Goalie... is a madman it is not evident at all. Handke's approach to narrative is to reflect exterior signs rather than enter the character's inner thoughts. See The Lefthanded Woman for example while it may seem on the surface that the woman does not have a reason for divorce in fact she might have a lot only she does not reveal what is on her mind. Same applies to the goalie he would not speak his mind therefore we and even Handke himself or Wenders can not enter his own intimate realm. Whatever his reasons are for what he does and murder is only one of his unexplained acts we can not know them. The film is about communication between people more than murder. It is funny that most of us would assume he is mad just because we can not find an account of his acts if you think about it in the real world outside the movie realm most people and even our closest friends would not tell us why they do what they do. And it does not necessarily mean they are mad.".

This is the first half of the film. The second half of the film is a journey to the country to attempt to reconcile things with an old girlfriend. He does not commit another murder.

With its unwillingness to rationalize or justify the main characters' actions this film completely sets itself apart from the dull psychoserial killer genre and offers a new way to depict a man gone mad.

	schema:headline " Best film about goalkeepers!";
	schema:reviewBody "While most reviews state the arc of the story well it seems the details of what happens to the goalkeeper in the opening scene are not well understood. He is clearly sent off for dissent kicking the ball away in protest after it has been placed in the centre circle after the referee awards a goal. He has not committed a foul and he isn't dismissed because he fails to save the shot on goal something which is not a rule of the sport. Nor is he substituted. He approaches the referee and protests that a player was clearly offside when the goal was scored. When the referee ignores his complaint the goalkeeper walks over to the ball in the centre circle and kicks it away. The referee immediately signals that he is sending the goalkeeper off. Although the referee isn't seen to produce a red card he is heard to say something in German obviously about red all of which clearly tells us the referee sent him off for the act of dissent.As for the goal scored we do not see a penalty kick being taken and the way the scene is shot as well as the fact that he protested that an attacking player was offside when the goal was scored suggests more that the goal is scored in open play rather than from a penalty kick where by definition noone could be offside if the goal was scored from a direct kick rather than say after the goalkeeper saved the initial effort and normal play resumed  to satisfy the even more pedantic!. While it would be interesting if we saw the goalkeeper face a penalty then see it as it really is an antiRashomon on TV it doesn't seem to me at the risk of being too literalminded perhaps that this is what Wenders filmed or intended. The TV footage does not seem to show the match in which the goalkeeper played. The stands are essentially empty in his match but in the televised match you can see it is pretty much a full house. And once again there is no penalty kick in that televised match but the goal is instead scored from open play with defenders crowding the 18yard area. It does not feel like this is a detail we are intended to connect to the match he played. If anything the brief TV clip is just another thematic demonstration of goalkeepers being on the losing side of their psychological battle with players taking shots at them. In the final scene we see another goalkeeper actually save a penalty kick by guessing correctly which way to dive finally showing us the alternative outcome of a confrontation which the sport takes for granted is heavily stacked against the goalkeeper.There is a surreal dislocated quality to the goalkeeper's behaviour in the opening scene. He leaves the field of play while his own team has possession in the opposition's final third and addresses some children behind the goal. He casts a glance back at the pitch and we see that possession of the ball is now being contested in the midfield. He then turns his back on play again still standing off the field. At this point in play with no goalkeeper defending the goal it would have been natural for the opposition to take a long distance shot on goal so any normal goalkeeper would have got back on the field immediately to discourage that. Any normal goalkeeper probably would never have left it in the first place of course but this is 1970s New German Cinema after all and clearly his angst is greater than the instincts which propelled him to the position of professional shot stopper he doesn't return to the field until what seem to be the last seconds before a goal is scored and he stands there rooted to the spot as the ball hits the back of the net. His actions prior to the goal suggest he's suffering from apathy prior to his dismissal rather than that his dismissal so profoundly affects him that this alone accounts for his subsequent state of mind and actions.The Camus references  goalkeeper inexplicable passionless act of murder  are entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe the trick is in the title. Accidental or intentional? A goalie without a goal which equals a movie without a goal. Die Angst Des Tormanns Beim Elfmeter The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is a story about things falling apart and no one paying attention to them people acting as if everything was OK while living in a disintegrating world. The goalie of the title is Joseph Bloch Arthur Brauss an unsympathetic and ruthless man who was kicked out of a match after a foul play who goes out on a rampage of murder for obscure reasons possibly none by killing a female cashier  whom he spent the night with  and a deaf boy  still unclear to me if he has part on his assassination later on ruled as an accident. What goes on is Bloch's sort of escape going from place to place hotel to hotel being rude with people and other times he's beaten by strangers after provoking them or he's robbed by muggers not knowing how to react and develops relations with other women. Sometimes there's few bits of information about his victims in the news and he seems preoccupied with those always wanting to read the papers. So what does he want to do? What's his goal? At my view none except escape  but who's after him? Who knows about his mysterious acts? So he just keep on randomly walking and putting things out of order.Easily one of Wim Wenders weakest and one of his toughest watches of all since he doesn't make anything appealing sometimes even not worthy seeing filled with empty actions poorly presented situations and mundane acts that doesn't add anything to a plot that has very few to show. There's few things which Wenders got it right while making his wrong presentation. He doesn't offer motive reasons why his main character goes out killing people. Who could give reason to a murderer? Who would consider a crime something reasonable? It's not it's simple abominable unexplainable just like the movie. Those who manage to get to the ending get a surprise but only the wise will truly get it. The very last scene when Joseph casually watches a soccer match chatting with another guy he tells the whole movie in an almost poetic manner. He makes a metaphor which shines a light on us in the audience. He explains to the man why the viewers focus on the game must be on the goalie instead of being in the player or the ball. The man proceeds in such and responds that it is too difficult to which Joseph replies You get used to it. But it's ridiculous!. Same thing with the movie. There's plenty of indications that this man is a murderer he goes from one erratic behavior to another almost to the point of getting caught by the police and he even helps one officer with a minor problem yet everyone around fail to notice him or his actions. People simply trust him all that much. We as audience can't fail with that we keep our eyes on the goalie. That scene has plenty of depth too bad the movie isn't just like that moment.Distractive and not in a good way a little misguided but somewhat engaging The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick worths as an imaginative way of breaking storytelling conventions with its fragmented narrative repleted of ordinary dialogs and some expectation when everything is silent. Difficult unpredictable and strangely not menacing as films about psychos tend to be. Also worths a view due to its soundtrack in the many jukebox scenes with pop and rock classics. I hated the main theme from the original score though it was quite annoying. I don't get the reviewers who compare it to the brilliant Camus novel The Stranger since the main character from the novel has more explained in the unexplainable reasons for murder than the goalie. A little good but Wenders has so much better. 610".

Because there is absolutely NO CONTEXT whatsoever you don't know WHY or what sort of a person he's beenis this his first does he make a habit of it etc. None of this is revealedyou just watch this guy over the period of a few days go about his terribly boring life that is apart from killing women. Frankly after watching the film I just found myself not caring one bit one way or the other. There were certainly better ways I could have spent my time than watch this video.";

	schema:reviewBody "Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter or The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is a 100minute movie from almost 45 years ago and it was the breakthrough for German filmmaker Wim Wenders. He directed here and also worked a bit on the script even if the main effort in terms of screen writing according to the credits comes from Peter Handke who also wrote the novel that this film is based on. You could call this movie here a film during which really nothing happens at all apart from one scene and the very first scene maybe as well. Joseph Bloch is a professional athlete and I personally see him as a man hungry for recognition and power. When his ego cannot take a referee's behavior he commits a horrific act in order to restore the belief in his own power.He is also a sociopath. After the act he lives a life just like he did before. No remorse no fear nothing. One great example of his selfconfidence is when we hear another character mention that the killer probably has a mustache by now but Bloch did not even think about it. He also won't go into hiding or anything. In the end the question for the audience arises if he gets away with it. Apparently police come closer to catching him but we do not find out definitely if they do which is a bit surprising as they get closer and closer while the film continues. In the last scene Bloch makes a catmouse reference that applies to goalkeeper and the one who shoots the penalty as well as to him and police without his conversation partner understanding the latter.I thought Wenders and Handke made a pretty good film here. This is certainly a very atmospheric watch and I believe Arthur Brauss who turns 80 this year was a really good choice for the main character. He brings a ruthlessness and coldblooded approach to the role that fits the mentality of a killer and goal keeper really well. Physically he looks like a mix of Daniel Craig and Matthias Schoenaerts which certainly helps at well. I cannot say there were any truly great moments here but this may also have to do with the base material. With Handke in charge of the screenplay it was certainly very close to the novel. I cannot go further into detail as I have not read this one. About the movie however it was a really solid watch and I recommend it. Thumbs up.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant British farce one of the funniest comedies ever";
	schema:reviewBody "A funeral is really the perfect setting for a British comedy. There's just something about the British and funerals contrasted with all the silliness that's going on that makes me laugh hysterically. The start of the film really sets the tone so well. You think it's going to be something serious but then the screw up by the funeral home's staff immediately changes the tone to a comedy and everything starts to carefully build up to a grand farce of mishaps secrets and misunderstandings which eventually come together at the film's climax. Farce is definitely a better description for the movie than black comedy because you don't feel guilty when you're laughing at all the horrible things that are happening in the movie.Yes there's crassness in the movie but it is also smart subtle and it has a ton of heart. You need to have patience with this film in the start though because it carefully builds up the setting and tension and puts the needed pieces in place in the beginning for the later hilarious scenes to work as intended. When the comedy really starts going boy is it worth the wait! The way the family tries to deal with the problems in secret while also trying to keep the funeral going is absolute comedy gold. The disruptions of calmness and decency the British appreciate are expertly crafted in this film.The cast does a wonderful job. Andy Nyman does an especially awesome job as a hypochondriac stressing about his skin condition he just can't catch a break!. Alan Tudyk absolutely steals the show his reactions and behavior during the funeral are so comical loved that guy on Tucker and Dale vs. Evil by the way and he can do a surprisingly good British accent. Matthew Macfadyen was a great choice to play the straightfaced son who is in charge of the funeral arrangements. Peter Vaughan as Uncle Alfie was also entertaining as the slightly anachronistic swearing old uncle. There's really too many good performances here to count them everyone simply acts fantastically. What was also great was that the many characters aren't put there just to do one thing but they're cleverly woven into many hilarious subplots. The music is used sparingly but when it's used it definitely enhances the comedic moments well. Oh and that toilet scene wow I've probably never laughed that hard. Grossout humor is used where it's appropriate and the situation and the characters are properly primed for to get those priceless reactions. Man I wish I could watch this movie over and over again without knowing that I've watched it before. It's just such a perfectly crafted farce. Few comedies have ever made me and my friends laugh out loud for as long as this one. Definitely give this film a go.".

I miss this guy such a good actor so much better than others that made it big on the other side of the ocean. All in all a British sitcom dealing and doing what they do best.

	schema:reviewBody "The laughs begin during the animated credits which prepares the film going public for the buffoonery to follow. Death at a Funeral DaaF is directed by Frank Oz. Because of the nature of this film I believe Mr. Oz is paying homage to the late great director Robert Altman particularly his film A Wedding. Both A Wedding and DaaF are both off beat extremely funny and very nontypical of weddings and funerals in which they both portray. In tribute to Mr. Altman Mr. Oz also uses an ensemble cast of well known actors by face but not by name. The audience has seen their work and in this film they most definitely make you laugh. This is an adult comedy with an R rating for adult themes nudity recreational drug use religious issues postmortem issues and the absurdity about death. Remember this is an adult comic opera taken to the extreme. At this funeral the mourners may come with their inhabitation's in check but due to the outlandish antics of many of the other grievous members assembled all of the gathered loose all claim to sanity. The audience becomes one with the collected zany members of this grieving group. Since the players on film have lost their inhabitation's so to does the audience. Remember this is an adult knee slapping laugh out loud farce. This film is outrageously funny in an adult vein not intended for children. If you go to a sporting event after you have paid for your ticket and bought your seat people around you cheer yell scream and sometimes even in funny costumes as well. A film house is the same communally shared type of experience and environment for entertainment but patrons of the silver screen tend to hold their laughter within as of being afraid of upsetting the patron in the next seat. Is it not time to unshackle this age old concept and enjoy yourself along with others? I am certain that is the reason why Frank Oz made this film so the audience could laugh and laugh at themselves. I personally want to thank you Mr. Oz for the laughter and the comedy of Death at a Funeral.".

I do not enjoy the overuse of toilet humour especially the way it has been done in numerous Hollywood summer movies but here it is within context and the film itself is full of laugh out loud moments. Oz assembles a host of talented actors that include Keeley Hawes Andy Nyman Daisy Donovan Alan Tudyk Jane Asher Kris Marshall Peter Dinklage and Rupert Graves. I did not expect Matthew Macfadyen to pull off comedy and here he was a funny surprise.The entire film is set during the funeral and what makes this film different from others of its genre is the comedy and the pace is pretty smooth. Even though some of the comedic situations were over the top in a good way none of it looked out of place. It's the kind of film that may not appeal to everyone but those who get it will roll on the floor laughing.I watched it during a tired evening and I thought I wouldn't be able to sit through it because I was so tired not because I expected the movie to be bad or anything but the constant laughing got me energized enough throughout.

It's a bit like that line in Fawlty Towers where the exasperated American guest says to Basil This is the lousiest crummiest hotel in the whole of Western Europe! at which the Major interjects No! I won't have that! Pause There's a place in Eastbourne So what's wrong with it this film not Basil Fawlty's hotel? I will start by suggesting that the least one ought to be able to expect of a comedy is that it should be funny. I have to report that I found the various attempts to provoke laughter either crass embarrassing puerile crude cringe worthy or in downright bad taste. Cadaver falls out of coffin. Yeah hilarious. Man helping paraplegic to sit on toilet gets excrement on his hand and face. A real thigh slapper. Dwarf ends up in coffin with his dead lover's body. Highly risible. And so it continues Of course humour is a highly subjective animal and I have to believe accounts of people roaring at this little turkey. I submit however that great  or even good  comedy films will stand the test of time the gags will still be funny at second or third viewing. I am not confident that time will treat DAAF too kindly. Subjective notions of humour aside there is plenty wrong with this film. I am immediately suspicious of movies in which foul language is used as a substitute for funny lines. Uncle Alfie announces his arrival on screen with a spray of obscenities and his character never rises far above that level. Something else that sticks out a mile is that practically every actor is firmly in autopilot mode. Rupert Graves in particular looks as though he was wishing he was somewhere else and what an actor of the stature of Jane Asher is doing in this little number is anyone's guess. That she is absolutely appalling can most likely be put down to a combination of a commensurately wretched script and criminal miscasting. And the alleged similarity to Four Weddings and a Funeral ends with the F word in their respective titles. I nearly died  but not from laughing.".

This is a clever well acted well directed film that not only leaves you smiling but ready to watch it again and again and again because it is simply so much fun. All the characters are charming in their own way even the villainous Dinklage who is certainly the dark character but who is far less villainous if you listen to his reasoning than he might initially seem. How often are viewers given the chance to watch an utterly engaging comedy that portrays people as they so often are a muddle of good qualities and not so good qualities the stuff that makes us all human.

Deftly handled by American director Frank Oz it puts a dysfunctional bunch of relatives through some very trying times during the funeral for a patriarch. It might not always be truly laugh out loud funny but it's twisted enough  and relatable enough  to put a smile on your face and keep it there. The setting is ideal because who better than the Brits could deliver lines in such a hilariously deadpan way and try to keep a stiff upper lip while chaos reigns?Among the story threads here are the dead mans' son Daniel Matthew MacFadyen having to live in the shadow of his brother Robert Rupert Graves a successful novelist Simon Alan Tudyk being given a Valium to help him calm down when in reality the pill he took was a hallucinogen a diminutive blackmailer Peter Dinklage showing up at the funeral with a shocking revelation for one and all and poor putupon Howard Andy Nyman being forced to repeatedly deal with a cantankerous wheelchairbound senior named Uncle Alfie Peter Vaughan. Things just get more and more out of control until the frantic climax and that's when Daniel finally tries to get things back on course with a eulogy that is improvised but completely heartfelt.While typing this review this viewer is reminded of that old adage that everybody grieves in their own way and what you won't see watching this is excess sentiment. The mourning is believable no matter if people aren't doing that much crying. The humour of course is priceless. The film does go for the grossout in a big way at one point but this provide worry wart Howard something to fret over that's worse than any mild skin discolouration. The cast is a treat to watch. Also included in this talented ensemble are lovely ladies Keeley Hawes Daisy Donovan and Jane Asher as well as Ewen Bremner Kris Marshall Thomas Wheatley and Peter Egan. Knowing that Tudyk is actually a Texan it makes his performance that much more impressive as he fits right in among this crowd.Oz eases his audience into the film with a modest chuckle to begin with and he and his actors do a fine job of making the pace pick up bit by bit. The ending is particularly funny.All in all a bright and refreshing comedy remade for American audiences three years later under the same title.Eight out of 10.".

The British are noted for their dry humor and this film is loaded with it. The least subtle scene is a bathroom scene with geriatric Uncle Alfie it will leave you rolling. Peter Dinklage turns in a great performance as a villain that you can't completely dislike. He appears in a 2010 remake of Death of a Funeral. I haven't seen that version so I don't know if he reprises his role. It would be hard to improve on the 2007 work though.The DVD contains a gag reel and two commentary tracks. The first is with Frank Oz who is a master of giving a movie crew flexibility in the production and having it work out for the better. No command and control guy he is. The second commentary track features several of the film's prominent actors. Both tracks added to the experience.".

Including the always enjoyable performances of John Cusack and Morgen Freeman one should be in for a great ride. But after several moments into this film it becomes clear why the script has been lying on a dusty shelf somewhere for so long waiting for top actors to get involved.Even with the star involvement the movie just fails to surpass its weak plot and tired premise. Excop Ray Cusack estranged father and his son are on a hike to better their relationship when they stumble upon a fatally injured policeman and his prisoner the hitman Carden Freeman. In stead of just letting Carden walk as Carden suggests Ray for no apparent reason decides to turn him over to the police at the risk of his own life and that of his son. After this the chase through the woods for Carden by both the police and Carden's accomplices begins. With people running through bushes occasional gunfire and certain bad weather.Although Freeman and Cusack give away ample performances the dialog seems to be that of some average TVseries. The villains and the characters of the police fare even worse. The movie just doesn't pick up any speed as it steers clear from any interesting action or build up of suspense. And especially the lack of motive for Ray to keep going with his plan to turn Carden in gets annoying after a while and this doesn't work very well in terms of sympathy for his herocharacter. It is obvious that Catz wanted to write a story in which the bad guy develops sympathy for his capturer and maybe the other way around as well. But the cheesy almost campy way this is attempted and the high number of scenes that just don't make any sense stand in the way of its success.Like the former reviewer pointed out the movie is crammed with clichs and is lacking any originality. There are no mentionable plottwists to keep the film interesting and the hackneyed screenplay is often accidentally comical.I wouldn't even recommend getting the DVD. Just wait till it's the movie of the week and then see something else in stead.".

However I was disappointed when I brought it home and looked up the rating on IMDb to see an average rating. But knowing I had to get my money's worth I watched it this evening now I didn't think it was a bad movie but it was pretty average for what I was expecting from these extremely talented actors. The plot had extreme potential but some things were not explained well enough like the characters just had no depth. The script just needed some more work.After Ray's son gets into trouble he wants to do a little bonding with him so he takes him camping. But things get a little interesting when he and his son try to save two people from the river who have washed ashore one of them is a police officer who is fatally wounded and the other man Cander is a hit man who is wanted by the F.B.I. and is also being followed by his fellow assassins. Ray and his son take Cander and try to take him to the police but it's hard when the assassins are after all of them and won't stop until they get what they want.A hitman with a heart of gold not that original not that believable not to mention how some of the plot seemed a bit mediocre and confusing at times. Now Morgan and John did a good job with what they had they made the film watchable. They really did have good chemistry so I do hope they do a film together soon just before they do that they read the script first. So The Contract is a film I would say is watchable just like I said it's a bit average for what you would expect but just judge for yourself.610".

Is this a reason to kill and important man? My vote is five.Title Brazil O Contrato The Contract";

Cusak just seemed to be phoning his performance in...even with the horrible lines. Freeman almost seemed to be bemused with the terrible story line and the bad acting all around him. And the plot...just a little too out there for me. The one point that explains why Cusak's character does what he does for the rest of the movie is given no background. Just one line given by Cusak. It actually angered me that I not only sat through this drivel but actually paid to rent it! Cusak and Freeman both hacked their way through this just for the paycheck at the end. Sad really.

His plan to bond over a camping trip in the woods goes sour though when they come across a hitman Cordell in the middle of escaping Government custody. Keene holds Cordell at gunpoint but without a mobile phone signal they begin to trek towards civilisation. However with Cordell's men hot on their heels Ray becomes increasingly desperate as he tries to get to the protection of the authorities.I saw this film on an overnight bus crossing Argentina. I mention this not as name dropping but to admit that the sound was very low as must passengers were sleeping and relying on headphones or the Spanish subtitles. Without headphones or a working Spanish I prepared to strain my ears and also use the subtitles the best I could. I needn't have worried because I could have followed this if the sound was on mute and the DVD was playing all the scenes on random shuffle. The plot is simple perhaps but it did offer a sort of moral ambiguity that was interesting to me at first. With two strong actors in the leads I expected the verbal fireworks to be more interesting than the action. In a way I was correct but this is not to say that the script was good  just that the action was poor. The moral complexity of good and bad is skirted on but is ultimately dumped in a ending that is nothing more than insultingly lazy writing.Fortunately anyone getting to the end will not be surprised by this as it is pretty much what the previous hour or so had been like. The narrative is totally unconvincing and offers little to make up for it. The tension that could have covered the plot holes is absent and the action is mostly just dumb. Writers Katz and Darrouzet deserve much of the credit for this because really nobody is given much to work with. Director Beresford does the basics with little conviction but I did feel sorry for the cast. Freeman and Cusack both deserved much better than this nonsense. Freeman I assume was attracted by the chance to play a baddie and it is a shame then the script doesn't really let him do this with any effort. Cusack does what is asked of him but nothing more. The support cast are average at best in keeping with their cardboard characters.Overall then a roundly poor film that offers nothing of interest and wastes the talents of the two actors in the lead. If I hadn't been a captive audience I would have struggled to make it past the 30 minute mark.".

Did Cusack and Freeman lose a gamblingbet and were they out of money so badly they didn't even bother to read the script? 110";

John Cusack phones his performance in. Newcomer Jamie Anderson is adequate as Cusack's son but hardly a revelation. Bill Smitrovich an actor I normally enjoy seeing in small roles is terrible as the 'comic relief' a smalltown police chief.The film is ultimately generic bland unengaging and a waste of considerable talent.

Freeman as a very experienced soldier and assassin didn't use a single skill to overpower Cusack except once in the cave. He of course tries to persuade Cusack to let him go but didn't he have some other tricks up his sleeve? Can we even start to comprehend this? spoiler when Cusacks son slips on a slippery rock and Freeman holds his life in his hands is a moment that he didn't take advantage of. Can you believe that? Throw me your gun and I will safe your son's life. But instead of hostility sympathy grows between the two. Stockholm syndrome? The four criminals who are hunting Cusack and Freeman are simply an insult to your intellect. It is so immensely boring to watch over and over again in Hollywood productions the hero pull it through against a superior force only because they cant think shoot straight finish their job etc.Simon".

	schema:reviewBody "I found the first twothirds of The Contract pretty enjoyable. The story was interesting and it moved at a nice pace. The movie was filmed in some beautiful locations and the three main players Cusack Freeman and Jamie Anderson were well cast as they played well off each other.Unfortunately that's about all the positives I can find in this film. Although I really liked the premise of the story  A man and his son who take a camping trip to bond with each other. Inadvertently they must take into their custody an assassin who kills the sheriff guarding him  the writers andor directors choose to water down the movie toward the end which created a lot of plot holes and gaps in the story. One hole in particular is after the assassin Freeman escapes with the son Anderson it is difficult tell how much time elapses. Cusack is seen nonchalantly hanging out in his house. Freeman appears at a funeral with a sniper rifle. It just doesn't seem to capture the situation correctly. The next thing we know Cusack figurers out Freeman's assassination plan based on a news report he is watching and then finds Freeman at the funeral and thwarts his efforts. Prior to this the film was nicely developed. It's as if the director andor writers just said to heck with the whole thing let's just get this movie finished. I could go on with more gaps but you get the point.This film is watchable but you will probably be disappointed in the ending as I was. I'd love to have a good writer or director clean up the mess and do a remake. Rating 5 of 10 stars.".

Ah yes it could be bad and was terrible...after the first few minutes I could tell there was something very wrong with this film. ...very poor direction and so many producers they needed to be counted as a herd! Freeman and Cusack carry their weight BUT they cannot carry this film! The script needs major surgery especially for the rest of the cast. Over all the story line has potential but never gets there because of very poor character development. No one will ever believe some of these characters could be so stupid as to actually take the actions they did in this film...i.e. the scene where the police fly over the area and decide it is nothing serious when they spot an individual on the ground...I cannot believe trained police would be dumb enough to fly over these folks and then merely land and walk into the trap of the bad guys???? It must have been the money that attracted Morgan Freeman and Cusack.Near the end of the film I thought The only additional feature which would tip this film deeper into the trash can would be to have the 'young lady' who lost her 'close friend' end up with Cusack. Sure enough she shows up at a picnic and ends up with Cusack...all this and not a tear for her former lover who was gunned down on the trail...wow talk about heartless! I gave the film a 2 and that is generous...too bad DVD's do not come with a money back guarantee...I would be in line on this one for a refund.".

I think he must have self esteem issues to come off like that against the reviewers.Anyways this movie is very funny if you're into this sort of movie.

While watching it I felt it was trying its hardest to be as true to the game as it could. It has sick and pointlessly funny humor both political and sexual and it has a ridiculous plot that feels like something right out of the game. Perhaps the one thing Boll does well in Postal is the bumbling collection of Muslim terrorists who are apathetic about the whole Jihad thing and they are quite funny to watch as they goof around. I guess what makes Postal the movie special is the collection of little silly Easter eggesquire instances that will just make you chuckle. Like the Postal game the movie deserves its due because it is a novelty among movies. Regardless it's Boll's best work.".

Assuming this was not some cosmic coincidence whereby Uwe Boll managed to write and direct a movie that actually entertains it's alleged target audience I feel confident in saying that this movie actually hits it's mark. Knowing the spirit and tone of the source material this is actually a pretty decent video game adaptation. The movie is essentially a Bollian journey into Tromaville territory from the crass sociopolitical commentary through the excessive violence coarse language gratuitous full frontal Dave Foley nudity right down to the self deprecating director cameo. It's intentionally offensive to everyone. Despite itself on some level this movie works. It's weird that I seem to only have good things to say about this movie seeing as it is not a good movie... but dare I say it's not bad either. 510".

It's intentionally offensive to everyone. Despite itself on some level this movie works. It's weird that I seem to only have good things to say about this movie seeing as it is not a good movie... but dare I say it's not bad either. 510";

It's hard not to remember other video games he's responsible for bringing to the screen Alone in the Dark Bloodrayne that really really sucked.Boll has said he looked inward to write about his own frustration with the world for this. And it's very different. It doesn't compare to his other films at all  is closer to Kentucky Fried Movie than to Alien Vs. Predator. It's a comedy presumably his first intentional one since his debut film 15 years ago and it goes to a place he hasn't shown us before.It's based on the spirit of the game Postal already politically incorrect cartoony out of control and not really serious not even as Vice City. In a post 911 world how do you make a film about an urban terrorist who's just pssed off without addressing terrorism racism and everything else that are hot buttons in the world...that create the madness that might make someone go...well you know.Boll has channeled the politically incorrect attitude and turned it on its ear. He doesn't mind making everyone look the fool do things they shouldn't for the wrong reasons kill the wrong people overreact act out clichs etc. Everything and everyone is fair game in this film and we must remember that  it's a FILM. It's fake folks. Everyone in it takes themselves too seriously and thinks killing someone solves their problems. They're crazy wrong and in this film they're laughable. Having fun yet? This is really a kitchensink movie. Every possible joke high and low sexual or sociological is jammed in with varying degrees of success. A lot of it's quite funny some is stupid and offensive but weirdly in a goodnatured way. It's not meanspirited at all. Ultimately it's a lot of fun. I agree that's it's too long towards the end if only because Boll didn't have the resources to make the final shootout as epic as it should have been and it begins to feel cramped.The portrayal of Osama bin Laden by soup Nazi Larry Thomas is inspired. Zack Ward and Dave Foley are both great and very comfortable in their roles. Uwe himself has a great nopunchespulled cameo along with the original maker of the game Postal at one point.I wonder if this will ever translate to a wide release or if it will remain something we see on DVD unrated we can only hope and laugh over. It is up to us to support any film that gets to the uncomfortable part of our world.And amazingly Uwe Boll wrote and directed it. Good job. Not the best film in the world but one to remember. I don't think Paul W.S. Anderson or Eli Roth to pick other famous hacks could possibly have pulled something this off. Boll is off the worstdirectorever list after this.Let's hope after Bloodrayne 2 he does something else more personal.".

Unfortunately the movie was a complete farce from start to finish and I can't say I took anything away from it save now knowing what Dave Foley's dick looks like. The movie was so completely devoid of anything resembling intelligent filmmaking or vocational pride that I remain unable to assess my feelings about it in words point for point. In the QA that followed the film Uwe voiced his opinions that the Hollywood system is too predictable too many sequels and retread franchises exist and there is too much censorship. Unfortunately all of those admittedly retread films amount to even at there most contrived movies that stand lightyears ahead of anything Uwe Boll has ever done.Before the movie I remarked to my friend What if this movie is actually okay?

Having played postal and postal 2 and seen all of Boll's previous work I was apprehensive of watching this one but the scene 1 got me hooked upfront. Its a really good adaptation and the humour is brilliant. Its after watching it that I read critics say. and so I have learned the fact  A critic is just another Moviegoer like all of us.

I expected some lowbrow American overthetop junk like American Pie or Hot Shots but this film actually turned out to be far far superior to those.Offending women Muslems Jews Nazis Christians and pretty much anyone else who has an opinion with his off attitude Uwe Boll manages to bring overthetop humor to a level never witnessed before. While the humor varies from highly questionable tot utterly hilarious the lesser jokes are easily ignored due to the film's fast pacing and solid editing. Also we find a criticism of American society that goes way beyond anything major Hollywood studios would dare to publish.... and while extremely cynical it is entirely to the point.As a comedy I found nothing to dislike about this film. I would have given it a 10 but the toilet humor level of some of the jokes force me to take one step back and give it a 9. Nevertheless I can highly recommend this comedy for anyone who doesn't get offended too easily.... If Boll's other films are really that bad I suggest he sticks with comedy.".

Little do they know that a small group of Taliban members is also planning the same heist at the same time.Could it be? Uwe Boll finally pulls through with a great video game adaption? Well. . . no.

Say what you will about Boll and his complete lack of artistic talent and I'll agree with it but he does know how to stir up some controversy. Whether it's threatening Michael Bay boxing critics or making an extremely offensive and perverse new comedy Uwe can cause problems. Now obviously as it's an Uwe Boll film you're going to have to expect many of the negative elements that go with it poor actingwritingetc. However as the film is so obviously meant to simply offend at any cost it's not hard to overlook a lot of the flaws and just sit back and laugh at the stupidly ridiculous spectacle that is Postal. I mean Uwe Boll actually stands onstage in his own film playing himself and says all of his movies are funded using Nazi gold and that children in the crowd arouse him. At least he's finally be honest ya know? Anyway if Tom Cruise 911 cults crap trailers racism swearing Dave Foley police brutality fat people hicks the handicapped and overthetop violence often against children sound like things worthy of a laugh then you'll probably love this.

Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.After the initial surprise wears off Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.This probably would have worked as a short movie but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long. There are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 410".

	schema:reviewBody "If Postal had the endorsement of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and believe you me this is right up their alley Postal might have had a better chance at the box office... or maybe not. Maybe a supercrazy hardR rated comedy on everything from the Taliban to Dr. Uwe Boll himself wouldn't make much money on a quiet weekend much less the comparable one to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's actually kind of a shame but then again its super lowend cult status could do nothing but help its chances on DVD... But yet then again why should I be defending a damn Uwe Boll movie? The man is simply notorious in his realm of bad moviemaking a financially successful Edward D Wood who has by reputation a horrible track record of wretched videogame adaptations like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark. I've seen neither of these but just seeing a handful of clips of the latter of those two is enough to make one run for the hills.So why then? Simple  I agree with the Osama Bin Laden character from the movie as quoted from the trailer he made a funny film. It's also from a video game but perhaps the nature of the game itself helped things it's about a guy named just Dude Zack Ward who is having a very bad day such as a bad job interview a bad though cheerfully violent experience at the unemployment office and his fat wife is screwing another man. He finally decides to go to his sleazy Uncle Dave Dave Foley who is going after a scheme to get him out of an incometax problem with by selling crotch dolls ? that also the TalibanAlQuaeda is looking to use to spread Birdflu everywhere in America. And as they saw wackiness ensues... by that I mean varying degrees of insanity and stupidity.It may be varying on the taste of the viewer some may find this to be the funniest trashiest piece of satire of last year and some... will want to kick it down a flight of stairs. I'm somewhere in the middle. It's hard to deny that in Postal  even when Uwe Boll is acknowledging with a full face of alright then alright that he makes crappy video game movies and pokes 'fun' at himself by appearing in a cameo as the guy behind theme park Little Germany where he reveals the 'rumor' of his films being funded by Nazi gold are true !  there's some stupid and immature s floating around. In fact a good 40 of the movie is just what it aims to be making fun of which is fecalrelated jokes and gruesomely violent shootouts and maiming. But that other 60 reveals a filmmaker who actually has a decent control of his style not like Alone in the Dark thank heavens and has some clever ideas up his sleeve.Indeed the opening scene of the film where the Taliban is flying a plane and getting ready to crash into a building and the two pilots have an argument about whether or not there will be enough virgins when they get to heaven if any at all is truly hilarious dialog not unlike a Kevin Smith movie. And when we see some of the more creative ways Boll takes to letting his actors chew the scenery Foley's assistant who takes his apocalypse theory way too seriously is one of them it really rocks. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's just as smartdumb as it appears to be. And maybe it will be toooffensive or too obvious for the viewer expecting a Bin LadenBush joke ending with the line I wish I knew how to quit you. But almost sad to say it mostly works. Dr. Boll if only for once good job.".

It's hard to deny that in Postal  even when Uwe Boll is acknowledging with a full face of alright then alright that he makes crappy video game movies and pokes 'fun' at himself by appearing in a cameo as the guy behind theme park Little Germany where he reveals the 'rumor' of his films being funded by Nazi gold are true !  there's some stupid and immature s floating around. In fact a good 40 of the movie is just what it aims to be making fun of which is fecalrelated jokes and gruesomely violent shootouts and maiming. But that other 60 reveals a filmmaker who actually has a decent control of his style not like Alone in the Dark thank heavens and has some clever ideas up his sleeve.Indeed the opening scene of the film where the Taliban is flying a plane and getting ready to crash into a building and the two pilots have an argument about whether or not there will be enough virgins when they get to heaven if any at all is truly hilarious dialog not unlike a Kevin Smith movie. And when we see some of the more creative ways Boll takes to letting his actors chew the scenery Foley's assistant who takes his apocalypse theory way too seriously is one of them it really rocks. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's just as smartdumb as it appears to be. And maybe it will be toooffensive or too obvious for the viewer expecting a Bin LadenBush joke ending with the line I wish I knew how to quit you. But almost sad to say it mostly works. Dr. Boll if only for once good job.";

Roy the obvious comic relief played his role very effectively I laughed at him often. The other characters were of lesser involvement but several stereotypical demographics were adequately represented the brain the jock the average joe the stoner the angry rich girl and the decent good guy.

And it was pleasant to have the lovely ohsocute Erika Christensen though I'm not too fussed about Scarlett Johansen she looks like a teenage version of my mother!. A nonShaggy but still manic Matthew Lillard has a small role as a concerned big brother.

And what else do you expect from an MTV movie?The DVD is in 1.781 anamorphic widescreen with lackluster Dolby 5.1 though to be fair it mostly a dialoguedriven movie.

I especially enjoy Erika Christenson who I didn't recognize from her work in Traffic and Swimfam as the girl who needs a high SAT score to get into Brown University.  This movie shows the pressure that high school students have on standardized testing in general.  Their grades may be good but without a good score on this one test makes the difference in what college they can get into.  I was not a fan of standardized tests in high school and I do not like them now.  I think that dislike of these tests adds to the appeal the movie.  I give this movie a 610.

Scarlett Johanson was fine but her performance didn't look that great next to all the mediocre actors.When the two main guy characters were in the bathroom discussing their plan to steal the SAT's and Leonardo Nam made his first appearance my brothers and I laughed so hard. I know it's stupid humor but that guy as the Asian stoner Roy was the highlight of the movie for us. The way he talked and the stuff he said was so hilarious. I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie nearly as much of it weren't for him.The best word to describe this movie is average. When I saw it was put out by MTV I thought I hope it doesn't suck then. It is an interesting plot idea that they could've taken so much further and made into a much better movie. The way they tried to get into the character's lives humanize them as someone else said seemed very Breakfast Clubish but more clich and less thought out. Maybe this is supposed to be The Breakfast club for the new generation but it just doesn't measure up.This movie really got me thinking about SAT's. I am a freshman in high school. The movie did a good job showing the reality of doing whatever necessary to get a decent score. Many parts of the plot were unrealistic. The way they just managed to FIND the SAT scores as easily as they did. I mean honestly in real life they would not be nearly that accessible. There were only a few roadblocks. Also the romance between Francesca and Matty wasn't that realistic either.A fine movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. It's way better than a TV movie not boring and I think it's worth watching just to see Leonardo Nam's performance!".

	schema:reviewBody "Of COURSE this is not Gone With the Wind or The Godfather or Apocalypse Now it's a teen flick and I find it absolutely hilarious and vastly underrated by some very snobbish commentary I've read.First please understand that this reviewer is several things A BIG movie buff capable of separating movies into genres and mental compartments rather than comparing apples to oranges in boneheaded fashion I am not finished watching the DVD yet it's on pause but...I do that watch and simultaneously check out IMDb part of the fun I'm utterly enamored of the freshness of this film. So far. But I've already had more laughs than I've had a long time watching a slew of flicks where great actors were hired to do dreck with no apparent motivation.I'm also a high school dropout a college dropout which means I've taken various tests of achievement and intelligence the GED the SATs and various other limiting mind control efforts fortunately I am now several decades old and well beyond the reach of the academia nuts who currently crank our future fellow citizens out like Twinkies i.e. old enough to have seen their results.Hence I get the premise and I love these characters. I find this film vastly more entertaining than any Ocean's XX movie made after the Rat Pack got it right the first time. This is more fun than Hackers and since I also spent years at IBM yes I loved that one too but I'm giving this a ten for the acting the story and the fresh handling of the genre.If it disappoints in the end I may come back and rate it again but for now I'm laughing my ass off. Great commentary on our educational bubble system great fun with each of the characters. Especially Roy I eagerly await his next scene. Though all these kids are good and the dialog is exceptional.Okay this previous post hasn't been posted yet so now I can conclude great stuff. I repeat for the genre. Some of the best out there.

	onyx:emotionText "Of COURSE this is not Gone With the Wind or The Godfather or Apocalypse Now it's a teen flick and I find it absolutely hilarious and vastly underrated by some very snobbish commentary I've read.First please understand that this reviewer is several things A BIG movie buff capable of separating movies into genres and mental compartments rather than comparing apples to oranges in boneheaded fashion I am not finished watching the DVD yet it's on pause but...I do that watch and simultaneously check out IMDb part of the fun I'm utterly enamored of the freshness of this film. So far. But I've already had more laughs than I've had a long time watching a slew of flicks where great actors were hired to do dreck with no apparent motivation.I'm also a high school dropout a college dropout which means I've taken various tests of achievement and intelligence the GED the SATs and various other limiting mind control efforts fortunately I am now several decades old and well beyond the reach of the academia nuts who currently crank our future fellow citizens out like Twinkies i.e. old enough to have seen their results.Hence I get the premise and I love these characters. I find this film vastly more entertaining than any Ocean's XX movie made after the Rat Pack got it right the first time. This is more fun than Hackers and since I also spent years at IBM yes I loved that one too but I'm giving this a ten for the acting the story and the fresh handling of the genre.If it disappoints in the end I may come back and rate it again but for now I'm laughing my ass off. Great commentary on our educational bubble system great fun with each of the characters. Especially Roy I eagerly await his next scene. Though all these kids are good and the dialog is exceptional.Okay this previous post hasn't been posted yet so now I can conclude great stuff. I repeat for the genre. Some of the best out there. And we'll see some of these kids later. But really a great movie. Not necessarily a keeper a watch again for sure. Still a 10 for it's intended scope and I'm still a critical bastard. Loved it.";

From different backgrounds each of them have their own reasons that force them to cheat on the test.When I saw the preview I thought it was going to be a funny movie but when I saw the movie there were no new jokes. The trailer had used all the funny moments and had cheated the audience. My expectations for the film weren't high but I was expecting it to be at least above average. The film really had nothing new to offer. Just some recycled jokes that we have seen before. What keeps the film from completely sinking is the cast. Some aren't very good while others actually give engaging performances.Scarlett Johansson gives the best performance out of everyone. She held my attention whenever she appeared on screen. Erika Christensen was also pretty good a little bland though. The rest of the cast were all pretty bland and wooden. Chris Evans just doesn't have what it takes to be a leading man. He was so unconvincing in this film. Bryan Greenberg was completely bland and pale. Darius Miles may be a good basketball player but he can't act at all. The worst performance goes to Leonardo Nam since they hyped him up as being so funny and he completely stunk. Matthew Lillard is underused in a small role. Which is too bad since his character could have been good.Maybe my expectations were too high since The Perfect Score is directed by Brian Robbins. He brought us classic films like Good Burger and Ready to Rumble. He just doesn't have a very good imagination and his idea of comedy is weak. The ending is at least honorable well sort of. They do get the answers to the test but decide not to use it. It was kind of stupid because they already knew half of the answers to the test. I know this is supposed to be a stupid teen movie but it should at least have been a funny one. In the end The Perfect Score is a huge letdown that's worth skipping. Rating 410".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not know why I went to see The Perfect Score earlier today. I have this huge ego thing that I should give almost every film a chance no matter how bad it looks. I can also admit that I am a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson because of her work in both Ghost World and Lost in Translation. This film to me looked rather Idiotic even at first but I figured it couldn't be as bad as it looks. Well sadly I was wrong but please continue reading my review as I rip apart the disaster that is the Perfect Score.The Perfect Score is about two best friends Kyle Chris Evans and Matt Bryan Greenberg who want to steal the answers to the SAT in order to achieve their own personal goals. Well they decide they can't do it alone so they need the help of Francesca Scarlett Johansson to help. They need her because guess what her Daddy owns the building where the make the SAT test. Oh how convenient. Well then Kyle falls for Anna Erika Christensen who is the 2nd smartest girl in school but for some reason is afraid she will fail the SAT. Well sooner or later Anna tells Desmond Darious Miles who asks Anna for help on the SAT because he needs to get into college to play Basketball. Well before all is said and done Roy Leonardo Nam overhears a conversation that Kyle and Matt are having in the bathroom about robbing the SAT answers so he too wants in. Together these 6 morons will work together to plan the ultimate heist to steal the answers to the SATs and achieve the perfect score.Well lets tackle the films acting first. Well it's very amateurish. Scarlett Johansson who is a brilliant actress and she proves so in such great movies like Ghost World and Lost in Translation is truly horrible in the film. She plays a smart slutty girl who does nothing but hate daddy and wear push up bras. I normally don't make sexual jokes but I think if anyone in this film should get an applause it should be Scarlett Johansson's boobs. They gave a terrific performance. Scarlett I beg of you no more bad films you're a terrific actress read the scripts and say no to the bad ones. I know you can do it. I also usually enjoy the work of Erika Christensen who starred in the films Homeroom Traffic and Swim fan. Once again she is useless here but at least her character isn't as annoying as rest. Leonardo Nam was the worst character in the whole film. The always high Chinese guy. Oh my god I wanted to run for the exit when he popped on screen. Awful who writes these freaking characters? Chris Evans who starred in one of the worst films I have ever dared to witness Not Another Teen Movie was actually tolerable in this film although a few more acting classes may be necessary. And lastly Bryan Greenberg and Darious Miles seemed like they were trying to make the lousy script work but failed at it horribly.The director of this masterpiece is named Brian Robbins who brought us other Academy Award winning films including the wonderful Ready to Rumble with David Arquette and Varsity Blues with James Van Der Beek. Needless to say he hasn't made too good of choices in the directing category. He actually produced Radio which was a huge surprise to me since I think that's one of the only films I have seen that he has been apart of that hasn't sucked! I know I am sounding mean but there are far to many crappy films being made each year so I feel I have to really criticize the ones that are truly awful. I am actually going to give Brian Robbins one last chance in 2005 when he directs the remake of the Shaggy Dog with Tim Allen. I am a big Tim Allen fan so if he can screw that movie up well then I will never watch another film he directs.The funny thing about this film is the fact that it actually took three writers to write this piece of garbage yes three. Mark Schwahn who wrote the horrible 2000 teen flick Whatever it takes Marc Hyman who wrote the flop Osmosis Jones and finally Jon Zack who wrote 2001s Out Cold which has the honors of being on my worst movies ever made list. I guess I should expect this script to be every bit as bad as it was just looking at who wrote it. I mean the dialog was so crappy. It looked like a five year old wrote it. And who was responsible for putting in the Matrix joke. Haven't we learned Matrix jokes aren't funny and never will be? The script is truly insulting. The whole movie was pointless. I ask if these 6 morons can take the test on a computer and get a perfect 1600 in order to get the answers. That's right they actually have to make a perfect score in order to even get the answers. I mean what the hell? Why steal the test if you can take the test and get all the answers right. How stupid! And also who was responsible for the great job on the blatant product placement? The greatest line ever used in a film is when Scarlett's character says to Erika's character You look comfortable in your Old Navy cotton pullover It was like what the hell? Where did that come from? Needless to say the script was horrible and the film was completely humorless.So was their anything remotely good about the film? Sadly there really wasn't except Scarlett's boobs. Its a shame to see both Scarlett  Erika wasting their talent. Believe me its there just watch some of their other films and you will see it. This movie has been the worst film I seen so far this year and damn it its only February but luckily so far it has been the only bad film I have seen. I wanted to like this film no matter how dumb it looked. I wanted to actually have a good laugh or two and watch these kids steal the SAT. I just didn't know I was going to be in pain for the entire 1hr and 40mins the film lasted. I can't recommend anyone to watch this film. I give this film a very low 210. I am sure it will be one of the year's worst films.".

I am actually going to give Brian Robbins one last chance in 2005 when he directs the remake of the Shaggy Dog with Tim Allen. I am a big Tim Allen fan so if he can screw that movie up well then I will never watch another film he directs.The funny thing about this film is the fact that it actually took three writers to write this piece of garbage yes three. Mark Schwahn who wrote the horrible 2000 teen flick Whatever it takes Marc Hyman who wrote the flop Osmosis Jones and finally Jon Zack who wrote 2001s Out Cold which has the honors of being on my worst movies ever made list. I guess I should expect this script to be every bit as bad as it was just looking at who wrote it. I mean the dialog was so crappy. It looked like a five year old wrote it. And who was responsible for putting in the Matrix joke. Haven't we learned Matrix jokes aren't funny and never will be? The script is truly insulting. The whole movie was pointless. I ask if these 6 morons can take the test on a computer and get a perfect 1600 in order to get the answers. That's right they actually have to make a perfect score in order to even get the answers. I mean what the hell? Why steal the test if you can take the test and get all the answers right. How stupid! And also who was responsible for the great job on the blatant product placement? The greatest line ever used in a film is when Scarlett's character says to Erika's character You look comfortable in your Old Navy cotton pullover It was like what the hell? Where did that come from? Needless to say the script was horrible and the film was completely humorless.So was their anything remotely good about the film? Sadly there really wasn't except Scarlett's boobs. Its a shame to see both Scarlett  Erika wasting their talent. Believe me its there just watch some of their other films and you will see it. This movie has been the worst film I seen so far this year and damn it its only February but luckily so far it has been the only bad film I have seen. I wanted to like this film no matter how dumb it looked. I wanted to actually have a good laugh or two and watch these kids steal the SAT. I just didn't know I was going to be in pain for the entire 1hr and 40mins the film lasted. I can't recommend anyone to watch this film. I give this film a very low 210. I am sure it will be one of the year's worst films.";

So the middle of the movie plays out like any heist caper the gathering of the team the planning the beginning of the heist operation. It seems like they end up on a random discovery process where the final team is made up of 6 high school seniors. One needs to get to Maryland where his girlfriend already is. Another second in her class but not good at taking tests wants to get into Brown. Another has always wanted to be an architect and wants to get into a certain school. Another is a star basketball player and in real life an NBA star whose mom wants him to go to St. John's to get a diploma also. And the other two just want the thrill of being involved.Erika Christensen is Anna Ross who is a model student and daughter has never even broken curfew. Scarlett Johansson is Francesca Curtis her dad ignores her while always chasing young tail. Darius Miles is Desmond Rhodes the basketball player. My favorite character was played by Leonardo Nam as Roy the kid at the very bottom of the class and who always seems stoned but is in fact brilliant with computers and higher mathematics. He just lacks direction and motivation.SPOILERS. Francesca has access to the building and gets cards and plans.

The guard is coming one of the boys sacrifices himself by appearing to be taking a computer monitor is arrested while all the others escape.

The film is narrated by a socalled stoner who sounds more mentally challenged than stoned. The only time I actually laughed in the entire film was when they played Because I Got High... The characters make very stupid decisions and the movie is a constant drag. The all too happy ending does not surprise just disappoints and makes you wonder why on earth you just watched this movie. For those who are saying this movie is a great teen flick I heartily disagree.

The plot is why they get at least a few stars but not many.Where The Perfect Score falters the most is with the 'hooks' MTV tried to give it it's narrated by the stoner and everyone speaks with only swear words. Stoners of course typically speak slower than an average person which just make all the predictable things he's going to say and the inevitable events happen even slower. The exaggerated use of swear words I'm assuming is just to give the movie an edge. Just remember that this is produced by MTV that should be all I have to say.".

These are characters we've all seen many times before including such classics as the sports star the overachiever the stoner and the betterthanthou rebel. They are all painfully predictably clich. The plot is why they get at least a few stars but not many.Where The Perfect Score falters the most is with the 'hooks' MTV tried to give it it's narrated by the stoner and everyone speaks with only swear words. Stoners of course typically speak slower than an average person which just make all the predictable things he's going to say and the inevitable events happen even slower. The exaggerated use of swear words I'm assuming is just to give the movie an edge. Just remember that this is produced by MTV that should be all I have to say.";

The film had world premiered earlier during the fest on Sept 9 at the Isabel Bader Theatre.This road movie with touches of dark comedy was a pleasure to see and touched the heart many times. It is story of a Kurdish Mozart as imagined by the director  a fictional living legend Kurdish composermusician with a whole orchestra of sons and daughters and his struggle to get to a major music festival in Iraqi Kurdistan from Irani Kurdistan. It was fascinating and lifeaffirming.Even as the film had several moments of desperation and despair on the way the whole thing was lightened by touches like a comedic bus driver various moments of interaction between the father and his sometimes reluctant or rebellious sons and the resilience of a young woman named Papooli Butterfly who was born with the name Niwe mung Half Moon.Director Bahman Ghobadi was an enthusiastic showup for the 3rd screening and gave many interesting tidbits during his QA such as info on the banning of female singing and musicians in present day Iran for the past 28 years that his selfcensorship on the film did not help it to get past Irani censors so that he may recut the film for the later general international release now anyway restoring more scenes of female singing  playing and that the whole 7 months of seeking for travel permits subplot in this film was a nod to the struggles he had to get his earlier Turtles Can Fly film made.This film was 1 of 7 in TIFF 2006's Mozart  A New Crowned Hope series which is a sneak peek at the series before it screens at the Vienna Mozart Year Festival in December 2006.Highly recommended and a worthy successor to the director's previous films.".

But from this boisterous opening there emerges a slowpaced road movie in which a group of Kurdish musicians undertake a bus journey to perform at a concert in Iraqi Kurdistan. Their trek takes us through some stunningly bleak scenery from dullbrown dusty plains to snowcapped peaks and towns clinging to mountainsides.The most striking scene in the film features a town full of hundreds of exiled female singers who line the street and tops of buildings as the travelling musicians retrieve a fellow performer for the concert. The absurdity of this acts as a clever commentary on the banning of female musicians in Islamic Iran and there are countless further insights into the lives of Kurdish people throughout Half Moon. The nervewracking confrontations with border guards testify to the great difficulties faced by the Kurds in being divided across four countries and treated frequently as secondclass citizens. Somewhat strangely for a film about travelling musicians the film does not afford a great deal of attention to the music of the people whom it portrays but there are nevertheless some very interesting sounds to be heard here.Engaging with the storyline can be difficult at times due the contrasting moods and a tendency to jump back and forth in time. Although not often laughoutloud in nature there are many moments of warmhearted humour during the film. On the other hand dark omens abound throughout and create a growing sense of foreboding. The combination of these elements seems incongruous on occasion but they are drawn together in a moving climax. I found parts of the film falling into place long after I left my seat in the cinema and I regard that as a rare and valuable thing.".

An elderly man Moma portrayed with great range and nuance by Ismail Ghaffari a celebrity singer in his native Iraqi Kurdistan sets out by bus from Iran with an entourage of his musician sons to his homeland to perform in a large public concert. With seven months of rehearsals official permits and visas carefully arranged nothing could go wrong right? Well this is border country between bitter enemies Iran Iraq and the highly marginalised Kurds who are basically a dispossessed people without a country and held in contempt by both countries as well as Turkey. This film illustrates what can go wrong.While beautifully filmed in some beautifully stark landscapes the real richness of Half Moon  like most Iranian films screened here  is in the simplicity of the story and the attention to detail to the struggles of seemingly mundane activities. The cultural aspects are especially fascinating. The authority of Moma as the family patriarch is evident his middle aged sons all hold him in high esteem and cower before him. Not unexpectedlyas Iran does not allow women to sing in public there are specific issues with involving a woman in such a cultural endeavour.The family and social dynamics depicted breathe life into this little gem of a film. Music is a universal language that binds people so when contempt is shown by the Iranian border guards it has a powerful effect on the audience. My inlaws are similarly musicians of a dispossessed people Pontians Greek orthodox who once lived in Turkey so I could relate well to the scenario in the film.It was interesting to see the advancement of technologies such as cell phones and wireless internet laptops creeping into these otherwise isolated communities. The film is full of beautifully understated performances and naturalistic humour and drama. I highly recommend it and like most Iranian films I have seen is something I would take my six year old son to see were it to get a theatrical release.".

	schema:headline " Another winner from Iran in Kurdish by Bahman Ghobadi";
	schema:reviewBody "Kurdish Persian director Bahman Ghobadi scores again at San Sebastian with the Kurdish language film Half MoonBy Alex Deleon image1.jpeg Basic Plot Mamo an old and legendary Kurdish musician living in Iran plans to give one final concert over the border in Iraqi Kurdistan. Rounding up his ten sons he sets out for the long arduous journey in a derelict bus while plagued by a recurrent vision of his own death at half moon. Bahman Ghobadi's new IranianKurdish offering Half Moon Niwemang was in competition at the 2006 San Sebastian Film Festival. Ghobadi is a favored son here in Donostia where his last film Turtles Can Fly was unanimously awarded the Best Film Golden Concha two years ago. The current work with a lengthy running time of just under two hours again focuses on the stateless Kurdish community of Iran and is rich in Kurdish cultural and folkloric material with the usual sparkling natural performances he invariably draws from his predominantly Kurdish performers and the huge panoramic landscapes of the barren mountainous Persian terrain which have come to typify his visual style. Half Moon might be characterized as a road movie in which a group of traditional Kurdish musicians consisting of Maestro Mamo and his ten sons set out in a school bus from Tehran for the border area where Iran abuts against both Turkey and Iraq hoping to stage a musical event with traditional instruments for their Kurdish brethren over the border in Iraq  now a possibility thanks to the recent fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. At the border they run into unpleasant military confrontations with near disastrous results for their treasured project. Mamo Ismail Ghaffari the handsome old man who is the leader of the delegation is so distraught that he gets into the coffin where the Kurdish instruments have been concealed and asks to be buried alive. At the touchy border crossing they are met by a beautiful mysterious young woman who offers her assistance in getting them past the ominous border guards.Half Moon  while dealing with the precarious position of Kurds in this strife torn part of the world is much lighter in tone than his previous Turtles Can Fly and is almost a comedy but with serious political overtones. The beauty at the border is played by Golshifte Farahani. currently Iran's most popular leading lady of the silver screen. With her looks and on screen charisma its not hard to see why. She reminds me of a cross between Italy's Monica Belluci and Pakistan's former president Benazir Bhutto. With Iran's growing presence on the world film scene it seems to be only a matter of time before this striking actress is discovered by some Western director and breaks out into an international career. Golshifte was present at the press conference and speaks fluent English so that language would be no hindrance. But if Hollywood gets their hands on her they'll probably change her name to something that sounds less shifty and easier to remember.PS Golshifte later had to leave Iran after defying the clerics and has indeed broken out into an international career without changing her name notably in films by director Ridley Scott. Unfortunately not yet in the kind of leading roles that would properly showcase the talents and beauty of this remarkable Iranian actress now 33. In January 2012 it was reported that Golshifteh would not be welcome back in Iran after posing nude in a French magazine. Britain's Daily Telegraph reported that government officials told Golshifteh that Iran does not need actors or artists like you. You may offer your artistic services somewhere else. This she continues to do while having taken up residence in France. Director Ghobadi has also been forced into exile after his underground film Nobody Knows About Persian Cats was viewed as subversive by the reigning powers in 2009. ".

But if Hollywood gets their hands on her they'll probably change her name to something that sounds less shifty and easier to remember.PS Golshifte later had to leave Iran after defying the clerics and has indeed broken out into an international career without changing her name notably in films by director Ridley Scott. Unfortunately not yet in the kind of leading roles that would properly showcase the talents and beauty of this remarkable Iranian actress now 33. In January 2012 it was reported that Golshifteh would not be welcome back in Iran after posing nude in a French magazine. Britain's Daily Telegraph reported that government officials told Golshifteh that Iran does not need actors or artists like you. You may offer your artistic services somewhere else. This she continues to do while having taken up residence in France. Director Ghobadi has also been forced into exile after his underground film Nobody Knows About Persian Cats was viewed as subversive by the reigning powers in 2009. ";

	schema:reviewBody "Half Moon original Kurdish title Niwe Mang director Bahman Ghobadi. Viewed at San Sebastian film festival 2006.Thursday day number eight of the festival was packed from stem to stern with significant film viewings three major press conferences and meetings with colleagues leaving little time to write about these events in any detail. The day started with the press screening in the main hall of the Kursaal Center of Bahman Ghobadi's new IranianKurdish offering Half Moon Niwemang. Ghobadi is a favored son here in Donostia where his last film Turtles Can Fly copped a unanimous decision for the Best Film Golden Concha two years ago.The current work with a lengthy running time of just under two hours again focuses on the stateless Kurdish community of Iran and is rich in Kurdish cultural and folkloric material with the usual sparkling natural performances he invariably draws from his predominantly Kurdish performers and the huge panoramic landscapes of the barren mountainous Persian terrain which have come to typify his visual style.Half Moon might be characterized as a road movie in which a group of traditional Kurdish musicians consisting of Maestro Mamo and his ten sons set out in a school bus from Tehran for the border area where Iran abuts against both Turkey and Iraq hoping to stage a musical event with traditional instruments for their Kurdish bretheren in Iraq  now a possibility thanks to the recent fall of the Saddam Hussein regime.At the border they run into unpleasant military confrontations with near disastrous results for their treasured project. Mamo Ismail Ghaffari the handsome old man who is the leader of the delegation is so distraught that he gets into the coffin where the Kurdish instruments have been concealed and asks to be buried alive. At the touchy border crossing they are met by a beautiful mysterious young woman who offers her assistance in getting them past the ominous border guards. Half Moon while dealing with the precarious position of Kurds in this strife torn part of the world is much lighter in tone than hisu previous Turtles Can Fly and is almost a comedy but with serious political overtones. The beauty at the border is played by Golshifte Farahani currently Iran's most popular leading lady of the silver screen. With her looks and on screen charisma its not hard to see why.PHOTO Golshifte Farahani She reminds me of a cross between Italy's Monica Belluci and Pakistan's former president Benazir Bhutto. With Iran's growing presence on the world film scene I would be willing to bet my bottom Euro that it's only a matter of time before this striking actress is discovered by some Western director and breaks out into an international career. She was present at the press conference and speaks English so that language would be no hindrance.At the press conference following the screening director Ghobadi was very relaxed often smiling and though speaking in Farsi through an interpreter looked every questioner straight in the eye while his interpreter translated into Spanish. This was a trilingual press conference as some questions had to wind their way from English through Spanish then into Farsi  and back again by the same route. Fun! An important question put to Ghobadi by Steve Ashton of the Napa Valley Wine Country festival in California was whether or not the film was censored or hampered in any way in Iran. Ghobadi replied that first of all he received no internal support to make the film in Iran and therefore had to import equipment from Europe this was an IranIraqAustraFrance coproduction and when finished it was banned from screens in Iran. The DOP incidentally was a New Zealander Nigel Bluck. This is the director's fourth feature since his highly acclaimed debut A Time For Drunken Horses in 2000. All have been shown at important festivals Mar del Plata Cannes and the last two here in Donostia.At 37 Bahman Ghobadi would appear to have a long road ahead of himself and is clearly a name to remember.".

One of the main problems with the film is that the viewer can see right away that neither of these relationships is going to work out  the older man is married and just looking for cheap thrills the younger man acts borderline psychotic right from the start  and you wonder how the heroine who seems fairly smart in most ways can be so naive as to not see that these two men are unworthy of her time. Perhaps the two most likable characters  the heroine's uncle and the young man's little sister  have very little screen time. The film is very wellacted especially by Ludivine Sagnier and Francois Berland but ultimately it is a minor work for someone of Claude Chabrol's great reputation. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Chabrol's latest film La Fille coupe en deux is a barbed comedy set in the city of Lyons. A charming young TV weather person Gabrielle Deneige Ludivine Sagnier suddenly finds two men competing for her affections. The successful writer Charles SaintDenis Francois Berleand is appearing on TV when he first runs into Gabrielle her mother Marie Bunel works at the bookstore where he's later signing his new book. Though he's a good thirty years her senior they feel an instant connection. To her he's sexy fascinating and rich. But not nearly so rich as Paul Gaudens Benoit Magimel the capricious young heir to a vast local pharmaceutical fortune. With his tinted Napoleonic hairdo and flamboyant wardrobe Magimel spins onto each scene like some spoiled princeling. He's amusing absurd and a bit menacing. There are obvious hints that he may be completely wacko. He spots Gabrielle too at the book signing falls for her and woos her aggressively henceforth. SaintDenis lives with professed contentment and serenity in a splendid superbly brittle ultramodern house in the country and has a vivacious and understanding and longstanding wife Dona Valeria Cavalli. Gaudens lives in a mansion with his widowed mother Caroline Sihot and two grown sisters. Both men have some dark scandals and improprieties hidden in their past though we don't learn much about them. In this relatively provincial world they are well acquainted with and have always cordially detested each other.It appears that Gabrielle is led into some indecencies by Charles whose special club and intown piedaterre she visits more than once. Preposterous as it may seem Paul who's headoverheels for Gabrielle appoints himself Gabrielle's moral savior. Though she's sought after by Canal and her current boss wants to make her the emcee of a new show Gabrielle eschews these opportunities for advancement and instead devotes nearly all her time to pursuing or being pursued by these two men enjoying the attentions of the curiously endearing Paul but running off the instant the sophisticated Charles summons herbecause he's the one she truly adores. In the French cinema older men are quite commonly seen as the more attractive. Both Berleand a convincing ladies man and the visually transformed Magimel by now a Chabrol regular if not a male muse are splendid in their roles. Sagnier whom Americans will probably best remember as Tinker Belle or the naughty young woman in Ozon's Swimming Pool projects a world of beauty charm vivacity and relative innocence.The Girl Cut in Two is highly amusing. The script by Chabrol's longtime assistant Cecile Maistre sparkles with witty zingers in every scene and has particular fun with the literary world intellectual TV shows and as always with the director the gilded squalor of the upper bourgeoisie. This being Lyons one of France's chief gastronomic capitals there are lots of good restaurants and there's lots of good wine many coupes of good champagne are tossed back. Nifty sports cars are drivenand when Paul arrives anywhere in his he leaves it at the door and tosses away the ticket afterwards with a disdain any driver would envy. For a good part of the time each scene is more fun than the last.The dialogue is smooth and glib but it's also smart. This isn't a murder mystery though a pistol does appear and later it is used. It's more a portrait of emotional conflict. And it treats issues of high and low of love trumping ambition and then turning out to be nave about wealth and madness about men and women youth and age. At the center of it is Gabrielle's search for love. But in focusing on Paul and Charles Gabrielle is of course carrying out that search in two quite wrong places. Both men are as deeply tempting as they are flawed so it's no wonder she wavers hopelessly between them.Gabrielle marries Paul but only on the rebound from Charles. This leads to unhappiness discontent and finally violence. The film has transposed to contemporary times without loss of credibility the story of the 1906 murder in New York of the famous American architect and womanizer Stanford White represented here by the writer by the husband of his latest mistress. It's a theme dealt with before notably in Richard Fleischer's 1955 Girl in the Red Velvet Swing and Milos Forman's 1981 screen adaption of E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime. But the MaistreChabrol treatment is unique.The Girl Cut in Two is one of Chabrol's lightest and brightest and most buoyant films. It may not as few can rest on the top shelf with his absolute classics but it is the best thing he's done in years.The film was shown at the New York Film Festival 2007 in September it opened in France in early August.".

In this relatively provincial world they are well acquainted with and have always cordially detested each other.It appears that Gabrielle is led into some indecencies by Charles whose special club and intown piedaterre she visits more than once. Preposterous as it may seem Paul who's headoverheels for Gabrielle appoints himself Gabrielle's moral savior. Though she's sought after by Canal and her current boss wants to make her the emcee of a new show Gabrielle eschews these opportunities for advancement and instead devotes nearly all her time to pursuing or being pursued by these two men enjoying the attentions of the curiously endearing Paul but running off the instant the sophisticated Charles summons herbecause he's the one she truly adores. In the French cinema older men are quite commonly seen as the more attractive. Both Berleand a convincing ladies man and the visually transformed Magimel by now a Chabrol regular if not a male muse are splendid in their roles. Sagnier whom Americans will probably best remember as Tinker Belle or the naughty young woman in Ozon's Swimming Pool projects a world of beauty charm vivacity and relative innocence.The Girl Cut in Two is highly amusing. The script by Chabrol's longtime assistant Cecile Maistre sparkles with witty zingers in every scene and has particular fun with the literary world intellectual TV shows and as always with the director the gilded squalor of the upper bourgeoisie. This being Lyons one of France's chief gastronomic capitals there are lots of good restaurants and there's lots of good wine many coupes of good champagne are tossed back. Nifty sports cars are drivenand when Paul arrives anywhere in his he leaves it at the door and tosses away the ticket afterwards with a disdain any driver would envy. For a good part of the time each scene is more fun than the last.The dialogue is smooth and glib but it's also smart. This isn't a murder mystery though a pistol does appear and later it is used. It's more a portrait of emotional conflict. And it treats issues of high and low of love trumping ambition and then turning out to be nave about wealth and madness about men and women youth and age. At the center of it is Gabrielle's search for love. But in focusing on Paul and Charles Gabrielle is of course carrying out that search in two quite wrong places. Both men are as deeply tempting as they are flawed so it's no wonder she wavers hopelessly between them.Gabrielle marries Paul but only on the rebound from Charles. This leads to unhappiness discontent and finally violence. The film has transposed to contemporary times without loss of credibility the story of the 1906 murder in New York of the famous American architect and womanizer Stanford White represented here by the writer by the husband of his latest mistress. It's a theme dealt with before notably in Richard Fleischer's 1955 Girl in the Red Velvet Swing and Milos Forman's 1981 screen adaption of E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime. But the MaistreChabrol treatment is unique.The Girl Cut in Two is one of Chabrol's lightest and brightest and most buoyant films. It may not as few can rest on the top shelf with his absolute classics but it is the best thing he's done in years.The film was shown at the New York Film Festival 2007 in September it opened in France in early August.";

Since Gabrielle senses that Charles is out of the picture she decides to marry Paul on the rebound. When SaintDenis shows up again it's already too late.This film that evidently was made for television shows a different Chabrol a man who has made a career as a master of the suspense. Alas there is not so much in this picture but the viewer is hooked from the beginning of the story as he knows there will be fireworks out of the elements at stake.The three principals Ludivine Sagnier Francois Berleand and Benoit Magimel that appear as the angles of the romantic trio do fine work under Mr. Chabrol's direction. We particularly liked the work of Mr. Berleand who gives us an excellent chance to enjoy his nuanced performance. Ms. Saigner keeps getting better all the time and the same could be said about Mr. Magimel a promising young actor who worked with the director in La fleur du mal. Caroline Sihol who is seen as Paul's mother gives a touch of class as the rich and controlling society woman.Even a minor Chabrol is better than most of what comes out of France these days.".

And if all of his movies are not as good as Hitchcock's ones none of them actually I'm sure his last one would have amused Sir Alfred for it's certainly one of his richest and intriguing movie since many years. I thing I've not been such intrigued by a Chabrol's since L'enfer in 1994 and its No end ending.La Fille coupe en deux apparently deals with the same subject as L'enfer  love and it's tragic consequences. But if L'enfer mostly dealt with madness and jealousy La fille... approaches tragedy but always in a cynical and almost funny way  Chabrol's universe is alway gamefull with the thematic of desire. It's the girl cut in half of the tittle that crystallizes this desire  Gabrielle Aurore Deneige Ludivine Sagnier a young TVhost desires an older and decadent writer Charles Saint Denis the great Franois Berland and is desired by a young and crazy aristocrat Benot Magimel it's the first time to me that he's quite acceptable in a movie. Chabrol plays for a time with his characters ans his spectators who don't exactly know where he wants to bring us. But the game is interesting enough to be played. This movie looks a lot like Woody Allen's Scoop with Ludivide Sagner as a french Scarlet Johanson. Chabrol even quotes Woody Allen in the movie and shares with him the same tragic but insouciant thriller tone. But it's really the similarity with another director that stroke me with this movie. It's the first time that a Chabrol's movie strangely sometimes looks like a Brisseau's. Chabrol uses here as in Brisseau's Choses Secrtes symbolic feminine mythological figures in order to develop his thematics  it's particularly striking in the dichotomously representation of Charles Saint Denis' two woman  his white and angellike wife and his dark and mysterious Capucine. But it's mostly in the desire's representation in the strange club where Saint Denis likes to go that the two directors share some common points. Of course whereas Brisseau is more than explicit Chabrol doesn't show anything but the moral fable aspect of the movie with a Hitchcock's influence in the way Chabrol suspenses the desire representation makes this movie quiet near to Brisseau's universe.Anyway it's been a very long time since a Chabrol's movie didn't appear to me as rich original and surprising as this one.".

As for fans of Chabrol and this goes without saying it's not a great film it's a sign that like Woody Allen he isn't going anywhere and still has some ideas kicking around.It's about the effect Gabrielle has on a man twice her age novelist Charles SaintDenis Francois Berleand in a quietly powerful and thoughtful performance and a spoiled and possibly emotionally combustible guy more her age Paul Benoit Magimel very good in that his performance is narrowed to being this creepy person. She really is head over heels for the older man who sadly is also happily married to his wife of many years while Paul does all but wave a sign saying pick me I'm free pick me with the line I get what I always want crossed out save for when he's drunk. It's like a double Catch 22 situation leading up to a marriage a murder and other occurrences. Chabrol presents all of this in what appears to be a straightforward style which usually suits him best and within this comes out the moral complexities.This could be enough for a decent movie if maybe a little slight in the mostly bourgeois atmosphere but Chabrol heaps on some social commentary to boot it's not just Paul but also Charles that put up a kind of front of complacency that is hard to crack for Gabrielle. It's slightly playful mostly harsh but always controlled satire not of the laughoutloud kind but where one might chuckle or raise an eyebrow at a plot point or scene of specific acting. It's an interesting approach which isn't entirely effective but never makes it boring. A Girl Cut in Two is acted just as it should Caroline Silhol particularly gives a deliciously icy performance as Paul's mother and is written and directed with a knowledge of its audience. 7.510".

But not much. Very lazy work suggest you read a telephone directory instead it will give you more insight into the human condition.";

Oscar WildeI'm cut in two myself wanting A Girl Cut in Two to be a companion piece to Patrice Leconte's unforgettable Girl on the Bridge 1999 and yet realizing it is wrong to expect such a complement. French icon Claude Chabrol's Girl Cut is an amusing and agonizing romance between an older writer and a young TV weather girl about 30 years in between their ages.

The triangle illustrates the complex yearnings of an attractive young woman whose mother Marie Bunel spies Gabrielle's need for the father figure as well as her own wish for her daughter to be financially comfortable. The warfare among the classes is typically Francaise.As for Gabrielle it is never clear where her love for the old man comes from for she never seems to read his works and their interaction before the first tryst is superficial.

The former Cahiers du Cinema journalist was famously a huge fan of the work of Alfred Hitchcock writing about the Master of Suspense at length for the magazine before Chabrol's own work weaved together Hitchcock's sublime blend of melodrama and tension with Chabrol's own French New Wave his debut Le Beau Serge is widely considered the first. This 2007 effort does much of the same but the emphasis is more on the melodrama for the main bulk of the film and it lacks the New Wave edge of his early greater works.Pretty young weathergirl Gabrielle Ludivine Sagnier catches the eye of the rich and famous author Charles SaintDenis Francois Berleand when the latter is interviewed at the TV station she works for. Charles performs a book signing at Gabrielle's mother's book store where he is confronted by the filthyrich heir to a pharmaceutical company Paul Gaudens Benoit Magimel while Charles invites Gabrielle to accompany him to an auction. The clearly unhinged Paul also lusts after Gabrielle and begins an aggressive pursuit of her while she is off falling in love with the arrogant and pretentious and married Charles.Sagnier is particularly lovely as a character who may have come across as spoiled and selfish if not handled quite so delicately. There are fewer things quite as uncomfortable to watch than a nice girl caught up in a love triangle with two absolute arseholes and Berleand and Magimel certainly bring a complexity and even flashes of sympathy to their loathsome manchildren. Gabrielle is pulled back and forth between the two  the metaphor of the title also plays out almost literally in a slightly surreal final scene  and this goes on for quite a while. It gradually builds up to the inevitable and the film begins to feel more juicy however by the time this happens there aren't quite enough minutes remaining to fully explore its full potential.

	schema:headline " A MaySeptember romance whose effects last forever";
	schema:reviewBody "Romantic liaisons between younger women and older men aren't supposed to last. The initial impulse isn't supposed to last the incompatibilities in age and lack of shared cultural experiences are supposed to prevent a deep bond from forming and the censure of polite society is supposed to eventually cause the parties to sever their ties. Yet what if the initial impulse is deep enough and various parties around the lovers are rash enough to trigger effects which last for the lifetimes of both participants? This is the intriguing scenario explored by directorwriter Claude Chabrol assisted by writer Cecile Maistre in A Girl Cut in Two.The May of the romance is a young onair television personality wonderfully played by Ludivine Sagnier who in this film is the embodiment of the expression a breath of fresh air. The September of the romance is an aging author and intellectual capably portrayed by Francois Berleand. Sagnier manages to demonstrate some believable longing and chemistry towards Berleand even though their scenes together are not explicit Sagnier fans will see a lot more of her so to speak in the film Swimming Pool. Unfortunately for our lovers not only is Berleand's character married as well as fussed over by a publicity agent played by Mathilda May with whom he is also dallying on the side but Sagnier's character is the desired object of affection of a brash spoiled young heir played by Benoit Magimel. This combustible mix eventually explodes as it must.A Girl Cut in Two is a very French film and will appeal to those seeking an immersion in French culture society and morals. The setting is not Paris but rather the smaller southern French city of Lyon which is beautifully captured on film. But the most intriguing aspect of the film is Berleand's character and what his many actions and deceptions say about French society and morals in the early 21st century. Berleand's character although he is exalted for the truths contained in his writings invents different truths to suit his circumstances and eventually pays a price for doing so.Ludivine Sagnier fans who appreciate her for more than just the charms of her beauty and body will enjoy A Girl Cut in Two as will those seeking a thought provoking film about uppercrust French society.".

In both occasions the cynical Charles meets the witty and gorgeous TV weathergirl Gabrielle Aurore Deneige Ludivine Sagnier whose mother Marie Deneige Marie Bunel works in the bookstore. Meanwhile Gabrielle is promoted to host a show on television and is wooed by the arrogant heir to a pharmaceutical fortune Paul Andr Claude Gaudens Benot Magimel who is Charles' enemy and invites Gabrielle to have dinner with him.Charles invites Gabrielle to go with him to an auction and then they go to his apartment in Paris. The inexperienced Gabrielle has one night stand with him and falls in love with Charles who teaches kinky sex to her. Then he brings Gabrielle to a men's club where she is perverted. Sooner Charles travels to London and forgets Gabrielle. Gabrielle is lovesick and depressed without strength to live. Paul insists in visiting her and finally Marie agrees. Paul and Gabrielle travel to Lisbon and Gabrielle accepts to marry him. She tells to Paul what Charles has done to her and after the wedding the possessive Paul feels jealous with the experience of Gabrielle on bed. His jealousy leads to a tragedy and Gabrielle has to choose between keeping her intimacy with Charles or disclosing it in court.La Fille Coupe en Deux is the penultimate film by Claude Chabrol with the story of a naive and gorgeous girl divided in two by the love for two scumbags. Ludivine Sagnier is impressively beautiful in this story that has elements of Bitter Moon with the cruelty and perversions of a man to a woman in love with him. Chabrol as usual does not disclose everything and the viewer that shall use his or her imagination to guess the sort of kink sex and perversions the gorgeous Gabrielle has been submitted since neither in the club nor in court the viewer sees or hears anything. However it seems that when Charles tells that Gabrielle could be the last girl he brings to his apartment he seems to be interested in her innocence and lack of experience. When she accepts to go to the club and have sex with his friends he loses the interest on her. I only do not see where people have seen comedy or black comedy in the plot of this great film. My vote is eight. Title Brazil Uma Garota Dividida em Dois A Girl Divided in Two".

The remainder of the script takes her from the frying pan of social stigma into the fire of manic depression. I can't help feeling sorry for her but as I examine my feelings I find I empathize with the actress for being cast in such a lousy movie rather than with her character for what she goes through. Think Stealing Beauty meets To Die For coscripted by Henry Miller and Milan Kundera. Utterly disgusting.

Think Stealing Beauty meets To Die For coscripted by Henry Miller and Milan Kundera. Utterly disgusting. Watch out for saucy sisters Josphine Clmence Bretcher and Elonore Charley Fouquet though the only selfdetermined girls in a parade of pinup puppets on Chabrol's string.";

Having another male lover of her own age in the background this triangle predictably results in disaster.What makes 'La fille coupe en deux' special however is the refined typical French way of telling its story.

Apparently There was a further mystery involved with the film in that he tried to have his connection with the film kept quiet as a way of lessening expectations. The performances are all quite good including Franois Berland the cop in the Transporter films as the older love of our heroine. The problem for me was that I could sense the construction of the film as I was watching it as we are handed the pieces of the puzzles one at a time so as to lead us down the garden path. I could feel us going somewhere and waited to be misdirected. Unfortunately when I got to the end of the film I was left felling as though I missed something. Since I was watching the film on IFC's on Demand I rewatched the end of the film actually the last 20 minutes three times to see if I had missed something. Apparently not. This isn't to say its bad its not its just that I was disappointed by the fact that I had spent almost two hours for an okay ending.Worth a look on cable or as a rental but not for ten bucks a head in theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you remember what you have done when you are 17? If it is similar to how i remembered mine then this movie would invoke alot of memories. Isn't life like that simple uneventful yet confusing and full of uncertainties?I applaud the way the director handled this comingofage movie. He managed to touch a really heavy topic like homosexuality without throwing it into our face. He had managed to keep everything simple with no dramatic ups and downs but accurately reflect the lives of 17 year olds. The lead characters may seem too sweet and innocent but pretty accurate to people in Asia.To keep the movie real the director went to the streets and got the male lead Chen Bolin Zhang Shi Hao and the female lead Gui Lun Mei Meng Ke Rou and all of the other cast. And knowing that they were all first time actors really lifts up the mood of the movie. I say they did a great job. By the way the name 'Meng Ke Rou' means 'fierce subdue the gentle' although not the exact words the pronunciation is similar which to me is a subtle undertext to her character. The biggest applause goes to Gui who did a great job portraying in Meng's confusion and awkwardness and her struggle to conform to society's standards.Watch the movie for its simplicity if you are looking for a plot heavy technically driven movie this is the wrong place. One of my fave movies of all times.".

Isn't life like that simple uneventful yet confusing and full of uncertainties?I applaud the way the director handled this comingofage movie. He managed to touch a really heavy topic like homosexuality without throwing it into our face. He had managed to keep everything simple with no dramatic ups and downs but accurately reflect the lives of 17 year olds. The lead characters may seem too sweet and innocent but pretty accurate to people in Asia.To keep the movie real the director went to the streets and got the male lead Chen Bolin Zhang Shi Hao and the female lead Gui Lun Mei Meng Ke Rou and all of the other cast.

But it is a sweet film which really does not come off as being neither artsy nor gay. The characters are common people yet sensitive and well developed.

The director makes many decisions like that to keep us focused on the big picture stuff happens and then something else happens. There's no stopping it.I have to point out that watching this Taiwanese film with English subtitles added quite a bit to the adorableness of it. For example after brooding girl sets up sensitive boy with girlygirl who knows he likes brooding girl you have to see the film to see how that happens sensitive boy walks girlygirl home. After an uncomfortably done goodbye girlygirl calls out after sensitive boy as he's about to mount his bicycle and says Zhang Shihao pause can you date with me? I don't know exactly what was said in Taiwanese but that odd translation seemed to capture the moment perfectly.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all if something has to be written about this film it's about the poetic way the director talks about teenage problem in Asia. The story about a young man and two young girls is really close to the 2 girls and a boy type and at the beginning you can be afraid that the film would be like a boredom teenage movie but be confident it's not and so go on watching it... The love story is about teenagers who don't love the right person the girl who loves her classmate who is also a girl who loves a young man who loves the first girl and the thing which makes it interesting is the fact that the story is not focused on the three people but only on two of them who try to create a false couple as their love is not mutual and shared. This couple transforms itself in a kind of friendship born from incomprehension.How sometimes destiny makes us meet some people by chance those who will be essential to our lives. That's the real topic of this movie. Little by little the girl who's afraid to love girls and the guy who's afraid to be alone start to know each other and to love each other even if they'll never be a couple. The movie is good because of that way to treat teenage relationships and also by the quality of the image.The work on image is really really good. Some sequences are quite splendid like the first sequence or the one with the two main characters on bicycles and the music is also really good a simple piano theme. The actors are really incredible and fit absolutely their characters.The whole charm of the movie lies in the real fragility of teenage relationships and on how life is taken by these characters  complicated light and sometimes quite incredibly beautiful.".

She tries to act as the messenger for her best friend who has a crush on him while he is interested rather in her. Then it gradually comes out that she is troubled by uncertainty of her own sexuality of whether she is lesbian and in love with her best friend.During the earlier part of the film it is easy to be fooled by its apparent simplicity and the nearly moronic dialogue.  Then it gradually becomes evident that what the filmmakers have tried to do is to create a very realistic juvenile world. It is then when the film starts to resonate with experiences that we all had once some recently some much longer ago.Through completely honest depictions the characters all of a sudden become very alive. We are also touched by the director's attentiveness in small things such as the girl nearly tripping over a chair on one of the occasions when she on her way out of the house something that does happen in real life very often. Two scenes I particularly enjoyed which is probably also many others' choice are the shuffle' scene and the telephone call. The first cleverly shows the mental confrontation and subsequent reconciliation of the two in disruption and subsequent rearranging of some of the chairs in the assembly hall. The second one at the beach bon fire at night shows for the first time deeper emotions of the girl as she weeps over words spoken by the boy not heard by the audience.Behind the superficial simplicity is a great deal of subtlety. The film is openended provoking rather than dictating thoughts and the ending is delightfully upbeat. In the end whether this is friendship or love between the two doesn't really matter. With their youthfulness there will always choices and possibilities.An amazingly wonderful film to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fantastic film about adolescenceUnfortunately I doubt many in the U.S. will ever see it. I'm also unsure as to whether U.S. audiences would like it much anyway. I myself loved it  it's very beautiful one of the best films on that age group I've ever seen.The story revolves around three teens in a Taipei high school two girls and a boy. The girls like to think of themselves as BFFs best friends forever! and like any two best friends they talk to each other about boys. The third character is the boy one of them likes. The two girls look for him one night and the girl who doesn't like him approaches him to tell him that her girlfriend has a crush on him. The second girl however is too nervous and flees the scene. The boy then thinks that the girl who approached him actually likes him but won't say it straight out.I won't go on with the plot. If I am wrong and it does get a U.S. release I don't want to be the one who ruins the surprises I'll let the professional critics do that. Suffice it to say that unlike American films about high school Blue Gate Crossing remains simple and honest all the way through. There are no subplots or melodramatic developments. No one gets knocked up or dies in a tragic drag racing accident. We are just left to witness the sweet and beautiful events in the lives of these three characters. The reason that I believe it will never be officially released in the United States is this it'll seem far too innocent. These kids are meant to be between 16 and 18 years old. For a U.S. audience their actions and attitudes will seem like those of sixth graders. Perhaps even in Taiwan it will be seen as quaint. One of the film's producers Peggy Chiao was present at the screening I attended and she said that the director himself Yi Chihyen was afraid that the film was too sweet. It's really up to 1 distributors and 2 film critics. Let's face it the first obstacle for U.S. distribution will be nearly impossible to overcome. As for critics people love to flaunt that critics in this modern day and age are meaningless. That may be true for the latest teen sex comedy but for foreign films they are of the utmost importance. I am afraid that they will see little but an after school special in Blue Gate Crossing. Let's all hope I'm wrong and that this'll be the biggest foreign hit since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first glimpse of this lovely film was through its music video by Cheer Chen one of my fav Taiwanese singers and the footages just grasped my attention so much that I wanted to catch it for the longest time. Starring one of the cutest boy actors who were up and coming during that time this was another good reason to watch too. But alas it actually took me more than a year after the movie was released that i finally watched it sadly thru VCD by a good friend.OK it's basically about an awkward love triangle story on 3 17 yrold kids with lesbian elements in it to add to the flavour. But if you look at it in a different angle it's just a pretty innocent love story and the chemistry between the 2 main leads are the main factor that keeps the attention going. With the boy's straightforwardness and the girl's sexual confusion it brings you back to school days where crushes are aplenty and some peculiar actions done by you or others that are just not explainable at all.There are some classic lines and performances by the 2 leads which are unforgettable and the story engages our attention with the tensions and struggles we face while growing up lots of questions nobody can answer and lots of emotions waiting to explode out from our young minds. The music is great too with a sort of sorrowful touch to match the teens' loss in terms of love innocence and youth.A simple story beautifully shot and strongly cast leads makes it an unforgettable piece of work and lastly I'll end with the classic line from the film 'If one day you start liking guys please let me be the first one to know'. Sigh! So sweet.".

Starring one of the cutest boy actors who were up and coming during that time this was another good reason to watch too. But alas it actually took me more than a year after the movie was released that i finally watched it sadly thru VCD by a good friend.OK it's basically about an awkward love triangle story on 3 17 yrold kids with lesbian elements in it to add to the flavour. But if you look at it in a different angle it's just a pretty innocent love story and the chemistry between the 2 main leads are the main factor that keeps the attention going. With the boy's straightforwardness and the girl's sexual confusion it brings you back to school days where crushes are aplenty and some peculiar actions done by you or others that are just not explainable at all.There are some classic lines and performances by the 2 leads which are unforgettable and the story engages our attention with the tensions and struggles we face while growing up lots of questions nobody can answer and lots of emotions waiting to explode out from our young minds. The music is great too with a sort of sorrowful touch to match the teens' loss in terms of love innocence and youth.A simple story beautifully shot and strongly cast leads makes it an unforgettable piece of work and lastly I'll end with the classic line from the film 'If one day you start liking guys please let me be the first one to know'. Sigh! So sweet.";

An orphan looked down on by all she survived barely by doing cleaning and laundry paid by the job but in her little room in town at night by candlelight made strange visionary paintings of flowers in large clusters looking like diamonds or insects. Raised and cared for in early life by nuns she sang to the Virgin when she finished a painting. Beautifully photographed meditative with a strong sense of the quietude of rural France in the teens and twenties this picture doesn't provide deep insight into either Sraphine or the German art collector who discovered and supported her Wilhelm Uhde Ulrich Tukur another veteran he has one of the secondary leads in The Lives of Others. Uhde deserves his own biopic. He was the first to purchase the works of Picasso and discovered the great modern primitive Henri Le Douanier Rousseau.Slowly methodically the film shows how Uhde finds out by chance that the haggard looking middle aged woman cleaning up in the big rented house he's living in in Senlis with his sister is doing unique paintings on wood. Nobody else around appreciates them or in fact understands modern art. He buys all her work from Sraphine and urges her to concentrate on her art. But WWI comes and as a German he is forced to leave precipitously leaving behind his little notebook and most of the art he's collected in France.Uhde returns years later with his sister and also a male lover Helmut Kolle Nico Rogner a talented young German expressionist painter dying of TB and rents another house in the area. He comes across Sraphine's work and finds it more ambitious and much more brilliant. He puts her on a generous monthly stipend. She shows signs of mania and her disappointment when she finds the Paris exhibition must be put off due to the worldwide financial crisis leads her into insanity. The trajectory is ever downward though the final scenes suggest that her last years in a sanatorium may have been spend it serenity close to the nature she loved.This film is thorough and handsomely made but a little too much on the dutiful and academic side. It has parallels as a story with Bruno Nuytten's 1988 Camille Claudel but it has neither the level of drama nor the presence of Grard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani as Rodin and Claudel to give it energy. As director Provost has said Uhde had a dark side his willingness to virtually abandon Sraphine when things got rough for her and not to bother looking for her when he first returns to France after the War. Provost leaves this mysterious which is just historically but unsatisfying cinematically. But Provost did apparently help organize the recent Muse Maillol exhibition of Sraphine's work. And this film is a thoughtprovoking addition to the onscreen literature of outsider or visionary art.The film opened in theaters in Paris on October 1 2008 to respectful if not overly enthusiastic reviews. It has been bought by Music Box in the US but no release has been announced. Shown as part of the RendezVous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center NYC in March 2009.".

A champion of modern primitvist artists who is credited with early recognition of Picasso and Rousseau Uhde is portrayed by Tukur as a quiet unassuming man who lives with his sister and a gay lover. He recognizes Sraphine's talent but never shows much enthusiasm preferring to keep their relationship on a very businesslike basis.Impressed by Seraphine's passionate art Uhde offers to become her patron but feeling estranged in France must soon leave the country to return to Germany as the First World War begins. Although Sraphine continues to paint she has no connection with Uhde until the latter part of the 1920s when he provides her with the means to quit her job and paint full time. Unfortunately her grip on reality falters and she is soon hospitalized after indulging in spending sprees on a wedding dress and purchase of a large mansion. One of the saddest scenes in the film is that of Sraphine dressed in a full wedding gown going door to door giving her away her possessions.Provost in Sraphine captures the artist's mystical nature and her close bond with nature that shows up in her works which are still exhibited in many of the world's museums. She is shown hugging trees climbing them and standing as a tiny speck beneath a towering shade tree. One scene shows her standing nude in water up to her chest in a nearby river. Provost takes a minimalist approach and the film does not contain much dialogue. The story is told by the silences and facial expressions and the music by Michael Galasso adds richness to the experience.

	schema:reviewBody "Sraphine de Senlis  born Sraphine Louis 1864 1942  may not be a painter well known to the entire art world today but the story of her life makes a compelling film. Writer Marc Abdelnour and writerdirector Martin Provost have extracted all of the significant aspects of Sraphine Louis' life and have created a work of art as a film much in the style of the way she created her life in art. Sraphine Louis Yolande Moreau was born in 1864 in Arcy to a poor family and worked as a shepherdess until 1881 when she accepted the position as a domestic worker for the Sisters of Providence in Clermont her life with the nuns enhanced her profoundly religious approach to her personal philosophy. In 1901 she left the convent in part due to a communication with her angel that she must paint to become a housekeeper for middle class families in Senlis. In her quiet manner she scrubbed floors and did laundry by day using the pittances of income to procure some supplies so that she could paint her images of fruits flowers and leaves by candlelight at night in her tiny room. Self taught she used pigment from strange sources  blood from the butcher melted wax from the votives at the cathedral pollen from the flowers of the fields her only 'purchased' component was gesso and white paint from the artist supply shop in Senlis. In 1914 the German art collector and critic Wilhelm Uhde Ulrich Tukur took a room in the house owned by Mme Duphot Genevive Mnich one of the houses where Sraphine worked and when Wilhelm discovered a painting by Sraphine he immediately recognized a painter of great promise and provided Sraphine with the first response to her artistic efforts. Wilhelm and Sraphine became friends and Wilhelm bought all of her art insisting that she devote her time to creating art instead of scrubbing floors. With the backing of a collector and friend Sraphine began painting in earnest showing locally and selling art under Wilhelm's sponsorship until 1914 when with WW I breaking out Wilhelm had to flee France leaving behind his collection of paintings as well as the close bond the two had formed. Mistakenly Sraphine thought Wilhelm's departure was to marry his roommate AnneMarie Anne Bennett only to discover that AnneMarie was Wilhelm's sister and fellow supporter of Sraphine Wilhelm informed her he would never be able to marry a woman. Sraphine continued painting as she lead her eccentric life in Senlis and in 1927 Wilhelm returned to France with his paramour  young painter Helmut Kolle Nico Rogner who suffered from tuberculosis  rediscovers Sraphine's art in a local Senlis exhibition and realizes that she had survived and her art had flourished. Under Wilhelm's patronage Sraphine began painting large canvases as large as two meters high and she achieved prominence as the nave painter of her day.

	onyx:emotionText "Sraphine de Senlis  born Sraphine Louis 1864 1942  may not be a painter well known to the entire art world today but the story of her life makes a compelling film. Writer Marc Abdelnour and writerdirector Martin Provost have extracted all of the significant aspects of Sraphine Louis' life and have created a work of art as a film much in the style of the way she created her life in art. Sraphine Louis Yolande Moreau was born in 1864 in Arcy to a poor family and worked as a shepherdess until 1881 when she accepted the position as a domestic worker for the Sisters of Providence in Clermont her life with the nuns enhanced her profoundly religious approach to her personal philosophy. In 1901 she left the convent in part due to a communication with her angel that she must paint to become a housekeeper for middle class families in Senlis. In her quiet manner she scrubbed floors and did laundry by day using the pittances of income to procure some supplies so that she could paint her images of fruits flowers and leaves by candlelight at night in her tiny room. Self taught she used pigment from strange sources  blood from the butcher melted wax from the votives at the cathedral pollen from the flowers of the fields her only 'purchased' component was gesso and white paint from the artist supply shop in Senlis. In 1914 the German art collector and critic Wilhelm Uhde Ulrich Tukur took a room in the house owned by Mme Duphot Genevive Mnich one of the houses where Sraphine worked and when Wilhelm discovered a painting by Sraphine he immediately recognized a painter of great promise and provided Sraphine with the first response to her artistic efforts. Wilhelm and Sraphine became friends and Wilhelm bought all of her art insisting that she devote her time to creating art instead of scrubbing floors. With the backing of a collector and friend Sraphine began painting in earnest showing locally and selling art under Wilhelm's sponsorship until 1914 when with WW I breaking out Wilhelm had to flee France leaving behind his collection of paintings as well as the close bond the two had formed. Mistakenly Sraphine thought Wilhelm's departure was to marry his roommate AnneMarie Anne Bennett only to discover that AnneMarie was Wilhelm's sister and fellow supporter of Sraphine Wilhelm informed her he would never be able to marry a woman. Sraphine continued painting as she lead her eccentric life in Senlis and in 1927 Wilhelm returned to France with his paramour  young painter Helmut Kolle Nico Rogner who suffered from tuberculosis  rediscovers Sraphine's art in a local Senlis exhibition and realizes that she had survived and her art had flourished. Under Wilhelm's patronage Sraphine began painting large canvases as large as two meters high and she achieved prominence as the nave painter of her day. In 1929 Wilhelm organized an exhibition 'Painters of the Sacred Heart' that featured Sraphine's art launching her into a period of financial success she had never known  and was ill prepared to manage. Then in 1930 with the effects of the Great Depression destroying the finances of her patrons Wilhelm had no choice except to stop buying her paintings. Sraphine's spending habits cause concern and in 1932 her psychotic behavior resulted in placement in the psychiatric ward in Clermont hospital where she spent the rest of her days alone and without friends or admirers of her gift of art.

In these examples beautiful nostalgic settings were contrasted with dystopian visions of the hard life. When we move to the biopic cinematic techniques are routinely used to persuade us of 'what really happened.' Sraphine continues the proud French tradition of costume and historical drama yet in a very accessible vein. It tells the true story of a minor French painter Sraphine Louis later known as Sraphine de Senlis after the village where she lived. Our story picks up Sraphine working as a maid for Madame Duphot. This lady of the house also rents an apartment to a German art criticdealer Wilhelm Uhde. Uhde believes in the 'primitive' artists and takes a liking to some of the maid's work he spots. Yolande Moreau's assured performance gives weight to what may be an unvarnished account. The discovery of the peasant woman's talent her humble charm as she goes about collecting the ingredients for paint wine mud fruits flowers as she goes about her chores as a domestic servant. Everything draws us sympathetically into Sraphine's world.Udhe nurtures Sraphine's embryonic talent ensuring it is seen worldwide. But as war hits the economy support evaporates.

One of the most famous exponents according to some is L. S. Lowry. The style seems natural to the childlike if brilliant personality of our peasant woman although of course many naive art painters including Lowry had unlike Sraphine plenty of schooling and formal knowledge of art technique.Production values in the film are high all round. Costume acting direction all achieve a high standard as evidenced by the many awards heaped on it in its own country. The overall effect is touching without being sentimental.Sraphine is a continuation of one woman's barely recognised legacy. Any subtext is about serving up a fine character from France's past a commemoration of national greatness from the early 20th century. Visits to the exhibition of her work in Senlis have predictably quadrupled since the release of the film. If there is any ideological weakness it is simply that held by the character herself a Christian attitude of sacrifice and acceptance of fate. There is no strong judgement on whether Sraphine could have lived her life differently. No real analysis of her painting style. It is after all a classy and enchanting fairy tale hung on the hook of a historical person a harmless deception perhaps. The viewer should she or he wish can make their own judgement. Just as they can on the deeply religious and fairly distinctive artworks she left for posterity.".

Then when she started painting I went Oh! The surprise was delightful. The film then went on in a regular way but I don't like the ending I think perhaps I just feel sorry for her.The paintings are crazy like her they're intense and the flowers sinister and unreal.

Mel Ferrer's 'El Greco' and John Hurt's 'Vincent' come to my mind immediately.The first part of the film happens in the treasonous summer of 1914 in the months before The Great War starts. The famous German art collector and critic Wilhelm Uhde acted with welcome discretion by Ulrich Tukur one of these man who do not buy art to resell it but sell art to buy what they love finds summer refuge from Paris and his own daemons in the French countryside. He discovers to his surprise that the aging maid in the house is a painter and a flamboyant one despite her lack of artistic education or of any education. The war breaks the German becomes the enemy and is obliged to flee France where he returns only one decade later.Here happens one of the astounding scenes of the film. Ulrich comes to look for Seraphine he does not know and we do not know if she is still alive or if she is still willing to talk with the prospective protector who abandoned her. The scene is sordid in a decrepit building filmed without inspiration I believe that this is intentional in this film only art and nature have color and beauty the door is closed and anything can happen at this point even the end of the movie.The door does open and the next and final part of the film is dedicated to the sudden success of Seraphine her lack of capacity to deal with success he sliding into insanity. It appears that her art origins in a mystic impulse maybe an unhappy love story but for an artist she says love takes other paths than it does with common people. While in need and under harsh economic pressure her faith was channeled into art when success comes she does not stop to create actually creates some of her best works at this time but her mystic beliefs try to find other ways of expression which for the rest of the world belong to insanity.Director Martin Provost makes a wise choice not to comment or direct the viewers into judging the character but rather lets them draw their own conclusions. How can genius be judged where is the real border between genius and insanity aren't rather these the two faces of the personalities of many great artists? The scenes where we see Seraphine painting are magnificent she is determined and fragile naive and passionate.The real Seraphine Louis or Seraphine de Senlis spent the last few years of her life in a mental institution exactly at the time when her work started to be known appreciated and loved by the art public world wide. The beautiful last scene shows her in a serene posture in the middle of the nature which seems to have been together with love for God the principal source of inspiration of her work.

	schema:headline " Seven Cesars can't be wrong";
	schema:reviewBody "Winning seven Cesar awards against tough competitors like Il y a longtemps que je t'aime says a lot. The biopic of French painter Seraphine de Senlis born Seraphine Louis Yolande Moreau at the turn of the last century is among the best that the French cinema has offered.The story of the title protagonist is told in a way you wouldn't find in Hollywood  no fancy montages no flashy flashbacks no annoying voiceover no pretentious twist and turns. Yet in the simple narrative that contains quite a large number of very short scenes the story is mesmerizing. With the skillful camera as proxy you are placed in the position of an intelligent observer of the somewhat enigmatic protagonist. Unlike many others the movie makers of this film do not try to force on you pseudo profound analysis littered with Freudian complexes and childhood trauma.The film starts with an adult Seraphine and never turns back to talk about her earlier days except for a very brief mention by herself of an early romance that bore to significant consequences. Instead it focuses aptly on the two most important things about her her love of nature and her talent for painting. Attentive with character development and crisps with event narration the filmmakers in turn paint a vivid portray of Seraphine lowly housekeeper and laundress plain appearance childlike disposition simple religious devotion subdued but keen observer and a passion for conveying the beauty of nature on to canvas. She is ahead of her time in her style of painting that art critic Wilhelm Udhe Ulrich Tukur prefers to describe with the term primitive modernism rather than the more unflattering nave.The relationship between Seraphine and Wilhelm her mentor is tantalizingly subtle.

	onyx:emotionText "Winning seven Cesar awards against tough competitors like Il y a longtemps que je t'aime says a lot. The biopic of French painter Seraphine de Senlis born Seraphine Louis Yolande Moreau at the turn of the last century is among the best that the French cinema has offered.The story of the title protagonist is told in a way you wouldn't find in Hollywood  no fancy montages no flashy flashbacks no annoying voiceover no pretentious twist and turns. Yet in the simple narrative that contains quite a large number of very short scenes the story is mesmerizing. With the skillful camera as proxy you are placed in the position of an intelligent observer of the somewhat enigmatic protagonist. Unlike many others the movie makers of this film do not try to force on you pseudo profound analysis littered with Freudian complexes and childhood trauma.The film starts with an adult Seraphine and never turns back to talk about her earlier days except for a very brief mention by herself of an early romance that bore to significant consequences. Instead it focuses aptly on the two most important things about her her love of nature and her talent for painting. Attentive with character development and crisps with event narration the filmmakers in turn paint a vivid portray of Seraphine lowly housekeeper and laundress plain appearance childlike disposition simple religious devotion subdued but keen observer and a passion for conveying the beauty of nature on to canvas. She is ahead of her time in her style of painting that art critic Wilhelm Udhe Ulrich Tukur prefers to describe with the term primitive modernism rather than the more unflattering nave.The relationship between Seraphine and Wilhelm her mentor is tantalizingly subtle. There is little about Seraphine that is sensually attractive and what's more. Wilhelm is homosexual. And yet there is something between them that is akin to Platonic love. Quite revealing is Wilhelm's characterization of himself as not collect to be able to sell but rather to seller to be able to collect. A true lover and connoisseur of art he would naturally love Seraphine for her talent and work. On her part she is not incapable of romantic tendencies as mentioned above but just imprisoned by her lowly status and unattractive appearance. Wilhelm is someone who can truly see how beautiful she is and her infatuation for him is only natural as in her jealousy of a woman who later turns out to be his sister.The seven Cesars include best film cinematography and Moreau's what must be a very close but very deserved win over Kristin Scott Thomas who is nothing short of brilliant in Il y a longtemps que je t'aime.";

I am in the film business and have seen 'everything' so I feel qualified to say that. It is very difficult to 'fool' me to really surprise me and this film did that. It is an Oscar nomination waiting to happen. I must say that at the point Seraphine was digging up things I got the idea that she was a secret painter before we were 'supposed' to know but that did not bother me. I think the direction writing and acting of this film were amazing. Accomplishing what a film can do without explosions and car chases and even mayhem which I enjoy! In every way technically and artistically this film is a must see. A serious subject dealt with what I believe to be accurately without changing for dramatic purposes much of what is actually known.

She is not classically beautiful yet clearly she is an actress of great stature in France to have won this role.

The lead actress was very good and the filming beautiful if having extended and multiple shots on Seraphine's large behind could be so!. This said I went to see this film and with a little reading had some ideas on what it was about that got me rather eager to go for it. Well it did not work exactly as I anticipated it would and now I have seen it I share my feeling very much with the last short comment I just read here I too got rather bored The frequent cutting of the scenes did not work to well for me as I probably would have preferred something more fluid. The slow pace that reminded me a little of a Chinese movie I saw some time ago Spring time In a small town where you almost felt that you were watching grass growing! I also have to confess I have problem with the unpleasant side of humanity so if your are in this category you may share my feelings. But one can not deny reality although this does not mean that we have to enjoy it all the time and all its forms but it's fair that it should be portrayed. I have known French rural life post second world war and latter had a similar status as Seraphine had although I was one of the rare person in my category to have been treated as a member of the family I was working for. However I remember others sleeping in some niche in the farm and having their meals in a back room by themselves and eating mostly left overs. I also have a mentalhealth worker's background here in Australia that started in the early 70's when much improvement came in this area. So as I watched this movie there was a fair amount of thoughts that went through my mind. I have to concede that entertainment does not necessarily mean to have pleasant feelings it can also be interesting or informative. This movie should not come under the spoilers rule as it's not a who done it and for my own appreciation I wish I knew a lot more about it than I did. I'm very thankful for a couple of comments so well written I read here that in some ways makes me appreciate 'Seraphine' more than I managed to do at the viewing. I thought the German actor has something familiar about him I could not retrace and thanks to IMDb I know now he was one of the main characters in what for me was one of the best movies I have ever seen The Life of Others. I can imagine that having some affinity to painting would add some interest to the enjoyment. Having said all this I certainly don't regret my attendance.".

	schema:headline " Wellcrafted biopic of simple housekeeper turned acclaimed artist";
	schema:reviewBody "Sraphine is a FrenchBelgian production about the housekeeper turned artist of the same name who first gained fame between the last two World Wars. Creating films about famous artists are difficult since they're inherently not very dramatic. Highlighting the beauty of the artist's creation is one thing but designing a fullfledged drama concerning the artist and hisher interactions with the people they knew could be problematic.While I would not call the story of Sraphine a gripping tale where you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat it does manage to hold your interest despite its languid pace. It's in fact a very well crafted biopic that features some sensational cinematography.The story is rather simple. Sraphine is a devoted Catholic middleaged housekeeper who also happens to be a talented painter. She collects some of the ingredients for her paint from unusual sources including wax from candles in her local church soil from plants and blood from a dead pig. One of the lodgers in a house she services is Uhde an up and coming art critic and collector from Germany who recognizes Sraphine's potential despite disparaging remarks made about her artwork by the local gentry. Uhde even buys a few of Sraphine's paintings but eventually loses all his art possessions when World War I begins and he's forced to flee France back to Germany.When Uhde returns to France between the wars in 1927 he looks Sraphine up again and notes her skills have improved a hundred fold. Now she's creating large works of art on giant canvasses. For a time Uhde is able to have Sraphine's artwork shown in wellknown galleries and pays her money where she's able to rent her own apartment. The onset of the Depression causes the art market to collapse and Uhde is no longer able to provide Sraphine with financial support. This perhaps precipitates the onset of her mental illness and eventually Sraphine has to be hospitalized. Her treatment at the hospital is not good and she falls deeper into psychosis. Uhde finally is able to sell some of Sraphine's paintings by around 1935 and uses the proceeds to make her more comfortable at the hospital. As noted above 'Sraphine' is a slowmoving affair. Nonetheless the method by which she creates her paintings her religious zeal and her unusual relationship with Uhde is enough for us to remain interested throughout. It's revealed at the end of the film that Sraphine never left the mental hospital and died in 1942. Uhde who was both gay and Jewish was forced to hide in the South of France while the Nazis occupied the country. He died in 1947 two years after the end of World War II.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sraphine is a FrenchBelgian production about the housekeeper turned artist of the same name who first gained fame between the last two World Wars. Creating films about famous artists are difficult since they're inherently not very dramatic. Highlighting the beauty of the artist's creation is one thing but designing a fullfledged drama concerning the artist and hisher interactions with the people they knew could be problematic.While I would not call the story of Sraphine a gripping tale where you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat it does manage to hold your interest despite its languid pace. It's in fact a very well crafted biopic that features some sensational cinematography.The story is rather simple. Sraphine is a devoted Catholic middleaged housekeeper who also happens to be a talented painter. She collects some of the ingredients for her paint from unusual sources including wax from candles in her local church soil from plants and blood from a dead pig. One of the lodgers in a house she services is Uhde an up and coming art critic and collector from Germany who recognizes Sraphine's potential despite disparaging remarks made about her artwork by the local gentry. Uhde even buys a few of Sraphine's paintings but eventually loses all his art possessions when World War I begins and he's forced to flee France back to Germany.When Uhde returns to France between the wars in 1927 he looks Sraphine up again and notes her skills have improved a hundred fold. Now she's creating large works of art on giant canvasses. For a time Uhde is able to have Sraphine's artwork shown in wellknown galleries and pays her money where she's able to rent her own apartment. The onset of the Depression causes the art market to collapse and Uhde is no longer able to provide Sraphine with financial support. This perhaps precipitates the onset of her mental illness and eventually Sraphine has to be hospitalized. Her treatment at the hospital is not good and she falls deeper into psychosis. Uhde finally is able to sell some of Sraphine's paintings by around 1935 and uses the proceeds to make her more comfortable at the hospital. As noted above 'Sraphine' is a slowmoving affair. Nonetheless the method by which she creates her paintings her religious zeal and her unusual relationship with Uhde is enough for us to remain interested throughout. It's revealed at the end of the film that Sraphine never left the mental hospital and died in 1942. Uhde who was both gay and Jewish was forced to hide in the South of France while the Nazis occupied the country. He died in 1947 two years after the end of World War II.";

Some go to extremes as they are consumed with a passion about their work that eventually serve to render them into lunatics because of the demands they impose on themselves and on the work they are trying to create. Such is the case with Seraphine Louis a poor woman from rural Senlis in the Oise department of France.The life of Seraphine is at the center of a film that tries to understand a complex life that only brought her sadness and heartaches and conspired to land her in an asylum for the mentally insane. Her life was marked by poverty. Seraphine was a shepherd who loved being in the wide open spaces of the rural community in which she lived. Whenever she felt sad she would go out and touch a tree.When we meet her she is working as a maid scrubbing floors and cleaning for a family earning a meager salary. Wilhem Uhde a German critic and gallery owner arrives in Senlis for a stay. Seraphine is asked to do the cleaning for the Uhde and his sister. Secretly Seraphine is seen going to church to steal the contents of the votive candles as well as going to the butcher where she takes blood in small vials for an unknown reason. Seraphine was involved with the nuns of a local convent visiting them often. We see her occasionally singing to the Madonna icon in her small room.Nothing prepares us for what she really loves to do. One day she brings a small painting to her employer a nasty old woman who thinks the apples in the picture look hideous. Uhde accepting a invitation from his landlady is amazed by the intensity the artist of the painting. He is even more surprised when he is told his own maid has done it. Little prepares Uhde for the treasures he finds in Seraphine's room. Unfortunately WWI is about to start and as a German he must leave his beloved France for a safe heaven.Years went by and Wilhem and his sister return to Chantilly not far from Senlis. Going to an exhibit he finds out Seraphine is still alive and producing her paintings only now made in larger canvas instead of the primitive wooden frames she used. Uhde becomes her champion. With a bit of the new recognition Seraphine begins to go for the things she never had. She begins to spend more than she can afford trying to imitate the rich people whose houses she cleaned in the past. With her obsession she keeps getting more and more irrational something that will develop into some kind of madness she cannot control. Wilhem realizes Seraphine is beyond help and he decides to institutionalize her in a facility where she will never get better.The film directed by Martin Provost impresses us for its beauty as well as for a wasted life that had such unrealized possibilities. The director wrote the screenplay with Marc Abdelnour. The film follows an extraordinary woman who created a wonderful body of work much admired after she was no longer around. Such is the life of many creative talents that were never recognized for their art. The only thing that is not made clear in the film is the earlier part of Seraphine's life since we only meet her after she is a grown woman.The work of Yolande Moreau is magnificent. She convinces she is none other than the poor woman eking a life. Ms. Moreau has been acting for quite some time but never was a role so perfect for her as this Seraphine. Ulrich Tukur is equally excellent as Wilhem Uhde a man who lived a personal tragedy but who was a genius as far as spotting artists that needed to be known. The cinematography by Laurent Brunet takes us to that part of rural France with the wonderful views of the small town and countryside. The musical score Michael Galasso created for the film works well in the film. Martin Provost had a great vision and he painted a large canvas taking the viewer along to examine the beauty thus created.".

It is this way with most austrian films I see. Seeing my fellow countrymen on the movie screen makes me ashamed for them. I think I even know the reason why it is probably because austrian filmmakers have a tendency towards realism in portraying everyday lives. I have been so brainwashed with perfect Hollywood people and their perfect lives it startles me to see real people being portrayed in a movie. Bse Zellen is a class of its own where realism is concerned. Seldom before I have seen people depicted so authentic in the way they go about their everyday lives. Its also an incredibly sad movie but its not going to make audiences cry because it is sad in a casual way. The characters have accepted what is happening to and around them and that way they can go on with their lives.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Manu Kathrin Resetarits cheats death when she is the only survivor of a plane crash returning from a vacation in Brazil but meets her fate six years later in a headon auto collision while coming home from a disco. The driver of the other car teenager Kai Dominik Hartel is uninjured but his girlfriend Gabi Nicole Skala is left paralyzed and he must deal with feelings of guilt and remorse. In Free Radicals Austrian director Barbara Albert recognizes that everyone is interconnected and that even in the midst of chaos structures and patterns exist as she explores how the lives of people in a small Austrian town intersect following Manu's death. The title of the film refers to unstable molecules that react quickly with other compounds as they attempt to capture the needed electron to gain stability. Like the free radicals in the atom the characters seek connection but find themselves weak and alone dependent on others for their selfesteem.Though set in Austria the world the characters inhabit seems very familiar. It is a world of casual sex without commitment or joy graphically depicted a la Dumont vacuous TV programs that trivialize and exploit human emotions shopping malls filled with fast food outlets scratch and win tickets and promotional giveaways. In this milieu the only thing that is not for sale or giveaway is satisfaction but the characters fight hard to find it. The film explores the lives of friends and relatives of the deceased girl and how they are changed by Manu's death. Manu's husband Andreas Georg Friedrich works at the mall and has sole care of their young daughter Yvonne Deborah Ten Brink who has physical and emotional problems as a result of the accident. Manu's sister rants against capitalism at the mall but can only maintain dysfunctional relationships with broken men.Manu's brother Reini Martin Brambach is a shy science teacher who lectures about chaos theory fractals and the Mandelbrot Set and forms a tentative relationship with an African girl who works at a cosmetics shop. Manu's best friend Andrea Ursula Strauss is a teacher at the school Yvonne attends and soon begins a relationship with Manu's husband Andreas and there are other subplots. Each protagonist has a burden they must deal with but they do have inner resources and some discover that before they can be with others they have to be able to be with themselves. Kai is rebuffed by his girlfriend after the accident but goes on the TV talk show Forgive Me to ask Gabi for forgiveness then hooks up with Patricia Desiree Qurada an overweight teenager who stands up to bullying at her school.Free Radicals is a dark film but it is lightened considerably by moments of compassion as well as exuberant musical sequences such as friends singing along with Aha's Take On Me Patricia dancing to the 60's song San Francisco and a stirring rendition of the Moody Blues Nights In White Satin by a church choir. It is also an ambitious work that is not afraid to show alternative ways of thinking and does so without condescension. For example therapy is shown not via the stereotypical psychiatrist hero but as psychodrama in which the participants act out various roles and in a scene that is normally fodder for cinematic snickering the friends make a serious attempt to contact Manu through a Ouija Board and the sequence is depicted in a positive light.Albert seems to be aware that the universe is multidimensional and at times her camera shoots from above giving us the sense that Manu or someone else is looking down and guiding us. There are perhaps too many characters and parallel stories that threaten to overwhelm us but I identified with them and their struggle to find purpose in their lives. Free Radicals is not a perfect film but it is a rare oasis in the desert of cynical and violent films and a harbinger of good things to come from a director with style and a personal vision.".

The director has craftsmanship to incorporate different styles of genre films such as horror comingofage and arthouseerotica. The influence from several European melodrama giants namely Fassbinder and Almodovar also permeates on the screen. The rare feeling which only occurs when I witness the moment of a new talent's emergence caught me while I was watching this film at New York Film Festival 2003.The screenplay is questionable the plane crash at the beginning is barely related to the rest of the whole film. The director's explanation in QA session at the Festival that the crash indicates chaos irony and unpredictability of life in the relation to the entire story doesn't convince me enough. Also a bundle of absolutely separate stories which don't interact with each other may look dated in the future though it is admittedly faddish at this moment.Several choices of music such as Take On Me and San Francisco are so personal that the director's feeling may not be conveyed to the audience.Overall this is an unpolished but young and energetic film which shows the director's promising future.".

In all the cases however the characters live a drab loveless existence filled with unfulfilled dreams and loneliness.Although the film begins with an interesting premise the overall effect is so offputting and depressing that we really can't enjoy the movie on anything but the most purely intellectual level. The people here just seem so miserable and unhappy that we want to get away from them as quickly as possible and head back to our own lives imperfect though they might be. Perhaps by including so many characters the film dilutes its focus making it hard for us to fully identify with any one person and make us care about his or her fate. Despite good acting this crazy quilt approach turns the movie into more of a clinical exercise than a deeper involving human drama and lends it an air of greater pretentiousness than it might otherwise have had.Enter the world of Free Radicals if you must but you might want to take some Prozac along with you to help get you through it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bse Zellen or Free Radicals not a literal translation at all is a coproduction between the 3 Germanspeaking countries in Central Europe but the one in the center of it all is Austria for sure because this is where writer and director Barbara Albert as well as most cast members are from. And it is also where it is set. This film received a solid deal of awards recognition and got also picked by Austria as the country's official Oscar submission back then when it came out almost 15 years today probably more depending on when you read the review but did not manage to score a nomination. The most known cast members as of today here are Strauss and Friedrich who managed strong careers until now. It is a really long film at almost 2 hours but this is also needed as it focuses on many characters in here and also very much in depth about all of them. All of these characters are somehow linked to the protagonist that the film starts with and one crucial component here is that the circle of people linked to the main character and her fate closes eventually. I still think she is the main character even if she disappears out of the movie relatively quickly maybe also because there is no other character really at the very center of the story. It is an ensemble performance and writer's piece for sure. Anyway you could also make a reference to the famous six degrees of separation concept here. All in all I enjoyed the watch. I believe there are some sequences that could have been left out maybe 1 or 2 characters even but it's never a film that really drags even if there was potential for better focus that could have made the film strong from start to finish. The way Albert went for there are some good scenes some bad scenes but as a whole it is a relatively competent execution and the positive is more frequent than the negative and that's why I give the overall outcome a thumbsup and recommend checking it out. Probably my favorite film from the director with what I have seen so far from her. I also think that one of the film's biggest strengths is that everybody in the audience will have another character that he ends up caring for the most and whose story interests him the most. Even if quite a huge coincidence involving the central character this is a film that always feels authentic which is something German filmmakers could learn from Austria now as much as in 2003. Go check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The above title explains it all when vengeance binds a father and a son. That was a Chinese idiom to describe the the fate that binds a father and son together. And this best describes the movie After This Our Exile.After migrated to Malaysia Hong Kong directorscriptwriter Patrick Tam decided to tell a tale of gamblingaddicted father Aaron Kwok which earns him a Golden Horse Award from Taiwan for Best Actor and a son the 9 year old newcomer Gouw Ian Iskandar who was torn between his father and his mother Charlie Yeung.Set in Ipoh Perak the story begins with the boy sensing something is amiss when his mother was exceptionally nice to him in a morning before school. He found out that she was preparing to leave the home. He informs his father and the couple had a quarrel in their neighborhood. She fails to run away.When the mother told the father that she is leaving him due to his bad temper and gambling addiction he decided to change. He brought the whole family for a cruise and yet he goes gambling in the cruise. She left the family this time round leaving the son and the father to face the problem.Facing with harassment from the loan sharks and tonnes of unpaid bills the father seek another alternative to get the money by go gambling in Genting Highlands. Note Genting Highlands is a tourleisure resort in Pahang Malaysia where it consist of theme parks shopping malls and casinos. Popular among Malaysians and Singaporeans. He lost the money leaving them with larger debts. To get the money the father gets the son to steal valuables from their neighbors.After This Our Exile is a simple yet sad tale about the struggles between a father and the son. The father was struggling from the loss of his wife constant debts and his gambling addiction. The son was struggling with the life without his mother which ends up being ripped off from the privilege of continuing his elementary education. This somehow truly reflects on what is happening in our society today.Kwok takes a new exploration on the role of the father who was short tempered selfish and more often cried over spilled milk. Compared to his previous roles in other features Kwok has given his fans and audience a new look on his skills for the past decade. Yeung's role as the mother can be added more for there are rooms in theatrical version which can explores more on the pains she has been through.The 9 year old Iskandar was something new for the film. Without any acting backgrounds he amazes the audience with his fine and innocent acting skills.While the director's cut gives the audience a fuller view on the story the theatrical version seems disappointing for it left the audience with too much space to guess. This has somehow unable to brought up the 'vengence' that binds the father and son together leaving a bittersweet aftertaste.After This Our Exile sounds common to some but it left the audience to reexamine the strained relationship between a father and the son.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a surprising twist of linguistics the English name for Patrick Tam's latest carries a much deeper sense of atmosphere and tragedy than the simple Chinese title translated more or less as father. Well a formal expression of the concept father but quite obvious either way.And if one thing it isn't that's obvious for Exile serves as an adept reminder that even the most straightforward of stories may require multiple runs to fully appreciate.Tam did items like Love Massacre in the past and hasn't been much of a prolific artist in almost twenty years. This new release rumored and talked about for over two  gives the director a respectable shot at a comeback even though it probably isn't what he was going for nor is it frankly the most astounding earthshattering drama to ever grace the silver screen.But it is a sensible intriguing affair with quite excellent cinematography a goodie bag's worth of various ingredients and an at least seldomvisited location setting.Exile further depicts lean pop star Aaron Kwok in a superb melodramatic turn which has one regularly thinking to themselves now that's acting. Just for that kind of pondering about him Exile surely has merit.It further puts forth Charlie Yeung Seven Swords New Police Story as Kwok's troubled life partner with the couple A Sheng and Lin entering the stage as two Cantonese speakers presumably from HK although that much is never revealed in Malaysia. Kwok's character works as a cook in a restaurant while Yeung depicts a homemaker taking care of son Boy Gouw Ian Iskandar. Something's amiss from the get go as Lin tries to get away from an abusive yet strangely loving relationship with her significant other all superimposed over landscapes Tam and crew make clear are quite homey and comfortable.For a minute there Exile veers close to the wave of cinematic psychedelia that came out of East Asia and mainland China in particular over the late 90's and early 2000's with a flickering mood of nonplace and slow thoughtful unfolding of events to challenge those who didn't get enough sleep the night before.However this makes room for a more realistic mindset quite early. Lin indeed makes her escape leaving Sheng and Boy to fend for themselves as we slowly witness them deteriorate further toward destitution in a pretty but cruel realm where despite being surrounded by others they are inevitably alone. Kwok does his job with flying colors convincing us throughout that he's this lonely wellmeaning character that's so tragic for simply being completely unfit for the world in which we live. No matter what the guy does he can't get a break from his crumbling family to bad debts that won't go away.Everyone else doesn't seriously measure up to Aaron with Yeung doing her best but ultimately failing to impress. She's OK yet we like her a lot better in urban rather than urbane roles. Some supporting love comes via Qin Hailu Durian Durian and the masterful Chicken Poets as Lin's KTV lounge friend and boss. What ruins her appearance in Exile is the horrible Cantonese dub they slapped over her Putonghua lines hence a reduction to a standin sideshow.Our beloved Kelly Lin has returned at long last from her own mini exile looking so different and mature we barely recognized the graceful lady. Sadly none of the bubbly Martial Angels stuff from back in the day here. She plays a prostitute granting Sheng temporary relief and haunting memories at the same time. And although appropriately emotional and chilling while engaged with him Kelly's persona also ends up in a dead end much like most everyone in the film leaving Aaron to carry it all himself.Even the kid Boy Iskandar doesn't pack too much punch despite showing promise. We wish him every success in the future but feel there was more that could have been done with his role. As it stands you feel for him in the few occasions where he starts to quite genuinely cry yet not a lot beyond.Exile overall can be touching at times and certainly there's those that'll find it very moving. It doesn't overwhelm with sheer sentiment though leaving its assets clear firstly there's Aaron in a prize appearance. Then the mesmerizing Malaysian landscapes. Finally that English title just compels one to reflect on what it all means. Taken in that context After This Our Exile thrusts itself forward defying a seemingly almost banal story and nondescript characters. Additionally Tam makes sure to incorporate saucy adult elements like love scenes not overdone and language. In fact more Fbombs here than in any other HK film we can recall recently.This humanity is definitely a driving force but not enough for grand success. Ergo after all this isn't our latest classic but it sure should be on your winter viewing list.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review After This Our Exile";
	schema:reviewBody "This film needs no introduction. The latest work from directorwriter Patrick Tam After This Our Exile took home honours from the recent 2006 Golden Horse Awards for Best Actor Best Supporting Actor and Best PIcture and after watching it today it's no surprise why it did.As mentioned in one of my recent reviews the storyline of a movie is important nevermind if the technicalities are great because if the story doesn't engage then it's a battle lost in my opinion anyway. In After This Our Exile the story is extremely simple but it resonates deeply and also because it deals with something very personal very close and perhaps family ties always cut closer to home. After all the Chinese title is Fu Zi literally translated as FatherSon which is quite unsophisticated if compared to the English title.If you raised an eyebrow in Aaron Kwok's win for his acting in Divergence and thought he probably didn't deserve it then his role as Sheng will win you over and justify his back to back win at the Golden Horse Awards. I'm sold. Gone are those teenybopper bad hair days and repetitive dance moves. Now with maturity he adds a certain gravitas to his roles and kudos too to his willingness to take on unsavoury characters instead of playing hero all the time. His dad is the perennial terror one who blows hot and cold in a whim full of false bravado and never hesitant to raise a hand against spouse and kid. Uneducated loud uncouth and worse a habitual gambler life for his family is difficult both in material and emotional wealth. Yes Kwok pulled off this character with aplomb with subtle nuances gestures mannerisms and attitude all spot on bringing to life a character you'll so love to hate yet sympathize with at the same time.And since the Fu played opposite the Zi and having both of actors pull off their father son relationship so convincingly with great on screen chemistry it's no wonder too that 9 year old Gouw Ian Iskandar took home the Best Supporting Actor award as the Son. His childlike innocence will probably bowl you over with earnestness as he holds his own opposite Kwok and screen mother played by Charlie Young. He doesn't come off as irritating and is so much likable and vulnerable in character that you just want to give him a hug. Intuitive and smart you'd come to love and pity his character very early in the story.Charlie Young only had half as much to do as the other two leads and without makeup she manages to bring out that average every day weary look of a tired mother and wife who had enough. And herein the conflict begins from the beginning of the film. Other supporting cast include Valen Hsu and Kelly Lin are kept to a minimum thereby keeping the focus squarely on the principal cast.As I mentioned earlier After This Our Exile tells a simple tale with deep themes and is able to draw out emotions from within you as it resonates. In what could be problems that households face when there's a gambler in the home the movie sets to show these issues from the onset with the breaking down of family ties and values and the debt causing financial strain on the family. I guess opposition to our Integrated Resorts would see their arguments fleshed out here.In what could be an oversimplification of the issue gamblers  debts  strain in family relations it is this domestic disturbance that ring out vividly. Broadly it can be categorized into two acts no I won't say anything more but each act focuses on different aspects on the family relationship and dynamics. Toward the end everything comes full circle with the son experiencing exactly what the mom has gone through and it makes the movie extremely poignant. It emphasizes the widely held notion that in domestic squabbles it's always the children who suffer the fate of the consequences.Brilliant cinematography and awesome musical pieces complemented the movie well with plenty of nice piano pieces punctuating emotional moments. The pacing though slow is well measured and Ipoh never looked more beautiful becoming a character in itself rather than just another locale to shoot the film in. Attention to details are not spared and the production brings about Malaysian flavour to it too. Some though I predict may not enjoy the open end that director Patrick Tam chose to finish it with but it will allow for post viewing discussion loads of it.My only gripe as I just found out is that the theatrical version now showing in theatres is the watered down one. The director's cut clocking in at almost 2.5 hours get whittled down to 2 hours here leaving certain scenes on the cutting room floor which were glimpsed at through a series of very quick flashback montage. I thought the film could have gone on and showed us more footage especially on the fatherson bonding hinted from production stills which I thought would have added a better level of the understanding about the dynamics of the FuZi relationship.The second movie this year which used the You Are My Sunshine song the other is the Korean movie After This Our Exile makes its way easily into my shortlist of favourite movies of 2006.You are my sunshine making me happy when skies are grey. You never know how much I love you.".

	schema:headline " Heart breaking tale of a father a son and a two broken hearts";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched the complete restored directors cut which runs two hours and forty minutes some forty minutes longer than the theatrical cut. I had picked the film up because the description on the DVD case promised one thing however how it delivered that story was not what I expected. I also picked it up because I love the English titleAs the film opens boy is being sent off to school by his mother. She is being especially nice to him and he suspects something is wrong. sneaking off the bus he returns home to find his mother packing up her things preparing to leave him and his father. He runs off to tell his dad who returns home in time to stop her from leaving. He manages to talk her into staying but it isn't for long as his mother eventually leaves leaving him and his father alone to take on the world and the money men he owes money to from his out of control gambling.Heartbreaking tale of two souls adrift in life's storms is compelling viewing. The performances by everyone involved especially Aaron Kwok as the father are very real and emotional. Its painful at times looking into the lives of these people. They are not good or bad they are just people which is readily apparent when Kwok his wife having just left him breaks down on the couch grasping desperately at his son pleading with him not to leave him too.its a heavy moment. Actually the movie is full of heavy moments many of them that rung true with me having lived through similar ones with parents and friends.The film is technically a marvel with a look that is stunning as is the use of the widescreen. Even better is the use of music both in its original score and its use of songs from elsewhere. Patrick Tam who directed is also listed as music designer a title I've never heard of before but which is aptly put in the present case. If the film has a flaw its that in this cut its a bit too long. As I said earlier this is forty minutes longer than the theatrical version which must move at a better clip. However I would be remiss in not saying I really couldn't tell you what I would cut to speed the film up or if I did have an idea I certainly wouldn't know where to cut forty minutes.On a more personal note I was slightly disappointed in the very end of the movie.There is something about it that left me unsatisfied. I suspect because it doesn't provide an end rather a stop. its a minor thing that I can't explain but its what prevented me from completely falling head over heels with the film something I felt sure I was going to do. Don't get me wrong this is a really good movie its just the last second of film just made me go wha?. Frankly I'm going to have to watch the final portion of the film to see if it makes a difference on a second viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched the complete restored directors cut which runs two hours and forty minutes some forty minutes longer than the theatrical cut. I had picked the film up because the description on the DVD case promised one thing however how it delivered that story was not what I expected. I also picked it up because I love the English titleAs the film opens boy is being sent off to school by his mother. She is being especially nice to him and he suspects something is wrong. sneaking off the bus he returns home to find his mother packing up her things preparing to leave him and his father. He runs off to tell his dad who returns home in time to stop her from leaving. He manages to talk her into staying but it isn't for long as his mother eventually leaves leaving him and his father alone to take on the world and the money men he owes money to from his out of control gambling.Heartbreaking tale of two souls adrift in life's storms is compelling viewing. The performances by everyone involved especially Aaron Kwok as the father are very real and emotional. Its painful at times looking into the lives of these people. They are not good or bad they are just people which is readily apparent when Kwok his wife having just left him breaks down on the couch grasping desperately at his son pleading with him not to leave him too.its a heavy moment. Actually the movie is full of heavy moments many of them that rung true with me having lived through similar ones with parents and friends.The film is technically a marvel with a look that is stunning as is the use of the widescreen. Even better is the use of music both in its original score and its use of songs from elsewhere. Patrick Tam who directed is also listed as music designer a title I've never heard of before but which is aptly put in the present case. If the film has a flaw its that in this cut its a bit too long. As I said earlier this is forty minutes longer than the theatrical version which must move at a better clip. However I would be remiss in not saying I really couldn't tell you what I would cut to speed the film up or if I did have an idea I certainly wouldn't know where to cut forty minutes.On a more personal note I was slightly disappointed in the very end of the movie.There is something about it that left me unsatisfied.

	schema:reviewBody "As eagerly awaited as a new Terence Malick film After This Our Exile the latest work by idiosyncratic Hong Kong director Patrick Tam more than lives up to expectations. Known as a teacher of WongKarwai Tam's first feature in seventeen years is a compelling and moving film about the complex interaction between an irresponsible father and his loyal and devoted son who would do anything for him even steal. Winner of major Hong Kong awards as well as Taiwan's Golden Horse Award for Best Picture Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor the film carries on the gritty tradition of the Hong Kong New Wave of the 70s and 80s while defying patriarchal genre conventions and probing greater emotional depths than much of the mainstream cinema of the time.Set in Malaysia but spoken in Cantonese the film uses flashbacks crosscutting and ellipsis to tell a riveting and oftenmelodramatic story. After Lee Yuklin Charlie Yeung walks out on her abusive husband Chow Cheungsheng Aaron Kwok a compulsive gambler their nineyear old son Boy Gouw Ian Iskandar runs to his father's place of work to tell him of her escape. The overwrought Sheng drags Lin home and physically and verbally abuses her but eventually shows his loving almost childlike side and they end up having sex.After taking Boy on a cruise Sheng returns to discover than Lin has left again this time with another man and father and son are left to struggle alone. Sheng has lost his job owes gambling debts and Boy is without the money to pay the bus driver to go to school. Forced to move to a seedy small town hotel Sheng is driven to pimping a girl Kelly Lin to make money but their life soon begin to spiral further downward. Sheng teaches Boy to sneak into people's home to steal jewelry but the child is caught and sent to a detention center in a sequence that leads to a startling and unexpected conclusion.While After This Our Exile sounds depressing and there are some truly heartbreaking moments the film has touches of kindness and humanity that are enhanced by the caliber of the acting and the rich cinematography of Ping Binlee. Iskandar also known as Ng Kingto is sympathetic and moving as the appealing but not cloying child who loves his dad but is slow to realize how he is guiding him into selfdestructive behavior. Pop singer Aaron Kwok gives a masterfully nuanced performance as the deadbeat husband who manages to evoke sympathy as a suffering human being in spite of his failings. We know that Sheng is doing what he does because he loves his son never grasping the extent to which he has endangered the boy until a furious coda suggests that pain heals very slowly and sometimes not at all.".

The movie isn't bad but just that it's really not that good. A few pleasant surprises besides the fabulous performance by the kid. Despite that his character is essentially a clichd stereotype Kwok turned out to be a much better actor than he is a singer. Also several scenes are funny and the director's humor showed.But the movie severely suffers from empty script and indulgent direction. The movie's character and plot developments are too light to substantiate the 3hour duration or I believe even the 2.5hour duration of the theatre's cut. And the movie drags on and on. Sometimes it's as if the director isn't confident that the messages he intends for the audience would get through and so he keeps resending them and sometimes in an overly melodramatic way.Another thing worth mentioning is the director Tam seems heavily influenced by KarWai Wong. It's especially evident in the setup where the father gets into an affair with his neighbor in the hotel reminiscent of In the Mood for Love and 2046. But the movie would have benefited much if Tam's direction were crisper subtler and more assured.".

The slang is quite entertaining to hear too as Malaysians are wellknown to speak Bahasa Rojak mixed up language which contains different slangs  language in dialogues i.e mixture of English  Hokkien  Mandarin. It is commonly used but not for formal functions. Kudos to the director for the extra detail taken in this respect! The story is about a family with Dad being a gambler harassed by Ah Long illegal moneylender who gives out loan  ask for a much higher amount than the debt given  a strained relationship with his wife  son. Mom on the other hand was not happy anymore to be with Dad as Dad constantly beat up Mom  Mom wasn't able to live with the nogooder husband. Then there's the Kid the central of the entire movie.I enjoyed watching the entire 1 hour 55 minute of this movie as it touches my heart deeply. Patrick Tam is a genius as he directs the movie in a more realistic way instead of portraying it like the Hollywood which is too unrealistic at times. The movie starts with You are my sunshine making me happy when skies are grey... It's very touching. No seriously. You are heartless if you don't at least feel sympathy to any of these characters.I believe many Malaysians would want to see more of this movie especially TMalaya users. ".

Mediocre acting is apparent except when Aaron Kwok and Charlie Yeung overtly tries to sneak in some IndonesianMalaysian lingo with conversational Cantonese. Even the swearing was unbelievably abysmal. How can you screw up saying Pook Guy in Cantonese? The title of this movie is Father  Son in Chinese. It somehow translates to After This Our Exile when it translates to English. Let's take a moment to make sense of that.Don't waste your valuable time on this movie and reading extremely inaccurate reviews about this movie. Life is short. The only way to make your life long is to live it with regret forever by watching this movie. The only reason I gave this 1 instead of 2 is that the actor who played Boy did an OK job. Good job mate.".

Past the time quite nicely but what with it being something of a comeback for Meg Ryan I guess people will be expecting quite a lot ...Well Ryan is good but she's still just Meg Ryan. She has never been a big favourite of mine especially since the interview with Parkinson that she did in the UK! she seems to just be on screen. From Sleepless In Seattle to You've Got Mail to When A Man Loves A Woman she nevers gets into a role as much as I'd like. People talk of her being one of the leading ladies of romantic comedy but when compared to the likes of Cameron Diaz Sandra Bullock Julia Roberts and even Catherine Zeta Jones I always question her 'greatness'. Just look at the physical comedy it always seems forced and at the very least placed and safe she's just not as free to do anything and to look really silly say like Bullock or Diaz often do in this genre.Banderas is his usual sexy and funny self he is great in rom coms tongue wedged firmly in cheek bringing all the fun and frolics he gets up to voicing Puss In Boots in the Shrek films to his physical self here ... great fun.Colin Hanks is good as the worrying son of Ryan. It's kinda a little weird seeing him in this role after Ryan's famous partnering on screen with his father Tom Hanks but he pulls it off well and you get a sense of his predicament ... but never anything more really ... writing problem more than acting performance.Selma Blair is underused in what could have been a fantastic role for her. One minute she's a little crazyloving Hanks' eccentric mother and wanted a bit of nookie whilst everyone is out of the house ... the next she's trying to convince as a somewhat serious FBI agent jumping into the car to catch some criminals. She says I'm coming with you because this is family. So is she gonna try and get Banderas off the hook? Or protect Ryan's character? It just feels messy ...I don't know there are things to like here and things that just felt like they were following a format ... I don't need rules to be changed up all the time in every genre but when you have a good premise and actors totally able to pull of some great pysical comedy then switch to romance Banderas Hanks  Blair I'm talking about it's just a shame not to utilize that.A 610 from me. Fun to pass the time but nowhere near the rom com heights of While You Were Sleeping Notting Hill The Holiday Pretty Woman or My Best Friends Wedding for example. Meg needs to try harder ... to be nice and for a hit!".

Yes most of the time a disaster is meant to happen because the industry has ran out of ideas and thus people have lost the faith in romantic comedies but this isn't an excuse for writing reviews that sometimes indicate that critics may not have seen the film or that talk more about Meg Ryan's surgery than her performance. My mom's new boyfriend stars Ryan as Marty the mother of Henry Colin Hanks an FBI agent and a woman who was once extremely fat but now when Henry comes back from a very long work trip is completely unrecognizable. I don't know what surgeries everyone mention but the woman Henry sees by the pool is very hot and I guess that's why a mysterious art thief Antonio Banderas falls for her.I don't know why anyone would enter this film badly predisposed. Firstly It has Meg Ryan eternal queen of romantic comedies. Is she in a bad acting phase? Nonsense watch In the land of women and In the cut and tell me if I'm wrong. Secondly it has Antonio Banderas whom I don't like but I prefer him laughing of himself and smiling rather than pretending to be serious. Here the actor and actress have chemistry and if they were laughing of themselves it certainly made a positive effect. What else? Colin Hanks who showed his comedic chops in the excellent Get over it and in the very good Orange County. And Selma Blair plays a delightful supporting role. Who dislikes Selma Blair? Am I selling this movie to you by defending its participants? You bet I am. Take in consideration it's not a great movie which romantic comedy is these days I can accept that and I knew nothing about its director George Gallo who also wrote it. Gallo seems to be a kind man. The chemistry between this 'unexpected cast' take a good look again and you'll realize you would have never expected to see those four together proves this and his script unoriginal and uncompromised reaffirms it. The key word here is 'uncompromised' because My mom's new boyfriend doesn't break into new ground of the classic formulas or contains many laughable jokes there were two or three times I truly laughed though but that's not where you should look.Maybe it's too convenient but it's as if Gallo knew that romantic comedies are taken less seriously these days so he provides a direction that is not safe that would be a disaster which is what someone would do to secure a hit but it's definitely pleasing. The thing is that Gallo makes it pleasing in the best form he could with a fastpaced rhythm and a fun edition that accentuates it a lineal storyline and a preoccupation for characters. Don't be surprised if you identify with some of these beings. I'm sure you've seen them before but as complete stereotypes. My mom's new boyfriend is short but in its duration finds time to construct its characters and establish their personalities by giving each one of them interesting things to say. Because I love romantic comedies I try to notice details and I understand if by now you see me as someone not to trust when it comes to this genre. I've already learned to let myself go and forgive minimal trespasses in occasions but I'm writing objectively and I'm writing the truth.My mom's new boyfriend is a good romantic comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to romantic comedies especially those out of Hollywood. They often are borderline insipid clichd predictable and dullwitted but those that aren't completely inept still manage to entertain to varying degrees. Unfortunately My Mom's New Boyfriend falls way below the grade and fails even at being mildly amusing.First it isn't necessary for a movie like this to be smart or particularly realistic but it should have some integrity so that we can actually believe in the characters. Here in the prologue we see Henry Durand Colin Hanks who clearly has a close relationship with his Mom Marty Meg Ryan leaving home and Mom behind to start a job with the FBI. Flash forward three years and Henry returns home  apparently without even once having visited or talked to his Mom in all that time. Now I'm sure the FBI requires a certain amount of secrecy but it sure doesn't require its agents to cut off all communication with their nearest and dearest for three years. Right off the bat the phoniness of the setup sinks any chance at viewer empathy with any of the characters.Second the characters themselves are about the most unlikeable I can think of in any romantic comedy I've ever seen. I'd rather spend a weekend locked in a cell with Barbara Stone Bette Midler's character in Ruthless People than 15 minutes with the insufferably egotistical vapid Marty Durand. Ryan is just awful here and I usually enjoy her performances. She badly overplays Marty's zany qualities with ticks and vocal histrionics that are way overthetop and she seems to have lost whatever limited gifts she had for physical comedy. Maybe the knife slipped and the surgeons cut something else out when they were redesigning her face. She looks like she's trying to look like Michelle Pfeiffer and failing miserably. It has to be the worst performance of her career and probably the worst of the year. Hanks perhaps trying to counterweight Ryan's annoying performance is as lifeless as a paperweight. He glowers and scowls through the film. Neither Antonio Banderas nor Selma Blair have enough to do to make much of an impression though Banderas manages at least to be somewhat charming through the muddle of the storyline. Actually the only genuinely funny performance in the film is from Trevor Morgan in a small part as a young stud Ryan dates.The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn't particularly funny the first time  the Italian chef who pines for Marty the FBI agents' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is etc. I guess it does this because it has nothing else to do. There's just nothing going on here no romance almost no comedy certainly no suspense and we lost logic in the first five minutes. The only thing that can recommend this movie is seeing the crackup of a once gifted actress. There's a certain fascination in that Ryan's performance is a slowmoving train wreck. I hope she gets it together and comes back in better form next time.".

Actually the only genuinely funny performance in the film is from Trevor Morgan in a small part as a young stud Ryan dates.The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn't particularly funny the first time  the Italian chef who pines for Marty the FBI agents' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is etc. I guess it does this because it has nothing else to do. There's just nothing going on here no romance almost no comedy certainly no suspense and we lost logic in the first five minutes. The only thing that can recommend this movie is seeing the crackup of a once gifted actress. There's a certain fascination in that Ryan's performance is a slowmoving train wreck. I hope she gets it together and comes back in better form next time.";

There are a couple scenes that are pure Meg. When Antonio is fawning over how hot she looks she responds Yeah! I know! Only Meg could do that and not make everybody sick. In another scene she gets mad at him and throws a fit punching and screaming into the air. Antonio just watches until its over and is speechless so was I but for a genuinely softspoken Wow. It was nice to see those scenes. Meg's still got it and Antonia doesn't seem like he's going to lose it any time soon.It was a pleasant surprise to see how good Antonio looks. Maybe I just haven't seen him in a while. I've always liked him in comedies. If you like Antonio you'll love the scene where he ends up with each hand in a glass of water or white wine?. Antonio could charm the socks off ... I dunno somebody who really needed their socks.That's what these kinds of movies are all about right? How good do our stars look? How much we enjoy seeing our favorite celebrities prance about ... acting.There's a light twist at the end so everybody can be happy. Upon reflection it explained a few unanswered hmmmm's from previous scenes but I didn't see it coming because I wasn't expecting it I didn't need it and I had forgotten about those scenes because this isn't a movie you keep score on.

We used to see this type film all the time.This film runs a fast 97 minutes they used to be about 85 shown as part of a double bill.This nice charmer was not released to theatresit went direct to DVD.George Gallo wrote  direct this light charmer.Rent this its far more enjoyable than many others.Ratings  out of 4 83 points out of100 IMDb 7 out of 10";

	schema:headline " Excellent Lang Crime Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Lang's last film in Germany before he hurriedly left the country the director claimed that he had lately been offered a key position in the Nazicontrolled film industry The Testament Of Dr Mabuse aka Das Testament des Dr Mabuse is best seen as a warning by a departing talent as well as a continuation of many of the themes of the director's previous work. Dr Mabuse The Gambler 1922 had been a great success and his new film his second made in sound capitalises on the reputation both of the earlier film and the grand social malevolence of its central character. Mabuse is another of Lang's evil allcontrolling masterminds  he was to reappear again in the director's last film The 1000 Eyes Of Dr Mabuse 1960  the representation of whose hypnotic presence and malign influence was to find disfavour with the followers of Hitler. The Nazis gained power during the postproduction period of the film and while recognising the great director's talent Testament was promptly banned by Goebbels who found the political portrait implicit in Mabuse too close to home. In later years Lang was to suggest that the film was intended as a political parable although this might have been exaggerated. As the present film opens Inspector Lohmann a splendidly grouchy Otto Wernicke receives a message from a former criminal associate who has stumbled onto a massive criminal conspiracy. Before the details can be spelt out the crook is hunted down and killed. Investigating his disappearance Lohmann discovers the name Mabuse scratched on a windowpane a clue echoed in Lang's M in which Lohmann also appears. Mabuse is discovered in an asylum in the charge of Dr Baum Oscar Beregi. The criminal genius insane but with his remaining magnetic attraction intact is feverishly writing detailed notes on prospective crimes. When Mabuse dies a visiting Dr Kramm finds the brilliant criminal notes of Dr Mabuse on the floor compares a news report of a jewellery robbery to what he is now reading and tells Baum that he is going to report it to the police. He is promptly killed by Mabuse's elite Section 2B hitmen on orders from the unseen leader  a scene set in traffic that found an echo over 30 years later in The Ipcress File 1965. Meanwhile a romance develops between Kent Gustav Diessel one of the henchmen of Mabuse's gang still apparently controlled by remote control instructions and the woman Lilly Vera Liessem who helped him when he was down and out. Mabuse's 'testament' thus lies in both the meticulously planned crimes which make up his posthumous papers as well as his hypnotic and malign influence on those who are controlled by him.Critics have compared the visual style of this film with those of others from the same period notably Spione aka Spies 1928 Lang's most recent comparable social thriller. Testament is far more cluttered its visual confusion suggesting moral complexity as well as the closing in of threatening events  both as far as the characters are concerned and as it unfortunately turned out for German society in general. In M evil was detected in the presence of a murderous outsider one eventually brought to book by a benign conspiracy of the underworld. Here there is a web of criminal activity and corruption from which no one is entirely immune and in which many are driven by a murderous compulsion to obey an evil power. At the same time Lang is happy enough to introduce into this world of social corruption elements of thrills and suspense which spring from a much simpler world of serials and adventure stories. The near documentary feel of a lot of the film is interspersed with explosions floods chases and close escapes. In this way the sombre far reaching criminalities of Mabuse's schemes rooted in current sociopolitical unrest are counterpointed with time honoured pleasures brought by crime melodrama. Lang had a weakness for this sort of drama The Spiders Part II The Diamond Ship 1920 contains a somewhat similar but much shorter scene where the hero is also trapped in a water filling room from which he escapes.   It has been noted just how much of the action of Testament plays out like a dream and in this sense it anticipates the disorientating mood which would characterise much of noir cinema of a few years later  of which the newly Americanised Lang would be a major exponent. Certainly the arch criminal mastermind of Mabuse has something in common with such later characters as say Mike Lagana in The Big Heat 1953 although such figures in Lang's American period are far less omniscient. Once Hitler was out of the way Lang increasingly saw the manipulation of human life as the province of fate rather than men a view that had made its first ongoing appearance as far back as Der Mde Tod Destiny 1923. In Testament some indeed appear predoomed by a nemesis stalking them although this is largely placed in the human realm. Events play out like an unstoppable nightmare  a feeling reinforced by Mabuse's somnambulistic appearance as he constructs evil from his bed the presence of ghosts the unreality of the mysterious drama which unfolds and such scenes as the weird opening its surreal use of factory sound anticipating the dark soundscapes of Eraserhead 1978. By the end of Lang's film there is a sense that all have been involved in some grand combine of evil and that the disorder and social chaos it presages has only just been forestalled  not by justice but madness.  Modern viewers coming to Lang's film will find much to enjoy even if some of the incidental elements have necessarily become a little dated. The editing and camerawork are excellent and Rudolf KleinRogge's piercingly intense Mabuse is a memorable creation. Lohmann and the supporting cast are memorable characters although the romantic interest between Kent and Lilly looks a little faded after all these years. It's a film in which special effects go hand in hand with suspense and the staging is still impressive. Amongst the most memorable scenes are those are the end with the destruction of the chemical factory and the expressionistic car chase back to the asylum. Most importantly while the morally debilitating effects of the postwar German depression as well as the impending rise of adulatory Nazism have now passed into history Lang's dramatisation of cause and effect remains as electric as ever in one of the finest films of his early sound career.".

The film draws on an exceptionally wide variety of cinematic styles. There are expressionist moments and these are particularly striking but they account for only two or three minutes out of a running time of 120. There are moments when one could almost be in a screwball comedy. And there are moments which come close to social realism  it would be interesting to know whether the patients at the mental hospital played themselves. The dominant mode though is an anticipation of film noir. I would though counsel against investing too much historical hindsight in this film  yes Fritz Lang did go into exile from the Nazis  but it is more the shadow of Weimar than the shadow of Hitler that hovers in the background here. Not perfect not an absolute masterpiece but an occasionally stunning and always stimulating film which deserves 9 out of 10.".

Although it may be too stylized for some it speaks volumes of what was to come in noir film making. The story is a little over the top but that only adds to the appeal.With only limited screen time Rudolf KleinRogge is just magnificent. What a face!!! I became familiar with him as Rotwang in Metropolis and have tried to view any film in which he appears. Unhappily his presence in this film is more felt than seen but still worth the effort. He reprises the Mabuse character from the earlier Dr. Mabuse der Spieler which ended with him being incarcerated in an mental hospital. This film picks up where the other left off and the scenes in the hospital with KleinRogge are mesmerizing.The opening scene as a fugitive is trapped beneath the factory gives the story a kick start as the pounding of the machinery drives him and viewers to distraction. No dialogue is necessary.The love story is a little weak but does not detract from the overall film. There is also a scene which fascinates.....it involves the shooting of a character at a traffic light.....fantastic.I would recommend this films to anyone unfamiliar with Herr Lang's work. You will become a lifelong fanatic!".

A sequel to the silent film 'Dr. Mabuse der spieler' archcriminal Mabuse has now been driven way beyond sanity and has spent the last eleven years in an asylum.Our dear doctor spent the first few years in a catatonic state totally unreachable. Then one day something akin to progress was made. The patient started to scribble down what seemed like gibberish on the walls. The patient was given paper to write on and since then Mabuse has been writing nonstop line after line paper after paper. Acknowledged doctor Baum has ever since taken a great deal of interest both in his patient and in this work of his. If one momentarily could just step inside Mabuse's sick and twisted mind then a cure might be possible...And then it happens. Baum manages to decipher the text and realizes that what he has in his hand might very well be a political essay of the same importance and power as Machiavelli's 'The Prince'. Throw mankind in the deepest abyss of despair Mabuse says using any means possible. Through random acts of violence through organized terrorism whatever will lead mankind to the brink of destruction. And then claim power.Soon after this discovery strange crimes are being committed and rumors of an organized criminal movement mobilizing underground are spread. It does not take long until Berlin is a city in terror.This is where commissioner Lohmann comes in doing his best to trace down the roots of the terrorist groups. Strangely enough the evidence seems to point towards  the asylum and Dr. Mabuse!The first half of this film is classic horror  through a visit to the asylum and a lecture by Baum we learn of Mabuse's work. And when we together with Lohmann is introduced to Mabuse locked up in his cell and meet his maddened gaze...well it's a truly CHILLING moment!We also learn of how a young man with good intentions through poverty is forced to seek work in organized crime. While trying to leave the group he realizes there is only one way out death. Another claustrophobic and suspenseful moment in the movie.Somewhere in the latter half of the movie things get a little out of hand. When the mystery with Mabuse's influence on the outside world finally has been solved some of the incredible dark atmosphere is lost. Instead we get more of a traditional crimesuspensekind of film and the high amount of plots makes the film drag on just a little too long.The eery atmosphere in the earlier parts of the movie the fantastic expressionist style and many original and innovative moments makes this a 'mustsee' for those with an interest for early German Cinema or those looking for the roots to genres as horror and film noir. While the early parts of this movie is a definite masterpiece the latter half feels somewhat flawed though.710".

Fritz Lang already had a long long career in silent movies before creating this masterpiece The weary Death Dr. Mabuse The Gambler Siegfried's Death Metropolis. From these speechless movie he learned to rely on powerful scenes and clear sequences to convey information.When he moved to sound pictures he didn't just put talking heads on screen. He created amazing suspenseful sequences which use the settings' sounds and the characters' own behavior and facial expressions to tell the story.The first sequence of the movie defines the movie's style very well a man hides behind a trunk in an empty room. Everywhere we can hear the sound of heavy machinery certainly marking the rhythm of his own heart beats as two men enter the room and move towards the trunk. One spots his foot but they don't betray their knowledge of him. They walk out and wait to ambush him. The man hiding isn't an idiot either and doesn't leave through the door. But man are waiting him outside nevertheless.No words are exchanged we don't know who's who but its' one of the most suspenseful and clearest sequences I've seen in cinema in a long time the type Alfred Hitchcock was learning to make by the time this movie came out.Throughout the movie we see sequences like these. Lang realized sound wasn't just for dialogue but an important storytelling technique too he had realized that already in M in which a killer is found out by his trademark whistling. But The Testament of Dr. Mabuse takes sound to new heights. Modern filmmakers should take a few lessons from Lang his contemporaries.But what's this movie about anyway? It's the sequel to Lang's 1922 Dr. Mabuse The Gambler I haven't seen it and I regret it because events from that movie have a lot of important in this one. Lang fills in the details as best as he can but I bet nothing beats watching the real deal.Dr Mabuse a master criminal lives now in an asylum and spends his days writing what seems to be a testament. Meanwhile criminals carry out elaborate crimes. Slowly we realize the criminals and Mabuse's testament are connected but how can that be if he's locked up and seemingly insane? That's what Commissioner Lohmann tries to find out in this labyrinthine crime thriller.People who have prejudices against old movies blackandwhite movies and foreign subtitled movies should learn this is one of the best movies ever made mixing just about every genre imaginable from horror to romance engaging from start to finish with one of the best villains ever to grace cinema and with one of the most realistic and logical plots to spread crime and gain power Lang created a precious gem that honors the history and language of cinema.".

But I guess that's apt for the aura of this film its history of being suppressed and its themes.I find watching Lang movies to be frustrating. His most celebrated films Metropolis and M don't resonate with me as they do with others. Even though they have effective scenes they are effective not because they are cinematic but because they are masterful stagecraft. After Lang went to Hollywood claiming this to be antiHitler his films turned mechanical.It was only with this project that he hits my sweet spot where his attentions are turned to all the elements of the cinematic art. This is whole and innovative in every element. Others may find the many plots overloaded and in some cases turgid. But I think the density of story is essential to the elegant narrative tricks that this uses  all of them rooted in the film as film. We have possibly for the first time nonlinear narrative designed in a way to confuse the viewer so that we are inserted as detective actively engaged in watching merely to make sense of what we see. The thing is envisioned as a whole with many reflections many cycles many connections between scenes and jumping among scenes. Images sounds ideas characters contrast with and merge with each other. Its a tight fabric with so many junctions we can navigate as we wish or as we have skills.Yes there are ordinary pleasures too amazing effects shots one of the best chase scenes ever filmed some very fine use of grime. But they re merely incidental to the way that this symphony is constructed and executed. This is one of the few films in my experience that gets bigger the more you learn about its provenance the infidelities between the filmmaker and his screenwriter wife the business with Hilter much obfuscated by later Lang claims and the notion that he would do so. The original novel The previous and subsequent Lang Mabuse films and their failings indeed the breakage of his career. The many incarnations of this film on its way to us. The way it overtly is written to influence containing a story about writing that influences. The way it deceives on the screen containing a story about deception behind a screen.The sex as it penetrates the whole thing without ever being shown. The fact that although you can see it as having historical significance you can still after 75 years see it as a modern immediately effective experience from a man that for one year actually mattered. Still does.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang brings in the visual artistry he developed in his silent movies. The first Dr Mabuse movie the Gambler was a series of portrait of that evil genius. He would direct crimes like Fritz Lang directs his movies. He is successful and as we get closer to that astounding character we see him want even more than all the money his crimes can draw. That is love. And that's the hinge factor. With the end of his crime empire the genius has become a lunatic with a fixed stare.So Dr. Mabuse has been in a lunatic asylum for 10 years and everybody forgot him as they thought there would be nothing to fear any more. It is where The Testament of Dr Mabuse starts. The very beginning is like a silent movie Lang uses an old factory as the haunt of criminals the Gambler's haunt was already fantastic. The only sound comes from the oppressing machines. An ambiance you felt with the workers of Metropolis. That is only the beginning of a masterful suspense overture.Hence Lang goes through different story lines one too much maybe but everything revolves around the lunatic asylum. On the other hand the story may lack the overwhelming presence of Rudolf KleineRogge in the Gambler. Anyway I think Lang understood he could not rely on the pictures as much as what he did with silent movies. The converging stories reach a fantastic climax and to get there much of the visual quality gets you in the movie either wanting to know more or fearing what may come out.Goebbels feared what may come out. The movie about a crime master writing crime recipes in his cell may have been too close to the story of Hitler writing Mein Kampf while in jail. A vision strengthened by the criminal's last words. Called by Goebbels to be explained the reasons why the movie would not be released Fritz Lang listened the propaganda minister a great fan of Metropolis putting his name forward for the head of the Reich cinema department. Lang objected his mother was jewish. WE will decide who's jewish and who's not! answered Goebbels. The same evening Lang had gathered all the cash he could and took the train to Paris.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all storytelling mediums the one that perhaps has most in common with cinema is the comic book. Both tell stories primarily through pictures both have a similar concept of the frame and both become clumsy and uninteresting if they rely too much on words. But few films immersed themselves so completely in a comic bookstyle world as the German pictures of Fritz Lang.What is especially comicbookish about a picture like Testament of Dr Mabuse is not just its fastpaced adventure plot but its timeless placeless exaggeration of reality. Just like Batman's Gotham City there are few if any references to real locations or people and every character and organisation is a surreal caricature of a realworld counterpart. That's why Tim Burton's is the best Batman because it properly recreates that overthetop version of reality. This approach is also what makes pictures like this so compelling and accessible.It's because of this approach that I feel this is a slightly superior picture to M. M was really the only one of Lang's German pictures that plotwise at least seemed grounded in reality and yet it is still populated those crazy character types. However  in the comicbook world of Dr Mabuse these figures fit right in. Otto Wernicke reprises his role as Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann hurrah! and the character seems much more at home here.This picture is not quite so tightly constructed as M but Lang instead throws everything into creating a sense of unease. As with the first Dr Mabuse film Der Spieler shot by Lang in 1922 audience participation is crucial. Lang several times has Dr Baum speak his lines straight into the camera making the character audience and the realworld audience share the same angle. In locations such as the curtain room he shows us all sides so that we too feel trapped between those four walls. Since his silent days he has added a new string to his bow in that he now uses the occasional camera movement to physically pull the audience into the film's world. Also consider the final moment in relation to this pattern of cameraasaudience shots.The Testament of Dr Mabuse is a captivating horrortinged thriller and the last great picture to be produced in Germany before things went tits up politically. It seems to represent everything that made Weimar cinema perfect for Lang and everything that made him a misfit in Hollywood  its surreal theatricality its dominance of setdesign over actors its blending of genres. Like the comic book writer Lang dealt in myths both in and out of his films  the story of his meeting with Goebbels for example is almost certainly a fabrication. The Testament of Dr Mabuse is one of his greatest.".

It seems to represent everything that made Weimar cinema perfect for Lang and everything that made him a misfit in Hollywood  its surreal theatricality its dominance of setdesign over actors its blending of genres. Like the comic book writer Lang dealt in myths both in and out of his films  the story of his meeting with Goebbels for example is almost certainly a fabrication. The Testament of Dr Mabuse is one of his greatest.";

	schema:reviewBody "Compared to most films in Hollywood in the 1930s Fritz Lang's mystery thriller The Testament of Dr. Mabuse is years ahead of the game in terms of plot and camera techniques. There are some shots in this movie that would not be seen until Orson Welles' famous Citizen Kane which forever changed the cinema. However I think it's safe to say that Lang was doing the same thing in Germany at the time when Nazi rule was in the wake. In this complex and filling story a veteran criminal with a brilliant mind has been in an insane asylum for ten years yet is writing memoirs that seem to predict crimes happening outside. The Inspector Lohmann attempts to solve this case not knowing how strange and convoluted it really is. Despite the complexity of it this film is rather easy to follow and boasts some great performances and use of sound. Considering this was only Lang's second film using sound it is a wonder he did what he could with it. The movie opens with a noisy print shop and a man hiding behind a huge trunk. The loud and obnoxious noise of the printer continues all throughout the scene and shows what sound can really do to a film. All in all Lang shows his pioneering ability to use the resources available in ways no one had thought of at the time. There are hints of German Expressionism here but mostly just a welltold and engaging detective story that certainly will not age any time soon.".

The negative reaction of the Nazi government to this story of a criminal mastermind destabilizing society through terror crimes prompted Lang to leave the country for his own safety.  The parallels between the film with its plot of a hidden criminal psychopath issuing orders to his followers to carry out acts of industrial sabotage currency forging and other attacks on the public safety and the Nazis' thuggish tactics in seizing power in Germany make for an interesting subtext.  Though coming at the end of the expressionist era in filmmaking Testament contains many fascinating images and themes consistent with this rich movement in German film.  The chase scene near the end where Dr. Baum flees from the police in his car down a treelined road at night is a perfect visual realization of his increasing mania as the white treetrunks spin madly past at everaccelerating speed.  As is often the case in German expressionist films much of the plot revolves around insanity and takes place in an insane asylum where the mad Dr. Mabuse of the title is incarcerated.  The forces of order and stability are represented by Inspector Lohmann a stout shrewd policeman whose nononsense approach contrasts sharply with that of the sensitive imaginative intellectual Dr. Baum.  But despite Lohmann's virtues the conclusion of the film is a slightly ambiguous one as evil is not overcome by good but instead collapses under the weight of its own insanity.  The final scene with the asylum door shutting upon the broken criminal mastermind does not provide a solution to the problem of evil but only leaves us feeling relieved that this time at least we have escaped intact from its clutches.".

So I'll sumitup if you have ever wondered if there is something wrong with moderncivilizationyou are correct and Fritz Lang's Testament of Dr. Mabuse will confirm many of these deepseated fears on the abuse of power and the deceptions inherent in allforms of media. Some historical and thematic background illuminates the Mabuse mythos more clearly...Postmoderist writers like Bataille have pointedout that we are constantlyassailed by constructs or phantoms is the Osama BinLaden we know anything close to the real one? Our socalled leaders? Of course not. Is a marketplace economy or globalization exactly what they are presented as? Was the Gulf War what we were presentedwith? Of course not and soon. Lang was certainly aheadofhistime in making all of the Mabuse films pointingout the problems we are all facedwith in our presentmodernity. Fritz Lang Thea von Harbou and Norbert Jacques had many models from their own era numerous warprofiteers Sidney Reilly the superspy as well as the international armstrafficker Basil Zaharoff the Greekone of Reilly's mainmentors not the simpleanalogy of rising National Socialism. And yet one can find some implied Platonicthought in these themes of a falsereality since when is Mabuse ever Mabusethe verything itself or a fake? Lang's films are like artichokes and onionsthere's always a newlayer one never suspected.In Testament of Dr. Mabuse we are assaulted with the same themes. Mabuse may reside in a Sanitarium but his ideas are freefloating alive. Whether heor the trueterroristsare aliveordead is immaterial both literally and figuratively. Their ideas infect those who are already ripe for control such as the Director of the Sanitarium he resides in! He and Mabuse are the same sowers of the chaoswithin. In the end...there is no end to the willtopower something offputting to some who are usedto the good winning. In Lang's films everyone is deeplyflawed just like reallife. A mustsee try the Criterion edition which is nearly flawless!! More than just a thriller. Lang's approach is purenoir before it was even a filmterm. His use of composition has been copied againandagain because it is so effective in this filmpowerrelationships abound in each tableau. Some have called this one of the last German Expressionist films but it really only has elements in a certain scene you will spot immediately. Also the film is finally available in the original aspectratio of 1191 with a pristinetransfer from the negatives and the best extantmaterials. This is the real video revolution! Directors need to draw on Lang's legacy more as we might have better films to watch.".

His villain is the most intense I've seen and the concept that he rules his gang from the walls of the sanitarium and then from beyond the grave is not only spectacular its well done.  The subplot about the good man who only joined Mabuse because he had no job and his girlfriend is weak however.  I understand that it moves the plot along and if you view Mabuse as Hitler than the good man is there to show how innocents have been swept along with him but overall this part of the film is weak.

And quite a good film it is. It's a sound movie that is a sequel to a silent movie Lang directed years before. Lang shows off a few cool tricks here and there with sound including a very clever chase in the film's opening that culminates in a rather odd but nonetheless cool onscreen explosion. Otto Wernicke reprises his role from 'M' as Commissioner Lohmann who investigates a series of strange crimes in which all clues point to criminal mastermind and hypnotist Dr. Mabuse. There's just one problem Mabuse has been catatonic in a mental institution for years. How can he be overseeing these complex criminal operations without leaving his cell or talking to anyone?

Wernicke carries most of the film chewing lots of scenery and cigars while kicking plenty of criminal ass although he takes a little too long to figure out the final twist. I'm a little surprised the film wasn't remade in Hollywood If it was it would probably have been 30 minutes shorter and not as good. What is interesting about the film now is its allegory on the Nazi takeover that was occurring at the time. While other German films seemed to stumble on the darkness creeping across the country by accident the parallels here seem quite intentional. Mabuse is Hitler brilliant and psychotic completely dedicated to evil influencing others by force of will and malice. Dr. Baum represents the population that he has enthralled.KEVIN As his once native Germany goes to hell in a handcart director Fritz Lang delivers his most complex thriller yet in the sequel to his 1922 silent hit 'Dr. Mabuse.' This film 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse' finds the demented hypnotist conducting his criminal empire from his jail cell. As well as mystery and crime drama it's also one of the very few psychological thrillers we've seen. Lang once again uses some special effects to depict Mabuse's bizarre machinations. The demented Doctor an obvious precursor to psychopaths like Hannibal Lecter sits in his jail cell scribbling away on his notes day and night even when he's got nothing to write with. Unlike 'M' where the socalled villain was the most fullyformed character in Mabuse it's the human characters that get to shine while the villain is a onesided master of evil. Otto Wernicke evidently reprising his role from 'M' as Inspector Lohmann kicks serious criminal ass as the unkempt Commissioner who will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this twisted plot. Oscar Beregi plays Dr. Baum the crazed professor who carries on Mabuse's work. We are never quite sure how conscious he is of his own villainy. Gustav Diessl is also very good injecting a surprising romantic interest that manages to deliver some of the film's best thrills rather than detract from them. A tense scene finds him in a locked room with his girlfriend a ticking bomb and no chance of escape. Usually a film from this period running over too hours feels way too long but 'Mabuse' feels just right. The ending is a little confusing with a release of poison gas threatening the city in the background while the heroes chase down the villain. And most importantly of all only a Fritz Lang film looks and feels like a Fritz Lang film. There's a grittiness and darkness that most Hollywood movies could only imitate.Last film Gabriel Over the White House 1933. Next film Gold Diggers of 1933 1933.".

Usually a film from this period running over too hours feels way too long but 'Mabuse' feels just right. The ending is a little confusing with a release of poison gas threatening the city in the background while the heroes chase down the villain. And most importantly of all only a Fritz Lang film looks and feels like a Fritz Lang film. There's a grittiness and darkness that most Hollywood movies could only imitate.Last film Gabriel Over the White House 1933. Next film Gold Diggers of 1933 1933.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ten Out Of Ten StarsProduced in Germany the film was banned in that country upon release. It would be 1951 before the film would play in Germany and even then it was slightly edited to a 111 minute running time opposed to the original 121 minute version. This film is truly amazing. If I hadn't known before hand that it was produced in 1933 I would have guessed it to have been made in the early fifties. The film is far ahead of it's time in both content and production. Dr. Mabuse can be classified as part mystery part horror part psychological thriller and part social political commentary.The story begins with Dr. Mabuse a master hypnotist already incarcerated in an insane asylum for attempting to sabotage Germany's monetary system. Upon capture after a fierce fight with the German police state Mabuse is judged to be criminally insane and spared the death penalty. The film's core plot revolves around an organized crime group's plan to destroy the German social infrastructure by sabotaging the banking and industrial complexes resulting in mass chaos and wide spread death. Here's the real twist though the crime group is being operated by noneother than Dr. Mabuse. How is this possible with Mabuse locked away you might ask? Well watch the movie.. The political ideologies addressed here revolve around the idea that humanity is a hopeless disgusting selfish greedy and hypocritical realm that deserves only to be obliterated from the face of the earth. And to think these ideas are being touted before George W. Bush took office. The power of the private individual is also touted as being more powerful than the State which is the main reason it was banned in Germany. This film is more controversial than anything I've seen the socalled mainstream Hollywood dipsh liberals produce ever.Also addressed is the emerging societal element of organized crime and the power and intelligence that it yields and employs. It's amazing a film made in 1933 could confront such a dark social commentary exposing political ideals many still consider taboo. Just as minorities may be purposely excluded from film unpopular political beliefs are susceptible to conservative censorship and are so excluded everyday even in 2010. This film dares to go where most people still are afraid to go.".

The relentless droning noise of machinery drowns out almost everything else on the soundtrack it's a decidedly unpleasant sound but very atmospheric. Another early segment takes place in total darkness illuminated only by a series of gunshots. All throughout the images and sounds are similarly arresting. When I see movies that are this welldirected I sometimes wonder how there are so many hack directors who can't equal this kind of work today over seventy years later. I suppose talent has nothing to do with time or technology...On a perhaps pointless side note I can see how this film influenced American noir of the 1940s including  perhaps especially  Batman! Mabuse a supercriminal orchestrating dark deeds from within an insane asylum seems like a prototype for Hugo Strange or the Joker or any number of the Dark Knight's foes like the Joker he believes in crime for its own sake. I can tell that these stories proliferated during the earlier days of criminal psychology when we were more interested in understanding how deviant minds work these days I don't think audiences have the patience for that kind of thing!I feel that the real climax of this film comes when two of our protagonists a reformed con and his lovely girlfriend are trapped in a room with a bomb.I won't ruin it but suffice to say that the resolution to this situation is very ingenious indeed. Sadly after this dramatic scene a pointless and lingering chase segment follows. The technical mastery of the earlier segments gives way to clumsily spedup photography and cheesy rearscreen projection. Oy!

He even ended his directing career with a Dr. Mabuse movie in 1960 with Die 1000 Augen des Dr. Mabuse.Just like in his 1931 hit M Lang uses still some silent movie effects also by simply leaving out the sound in parts in order to enhance the tension. In those moments you can also really tell that Lang's true heart is still at silent movie making. The movie has an old fashioned style of filmmaking even for 1933 standards. This can be seen mostly in its compositions camera movements and editing style. I like this style and it also makes this movie a typical Fritz Lang picture with its own unique distinctive characteristic style.Just like the first movie Dr. Mabuse der Spieler  Ein Bild der Zeit and till some extend also M a lot of different styles get mixed and it's hard to place this movie under one genre. The movie has definitely thriller elements crime mystery a touch of the supernatural and even some horror and comedy. Some people call this movie surrealnoir which is perhaps the best way to describe it in short.It foremost is a movie that progresses and is build up in a typical thriller style with a mysterious crime story that slowly unfolds. It's a real solidly written and constructed story that is especially strong in its build up of its mystery and tension. This especially goes for the movie its second halve.It's of course also nice that Rudolf KleinRogge reprises his role of Dr. Mabuse again 11 years after his last appearance even though his role is this time much smaller. He was an actor that regularly would appear in Fritz Lang movies. They made 10 movies together including classics such as Metropolis the two Nibelungen movies and of course these Dr. Mabuse movies of which this movie formed their last collaboration.Dr. Mabuse was in 1922 one of the first ever real movie villains. He's a very manipulative character with special hypnotic powers to force people to do things he wants them to of course purely for his own benefit. He continues his evil games in this movie though his entire scheme doesn't seem as ingenious and evil as in the first movie was the case mostly because Dr. Mabuse isn't a lot present in his own physical form. Nevertheless a couple of great dreamlike sequences involving his character make up for this especially in the end.Truly yet another impressive early thriller from Fritz Lang.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

When I saw this movie at a New York revival house a live pianist provided the silent film's accompaniment.  I encourage you to see it this way as that somehow made it even easier to put myself in the place of an early 20'th century filmgoer and see this fine movie for what it was.  The story is light but the beckoning mystery of outer space is captured in a way that will make you feel you know something more than you used to about the people who made and first saw these images.  And when you do remember that real space flight was 30 years away.  Later you might ponder that the first lunar landing is now more than 30 years ago but do that after you enjoy this sweet look at as Fred Pohl put it in another related context the way the future was.One extra bit of advice  Keep your ears open at the moment of launch.  All of the effects in this movie are naturally simple and grayhaired. Nevertheless when the rocket actually took off my audience gave an audible reaction because I think Lang decided to emphasize an aspect of what a rocket is and what it can do that virtually all later filmmakers have decided to ignore.

	schema:reviewBody "The new Kino DVD release of 'Woman In The Moon' is a great addition to anyone's Fritz Lang collection. Once again the new music composed for the film adds tremendously to the experience. I was astounded by how ahead of its time this movie was in terms of its science and it was no surprise to read that Ufa had a team of science consultants working with Lang to supply realistic details. The use of the rotation of the Earth to provide extra impetus to the rocket the way the booster rockets were discarded as the spaceship moved further out of the Earth's atmosphere  having grown up watching real moon launches in the 60s it was astonishing to see the actuality echoed by fiction decades earlier. There was clearly a lot of attention to detail they even figured out ways of conveying weightlessness in space which were pretty advanced for the time. The special effect of trying to pour a bottle of wine without gravity was both funny and impressive. The movie is not one of Lang's great masterpieces and I agree with other comments that point out that it tends to slow down in places. Lang always did like making long long movies and when he settled down to tell a story he could really take his time getting everything perfect. When this involves people just sitting or standing in a room talking it can get a little tiresome  in one scene Helius is trying to get through on the phone to his partner Windegger and it takes so long he has time to snip to pieces a big bouquet of flowers on the table in front of him. I swear it seems to be happening in real time if there were something exciting happening in the meantime somewhere else it might have passed more quickly but we just keep cutting between a scene of a man impatiently holding a phone to his ear and snipping at flowers and a scene of people sitting at a dinner table listening to a speech. Not even Lang can make this gripping though I think he was defiantly determined to try. On the other hand there are places where it works well. The long buildup to the rocket launch is terrific  I would have enjoyed it if it were even longer. The hangar in the darkening scene lit with jumpy spotlights as the moon begins to rise the slow smooth monumental sliding of that massive machinery as the rocket glides forward to its launch position dwarfing the human beings walking alongside it and all the beautiful changes of camera angle to draw in the viewer are very moving. I can see why the Nazis liked Lang and wanted to get their claws into him if they could have harnessed him to make THEIR kind of movies he'd have been a real prize for them another Riefenstahl. 'Woman In The Moon' wasn't a hit at the time mainly because Lang as usual wouldn't listen to the studio heads who wanted some concessions to the coming of sound technology so it was a dinosaur silent movie when the public was engrossed with something new. But it is definitely worth watching and its strong points are worth sitting through some tedious slow patches to enjoy.".

Once again the new music composed for the film adds tremendously to the experience. I was astounded by how ahead of its time this movie was in terms of its science and it was no surprise to read that Ufa had a team of science consultants working with Lang to supply realistic details. The use of the rotation of the Earth to provide extra impetus to the rocket the way the booster rockets were discarded as the spaceship moved further out of the Earth's atmosphere  having grown up watching real moon launches in the 60s it was astonishing to see the actuality echoed by fiction decades earlier. There was clearly a lot of attention to detail they even figured out ways of conveying weightlessness in space which were pretty advanced for the time. The special effect of trying to pour a bottle of wine without gravity was both funny and impressive. The movie is not one of Lang's great masterpieces and I agree with other comments that point out that it tends to slow down in places. Lang always did like making long long movies and when he settled down to tell a story he could really take his time getting everything perfect. When this involves people just sitting or standing in a room talking it can get a little tiresome  in one scene Helius is trying to get through on the phone to his partner Windegger and it takes so long he has time to snip to pieces a big bouquet of flowers on the table in front of him. I swear it seems to be happening in real time if there were something exciting happening in the meantime somewhere else it might have passed more quickly but we just keep cutting between a scene of a man impatiently holding a phone to his ear and snipping at flowers and a scene of people sitting at a dinner table listening to a speech. Not even Lang can make this gripping though I think he was defiantly determined to try. On the other hand there are places where it works well. The long buildup to the rocket launch is terrific  I would have enjoyed it if it were even longer. The hangar in the darkening scene lit with jumpy spotlights as the moon begins to rise the slow smooth monumental sliding of that massive machinery as the rocket glides forward to its launch position dwarfing the human beings walking alongside it and all the beautiful changes of camera angle to draw in the viewer are very moving. I can see why the Nazis liked Lang and wanted to get their claws into him if they could have harnessed him to make THEIR kind of movies he'd have been a real prize for them another Riefenstahl. 'Woman In The Moon' wasn't a hit at the time mainly because Lang as usual wouldn't listen to the studio heads who wanted some concessions to the coming of sound technology so it was a dinosaur silent movie when the public was engrossed with something new. But it is definitely worth watching and its strong points are worth sitting through some tedious slow patches to enjoy.";

The production models of the liquidfired rockets from Frau im Mond were so advanced that in 1936 the Gestapo seized them as state secrets. Werhner von Braun went on to develop the brilliant Nazi terror weapon known as the V2.  Postwar the V2 and its German designers begat both the American and Soviet space programs. All subsequent space history was profoundly influenced by these developments. Frau im Mond maintains its impact to the present day.  For just one example purely as a dramatic device to build tension before the rocket's liftoff to the Moon Fritz Lang introduced title cards counting down from ten to one.

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny that until recently I hadn't heard of this film even though I am a huge fan of silent films and talkies. This is even more surprising because the film was so goodbeing one of the very best early scifi films. In fact aside from director Lang's more famous METROPOLIS it is probably the best fulllength silent scifi film you can find. And in so many ways it is very unlike METROPOLIS because the film seems rather plausible! It seemed that those who made WOMAN IN THE MOON really wanted to make a film that looked like a realistic film about the first moon landing. Considering that the film came out in 1929 I think it did a really good job of trying to get it right. Of course the details weren't exactly right but you could sure tell that Lang consulted with astrophysicists and other scientists to get it as close as they could to reality. The actual takeoff for example was simply breathtakinglooking pretty realistic and using models that looked amazingly real even today!! Seeing the enormouslooking rocket being ferried to the launchpad was spectacular and just plain cool.While this attention to details COULD have made the film very dull and documentarylike the addition of the subplots really lifted it in mood and made it very engaging. The hero of the story and his mentor are actually threatened by a cartel of five evil robber barons who want to take over this private space program! So out of a desire not to be killed they are forced to take along an agent of this cartelwho turns out to be destined to wipe out all those on the ship and take back gobs of gold to his evil masters! As a result the film was infused with some excellent action and suspense.So my final verdict is that this silent film is simply amazing and worth seeing by anyone who is patient enough to watch a silent film without whining. Plus historically speaking this film is a true treasuresee it an be amazed.".

I don't want to repeat what others have written but there's so much more one could say... so here's some notes of mine. Best read them after seeing this film.It really feels this was silent movie's last stand. Whiteonblack intertitles were just so out in 1929 they are often avoided read their lips  animated the countdown once bombed up or drawn right into the shots GOLD!... as earlier seen in Dr. Mabuse part 2.The supporting hero role of smart Gustav 14 years old  but able to launch the spaceship after some theoretical training and avid reader of SciFi pulp surprised me but charmingly. In Spione he only had a short part but here his was expanded considerably. Maybe marketing considerations  to attract young spectators? The movie wasn't so successful in its days in Germany as talkies were already spreading.The professor gets to live his lifetime dream to step on the moon complete with atmosphere testing by lighting three matches and strike gold  and disappears soon after. I liked him best in the first act so hungry and so much enjoying the food and even sparing some for the mouse.The person currently called Turner struck me with his Hitler hairdo matched inflight with an army jacket and in general his uncivil behavior though he gave the best live maskchange I've ever seen. I wonder about his motivation though  why would he sabotage the starship? He couldn't fly it back alone I suppose and he was representing the interests of the brains and checkbooks trust no? Hans Windegger Friede's fianc was tolerable while on earth but away from it he appeared as rather onedimensional spacesick weakling. I might have wished some more positive impressions of him after takeoff.Friede which is a German first name but also means peace was the opposite always nice and charming. Two times I felt reminded of the role of modern air hostess when she takes orders for brandy and instructs the professor to keep the windowshade shut. But did also good as feminist camerawoman and nurse  and ultimate heroine.Captain Wolf Helius Willy Fritsch who is mostly known for smiling sonnyboy roles had to carry the lostlove sorrow 160 minutes out of 163 but did it heroically mastering all challenges posed to him and refraining from wooing Friede though he'd love it so much...After very detailed beginnings the end is somehow open. Will the spaceship make it back to earth? What will happen to Friede and Wolf? Yet it's a terrific happy end even on repeated viewing.".

And this is a world not totally removed from our own experiences because we all of us dream.Frau im Mond was adapted by acclaimed screenwriter Thea von Harbou from her own novel. It has at its core the spirit if not the accuracy of scientific endeavour and yet it is essentially like most of von Harbou's work a story of epic riproaring adventure. Rich with subplot which adds to rather than detracts from the aweinspiring voyage of all her stories it is probably second only to Metropolis for its sheer imaginative splendour and romantic sweep. Many of its devices found their way into Tintin's moon adventure twentyfive years later author Herge even naming one of the characters Wolff as a possible tribute to Wolf Helius.Such a story is in constant danger of going off the rails of credibility and as such it requires a director of a certain boldness in approach. Fritz Lang von Harbou's husband at the time is known for his stark visual style which many would associate with the expressionist excess of film noir a genre to which Lang would indeed make several notable contributions in later years. And yet his manner unbridled as it was in Germany where he was allowed to work more closely with his creative team is more one of bizarre fantasy and nightmarish exaggeration than of grim realism. It is this take on things that brings Frau in Mond into the world of acceptability. Von Harbou creates a great character in the impoverished yet brilliant Professor Manfeldt. Lang brings Manfeldt's world to life with the bleak angular depiction of his home. In such a place it is normal for actors to grimace and gesticulate wideeyed into the camera.And herein lies the important second dimension to Lang's technique. Pointofview shots were by now a fairly routine trick in Hollywood but Lang consistently breaks that fourth wall and inserts the audience somewhat aggressively into the film's world often having the camera take the position of alternate positions of two characters facing each other. Also notice how each of the sets of Frau im Mond is an enclosed space not a backless facade as we would get on a soundstage. By giving us 360degree coverage of a room Lang gives us the impression  better I think than any other director  that we have entered the same space as the heroes and villains of the story.This is how Lang and von Harbou get away with their own bizarre and fantastical ramblings. Fritz Lang's later silent films are exciting so enthralling in spite of their long running times their oddball imagery and melodramatic plot lines. The finest work of Lang and von Harbou allows us to become part of their dream world.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the coolest things for any silent film buff is to discover a film that they hadn't heard of or known too much about. That's the case with Fritz Lang's restored Woman in the Moon in the 2004 KINO DVD release in which the print quality is excellent and a new pianosynthesizer score has been added. As has been cited by many others here the pacing of much of the picture is slow and the acting is occasionally melodramatic but as was occurring with most movies in the latter days of the silents the acting techniques were moving form the broad stage performances of early film to more controlled and realistic portrayals and most of the actors were of the latter group. In addition to the surprisingly realistic portrayal of many aspects of what would become space flight it is interesting that the space science fiction aspect is not the focus of the movie. The movie deals primarily with six characters and the tensions caused by greed love scientific curiosity and boyish hero worship. The fact that they are making a trip to the moon to verify a theory that gold might be mined there is just the vehicle of the story. And the story itself is pretty decent especially if you have the patience to let the movie tell it. And even though I am a fairly jaded film buff I found myself genuinely startled and surprised at least twice by plot turns. I love it when that happens.Be patient. Its 169 minutes but I think it is worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the original premiere presentation director's cut of this movie in January of 2003 with excellent musical accompaniment by Dennis James at the Paramount theater. Perfect restored print a movie that I have always wanted to see since it was mentioned in Carlos Clarens Horror Movies first published in 1967. HOWEVER... The tendency toward original premiere presntation director's cut reached new heights of lunacy pun intended with this movie. It ran more than three hours and 40 minutes! According to it's IMDB entry the original version that ran in the US was 95 minutes with longer versions running time up to 2 and a half hours running in Europe. At times I felt as if I had been placed in hypersleep in prep for a deep space expedition of my own! The film certainly lived up to advance billing yet certain things like the 45minute opening dinner scene were obviously way longer than they needed to be. One doesn't need to be a genius to know that after the premiere Fritz Lang probably cut the dinner scene to about three minutes removed whole sections and generally tightened up an otherwise improbable story. For example the moon is portrayed as a rather pleasant if poorly stocked with resources for survival beach resort. Everyone runs around in sweaters and jodhpurs and true love seems destined to survive the wait for a return rescue rocket. Other stuff was great the launch pad countdown and the experience of the G forces on blastoff were well the archetypal events for all the space operas to follow. A good movie but probably seen to much better effect on video or in the shorter release version if either ever turns up.".

The look of the film is quite impressive considered that it was made in 1929.

In a section of the book about science fiction movies the film was mentioned accompanied by a photograph of the film. This picture always intrigued and stuck with me  three people and their rocket on the moon very retrofuturistic looking. I finally saw it many years later and was not disappointed.Woman In the Moon really does deserve the title of a unique film the movies feels like 50's science fiction movie yet was released in 1929. The design of the rocket has that retrofuturistic eggshaped 1950's look while the painted moon backdrops look as if they could be in a 50's space fantasy film. Likewise actress Gerda Maurus has a very futuristic metallic looking hairstyle. Science Fiction wouldn't become a staple genre in cinema for another 21 years and Fritz Lang himself was to create a scifi movie in the 1950's which unfortunately never came to be. The movie also mixes together other time periods. Portions of the movie feel reminiscent of a Jules Verne story with that 19th century scifi aesthetic such as the apartment of Professor Mannfeldt with its vintage 19th century furniture chairs and telescope.Woman In the moon combines genres with a mix of espionage melodrama comic book scifi and even a helping of comedy thrown into the mix. Other moments feel like a documentary with scenes of scientists and diagrams explaining things I love that stuff. Woman in the Moon was the first time ever film or otherwise in which space travel was depicted through the use of a multistage liquid fuel rocket 40 years before man first landed on the moon. Considering this it's a shock that this movie isn't more widely known especially in compassion to Lang's previous scifi epic Metropolis. Even later Nazi rocket science and eventual American rocket scientist Wernher Von Braun acted as an advisor for the film.The film has its Cartoony moments such as the ever clich image of closeminded bearded scientists laughing and the insane or seemingly insane person is the one who is right but the message is clear as Professor Mannfeldt angrily puts it The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification. The movie's villain on the other hand is obviously modeled after everyone's least favourite evil dictator Adolf Hitler he doesn't have a mustache but has the same parted hairstyle. Lang hated the Nazis before it was cool or before they even came to power.The only major downside of Woman In the Moon is the run time at 2 hours and 50 minutes which I felt could have been cut down. At the 26 minutes in until 50 minute mark was a section of the film which really tried my patience with its painfully slow setting up in real time but it's largely smooth sailing after that.The rocket launch is something to behold with the impressive miniatures and the very gradual build up. The rocket interior is in tune with a space fantasy even with its design taking the absence of gravity in space and Gforce taken into account. The actors do an effective job of conveying Gforce and not coming off as laughable. When on the moon the astronauts do not wear space suits are able to breathe on the moon and did I mention there is also gold on the moon. I assume the filmmakers intentionally created a film which combined scientific accuracy and fantasy to create a film which has a great sense of adventure. The child stowaway on the rocket represents the schoolboy adventurer in us. The moon as seen here is a fantasy land full of mountains and caverns. Plus I love and I do mean LOVE the film's ending. Such an uplifting moment after we're led to believe the opposite but doesn't come off as contrived.There are some subtitle issues on the Masters of Cinema Bluray release with white English text overlaying white German text.For the human mind there is no never  only a not yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang's final silent film is an excellent if flawed one. It seems with this particular film of which I viewed the new DVD edition from Kino video Lang forces his objectives on a film that somewhat is not meant for him.I can forgive the fact that there is an atmosphere on the moon and gold and that there seems to be something as flimsy as a screen door on this rocket. What bothers me with this particular subject matter is that Lang ignores the necessities. He is so interested in depicting space travel as accurately as possible that simple questions such as what do they eat is there a toilet on board are not answered at all.The ending which is dramatically satisfying fails to answer a simple question. How the hell do Helius and Friede expect to live for the rocket to come back??? Lang's mechanic attitude is very evident as he recycles his previous plots for this film that required a more imaginative plot. The Professor Windegger and of course Turner are so useless one has to wonder how dumb Helius is in bringing the first two along. Further the idea of gold being on the moon was a cheap idea but how did Turner expect to get back to earth if he left everyone behind for one little bag of gold???? He wasn't a scientist.I could go on with the plot holes but I must say I did actually like the film. The images were stunning. I think this may have had the most effective lighting of all of Lang's silents. The score that Kino added by Jon Mirsalis was terrific. But the blastoff scene was the best and seeing the struggle versus GForces was very effective.Fritz Lang was a great director who sometimes sacrificed his story and characters for his own cynical view of human beings. In this case it doesn't work like it does in Metropolis and Die Nibelungen. More imagination and detail to the human element of the plot is the missing ingredient.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frau im Mond or Woman in the Moon is another Fritz Lang  Thea von Harbou collaboration from the 1920s less than 5 years before the Nazi Party took over in Germany so it's over 85 years old still silent and blackandwhite. And as with some other Lang films especially the famous Metropolis he tackles sciencefiction once again mixed with a touch of drama and love story. Frau im Mond runs for almost 3 hours in the version I watched so it really is an extremely long movie and as there is no sound in here apart from later added music perhaps this is certainly not for everybody. And that probably includes me as well.I must say I quite enjoyed the scenes on the moon and how they displayed the planet here but the personal drama stories just weren't interesting enough in my opinion. Sadly these beautiful shots at the moon are definitely not worth it to sit through considerably over 150 minutes and watch this one. It really only is a good watch for people who cannot get enough of Lang's films and old blackandwhite silent films in general. I am not one of these people and I have seen several of Lang's works. Frau im Mond is nowhere near the best I have seen from him. Or from German films that were made around that era. Many of them are considered classics today but I can hardly agree with any of these. And certainly not with Woman in the Moon being such. Not recommended.".

He was ridiculed by his peers and disgraced because of this. However a wealthy industrialist believes Manfeldt's theory and has been building a rocket to travel to the moon. when a group of wealthy men who control the world's gold supply feel threatened by the possibility the theory may be correct they threaten to destroy the rocket unless one of their agents Turner is allowed to go on the expedition too. Apparently Lang's film got so much right about space travel that the Germans seized the models used in the film as state secrets when they started their own rocketbuilding program. This film runs 169 minutes and is quite slow in places. It has some very interesting and thrilling scenes but it is probably one of the weaker of Lang's films that I have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although there is about an hour of intrigue leading up to the actual launch this is a masterwork. To be honest I had never heard of this film but of course was very aware of the great Fritz Lang. This is a very long film and begins with a visit by a man named Heilius to a wacko old professor who has come up with a way to travel to the moon. He is incredibly poor and his motives are a bit suspect he is interested in gold on the moon. His colleagues laugh at him and ridicule his ideas. But Helius has faith in him and being independently wealthy has a rocket in production. He also loves woman Thea von Harbaugh who is engaged to marry his business partner a self centered jerk named Hans. Soon a sort of consortium of evil businessmen send a strange man with the weirdest hair style I've ever seen to steal the documentation for the flight. He plans on taking the moon trip also interested in the gold. Soon Helius must get in league with these guys or risk the safety of his rocket and his friends. Eventually the rocket is launched with the young woman. Someone did a masterful job of anticipating the scientific realities of space flight remember this is 1929. What the did not do well was have the people dress the part they are wearing clothes that look like they are going to the tennis club. They also have made assumptions about the atmosphere on the far side. When they get to the mood the old guy uses a divining rod to find water with all the positives this is real clunker. Couldn't they have come up with a drill or a sensor of some kind? On the way they find a stowaway. A boy who lives near Helius. He has studied moon travel by reading John Carter stories in tabloids. He turns out to be quite helpful. But the whole gang has trouble from the start. Hans goes along in order to impress his fiance but soon regrets his reasoning and demands they turn back. He becomes a really sore point and quite dangerous to all as is the greedy badhair guy. The romance with the young woman wanes and things fall apart. All these negatives aside this twoandahalf hour film really grabs one. The music added later is wonderful and contributes immensely to the action of the movie. See this if you can.".

This movie is about describing the high spheres of New York society. It is a good lesson on how corrupted the system is how hypocrite people can be and how you can't rely on anybody even socalled friends. Everyone will turn his back on you when it comes to his own interest.Al Pacino acts great in this movie. It's a very hard part since there is no real guideline but he does the job wonderfully. You will see an OLD Al Pacino a TIRED Al Pacino that might disappoints you if you remember him as the lively and shouting mister Devil's Advocate but it's an interesting side of him that you might discover.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Brutally honest and shocking movie about those in power and how they use that power to control the lives of millions of people from top elected politicians and Wall Street executives to the rank and file working man and women and how far they would go to keep and hold on to their power.Eli Wurman Al Pacino is a top publicity agent in New York City. Having graduated from Harvard Law School 4 in his class he found out that doing publicity for his favorite cause improving race relations was more effective then being a top flight civil lawyer or advocate. One night Eli bails out one of his client's actor Cary Launer Ryan O'Neallover who came to see him from California TV star Jill Hopper Tea Leoni. Instead of driving back to Jill's hotel room she tells the limo driver to take her and Eli to Wall Street. Going into this secret club thats a cross between a highclass bordello and opium den Eli sees who he's not supposed to see the makers and shakers in the world of power in both politics and big business and doing what there not supposed to be doing drugs sex and making under the table deals that affects countless lives. Jill's thrown out of the club for going there with an uninvited guest Eli but she also secretly took photos of the club and the people there with a hidden camera. The next morning Jill is found dead in her hotel room from an apparent drug overdose. Eli who was there with her out cold in her bathtub and who her killer didn't see saw what happened.Eli is really not a danger to those in power since he's obsessed with his benefit show that he has planned the next day for the improvement of race relations in the city of New York. Trying to get people of fame and power to attend his benefit gives some of them who Eli saw at that secret club the idea that he's blackmailing them even though Eli only wanted them to show up and make the benefit be a success. It should have dawned on Eli that his life was in danger by what and who he saw at the club the night before and the death of Jill the next morning but he's so wrapped up with his dream of racial harmony that he didn't realize just how really dangerous things were for him. Still those in power can't take any chances with him blowing their cover and exposing them and in the end they took things into their own hands and that spells DEATH for Eli. Al Pacino's performance in People I Know is what I think is one the best of his career on par if not better the his fine work in both Godfather movies as well as his roles in GlenGarry Glen Ross and Scent Of A woman for which he won an Academy Award for best actor. For some strange reason People I Know has never been released theatricality but went straight to the video and DVD market like some BMovie you would see on an airplane for free? Besides Al Pacino there's fine performances in the movie by it toprate cast of Kim Basinger Ryan O'Neal Richard Schiff Tea Leoni Robert Kline and Bill Nunn as a fiery Al Sharptonlike Reverend Lyle Blunt who stole almost every scene that he was in. It's Al Pacino who really carried the movie People I Know with his both sensitive and tragic role of Eli Wurman who was so absorbed in the good that he was trying to do that he didn't see the evil that was all around him for years that he only noticed when it was too late. I have to warn you that People I Know is a very dark and depressing film and it has no happy ending but it's so ON to whats happening in the world of politics and business today that it should be a must for every serious movie goer.".

	schema:reviewBody "With 'People I Know' Dan Algrant tells a story of how the rich and powerful can get away with anything and everything. In the film it is an actress Jill Tea Leoni and a PR Al Pacino who fall victim as they threaten to expose the shady potentially scandalous secrets of the rich elites. Algrant's portrayal is very onesided because he shows all the wealthy characters as big bad wolves and the lesser fortunate people in a more humane light. Examples include the scene where Tea's face lightens up as she thinks of a house in the country and the sequences between Pacino and Basinger where we see a vulnerable side of Eli. It is the performances that stand out. Al Pacino displays a very intense performance of a vulnerable and relatively weak character. It is entirely different from the kind of roles he has played earlier and one of his best parts. Kim Basinger lightens the screen as the supportive and loving Vicci. I liked how Algrant demonstrates the special relationship between Eli and Vicci. Their scenes together were some of the best moments of the movie. Tea Leoni is superb despite having a small role. Ryan O'Neal and Richard Schiff are adequate. 'People I Know' is a small film and the ending perhaps may not appeal to many but I thought it was an interesting even though somewhat partial take on how power corrupts and destroys.".

The story as I perceived it takes place in today's New York with today's personalities of the moment.At one point of the film when Eli Wurman played by Al Pacino is talking to his widowed sisterinlaw Victoria Gray and he asks her if she remembers when they had marched in Selma? Helloooo Mr. Baitz how old is Victoria supposed to be? I made her out to be in her early 40s. Now wouldn't that have been a miracle? The only way she would have been around Selma at the time of the march on that city would have been in the womb of her mother if that was so! Well then again I could be wrong she really is in her late 60s!This film tries to do too many things it goes in all directions without making sense most of the time. The idea of presenting the Eli Wurman of Pacino who was obviously gay playing against a straight woman is laughable. Even more ridiculous when the one making the passes is a beautiful woman like Ms. Bassinger in wild contrast with this washed out person.Mr. Pacino might be a great actor. He has given us many interesting and diverse characters that will be cherished by all his fans but lately he has appeared in a series of duds that one wonders who is the person behind his decisions since many of his choices haven't added any substance to his body of work.This Eli Wurman being compared to the Burt Lancaster's character in Sweet Smell of Success by many critics kept reminding me of the Clifton Webb's tragic role in The Razor's Edge. This Eli has seen better days and no one cares about him at all. The subplot having to do with the cause Eli is working to promote racial justice to people being deported sounds empty and not true. It shows a side to this character that deep down inside all he cared for in his life was being at the right places surrounded by the same celebrities he stooped to serve.How about the other aspect of the film about the rich possible wouldbesponsors of the cause as libertines and swingers in an opium den on a Wall Street club? Is that supposed to be a metaphor? Oh well I guess some of us so out of touch with the powerful people of New York will never know what we are really missing in those fun places.".

It shows a side to this character that deep down inside all he cared for in his life was being at the right places surrounded by the same celebrities he stooped to serve.How about the other aspect of the film about the rich possible wouldbesponsors of the cause as libertines and swingers in an opium den on a Wall Street club? Is that supposed to be a metaphor? Oh well I guess some of us so out of touch with the powerful people of New York will never know what we are really missing in those fun places.";

If I had visited IMDb before I rented this I would have realized why it quickly went to DVD and grossed less than a million in the theaters. The plot is not at all believable nor convincing. The storyline requires the viewer to believe that various groups  Jewish African American etc.  are organized like mafias and have hit men that execute like Israeli assassins. The various characters are also either not believable or enter the movie not fully developed or left hanging in the wings. Kim Bassinger is brought in as Al Pacino's late brother's wife with some romantic flavor but doesn't go anywhere. It is mentioned that his brother committed suicide but that goes no where. I watched the entire movie hoping that in the end something would come together but it did not. If you want to see a day in the life story of someone in NYC Bringing Out The Dead with Nicolas Cage is a much better choice. If you want something long and drawn out with loose ends choose a foreign movie like What Time Is It There. At least it is artistic and believable and it has better locations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sammo Hung delivers an excellent dramatic performance as Master Yu. This movie is well done and at times very sad. It borrows a lot from Jackie Chan's autobiography on his years at the China Drama Opera Academy with Sammo and Yuen Biao. This film follows the lives of the Opera Academy students and Master Yu who led them during the 1960's. It focuses more on their performance life than the harsh realities of life at the school. It also focuses more on the Master himself than his students as if it's more about his side of the experience.Jackie Chan has said that the depiction of Master Yu was sympathetic and that life at the school was a lot harder than the way it was depicted in this film. His book certainly tells of a lot of harsh treatment and punishments they all received on a regular basis including learning how to do their acrobatics out of fear of getting whipped by the master's or Big Brother's cane. But this film is clearly not about that and seems to be intended as factbased tale rather than an expos so there's a mix of reality and fiction. The funny thing is that all of their real names are used  sort of. Early in the film a new student arrives Chan Kongsang  Jackie Chan's real name. Sammo is also referred to as Sammo and Yuen Biao as Biao. Sammo didn't actually take that name until he had left the school and was working in film. And even though the kids teased Jackie and called him Big Nose he did have a name Yuen Lo that Master Yu called him and he was known as. The nickname is kind of used to the extreme in this movie as opposed to his proper name. So it strikes me as quite mixed up  it's sort of a fictionalized story borrowing on some of the realities using their actual names but not entirely accurately. Weird. Some factual tidbits include the performance where the pants got in the way the bus incident though Jackie says they all had to sneak off and jump off the bus while it was moving! and Jackie's mother bringing hot water to the school to bathe him.The ending is quite touching and again fictionalized as it doesn't match Jackie's description. He says that the students gradually left on their own Sammo first then him then Yuen Biao when the school closed. I'm pointing all of these differences out in order to clarify to anyone who might be curious where the lines of fiction and reality lie not to criticize the film. In fact the film itself is well done and compelling. And as mentioned a very strong performance from Sammo. Many beautiful shots and some fun performances by the opera students as well. Also to note Jackie Chan is listed as one of the actors on IMDb but he does not actually appear in the film.".

This film explores their childhood in the famous Peking Opera School following them through rehearsing training acrobatics and finally acting looking at the origins of a team who would go on to win international stardom. It's a respectful and sympathetic film certainly not an action movie despite the presence of Sammo Hung in the lead role one that focuses on childhood friendship and bonding. The film presents a sliceoflife snapshot of life at the school in the 1960s and helps to capture a lost moment it's often quite wistful in tone.

	schema:reviewBody "The vast majority of the time one hears the words 'government contract' it is safe to assume it is not the best and brightest people who are volunteering to go for extended periods of time to locales termed war zones. Sure there are those altruistic few who take up the charge to make the world a better place but routinely it is just someone willing to exchange six months of their life in exchange for a juicy paycheck. The Whistleblower's heroine Kathryn Bolkovac Rachel Wiesz is one such person. She was a Nebraska police officer who signed on with a company called Democra who had a security contract with the United Nations.For six months of her time and 100000 Kathryn was to monitor the local Sarajevo police and advise them on proper police procedures. Very quickly she discovers the word monitor means turn a blind eye as Serbs Croats and Bosniaks abuse whatever power they have to continue a sort of undeclared war on each other. The Serb policemen will not investigate or prosecute domestic violence cases especially if the woman is Muslim. Kathryn successfully leads Bosnia's first case against domestic violence earning her a more visible job as the department head for gender affairs.Now her scope includes far more than standard local police issues. Young Eastern European and Russian girls are turning up on the streets and shelters looking severely assaulted and sexually abused. To her shock and dismay Kathryn learns that United Nations employees from all nations are not only the girls' customers but frequently aid local human traffickers in their transport and have an interest in holding the girls against their will.Nobody in any position of authority ever raises their hand for a scandal so all of Kathryn's investigations and findings are swept under the rug and she is ostracized from the rest of her compatriots who are either not interested in obtaining justice for the girls or believe so much in bureaucracy and paperwork that they sometimes send the girls right back to their rapists. On Kathryn's side is the High Commissioner for Human Rights rep played by Vanessa Redgrave and an internal affairs agent played by David Strathairn.Frequently the subject matter and scenes of girls undergoing sexual abuse and torture are stomach churning. The film can be relentless at times showing various punishments and cruelty. Human trafficking especially if it involves a trusted world organization and its sleazy contractors is an extremely important subject to cover and make films about therefore be ready to adjust uncomfortably in your seats as you watch downright disgusting and brutal activities perpetrated against teenage girls.The Whistleblower deserves applause for bringing to light the company Democra which still carries out government contracts to this day. However when the film takes a break for showing the girls' plight it focuses on Kathryn's personal life and back story which are choppy and do not come across as fully thought out. There is her home life back in the states which she left including her daughter and an awkward budding romance with a Dutch security contractor. Including romance and relationships in a film with this disturbing subject matter would be tough for any director and this first time feature director does not quite pull it off.It will take this reviewer some time to get over some of the images in The Whistleblower tread at your own risk. But this story deserves to be told and shown in all of its brutality.".

Who cares ? Obviously they cared more about aesthetics than the actual story. Even with all it's flaws it is a very entertaining although sad movie. It actually prompted me to do some research on DynCorp KBR and Blackwater  3 of the security contractors getting billions of  from our governments while committing countless crimes around the world. So I guess in that respect the movie has worked and got it's point across. Good to see a movie that actually gets your passion and emotions flowing even if it is outrage.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Whistleblower is an excellent film but it left me depressed. However its message is undoubtedly important and I think that it definitely deserves an enthusiastic recommendation not exactly as an entertainment but as a testimony of a horrible situation which is unfortunately extended all around the world even though the story from the film is set in Serbia and Bosnia. Which one of so many possible atrocities does The Whistleblower deal with? The human trafficking and even though it does not offer solutions probably because they don't exist it at least brings us new reasons to feel ashamed of the human genre.Having established the importance of the message expressed by The Whistleblower I will proceed to focus myself into its many cinematographic attributes. The screenplay is fascinating and it kept me in suspense the whole time because even though it does not have the structure from a traditional thriller the crusade undertaken by the main character demands a strong emotional response and as well as we share her hope of a positive solution we also feel her frustration when she faces the constant obstacles she finds from the mafia the bureaucracy and even the enslaved young women who are too scared in order to testify against their captors. The only thing I can say against this film is that the screenplay should have explored a bit more some of the subjects it deals with.Rachel Weisz brings a great performance in the leading role from The Whistleblower due to the wide range of emotions she perfectly expresses with her character. Vanessa Redgrave Monica Bellucci David Strathairn Roxana Condurache Paula Schramm and Nicolaj Lie Kass also bring perfect works. So in conclusion The Whistleblower is a hard but brilliant movie whose finality is not amusing us for a while but illustrating us about a sad reality which is lived by millions of people every day. I guess that it is difficult to think about that when we have our own problems which are undoubtedly minor even though they affect us daily but that apathy is exactly what companies like DynCorp need in order to enrich themselves at the expense of the human misery. Even though I think that exactly the same can be said about any government.".

The lack of action on the part of the American bureaucratic system after what was happening was exposed along with the European governments et al as well to clean up the contractors and the representatives sent to these destabilised regions all to well underlines the real attitude to dealing with this epidemic of trafficking systematic rape and torture. Trafficking is certainly alive and well thanks to that attitude and indifference to deal with this issue largely by men.

	schema:reviewBody "So i sat down this evening at a special screening of The Whistleblower id seen the trailer and was certainly intrigued as i think Rachel Weisz is an extremely fine actress and it reminded me of a similar Australian film i saw a few years earlier called 'The Jammed'. I was absolutely floored by this film so many times i was literally holding back my anger and my urge to yell at the screen.The story is a story that has been told somewhat before but none have had Rachel Weisz she is the pure driving force of this movie picturing someone else in this role is near impossible. The supporting cast are also stellar I particularly enjoyed David Strathairn's character one good guy in the midst of all these corrupt male cops and the actress who played Raya gave a heartbreaking portrayal of a trapped woman.The fact that sex trafficking is still a major problem in the world is horrifying i hope this movie eventually gets a full release in Australia as i think its a film a lot of people should see as sex trafficking is a major problem here.Be prepared to hold back your rage and frustration....Come Oscar time i hope Weisz gets the recognition she so rightly deserves.In one word  Flawless".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I have to say that I was greatly impressed at the quality of the movie because it was a Canadian production and to be honest I have rarely seen us live up to the quality we are capable of achieving.Rachel Weisz has definitely grown as an actress from her days of doing the Mummy movies. Don't get me wrong I absolutely loved her character in those movies but I never would believe she could have the 'chops' to do a movie this intense and carry it off. Kudos to you Rachel you were magnificent.To the reviewer that thought this was some kind of CSI movie I have to agree with another reviewer. OBVIOUSLY you need to buy a clue and realize that this was not just some fairy tale it was a very dark real portrayal of human trafficking that is going on all around us.But this movie was more than just a story it is a report on an INTERNATIONAL organization that is supposed to PROTECT the helpless not only turning a blind eye but actually becoming INVOLVED in something that 55 years ago people were being tried and hung for in Nuremburg.As a resident of Markham just northeast of Toronto I had to chuckle when I saw them using Toronto City Hall as the U.N. offices in Bosnia but I'm sure that only Toronto residents would recognize the interior.Overall an excellent movie worthy of many awards and I only hope that many more people will see it and realize how serious a problem we have on our hands. Please do give it a watch. I now find myself having to watch Taken because I need something to uplift me a bit and make me think there is someone out there that can do something righteous against these human trafficking scum.".

	schema:headline " A smart and gripping political thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "These days it's become a rarity to find a political thriller that is intelligent intense and intriguing. So when one like The Whistleblower comes along I find no trouble in treasuring every moment of it. Rachel Weisz stars as the titular potboiler who uncovers a sex trafficking ring while working as a peacekeeper in Bosnia. Based on a true story she turns over some dirty rocks and a lot of people start to get very angry. This leads to a very tense race to discover the truth and find someone willing to help her bring down these horrible men before they get to her. There's a subplot with Monica Bellucci's character that is a little dull and eventually inconsequential but when the Weisz side of things is so gripping it's easy to look past.The story here is strong and every moment especially in the final act breathes with a wicked intensity that keeps you on your toes but the real driving force of the film is Weisz. For some reason it seems like it's pretty hard for films to present female characters who are strong and firm in their beliefs without turning them into unbearable stereotypes. This year though we've experienced an influx of great ones that come off as genuine human beings and Weisz's Kathryn Bolkavac is another to add to the list. Especially given the fact that she plays a woman who is being constantly attacked and undermined by everyone around her a role that opens itself up to melodramatic hysterics pretty easily. Weisz had to hit this balance of strength and broken hopelessness without going too far to make it unrealistic and she hits every note necessary.There's one scene later in the film that really stands as a measure to the power of her performance. Bolkavac gets within an inch of freeing these girls and exposing the truth when out of nowhere the rug is pulled out from under her and things look worse than ever. She bursts into tears desperate for some way out of this situation everything she was fighting for was right in her grasp and she just gets it ripped out of her hand like two kids fighting over a toy on Christmas. This moment would have been difficult for most actors but Weisz has matured into one of our finest performers and she doesn't phase for a second. She could have easily slipped into unintentionally comedic melodrama but instead she brings down the house and almost brought a tear to my eye. It's a devastating moment in one of the strongest most commanding performances of the year so far. A superb performance in a taut intelligent thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "With billions of dollars behind peace keeping in torn countries like Bosnia it is a given that there will be needed order albeit with corruption. Paid handsomely lowlevel people workers in these countries are seen by their corporate employers as necessary grunts getting the daytoday work done and silently bank their tax free earnings. For the most part that bet seems an easy way for these powers to amass wealth while enacting little real change. Their small roles big paydays combined with the quite dangerous hardly glamorous hard life they lead usually silence them for a quick in and out period of employment without any ripple to the system .Sometimes unforeseen events do occur mostly they too can be contained. Few with purely idealistic goals survive any length of time in such an environment. These troublemakers can be summarily dismissed in obscurity. In relatively few cases there arises a most unlikely character who somehow in spite of hisher relative powerlessness rises and threatens to shake things up. The Whistleblower tells the story of one such person who against the forces that be exposed the complicity of the UN Peace Keeping Forces and a Blackwaterish private contractor in turning a blind eye to rampant human trafficking while supposedly returning Bosnia to order. This isn't a surprise that stretches one's imagination yet the fact that billions of tax payer's dollars supported this should outrage any moral being.Kathryn Bolkovac a divorced former Nebraska policewoman needs to make enough money to be able to finance a move to Georgia so she can be close to her two children who are in the custody of their father. She sees the job in Bosnia her best bet to succeed in that goal while hopefully working in the realm of law enforcement which she enjoys. Kathryn played by Rachel Weisz becomes aware of sizable numbers of European young women being forced into prostitution in Bosnia. The local arm of it seems to be run out of an outlying bar called The Florida Bar. It is common knowledge yet the locals turn a blind eye. She immediately seeks a witness who will help her to use the legal system to prosecute those involved to save these young girls and return them to their families. Kathryn soon realizes it will be a battle as The UN administrators save one Madeliene Rees do not want to get involved. What ensues is a harrowing story of one woman's never say never attitude as she goes up against The UN governments and private contractors who have a vested interest in dealing with other problems instead. If Kathryn wants to live and make it back to her kids she has to decide if the outcome is worth the risk. These are big stakes with such negative repercussions most workers would likely choose the route these other organizations have chosen. Not Kathryn.This movie is anything but a grandstanding commercialized depiction tailored for mass movie audience consumption. The Whistleblower is very direct and economical in bringing to light the struggle waged by Kathryn. While being a Canadian production it is world class in both writing and filming. You feel the danger and the hopelessness that has surrounded Bosnia since civil war brought total chaos. Rachel Weisz performs at a level we've yet to see her achieve as the viewer feels the presence of a very real Kathryn Bolkovac's frustration and heartache. As the story builds the stakes naturally get higher. When it seems Kathryn's persistence will finally enact the freedom of the girls and the exposure of corruption she gets fired. No longer enjoying diplomatic immunity she is even threatened with the very legal system she sought to use to end this evilness. She risks her own freedom which other than life's breath itself is all she has left. At this point she teams up with a sympathetic UN executive the only one Madeliene Rees implicitly trusts within The UN to be of any help. The two fool the corporate peace keeping organizations point man enabling Kathryn to flee Bosnia along with the police records that were to expose the corruption but had been closed by mysterious forces. You need to see this movie as you will summon a very reallife outrage by things you had no way of knowing your tax dollars were financing.I repeat The Whistleblower does not grandstand but tells it completely straight with great realism. Everything works the singularly amazing performance of Rachel Weisz the perfect costarring roles of Vanessa Redgrave as Madeleine Rees and the very lowkey part of the UN executive conspirator played superbly by the great character actor David Strathairn. Cinematography is suitably stark gray and hopeless combined with the script the location and the performances we have a very palatable synergism. After seeing the movie the viewer wants to know even more not the least of which is due to the factual aftermath revealed in the closing. Very powerful moviemaking a must see.".

Rachel Weisz plays Kathryn Bolkovac a cop from Nebraska who arrives in Bosnia to work for this firm and is seconded to the genderaffairs department. Weisz sees the stint as a much needed change of scene leaving behind a broken marriage plus as an opportunity to improve her financial position given the compensation that comes with such a hardshipposting.The times are tough and the residues of communal hatred still linger  one situation shows the apathy of the local policemen towards a victim of domesticabuse given that she is from the other side. Weisz stumbles upon a racket of human trafficking that lures young girls into slavery who are abused by ruthless sadists  all with the active connivance and involvement of some employees of the firm. Wiesz lone voice is silenced by the firm  despite the support she receives from a plucky UN officer for genderaffairs played by Vanessa Redgrave.Eventually Rachel takes the sordid story of protectors who have turned predators to the media in the UK where the firm is registered.Fighting workplace conspiracy that is fueled by apathy and greed can be lonesome and Wiesz portrayal of a gritty professional is engrossing. One is reminded of the roles of Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich 2000 and Laura Dern in Damaged Care TV 2002 standing up for what is right despite being stymied by the perpetrators whose acts have the undertones of genderbias and suffering the indignation while staying the course with deep conviction.The movie is spartan in productionvalue driving home the truth that a good script and great performances are more than enough to tell a story.The story makes one wonder of the risks that arise out of the involvement of private enterprises in security and policing notwithstanding the mandates under which they operate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Emotional exhaustion swept over me as this film came to an end. Based on the true experiences of Kathryn Bolkovac we see what a true hero is. She absolutely refused to turn away from the despicable actions of her coworkers and government officials.Rachel Weisz delivers what is far and away her best performance yet. She captures the emotional complexity and strength that Ms. Bolkovac displayed. Some have stated she was conflicted but I never saw that. I saw the character of a woman who had a clear understanding of right and wrong ... and would settle for nothing less than right.Kathryn a Nebraska cop accepts a UN peacekeeping job in postwar Bosnia. Her spirit and strength is recognized and rewarded with promotion by Madeleine Rees Vanessa Redgrave who is director of the Human Rights Commission. It is in this job where she slowly uncovers the corruption and coverup of sex trafficking of underage girls. Even more sickening is that this most profitable business is being run by the peacekeepers and law officers being paid to protect these citizens.It turns out that though Ms. Bolkovac was fighting for these human rights of these girls she was also working diligently to expose the corruption of the private contractors hired to supply personnel in all aspects of recovery in countries such as Bosnia. In her situation the private contractor was DynCorp and she had no problem pulling back the curtain on the lack of training and control exhibited by this and other contractors.Combine that with the frustrations in dealing with bureaucrats such as Monica Bellucci's character it often feels as if Ms. Bolkovac is fighting a one woman crusade with a little help from David Strathairn's character. When red tape such as no passport for the abused girls and diplomatic immunity become major players in fending off her efforts we get the wonderful line immunity not impunity. That explains a great deal.The film is directed by first timer Larysa Kondracki. Setting and tone is well captured but the editing of many scenes left me somewhat distracted but not to the point of annoyance. There is so much tension and exposure to despicable actions in this film that I found it difficult to relax afterward. The strength and courage of this woman will restore your faith in humanity and remind us we should never turn away from doing the right thing.".

Buried amongst a slew of popcorn blockbusters and big title releases this movie disappeared quickly from movie theatres and from people's awareness as it appears was intended.Its subject matter is not an easy one as it deals with one of humanity's scourges namely human trafficking a phrase which seems to be more acceptable and suited to our modern day sensibilities and political correctness a scourge that I myself like to call it for what it actually is...slavery.Yes folks if you thought that slavery is buried and gone you are dead wrong! It still thrives and it is as cruel barbaric and dehumanizing as ever. Faces places and dates might have changed but the basic cruelty and oppression upon which slavery is based has remained.Though the story is set over 10 years ago most of the subject matter is as relevant today as it was then as is the urgency to deal with this dark and ongoing chapter of human history one which our civilized world apparently continues to tolerate and allows to exist.The wonderful cast Rachel Weisz Vanessa Regrave Monica Bellucci and David Strathairn among them tries to bring some humanity and context to this depressingly realistic take on the trafficking and sale of human beings in this instance women from the former Yugoslavia and the rest of the Eastern European bloc.The movie is as bleak as the topic it tackles and as devoid of a clearcut resolution or triumph as in real life. Every small success is counteracted by more disappointment failure and a deep sense of impotence and frustration at the inability to do anything about it. The identity and nature of the parties involved and partaking in this cruel and inhumane enterprise is all the more shocking and discouraging. It is literally one step forward and two steps backward...to put it mildly.If you are looking for some story of heroism or some silver lining be forewarned...there is none. Still I would like to challenge people outhere to see this movie for themselves rent it buy it watch it ondemand stream it on the internet whatever! I feel that this film deserves more attention from as many people as possible. If enough of us see it and if any of it permeates into our consciousness then perhaps we will at least be more aware of the world we inhabit better yet some brave souls might even decide to do something about it!".

In order to be closer to her daughter she strove to get a transfer to Atlanta without much luck until an offer came  a deal that she be posted first to Bosnia for a sixmonth U.N. peacekeeping assignment.Her initial experience was one of frustration witnessing how people who were supposed to help really did not care  Bosnia specializes in fxxxups as one coworker quipped. To most of these people complicated racial makeup and longharboured hatreds were too much to disentangle. Steadfastly loyal to her job she helped win a racialprejudiced case in court which brought a promotion to head a department in the U.N. Gender Affairs Office. This unfortunately was only the beginning of a nightmare.Raid of a local bar unveiled corruption in the form of protection money to harbour prostitution. But this was only the tip of an iceberg. What started as an investigation of one or two corrupted officers turned out to be a DavidandGoliath fight against people in high places who rather than just harbouring prostitution condoned full scale sex trafficking by all kinds of people with authority and diplomatic immunity.In many ways this movie is similar to Fair game 2010 another recent truestory based movie. People at high places have lost their fundamental sense of right and wrong serving an animal called political necessity. In both cases the protagonist promised protection to civilians to obtain their cooperation only to end in bitter remorse when they found that they were powerless to deliver the protections they gallantly promised.But there were also differences. In Fair Game the protagonist tried to bend to avoid breaking before finally fighting back. But when she finally did the audience was awarded with the satisfaction that poetic justice exists not only in fiction but also in real life sometimes as the movie ends with a clipping of the real person's opening address in the enquiry where she blew the whistle and at least one of the rouges was jailed we learned in the movie. In The whistleblower exposing the case through the British media did not result in any prosecution. Some people were brought back from Bosnia but were probably reassigned to other places such as Iraq where they could presumably continue with their hideous crime.While there are some dramatized thriller elements the movie is tough to watch and depressing to emerge from. Yet the fact that the movie has been made and is watched by millions of people around the word is a positive note. Weisz in this movie has taken her performance even one notch higher than in Agora 2009 and has been tipped for an Oscar nomination or even win. She deserves at least a nomination. While this is mainly her show there is an absolutely first class support cast including Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathairn portraying her two true allies in a sea of enemies. Monica Bellucci played an unpleasant character not exactly a villain but a rigid bureaucrat who places rules and regulations way above human compassion. This is a somewhat outofcharacter role for voluptuous Bullucci and my guess is that she takes on the role as one in a movie with a worthy cause.".

The theme of the film is Human Trafficking and apparently there are about 2.5 million victims around the world today  young people who are sold into sexual slavery for the financial gain of people from all areas of life including our own government the International Practices Task Force and contracted companies supported by the US Government to rebuild who are assigned to third world countries and countries besieged by or recovering from war and in our own cities in this country. This film is based on a true story a story written and discussed in the bonus track on the DVD by Kathryn Bolkovac who was transferred from her police job in Lincoln Nebraska to Bosnia with the promise of 100000. and a six month term to monitor the local Sarajevo police and advise them on proper police procedures. Bolkovac's story was written for the screen by Eilis Kirwan and director Larysa Kondracki who also directed the story with stinging reality.Kathryn Bolkovac Rachel Weisz is a recently divorced mother of a young girl who has lost custody of her daughter because of her constant commitment to her job. When she is offered a lot of money and an advancement if she will go to Bosnia on a special assignment she accepts feeling that if she ha money she can return home to live close to her young daughter. When she arrives in Sarajevo she is treated with distance from the colleagues with whom she will be working. Her first accomplishment is bringing to justice the abuse of a Muslim woman who has been constantly a victim of spousal abuse  something not considered a crime until Kathryn proves it in court. She soon discovers that there is a human trafficking problem in Bosnia where young girls are brought into the country sold as sex slaves to tend to the needs and whims and cruel and often sadistic whims of the IPTF International Practices Task Force as well as the US and international soldiers assigned by the UN to cover the recovery of Bosnia. She visits the bars where the girls are kept finds evidence of physical violence and abuse in the filth of the atrocious living conditions the girls are subjected to and begins her attempts to save the girls  particularly Raya Roxana Condurache and Luba Paula Schramm whom she promises to protect if they will testify about their conditions. Kathryn seeks solace from a Dutch compatriot boyfriend Jan Nikolaj Lie Kaas and takes her case to the UN person in charge Monica Bellucci who is a bythe rules leader and cannot offer help to Kathryn. Kathryn is contacted by Madeleine Rees Vanessa Redgrave the High Commissioner for Human Rights who aids her in her plight and puts her in contact with Peter Ward David Strathairn in Internal Affairs chief of the UN complex. Kathryn finally discovers that the perpetrators of the human trafficking are the very people with whom she works and she is ultimately fired from her position. But before she leaves she releases the documents she has created that prove the victims of human trafficking are under the direction and service of the employees of the UN  in many ways her dangerous mission has been accomplished and the Democra a security contractor is exposed.Rachel Weisz brings a very human quality to her role making her transformation into a heroine for the abused victims all the more credible. Her performance is outstanding  and in the conversation with the real life Kathryn Bolkovac in the bonus feature with the film the manner in which Weisz succeeded in her role is all the more impressive. This is a tough movie to watch but it is a necessary statement to make the heinous crime of human trafficking more widely known and punished throughout the world. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

She is offered a high paying 6 month post working for the UN in Bosnia which changes the course of her life. She is the only woman on the force working amongst hardnosed men who have little regard for women. Her excellent work protecting the rights of Muslim women is noticed by Madeline played by Vanessa Redgrave who offers Kathryn a promotion to Head of Department.Kathryn's bullheaded determination to investigate what appears to be discrepancies with how cases are handled begins to create tension with her colleagues. It isn't long before things begin to unravel when Kathryn discovers that the girls from a local bar are part of a human trafficking business. The girls held against their will are brutally beaten drugged and tortured. What Kathryn uncovers puts her life in danger and has huge international implications for the persecution of high officials employed as peacekeepers.The film is action packed from start to finish and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The brutality is severe making the facts that this is also a reality for 2.5million victims of human trafficking difficult to conceive and devastating to accept. The atmosphere created by the bleak and colourless location accurately reflects the lives of those trapped in its existence.Rachel Weisz's performance is exceptional. Her eyes speak volumes. The viewer is swept along Kathryn's journey at such a rapid pace that it is easy to be caught up in Kathryn's frustration and the compassion she feels for the young girls whose fear of the brutal treatment by their captors outweighs their courage to try to escape.It is a disturbing and stressful film to watch because of the truth of the facts. It is brilliantly written and directed by Larysa Kondracki. The film is an amazing achievement as her directorial debut. Also of high standard is the cinematography work of Kieran McGuigan and brilliant editing by Julian Clarke. It is a film worth seeing and one that will be etched in your mind permanently. There are many reasons to see this film the most important is for the awareness it brings to human trafficking and the exposure of the people who are paid to protect. If youth won't listen to the advice of their parents they may pay attention to what happens in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "  out of I've mentioned it before and I'll say it again I'm a sucker for mystery thrillers especially when they involve methodical serial killers. So despite the fact that Twisted was clearly one of the worst reviewed films of the year I still rented it based on both my preference for the genre and for the film's cast as I am huge fans of Samuel L. Jackson and Ashley Judd. Andy Garcia Russell Wong and Leland Orser are in the film too and that's definitely not a shabby supporting cast.The film stars Judd as San Francisco patrol officer Tess Shepard. After busting a murderer she's promoted to inspector by the commissioner Samuel L. Jackson who also happens to be her legal guardian thanks to a rather sordid past. Tess' new partner is Del Marco Andy Garcia and they're quickly assigned to their first case when a corpse is discovered by the shore. The crime is murder but there's a catch Tess recognizes the dead man a mere stranger she picked up at a bar a month ago. Another murder occurs and it's yet another man Tess slept with. And considering she keeps blacking out the night each of the men is killed she begins to suspect if she's the very own killer they're looking for.For all that's very wrong with this film Twisted isn't nearly as bad as I though it'd be. Don't take that as high praise because the movie's still bad just not horrible enough that I'd put it on any personal bottom 10 lists. Because I saw this film just a day after Taking Lives there was the occasional bit of dj vu. Remember how I mentioned that film introduced us to the heroine by showing how clever and resourceful she was? Pretty much the same case here except we also see that Judd's Tess Shepard can kick ass. Her cleverness is displayed through her ability to perfectly describe people and objects she's seen after a brief glance a fine ability no doubt but not something that really impresses in terms of plot and characterization.The movie's various attempts at building a sense of mystery are suspense are quite pathetic. Examples? Judd keeps hearing a metallic clinking outside her apartment every night before the murders and she keeps drinking alcohol on those same nights and consequently blacks out. This is a repeated process so you'd think it take her more than the majority of the film's running time to figure out her drink might be tainted with a drug or that whoever's making that noise might somehow be associated with her blackouts. Figuring out the identity of the killer is almost too easy. Just follow Roger Ebert's little movie rule about how the culprit is almost always the person who has no other reason to be in the picture and you'll be able to narrow it down real fast. Twisted is blessed with a surprisingly highprofile cast and while most everyone is nothing less than decent it's a bit of a surprise actors of such highcaliber would choose a script that plays out more like 'TV movie of the week' material. I can maybe see the appeal to Ashley Judd in playing a tortured but tough heroine but Samuel L. Jackson has arguably the film's most thankless role and he's barely in the picture for more than fifteen minutes. Competent acting is always a great plus in the genre but it also takes plot and suspense to actually make a thriller with thrills and this movie has absolutely zilch in that department.".

It wasn't bad at all. It was a decent serial killer movie except for the ending which went on too long and got a bit sappy but a lot of movies are know for that. However by the end all the characters including Judd's Jessica Shepard had worn thin and I was glad to see it end.I also had heard that the ending was easy to figure out but I didn't find that. Actually I thought I but I guessed wrong and I assume others did as well. So don't believe everything you hear it's a decent film. Nothing to spend a lot of money on but you could do a lot worse. With Judd Andy Garcia Samuel L. Jackson and David Strathairn the same could be said about the cast".

	schema:reviewBody "To hear Director Philip Kaufman tell it Twisted was supposed to be the best film noire picture since the classics of the 40s. Not so. It has most of the elements of film noire..the dark lighting the darkened streets and a murder mystery. But it doesn't quite work.Officer Jessica Shepard Ashley Judd is a kick ass police officer who has just been promoted to Homicide Inspector. Now it seems that the comely young officer also has a penchant for violent behavior and one night stands. Her mentor is none other than Police Commissioner John Mills Samuel L. Jackson who has raised her and nurtured her career following the tragic deaths of her parents some years earlier.Shepard's new partner turns out to be Mike Delmarco Andy Garcia whom she had unknowingly met the previous evening during a party at a bar in her honor. Suddenly Jessica's one night lovers begin turning up dead brutally beaten. At the same time she has been experiencing blackouts immediately before the murders. She then begins to suspect that she may be responsible.Sounds good huh? I though so too but on watching it I guessed who the murderer was almost right away. This took away any suspense the director was trying to build by placing suspicion on other characters. We do get some nice shots of San Francisco though.The petite Ashley Judd is just not convincing as a tough love 'em and leave 'em cop. She does her best work in the psychological scenes where she comes unraveled at the thought that she may be murdering these men. Jackson does the best he can with limited material. He is off screen more than he is on. I thought that his character could have been fleshed out a little more. Garcia playing an Italian again does what he can with his role. TV's Camryn Manheim puts in a appearance as the forensic examiner Lisa.Not nearly as good as Director Philip Kaufman would have you believe.".

The reason you already saw this movie it's because the movie is generic and predictable. This movie has every possible and imaginable clich a who done it movie could have there's the disturbed hero that had an unfortunate childhood trauma and happens to be the prime suspect of the slaughter there's the unrevealing partner who seems to be too nice to be true there's the mentor who took over the hero's guardianship when her parents died there's the exlove interest who's far from the perfect date there's the jealous coworker who's trying to take the hero down and there's the predictable plot twist at the end. Does this remind you of something? If you're thinking A Time To Kill Eye Of The Beholder High Crimes or Double Jeopardy you've got it! Ashley Judd only takes part in generic who done it films. What's even funnier is that the posters for these films look exactly alike. The acting itself has its highs and lows. Sam Jackson is of course the star of the company alongside Andy Garcia and both eventually have to carry the whole movie since Ashley Judd can't even wake up convincingly. Some moments in this film I thought I was watching and amateur group. Filmmaker Philip Kaufman seems to like going ups and downs in his career and create generic and bad movies Henry  June Rising Sun Twisted after brilliant movies The Unbearable Lightness of Being The Right Stuff so this seems to be yet another low point in his career thought he can't be blamed that the plot is so generic. A movie with this cast should have done a lot better and Ashley Judd's career needs better scripts. She's not totally untalented she just doesn't do these sorts of rules any justice. She's definitely not suited to be wear the tough girl gimmick. Only watch this movie if you have nothing else to do since you've already watched it anyway. Too generic.".

When Jessica starts blacking out before each murder the police commissioner Samuel Jackson and her partner Andy Garcia begin to suspect that she may be more directly involved with the murders. Twisted may boast an impressive cast but that's about all it has going for it. The story is pretty unoriginal as this is just a female version of Tightrope. While having a tough female cop in the lead role is a little interesting it doesn't save the film from being really bad. The film tries to trick the audience offering some twists and turns but they all fail. Twisted is a poorly written thriller lacking twists. If you really think about it you could probably figure out the ending before the thirty minute mark. It's just so obvious that you wonder why they even bothered making it in the first place. Ashley Judd stars in this movie and she really needs to move on to a different genre. High Crimes Eye of the Beholder Kiss the Girls Double Jeopardy and now Twisted have all starred Ashley Judd and I think audiences are getting bored watching her in the same role in every movie. In Twisted she gives her usual performance though she looked a little bored throughout the film. You would think having Andy Garcia and Samuel L Jackson would help but apparently no talented actor can save the movie. Jackson also appears bored throughout the movie and this a paycheck movie for him. Andy Garcia gives an okay performance. It was just a little over the top. It's a by the numbers thriller and if you pay close attention to the film you can figure out the killer five minutes into the movie. If you sit back and relax you may enjoy it more but they could have hidden the identity of the killer a little better. All of the three main actors in this movie are way above this material and I was surprised to see all of them in this. In the end Twisted is another dull entry into the genre and it's only worth watching if you're a diehard fan of anyone involved. Rating 410.".

TWISTED stars Ashley Judd as a tough cop who picks up guys in bars and has wild sex with them. The only problem is the guys she sleeps with end up dead! I guess some of the guys are a little uptight about sex and or women being cops but that's their problem. What is different about this film from say SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is that in TWISTED Jess Ashley's character comes to believe that she might be the killer she is looking for. This is her best role ever and I think there's something liberating about seeing a woman cop kick some ass and be truly feminine at the same time. She is strugggling with her capacity to kill. At the end the film answers the question of whodunit' in a truly shocking and unexpected way.If pressed I would say that this film is a noir thriller though it's so much more. There's a great love story here too actually there are many kinds of love stories in the film and one really twisted onethus the title. The direction the camerawork and acting are all great.".

I read somewhere that he really pursued the film and I can see why. Andy Garcia is great as her strange partner. TWISTED is a film noir. Someone just sent me an excellent definition ...a film noir is a crime story in which the characters in the grip of urgent appetites sex money and revenge are the most popular are driven to perform extremely dangerous complicated and often morally dubious acts and in which the prevailing mooda mixture of fear desire and desperation is intensified by both a singleminded economy of narrative and an almost oppressive formality of graphic design.. TWISTED is not a typical Hollywood film nor is it an Ashley Judd woman in jeopardy film. This is a bold role for a great actress.I've read some extremely stupid and unfair things written here about the film. There is such a thing as a black out syndrome just ask any psychologist and everything seemed very accurate to me I have friends who work in law enforcement who also enjoyed the film even though a cop is the killer. I think it's sort of like a political debate where everyone is trying to agree with each other instead of seeing the film for what it is. I hope people can see it and enjoy what the filmmakers clearly intended a sexy twisted film noir.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is one word to describe Twisted formulaic. This movie without much direction and hardly any substance tries to manufacture a story based on nearly every serial killerprofiler thriller that's been out. It's a bunch of pieces put together but the final product is completely forgettable particularly the ending which was not only uninteresting but also somewhat confusing as to helping you understand motive essentially acting as an anticlimax to a dull movie.The movie starts out with about a half hour of boring dialogue and interactions as we are introduced to our characters one as inconsequential as the next. The story is about that of patrolwoman Jessica Shepard Judd who gets promoted to investigator thanks to her keen eye for detail. But with her promotion follows a gruesome chain of mutders of guys that she's been permiscuous with. We are briefly shown one murder after the next. This is not even a psychological tempter where the detectives get so insanely into their work as they try to figure out who the killer is and his moda operandi and all of that the way other serial killerprofiler movies do. It took Morgan Freeman quite a few murders in 'Seven' and a deep dig in the library before he could formulate some theory about the killer. In 'Taking Lives' Angelina Jolie became so engrossed in the murders that she used to have the pictures spread all over her floor while she slept and bathed. We can see the nervewracking positions of the detectives and it adds to our own assumptions as to who we think the killer is and why he does those brutal crimes. But in 'Twisted' there is almost nothing compelling about the murders as they are introduced so quickly and with hardly many details other than that of a killer who marks his victims with a cigarette burn on the hand. In fact the story only seems to drop these murders in our lap so as to eliminate possible murder suspects. That weird guy in the bar with the strange tattoo or Jessica's violent exboyfriend quickly become knocked out of the picture and thus struck from our list of possible killers. In part toothis is because we are supposed to believe that Judd is the killer but even that is still unconvincing as we see her blackout all the time and are even shown her strange dreams. Jessica becomes one of the suspects because of the coincidental closeness she has to each of the victims and because of her suspicious violent tendencies something she supposes is a genetic trait as her father had a reputation for violence. But as well as Jessica pays attention to detail she can't be sure whether she is the killer. 'Twisted' doen'st even offer much development here and that is partly because the situation is too repetetive. Viewers are pretty much given the same bag of tricks with little to throw their attention or interest.  Every night is the same thing she comes home to to wave at the old neighbor woman staring at her from the building across  the way and then after a tall glass of Cabernet she blacks out and her dreams of violent and sexual encounters all of which make her even more confused. You'd think that she'd back track and at least stop drinking the same wine every night knowing that that is exactly the moment she passes out. But Jessica is up for a rude awakening when she realizes the truth. Not only is the ending predictable as the killer goes for that let's make this finale death scene look like 'the serial killer' that you're looking for did it. The killer's motives and explanation for committing the crimes are even as textbook as the finale. 'Twisted' was a pretty bad movie and one that proves how ridiculously formulaic the serial killerprofiler movies have become. Writers are running out of steam trying to ride on the popularity of a thriller but not offering much by way of story development particularly the endings. The ending to this movie is about as illogical and uninteresting as 'Gothika.'".

With the coming to power of the Nazis all this changed. Between 1933 and 1945 100000 men were arrested for homosexuality under Paragraph 175 the sodomy provision of the German penal code dating back to 1871. Some were imprisoned others were sent to concentration camps. Of the latter only about 4000 survived. Today fewer than ten of these men are known to be living. Five of them have now come forward to tell their stories for the first time in this powerful new film. The Nazi persecution of homosexuals may be the last untold story of the Third Reich. Paragraph 175 fills a crucial gap in the historical record and reveals the lasting consequences of this hidden chapter of 20th century history as told through personal stories of men and women who lived through it the half Jewish gay resistance fighter who ...";

I did not expect much because usually I am not the documentary type but the mixture of old film footage and photos with some 20s and 30s music and interviews of a few of the survivors 7 homosexualls 1 lesbian was very interesting. The big thing about this movie is to get to know about what happened in that time because no one spoke about this when we were talking about the second world war in history class. it is unbelievable that the paragraph 175 existed even till 1969. this is a mustsee film !".

	schema:reviewBody "Paragraph 175 is a powerful documentary that deals with a provocative subject. I just wish filmmakers Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein had fleshed out the subject a bit more. While this film about gay men who were persecuted and imprisoned under the Nazi regime is in many respects absorbing the film ultimately suffers from an overly narrow and constricted focus.Perhaps the problem was that there were just not enough men alive today who were willing to talk about their experiences. From the outset the pool of interviewees was certainly going to be limited but also limited is the actual archival footage of life in the concentration camps.Instead the directors have chosen to pepper the film with wellpreserved family photographs and lively footage of gay and lesbian culture blossoming during the days of the Weimar Republic after WW1. Sensitively narrated by British actor Rupert Everett Paragraph 175 is all about the German penal code which was originally enacted in 1871 and later used by the Nazis to outlaw homosexuality.The penal code stated An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex is punishable by imprisonment the loss of civil rights may also be imposed But Paragraph 175 was never really enforced until the Nazi's came to power. This documentary centers on six emotional accounts of the most elderly and frail survivors of the concentration camps who up until now have repressed their stories.There's a Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort a photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality who upon his release joined the army because of the lack of men in his hometown and he wanted to be with men. There's a young man who was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again at Buchenwald and a Frenchman imprisoned from Alsace who breaks down after telling of being raped and subject to inhuman torture. Their stories are indeed heart wrenching because unlike the Jews they have forced to live quietly unable to share their horrific experiences for so long.It is interesting to note that the penal code didn't cover lesbians. The Nazis considered lesbians to be curable. Women were regarded as vessels of motherhood  increasing the German population was top priority  therefore they were exempt from mass arrest. Most lesbians went into exile or quietly married gay men. One woman who tells her story in the film was given exit papers and was lucky enough to escape to England.The statistics are staggering Between 1933 and 1945 some 100000 men were arrested for homosexuality roughly half of them were sentenced to prison and from 10000 to 15000 were sent to concentration camps. The camps were used for reeducation slave labor castration and sadistic medical experiments. It's believed only about 4000 survived their ordeal.The situation didn't improve after the war. Paragraph 175 remained in force until the late sixties so many gay men were reimprisoned and subject to repeated persecution. In this respect Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die.

I read a similar account on the Internet I suspect it was the same case in which graphic details were given of the brutality of the crime details which if you heard or read about you would never forget. To just gloss over this compelling tale in the manner the movie does is inexcusable. How can one understand the true horror when it is glossed over.Additionally one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war specifically because of Paragraph 175. It is barely a footnote in the movie. This is inexplicable to me.What is good is having a record of living survivors of gay detention during the Holocaust. It remains the reason for seeing this movie. But the narrative is very meandering and a few of the lingering closeups of some of the survivors breaking down almost feels exploitative.Bottom line because of the important subject matter and the live interviews the film needs to be seen.

I just wish it had been made more coherently. A film with this type of material will always be powerful. It could have been far more so had it been made by better filmmakers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the wealth of documentaries and factual dramas covering the atrocities committed by the Nazis under the command of Adolf Hitler there is always another story as equally horrifying as it is unbelievable to come out of the woodwork. This harrowing documentary by Rob Epstein The Times of Harvey Milk 1984 and Jeffrey Friedman Howl 2010 focuses on the social persecution and mass murder of approximately 75000 German homosexual men under Nazi rule. Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code forbade homosexual activity placing it on the same level as bestiality and paedophilia and the law was broadened by Hitler during his rise to power as he sought to 'purify' the German race. The law remained in place until 1994.Early scenes show a 1920's Berlin in full swing where the young danced drank and experimented sexually without fear of persecution. Paragraph 175 existed but was rarely enforced and the young partied freely in a country relieved to come out of the carnage of World War I in one piece. As the Jews were starting to be rounded up and placed in ghettos ready for the concentration camps homosexual men were under the impression that simply being German would be enough to save them. Similar to what they did with the Jews the Nazis did nothing at first allowing the men to congregate in their night clubs and hot spots only to be rounded up later once they finally felt safe. The emphasis here is on homosexual men as Hitler thought lesbianism to be curable and why waste a perfectly functional carrier of future Aryans?The interviewees taking part in Paragraph 175 have been largely quiet for decades with the German government largely resistant to acknowledging the massmurder of gay men and many countries oblivious to what took place. They often talk in hushed voices with one man describing the 'singing forest' a place that sounds like some kind of haven he escaped to amidst the madness. Instead it was named for the screams that echoed throughout as victims were hung from hooks and left to die. Others describe of seeing their friends being torn apart by dogs while another more animated than the others tells of how he was he was raped with planks of wood by Nazi officers while under questioning. It's a shocking important tale largely ignored even by World War II enthusiasts eloquently told by the two filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably history was after all meant to be a study of human consciousness in guilt. Of course there is always a need to realize something valuable out of the past that a study about the past is after all a human being's reversetroubleshooting guide. Probably that's the reason why there are beautiful pictures of stoic stifflipped people in our high school history textbooks. We like to think of ourselves as the descendants of glorious generations men and women valiant in their own right contributing their bit to the proud bloodlines we carry today. We read on these people associate ourselves with the affairs of their lives judge them for their actions name calendar days after them hate them worship them write books on them film biopics on their lives name our babies after them The reason we can't forget these people could be because they've either given to or taken from this world in proportions far greater than what you or me have.Between the years 1933 and 1945 one man changed our world because he believed in something that seemed stupid at first. As time rolled into horrorfest mode it turned into mankind's worst ever mistake. Something that psychologically stopped time and spun it backwards. We remember that man either because he took away from this world a chunk of our moral fiber the scars forever etched in our minds or probably because he gave this world freedom from the ideologies of mankind's vilest prodigy when he hanged himself.Today history attests the importance of this period of madness with facts and figures that might seem absurdly horrible for our generation. We've all probably read enough to forget about a past like this. Biopics and documentaries have already drychoked our tear glands at the horrifying experiences recounted by Jewish survivors. Pictures of gas chambers and massgraves have already made us numb. And just when we thought that we knew too much to burden our consciences comes a movie about this small group of men who disappeared off the face of the earth because of something that disturbs intrigues and thwarts us till this day Love and all the stigma it carries. And for something so simple and subtle as love to take place between two people there lies an even more absurd reasoning as to why the two people shouldn't be of the same sex. That's the Nazi regime's code of stigma also known as Paragraph 175. And no your fat dogeared history text book does not consider the lives of one hundred thousand men who lived during that time loving others worth mentioning. These men died unnoticed and in secret captivity so secret that even those labor camps within which they died are today not preserved for posterity. Few of those numerous men survived. Fewer live today. And fewer still are willing to come out of their dark closets of tears and share their experiences unscripted and undistorted to a camera crew determined to make known to us such a vital forgotten part of man's history.It's pretty obvious what the contents of Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code contained judging by the number of innocent lives it consumed it would be more appropriate if you'd watch the movie and learn rather than have me explain it to you in a website review. What's most unsettling is interestingly not Paragraph 175 itself considering the circumstances under which it took form. Rather it's the fact that a law that was so fatal took a hundred and twenty three years from the time it was adopted in 1871 to be finally revoked in 1994. Even after the fall of Hitler in 1945 it still took close to fifty whole years and six amendments to finally strike it down.Nazis killed plenty of men women and children. You certainly wouldn't expect the most powerful and conservative army in the world to go soft against gay men and women and suddenly endorse mutual love. Not at a time when your firstduty towards the people you love was replaced by the pride of the country. So in short Nazis did what Nazis do best kill. But even after we thought the horrible era of an insane ideology was over and done with heads of government still remained conservative and chose to ignore the ills of their pasts dragging their feet through the marshes of sludgebureaucracy.Rob Epstein conveys all of these truths with anger and emotion throughout while interviewing these survivors. Some among them is a halfJewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort Annette Eick the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she loved the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality then joined the army on his release because he wanted to be with men and Pierre Seel the French Alsatian teenager who watched as his lover was eaten alive by dogs in the camps.The statistics are staggering Between 1933 and 1945 some 100000 men were arrested for homosexuality roughly half of them were sentenced to prison and from 10000 to 15000 were sent to concentration camps. The camps were used for reeducation slave labor castration and sadistic medical experiments. It's believed only about 4000 survived their ordeal. It is interesting to note that the penal code didn't cover lesbians. The Nazis considered lesbians to be curable. Women were regarded as vessels of motherhood  increasing the German population was top priority  therefore they were exempt from mass arrest. Most lesbians went into exile or quietly married gay men.There are only about 10 homosexuals left from this tragedy and they interviewed eight for this special film. It was incredible and moving and if you are not touched by their stories then you are cast in stone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The German Penal Code of 1871 Paragraph 175 states An unnatural sex act committed between persons of the male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment the loss of civil rights may also be imposed. The law was widely disregarded and the postWorld War I Weimar Republic saw a flowering of gay and lesbian culture most particularly in Berlin. When the Weimar Republic collapsed and the Nazi party rose to power few gays and lesbians felt any reason to fear was not Ernst Rohm head of the SA well known for his homosexuality? On 1 July 1934 later known as The Night of Long Knives the Nazi party conducted a bloody purge of their ranks. Rohm was among the victims and as the Nazis swept to full power over Germany they moved to broaden the scope of Paragraph 175. The glory days of gay and lesbian Berlin were over. Somewhat oddly lesbians were not regarded as a threat to the Nazi party and many lesbians either left Germany or simply withdrew from public life thus escaping with their lives. Gay men however came under full attack. A special branch of the Gestapo was formed to identify gay men once their lists were established the arrests began.With many records destroyed by the Nazis as the Allies swept through Europe at the close of the war it is now very difficult to estimate how many homosexuals were arrested. Most historians agree there is hard evidence to support a figure of 100000 but many note that the total may have been well in excess of that possibly to the extent of 600000 total. Of those fed into the Nazi meat grinder perhaps 4000 surviveda much lower survival rate than that found even among political prisoners. There is considerable evidence that homosexuals were regarded as the lowest of the low in the prison pecking order and suffered not only from Nazi atrocity but were also sometimes savaged by their fellow prisoners as well. And to them was given a final curse the victorious Allies retained Paragraph 175 as law following the collapse of Nazi Germany. Fearing possible rearrest at Allied hands homosexuals who survived the prisons and concentration camps dare not speak of their lives and experiences. Most would remain silent until their deaths.The documentary PARAGRAPH 175 does not attempt to examine the full scope of Nazi atrocity or even Nazi atrocity against the gay community. It instead focuses on the memories of a handful of men and women who recall their experiences. Perhaps the single most famous of these is Pierre Seel who saw his lover killed by dogs in the death camps and who closeted himself to a remarkable extent after the war. I am ashamed! Seel cries at one point in his series of interviews. I am ashamed for humanity! It is a memorable moment of pain echoing across the decades. Seel died in 2005.While most of the interview subjects are male lesbians are represented by Annette Eick a remarkably charming woman and while their stories vary considerably in detail they are the same in content I was there I saw it and I bear witness for those who cannot speak. At times the film seems excessively languid but overall it does justice to its interview subjects who emerge as fullydepicted individuals sometimes passionate sometimes restrained but never without the dignity that should belong to all mankind as birthright.The DVD contains several extras. Although it contained several points of interest I was not greatly impressed with the audio commentary on the other hand I was greatly impressed with two bonus interviews and particularly so by subject Kitty Fisher a Jewish woman who recounts how a homosexual prisoner came to her aidand whose advice ultimately saved her life.These are painful memories all of them and all the more so because the Holocaust has been increasingly downplayed over the past few decadesdownplayed to a point at which some few now attempt to deny that it ever occurred at all. But facts remain facts no matter how many misguided people attempt to change or refute them and in the name of humanity itself we owe all those who have suffered in the killing fields of the world the dignity of truth. PARAGRAPH 175 is a part of that truth.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Instead we are given a chance to journey beyond the obvious sound bites and start to understand just a little of what those interviewed went through and who they are while avoiding the maudlin Barbara Walters approach which can so easily rob the subject of hisher dignity.By careful pacing skillful choice of materials and beautiful editing we are pulled into this little told story of barbarism and bravery. It is extremely moving without feeling in any way exploitive. Bravo!".

The stories of the progay Wiemar culture are the best thing about the picture. From them we get a real sense of what that era was like and what a loss the Nazi ascension represented. When the film considers the Holocaust itself however the interviewees' reticence on the topic fails to provide nearly so rich a description of either the camps or the legal mechanisms of Nazi persecution of homosexuals. It is not a bad film by any means but it does little to educate the viewer and education on this topic is sorely needed.".

There are no characters just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation and that's about it. There was no real plot and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact many action scenes just began on their own coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking Where is this happening? What's going on? The acting was high school drama quality with stiff wooden delivery as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks looking almost robotic in their movements. So these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here now they're there. This was happening now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.".

The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you don't pass out you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store.

If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark please let me know because this is the best I can come up with. However I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.I went to see this film with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes to me the other is an actionadventure flick guru. This latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark. Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started I knew why immediately.It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. Yet I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie. Yet not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema but it also makes no sense. It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and are confused you are not alone.Then the awful storyline acting effects and camera work begin. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad not convincing and has no chemistry with Reid.The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like What is this? And what is going on? Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? Once again NO.Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. But then BAM...sex scene. Once again I don't know.A good oh i don't know 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. This is set to a heavymetal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.And if that wasn't enough...There exists no main villain. There is the scientist and there are the alien things. At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I have no idea.The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the alien things break through? Did the military tell them? Who knows...and by this point who cares? I didn't and you won't.But to top it off Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And thats right you guessed it it the middle of the ing day and it's bright as can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses I don't know and I don't care.Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater all 6 foot 6 inches of me waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my gungho actionadventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.To sum up this CRAPFEST i give it a 0.010 and would give it lower if I could.Unequivocally the worst movie ever made. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.".

On top of that it is narrated as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff who I typically enjoy and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult Tara Reid playing an intelligent role oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.

This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie.

This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie.

	schema:reviewBody "The other day my roommate called me up and said he had two complimentary tickets to a special prescreening to a new moving coming out soon Alone in the Dark.If the name sounds familiar it's probably because you're familiar with the video games by the same name. If not don't worry although the movie claims to be based off the games games I know very well I didn't see any similarities other than the names of the main characters.My friend and I wandered into the theatre and took our seats. Anxiously awaiting the movie. I was especially excited because the game Alone in the Dark ranks in my very exclusive list of alltime scariest games ever...it's only competition is Doom 3. The point is I was expecting a movie that would scare my pants off and send chills up my spine much like the first game did back in the early 90s.Before the movie started a man came out and stood before us and announced that we were the very first audience ever to see this movie and he hoped we enjoyed it. The excitement built!The movie started...and it wasn't long before that excitement turned to confusion and shortly thereafter disappointment combined with a healthy dose of disbelief.This movie sucked! Plain and simple. The plot was by far the worst thing about the movie followed not too distantly by the dialogue and cheesy acting. The only actor who did a halfway decent job was the main character Edward Carnby played by Christian Slater. In fact I would go so far as to say he carried the entire movie.Please note From here on I will be making references to the movie that would be considered spoilers. Even references to how the movie ends. If you actually intend to see this movie even after reading this review you may want to skip the part about the plot.Let's return to the plot for a moment. This is where the bulk of the problems lie. The plot can be summed up through the following words broken confusing irrelevant uninformed and poorly written. Why?The movie has practically nothing to do with the games. The games were based off of an investigator who explored various supernatural phenomena and became trapped in this haunted mansion. The entire point of the game was to get out of the mansion alive...something that was not so easy to do! The movie didn't take place in a mansion really had very little to do with the supernatural and more about some sort of alien creatures. It wasn't a psychological thriller with some action interspersed it was an action flick...and if it attempted to be the former in any way it failed miserably...so much so I never noticed any elements of it.There were several questions raised in the movie that were never answered or even dealt with for that matter. There was this theme of some ancient civilization which apparently had something to do with these creatures but it was never explained what the civilization had to do with the creatures or where or what these creatures were to begin with.Several inconsistencies with elements of the movie. For instance big spoiler ahead. It's established that these creatures cannot exist in the light. They're hurt by sunlight and various other types of light sources. Then at the end the main characters climb out of their underground ordeal appear in the city during the day and notice that everyone is missing. no bodies no blood no signs of struggle...just missing. Then in broad daylight one of these creatures jumps out at them and the movie ends. ...uh folks...daylight. It seems the director forgot to pay attention to that little fact. This is one of many inconsistencies in the movie. It's rife with them.There was this military? police? rebel? institution called 713 which was apparently hunting these creatures aliens? for a while now. It was never established what this organization was if they were part of the government or not or anything about them. They just showed up and all the characters in the movie just accepted them as being in charge of things.The love scene. Completely gratuitous! There was no chemistry between the hero and the heroin. In fact the only way one would know that there was any kind of attraction between them was that it was briefly established in the beginning that they used to be in a relationship. Then for no apparent reason in the midst of all this danger and alien creatures in the same building with them bam. They go at it. Then as if nothing had happened the rest of the movie they continue on their way with absolutely no chemistry to the very end.Character Development...there was none.Several points where the movie moved way too fast or way too slow causing either confusion or boredom. I could go on I have a whole list of things I disliked about the movie but I'll stop here. There were a couple good points to the movie and it's only fair to state them. The introduction was well done and was relatively engaging. I'd go so far as to say the first scene was the best scene in the entire movie although even that scene had several points to it which raised questions that were never answered or dealt with in any way  adding to the confusion later on. The cinematography in parts was creative and showed a level of quality that was far beyond this film. The special fx held their own and for the most part were impressive at points. Alone in the Dark could have followed in the footsteps of the games it was based on and potentially done an amazing job. The games were incredibly frightening and established a mood of horror and suspense from the moment you started playing till long after you quit playing. This movie did nothing more than leave a feeling of disgust at the pit of my stomach that it should represent a series of amazing games and fail so miserably at doing so.The sad fact is my friend and I had the opportunity to see Alone in the Dark for free and yet somehow we both came out of the ordeal feeling cheated.".

This movie was no Manos The Hands of Fate or Troll 2 yes I have seen them both.. twice but at the same time this movie is No Alien Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator Yes even that movie surpassed this. Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.Acting I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film next to the ending credits which played 'Wish I had An Angel' the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it. Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though it was average not good and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.The Soundtrack Except for 'Wish I had An Angel' the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears perhaps to disguise the awful story something I will get to soon. A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.The Directing Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us Yes movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies. At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action the camera stops for some reason.The Producing Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.The Writing  Storyboard Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud. Then it fastforwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective. He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.Yeah the plot is bad really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes which felt like 100 of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another more then the audience can handle more then the audience wants to handle more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.Overall miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0.".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually start by relaying the premise of the film but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews. Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll whose film right before this one was House of the Dead 2003. Like Alone in the Dark it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark there must be something wrong with it.The Premise Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the second world which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later some scientistgovernment researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal and specifically this tribe decided to experiment on some kids to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. Believe it or noteverything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the filmit's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voiceover also reading it to us. Then there was something about the kids being in an orphanage but the government takes them back out and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics and there are super humans roaming around and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.In fact the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf worms that invade your body and turn into snakelike aliens tunneling worms underground zombies Starship Trooperlike wars evil scientists underground lairs gold mines spooky warehouses impalements big mostly unused museums government conspiracies golden trunks pulled out of the sea nuns explosions complex backstabbing plots a very ambiguous romance car chases home invasions kitchen sinks . . . wait I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly amusingly? in Fangoria 240 producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying We're spending much more time on story being very meticulous about that. Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark a smarter film.Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting why we were there or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began. It's just a random mishmash of settings and clichs as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel which is a combination of short varied unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. Just as I tend to at least like most films I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well Tara Reid was bad hereand I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blowup doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining motherinlaws.And speaking of that dialogue a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that I mean that it's a lot of pseudoscientific gobbledygook. At least in Godzilla films there's a campiness to it because they know how ridiculous it is and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.Still I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.".

I'm a Christian Slater fan for starters and now I'm a Uwe Boll fan too. I reckon as Bgrade movie directors go the guy's got talent. He handles the sex scene very well without it being fifteen minutes long and featuring an inordinate amount of nudity and fading in and out all the time and the film was fastly paced and tight. The visual effects were also amazingly welldone for such a film the creatures I forget what they're called especially.I could overlook the problems with the script and the acting but only because 'Alone in the Dark' is so suspenseful and genuinely interesting at times. There's never a dull nor slow moment to be found. I reckon 210 is rather harsh. I've seen worse films than this much worse.

	schema:reviewBody "This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked it still should have been right up my alley hell I like Congo and Allan Quatermaine movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly aliendemonadventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.1. HorrorScifi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Supernatural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.So this movie had potential at least in the cheesehorror section of the video store but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean let's face it both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad it is laughably bad. Oh and for those of you curious she doesn't get naked only down to a bra in a silly totally unnecessary love scene.Even with Reid's performance perhaps the movie could have worked but the plot is what dominates and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in realtime. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened he has amnesia of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713 a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious I guess you never really know unless it was in one of those voiceovers I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities. I may have the exact quote wrong but you get the idea.There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth no reason given experiments on children super demonalienhuman hybrids photonic bullets the demon things can't stand sunlight and of course Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.Jesus I can't even being to wade through the clichd elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes they use the old scifi stand by of parasitic aliensdemons which fuse with the spine of their hostOf course Slater is like Blade half superslug powered but his slug didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock thank god. Oh and the people with these fused spines have no idea they're halfaliendemon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.So lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it is.Also the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.Not the very worst thing you'll see but a truly bad movie.".

	schema:headline " Plan 9 From Outer Space for a new generation";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates Plan 9 from Outer Space Battlefield Earth and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film. But alas I felt alone in the dark I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.So... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens they even call them Xenos and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can turn invisible at random and I assure you it is random and get hurt by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.And those were the high points. The story revolving around a paranormal investigator Slater whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trenchcoat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist Reid who is rather inept. And a government agentDorff whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed at their performances not that they have really ever done a good a job before and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess. The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.Then comes the plot. Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the backstory. This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. And the ending did not make one ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film it simply did not make sense.Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll. Disgrace thats all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.I payed a 1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.Shame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone who was associated with this film.".

Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates Plan 9 from Outer Space Battlefield Earth and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film. But alas I felt alone in the dark I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.So... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "It has only been recently that Uwe Boll's seeming masterpiece Alone In The Dark has been available here for rental. It completely bypassed local theatres and was available on DVD in America at least a year before here which is rarely a good sign. Unlike Boll's previous effort House Of The Dead the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects. The real problem lies in the direction and editing. Articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing Boll's inflated selfopinion and inability to work effectively with collaborators. It seems that this includes actors. Reid and Slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film. At one point Slater and Reid appear to be running from the Alienlike creatures of the story through a warehouse. To say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement. This scene could have been more convincing in fact if they had been running across a floor with a rearprojection behind them.No the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing. A sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes. Adding to the film's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow. Said plot basically follows Christian Slater who looks nothing like the Edward Carnby of the video games as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them. Exactly where this plot stems from I do not know and I have only briefly played one of the games but I do not remember any of the embellishments Boll has provided which telegraph themselves with fervor. Compounding the problem is that Boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes. That none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes Boll's incompetence as a director pretty obvious.To hear it from Boll during the featurette Atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film. The nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to sayabout Boll and his films. The writers of a rejected screenplay for House Of The Dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with Boll. Speaking as a writer myself this tells me far more about Boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy DVDs made of his lousy films ever could. Adding insult to injury is that Nuclear Blast paid Boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack. If there were justice in the world Nuclear Blast would be one of the many record labels outselling Sony by a twelve to one ratio. They are innovators and have released some masterpieces from the likes of Therion or Agathodaimon. That they have to slum it in dreck like this while Sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to Alone In The Dark. I hope that thirty grand could be written off easily.Soundtracks and bad direction aside the construction of the film is utterly terrible too. I cannot really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has but I bet that Uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of Resident Evil. It is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in and that context needs to make a certain level of sense. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot but at the very least Alone In The Dark could have given a small breadcrumb trail anything to make point A follow logically from point B so to speak. The idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film is pretty ludicrous. Others have described the patent unbelievability of Tara Reid as an archaeologist but this is in fact one of the least of the film's problems.I gave Alone In The Dark a two out of ten. As a horror film it is far too tame to horrify. As an action film it is too stagnant to move the audience. As a serious acting piece it has no drama to speak of. Without the lousy or idiotic production decisions it also loses the unintentional comedy that made House Of The Dead bearable. In essence it winds up in no man's land. See it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence.".

I found all of these points of frustration for so many posters here to be quite realistic. the film had plenty of other flaws but i think the realism of the protagonists' descent from calm and crafty to desperate and delirious was right on. much of the acting was unremarkable but did not ruin the movie. what do you expect? i heard bobby duvall had to drop out because of a conflicting project.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Open Water had a couple stranded in the high seas when they went deep sea diving and somehow missed the boat literally thereby being stranded in the middle of nowhere. The formula is now repeated in Open Water 2 Adrift just called Adrift here probably to disassociate itself from being a sequel of sorts movie with the number of couples increased threefold.But I can't judge which is better having not watched the original. Adrift though seemed decent enough with human nature for selfpreservation portrayed so starkly on screen it's scary. And having to bump up the number of those in trouble allows for different views and types of people read caricatures at times to be showcased. Each cast member have certain strengths and some just have total negativity built into them for contrast purposes.The setup is simple and we waste no time in being introduced to our characters almost all of whom are high school friends and gathered together to celebrate one of their 30th birthday. They go on a weekend cruise on a luxurious yacht and it's party party party enjoying the finer things in life. Until they decide to go swimming in the sea did they realize that hey did someone lower the ladder on board? Otherwise how are they going to get back to the deck? It's down to the adage of looking before you leap and that danger lurks when you're enjoying yourself so much that common sense precautions and safety get thrown in the wind.And when the severity of the problem surfaces what do you do? Are you the leader the thinker the whiner or the quitter? When everything is fine and dandy everyone knows how to enjoy to the max. But when there's an issue at hand do you begin to point your finger at everyone else or help to think of a solution? And when all seems lost do you give up or try try again? The characters partake in exhibiting some of these traits at different points and with time running out and dehydration paranoia and hysteria slowing creeping in you'd wonder how long they'll last.It's human nature to instinctively try and survive and watching the characters on screen do just that in spite of impossible odds just makes your heart pound faster as you think  what would you do if you're caught in the same situation? Would you bitch slap the complainer? Would you follow instructions to a T? Would you give ideas and shut up when it doesn't work? And when all seems lost what would you do?Supposedly based on true events this story might have its plot holes at certain times when you think hey they should have done this or that but I'd suggest to hold onto your train of thoughts until a key revelation is made to which you may nod in agreement why it happened the way it did and that shake in disbelief when you think that when it comes to life and death material things should be sacrificed first and facing the music is just part of the inevitable consequence.".

The direction and the acting are superb and the good screenplay has an ambiguous and confused conclusion. The story explores first how an inconsequential act may cause the death of people further how fragile the human beings are under stress and in constant fear leading them to panic and to selfdestruction. The explanation for the stupid attitude of Dan is given after the death of his friends when he confesses that he does not own the yacht. Further there is no captain of experienced crew on board. With regard to the conclusion my interpretation is that Amy brought the dead body of Dan onboard and she is catatonic in absolute state of shock with the whole situation. Apparently the yacht is not anchored therefore while in the storm it should have moved adrift to another location. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available".

Okay the plot may seem a bit dumb I hear you say after all who forgets to put the ladder on their yacht down before jumping in the ocean but hey apparently it'a a true story.Basically the whole film is based around these guys and girls stuck in the ocean 'cos some moron forgot to put the ladder down before they all jumped in. One by one they get bumped off by a bump on the head a knife wound etc etc. I found myself thinking why doesn't one of them just lend one of the other members of the team their shoulders to 'bunk them up' so to speak so they can get up on to the deck.It does seem to have minor influence from Dead Calm but it's a much lower budget film I'm sure. The ending is confusing as hell. Are they all dead or not? I don't think the film maker intended to confuse us viewers more likely he got stuck for a good ending and so made something that is not clearly defined and is rather disappointing.Not a bad film but the ending really disappoints and confuses. Your mind will be boggling for days. I would suggest watching Saw instead.".

Okay the plot may seem a bit dumb I hear you say after all who forgets to put the ladder on their yacht down before jumping in the ocean but hey apparently it'a a true story.Basically the whole film is based around these guys and girls stuck in the ocean 'cos some moron forgot to put the ladder down before they all jumped in. One by one they get bumped off by a bump on the head a knife wound etc etc. I found myself thinking why doesn't one of them just lend one of the other members of the team their shoulders to 'bunk them up' so to speak so they can get up on to the deck.It does seem to have minor influence from Dead Calm but it's a much lower budget film I'm sure. The ending is confusing as hell. Are they all dead or not? I don't think the film maker intended to confuse us viewers more likely he got stuck for a good ending and so made something that is not clearly defined and is rather disappointing.Not a bad film but the ending really disappoints and confuses. Your mind will be boggling for days. I would suggest watching Saw instead.";

The yacht had to be anchored for the plot to work  for as a yachtsmen who has sailed offshore I can tell you that ocean currents are quite strong and the yacht would have drifted without any wind. It certainly would have drifted when the weather turned foul and anyone in the water would not have kept up with it. Finally the yacht has high topsides which creates windage in itself causing the yacht to drift even in very light breeze. So let's assume the yacht had to be anchored to give the plot the slightest credibility.3. With the yacht anchored  ALL SOMEONE HAD TO DO WAS CLIMB UP THE ANCHOR WARP AND CLIMB ABOARD IT'S THAT SIMPLE!!! Hello go figure!!!4. If the yacht was not anchored there would be no plot because in 'REALITY'  'REAL LIFE' the yacht would have definitely drifted and they would have all been kaput lost at sea drowned or whatever.The movie plot was so dumb and so seriously flawed  Hollywood at it's worst. I turned it off as soon as I realized this movie was going to end without any of those idiots on board figuring this out. The only true to life fact in this movie is that the worlds oceans are filled with idiots such as these characters who cost the coast guard and tax payer millions of dollars a year trying to find them when they do dumb stuff at sea.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a Tuesday we went to go for a sneak preview at the local cinema. From some sources we got the information that the movie we were about to see could be Adrift  Open Water 2. Having taking a look at the IMDb score it had received we were basically hoping the information we got was incorrect and we'd see something nice like Fearless instead.But no. It was in fact Open Water 2. And boy was it bad. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is known I'm not getting into that. Let's get to what's good about this movie. OK. That was the good part about the movie. Now let's get to what was bad.First this movie lacks depth character growth and pacing. It would have already been much better had these things been present in the movie. But they are not. On the contrary it's almost as if the director wanted to make the worst movie of the year. Scenes are drawn out like you wouldn't believe. Sometimes the movie goes into slow motion. Taking into account the awful pace of this flick it's as if the movie just comes to complete halts at these points. It's like you're watching a computer game at 10 frames per second. The characters are ridiculous and make the worst decisions one could make. Leaving the boat without having a way to get back on it? OK that's stupid but not a bad or unbelievable way to start a movie per s. It's the way the characters go about the things they do and the awful dialogues are presented to the viewer that makes this movie horrific. Especially look out for things like We need to get him to a hospital as soon as possible! and the prayer the stereotype dumb blonde chick says. It's just... so dead wrong. It's the way the annoying baby is constantly screaming while the point has long been made. It's the way they lose what little equipment they have. So incredibly silly and foolish you wouldn't believe. What furthermore kills this movie is how the characters aren't interesting. They are boring and some are downright annoying. The way they deal with the situation they're in just has to be a joke. Also the way they are supposed to struggle with the water and the fact of being lost is totally well lost on the viewer. The director tried to make this work by having the idiots say stuff like Ooah I can't feel my legs anymore and ... Well that's basically all the director uses to compensate for lack of involvement and drama. Just Ooah I can't feel my legsfeetarmsinsert whatever suits you. And then the camera zooms out. Shot of the boat. The camera zooms in. Oah I can't feel my legs anymore. The camera zooms out. Minutes later. The camera zooms in again. This is all your fault  some guy dies in some kind of silly way. Camera zooms out again. And in. Etc.Damn what a bad movie. It's not even fun to watch how bad it is. Good horror B movies are fun for the crappiness factor. This movie is just a 100 piece of junk.".

	schema:headline " Another people trappedin the water movie but this is actually pretty good far better and far cleverer than Open Water";
	schema:reviewBody "There have not been many comments or many reviews yet of 'Adrift' aka 'Open Water 2' which takes as its premise a woman with a water phobia Susan May Pratt seen in '10 Things I Hate About You' on board a yacht with her baby and a bunch of hedonistic old friends who make a terrible mistake. The film may be German financed but feels utterly American being well acted in English by an American cast. The lack of comments here so far arises partly because it is yet to open in the UK or US. But I saw a London preview having been intrigued by the trailer and was very impressed. I did not much like 'Open Water' which despite its reasonable BlairWitchonwater premise had a very amateurish beginning it began like some terrible home movie and a stagy last houryes stagy despite being set in midocean since it was all dialogue. This quasisequel is smarter far better acted Pratt is very good quite obviously higher budget with some keen script construction and it also carries an extremely enigmatic ending tooindeed I long to see the ending analyzed here but I will not do it for I am not offering spoilers. The premise is actually wonderful. How you can have everything you need feet away and yet be contemplating death and destruction at every turn. The cast too is generally very good making the film quite harrowing in places far more convincingly harrowing than 'Open Water'. The way they are plunged into their awful predicament is convincing and effective. Others have suggested it is easily resolved I don't think so for a minute not if you consider the actual situation. The device of the baby left alone on board is genuinely brilliant. At times you want a little more action and a little less emotion but I can live with that.There is though the question of how Americans will react. Because this whole plot seems to work not just as a reasonable thriller but as an allegory. Like any good allegory it's mostly inconspicuous someone with me enjoyed the film but did not take on the allegorical dimension at all.

	onyx:emotionText "There have not been many comments or many reviews yet of 'Adrift' aka 'Open Water 2' which takes as its premise a woman with a water phobia Susan May Pratt seen in '10 Things I Hate About You' on board a yacht with her baby and a bunch of hedonistic old friends who make a terrible mistake. The film may be German financed but feels utterly American being well acted in English by an American cast. The lack of comments here so far arises partly because it is yet to open in the UK or US. But I saw a London preview having been intrigued by the trailer and was very impressed. I did not much like 'Open Water' which despite its reasonable BlairWitchonwater premise had a very amateurish beginning it began like some terrible home movie and a stagy last houryes stagy despite being set in midocean since it was all dialogue. This quasisequel is smarter far better acted Pratt is very good quite obviously higher budget with some keen script construction and it also carries an extremely enigmatic ending tooindeed I long to see the ending analyzed here but I will not do it for I am not offering spoilers. The premise is actually wonderful. How you can have everything you need feet away and yet be contemplating death and destruction at every turn. The cast too is generally very good making the film quite harrowing in places far more convincingly harrowing than 'Open Water'. The way they are plunged into their awful predicament is convincing and effective. Others have suggested it is easily resolved I don't think so for a minute not if you consider the actual situation. The device of the baby left alone on board is genuinely brilliant. At times you want a little more action and a little less emotion but I can live with that.There is though the question of how Americans will react. Because this whole plot seems to work not just as a reasonable thriller but as an allegory. Like any good allegory it's mostly inconspicuous someone with me enjoyed the film but did not take on the allegorical dimension at all. But very early on we see a satirical Vote Bush sticker with a frown face later much play is made of the US flag which is torn in half as the desperate cast try to redeem things. Is not this troubled ship a ship of state threatened by its own macho hubris whose ownercaptain even bears a resemblance to a younger Bush? Finally the rescue comes from a very obviously alien boat.

	schema:reviewBody "The English title is given as The Wayward Cloud. I saw this film in Taipei where the director Tsai Mingliang stopped in for a surprise speech before the show. Wouldn't it be great to meet the director before every film instead of sitting through the assault of those damned previews previews evidently aimed at folks who are deaf and dumb? He spoke informally for a few minutes just to assure the audience that he intends the film to have redeeming social values  as US lawmakers used to say. This seems necessary because the government in Taiwan spent 2 weeks meeting with consultants to decide whether or not to censor the film. They let it show uncut.That is to say don't bring your kids to see this  but adults will be able to see that it is not porn but rather a critique of porn. This is a simplification since the main theme of the film is general alienation. The wayward cloud and the drought in the film are shown to be symbolic of the emotional and interpersonal drifting and dryness that each scene highlights. The film shows how porn is merely one symptom of people's awkward attempt to connect with each other on a deeper level. The film is unusual in style see previous user comment so don't expect it to imitate Hollywood conventions. It is recognizably in Tsai Mingliang's previous grim and dim style i.e. The Hole and The River and What Time Is It There? but here he adds a lighter note of wit to that.Personally I don't enjoy musicals but the handful of musical interludes in this film are delightfully surreal and humorous and while they address heterosexuality the aesthetic is gay in both senses of the term. I especially liked one of these where a smiling state statue of historical dictator Chiang Kaishek is the central prop for a tongueincheek erotic song  dance troupe of lovely ladies. Also the music in itself is attractive since we don't usually get to hear those old songs from Shanghai in the '30s and Hong Kong in the '60s. The final scene officially raises the bar for the visionary use of a sex scene to reflect on alienation. Those who remember the historic shock of Last Tango in Paris Bertolucci's Ultimo tango a Parigi so many years ago will see what I mean by raising the bar. It will make its own peculiar mark in underground film histories.".

	schema:headline " You Will Never Look At Watermelons The Same Way Again";
	schema:reviewBody "What a strange strange strange film. Strangest thing about this is that it was a huge hit in Taiwan grossing 20 million dollars when the average film in the country makes under a million. When you see a cover with a girl tongue kissing a watermelon it is understandable to think I'll pass but in this case you would be missing out.As best I can describe this is a film about two neighbors who live in an apartment building in Taiwan during an unusually hot summer and inexplicable water shortage. One woman named Shiangchyi Chen sits around her apartment eating watermelon while her next door neighbor Kangsheng Lee makes hardcore porn films which in the opening scene involve a watermelon between a woman's legs.The film is mostly minimalist and truly beautiful in its austere compositions and delicate urban electric light shadows and silhouettes are repeat motif used gorgeously. This is interspersed with scenes of graphic sex albeit no more than you would see in Crash Short Bus or WR. Mysteries of the Organism but just as explicit. The same long takes which lingered on an empty hallway now assume the position of Peeping Tom.The detached view of sexuality would seem indebted to films like Crash and Salo where the body is reduced to a writhing mindless thing with genitals. This becomes especially apparent in the last scene where a women is unconsciousdead there is some debate between whether this porn actress is dead or passed out from heat exhaustion but the show must go on and the crew literally props her up in a variety of positions so the Lee can have sex with her.This is all watched by Chen who discovers only moments before when she finds the porn starlet passed out in the elevator and consequently what Lee does for a living. Their flirting and relationship build up being the emotional heart of the film which repeats images of watermelon and bottled water again and again. Our heroin is often scene rubbing water on her arms while alone juxtaposed with our hero covered in his and someone' else's sweat. They even share Annie Hall homage of giddily picking up crabs from the kitchen floor. And they laugh and they love and the film swerves back and forth between their two perspectives meeting in an occasional musical number.It's also worth mentioning that this is a musical. There are about 5 or 6 full on musical numbers and not merely spontaneous karaoke affairs like Happiness Of The Katakari's but full on Singing In The Rain level classical Hollywood showstoppers one song includes a crowd with umbrellas if directed by Tarsem. In one scene a character becomes a merman and serenades the moon from a water tower. In another Alice in Wonderland like giant flowers appear around the statue of a Taiwanese politician. In yet another after our hero is having some trouble getting it up there is a song where a man wearing a lifesize penissuit is surrounded by dancing girls wearing plastic buckets on their heads in a public bathroom. I can't stress enough how genuinely fantastic from a technical film standpoint and absurdly incredible they are.The songs themselves are assorted 60's and modern soul and folk sounds from Taiwan and are all unique and lovely in their own right. Weird as all this sounds it comes together in a smashingly perverse erotic socially critical and emotionally devastating climax you might find in a Lars Von Trier film at his most crafty like The Idiots or Dogville Goodbye Dragon Inn Ming Ling Tsai's previous directorial effort was so rigid in never moving it's camera's and keeping it's character's in the dark it distracted from how formally inventive and cinematically fresh the whole thing was. The Wayward Cloud as a follow up has no such difficulties getting its vitality up and keeping it up. It veers between the common and the theatrical so organically it stops feeling strange when the singalong follow the money shots which flow into images of watermelons floating down a river.As for what Wayward Cloud means I would say it's a love story. The two lead characters I later read were in a previous Mingliang Tsia's film called What Time Is It There? and this is their Before Sunset second chance at love. It would have been simple for Mingliang Tsia to make a moody little film about an alienated women infatuated with an alienated man doing alienated things which is basically what the film is. However like a true artist Miang Liang imbues the proceedings with a cinematic spirit through editing cinematography MUSIC and subduedwildly theatrical performances that becomes transcendent of the films runofthemill social yearnings for genuine connection in the cold cruel world. I can't think of any film as repulsive arousing beautiful fun and sad at least not with all those gears running at once like they are here.In a way I thought it was a happy ending. The couple has come together right? No more lifeless proxy sex with sleeping girls and emotional amateur porn and no more isolated peeking around the corner from what we desire while waiting for the water life's lubricant to return. I don't know maybe I'm all wrong and our heroine's tears are from a place of even deeper sadness. Or maybe their courtship was so convincing and extraordinarily arranged that I was rooting for the couple to come together regardless of their strange and horrible acts.Only one thing is certain the watermelon has lost its innocence in the fruit kingdom it must now go in the adult's only banana and kumquat sectioned off by beads part of the produce aisle.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wayward Cloud features everything one expects from a Tsai MingLiang film but it is also much more sexually explicit. The shot compositions the use of space and the choreography of the musical numbers are excellent. However not everyone is going to enjoy a musical number featuring a woman and men dressed as the fluid that she had just received a moment before in the main narrative.I understand the perspective of those who argue that Tsai doesn't have a clear point here as he does in his other films. I would argue though that the film is more challenging because it does not offer the glimmer of hope found in Tsai's previous films the woman pulled up in The Hole May's dignity even as she cries at the end of Vive L'amour. The viewer has to piece together any hope from various parts of the film as the shocking finale is not at all uplifting.Tsai has some real insights into the human condition here. Xiao Kang's autoerotic sexuality has a lot to say about loneliness and insecurity. Also the flirtation between Xiao Kang and Shiangchyi is very charming even sexy I'm thinking especially of the way Xiao Kang leans against the elevator after their date. I think this film's vision brings to light the way sexuality has become a commodity and I find it tragic that Xiao Kang and Shiangchyi find that there is great difficulty in overcoming that commodification.".

At last he has made a film that actually leads up to something resembling a satisfying climax very literally actually. Also it may just be that I saw it in a theater but the cinematography seemed far and away much better than any of his previous films. It's easily one of the most beautiful films visually that I've ever seen up there with the best of Wong KarWai no question. It's also somewhat oddly both his most accessible film possibly and also by far his most confrontational and edgy. This is basically his Brown Bunny or Ken Park and i mean that in the best possible way. That said it may not be his most consistent film but it is probably his most rewarding. Also watching it with an audience that laughed at all the right places was rather remarkable. At times I felt like Tsai MingLiang was playing up to the audience's expectations too much but my opinion in that regard was completely changed by the end of the film.".

Of course you could be forgiven for thinking that the very explicit sex scenes have within them a sense of comedy or at least are meant to be 'tongueincheek' no pun intended and that the musical interludes are aimed at a largely gay audience.

You get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession Expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction the camera here hardly ever moves  apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken. This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that even as the story progresses at a snaillike pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed. Unfortunately for me at least this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark. I began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of wills.Had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to Western audiences. As it is there's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so repugnant that while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so overzealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective. Of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fastforward button of the remote.For all its problems the film is definitely a stayer and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make. Ironically for a film in which so little happens the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time. For me however once was enough".

As it is there's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so repugnant that while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so overzealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective. Of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fastforward button of the remote.For all its problems the film is definitely a stayer and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make. Ironically for a film in which so little happens the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time. For me however once was enough";

As I have seen nearly allexcept for the previous one Bu San this is a great disappointment to me. As of all his movies which are low budget nearly no music and having minimum dialog Tsai has always successfully used silence to hit our sense but I think this one is a failure.Except for the female nudeprobably the ugliest looking porno actress scenes nearly everything else has been done in his previous movies water problem use of water melon musical interludes the same few facesmasturbation quiet apartments etc. And like all his previous filmsBu San I am not sure there is always a link with the same characters name and plot or the same style of movie making this one looks like a sum up of all his previous movies with more sex and nude scenes for box office appeal. Lets see what else can he offer next ?This time the female lead gets more scenes than before but I think she did not act well enougheven her moaning is poor and unrealistic compared to the Japanese and Tsai's frequent actor Lee Kang Sheng who never failed to bare or do some lonely sex did the extreme in this one but unfortunately he appeared old and a bit out of shape.Only the musical interludes saved the movie but they are not as well made as in his previous The Hole. Lets hope this is not going to be the end of Tsai MinLiang's directing career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tsai is back with his alter ego the prettyboy punk Lee Kangsheng who this time has stopped selling watches and become a small time porn actor I guess. The girl who wanted him Chen Shiangchyi is back too and this time they get together in the end sort of.Avantgardist filmblogger Adam Balz writes The Wayward Cloud a film by Tsai Mingliang is a profound glimpse into the sheltered world of pornography. Actually Tsai can't really be trying to represent pornography accurately. His pornography shooting scenes are monotonous rabbitstyle hump jobs by Lee Kangsheng with real Japanese porn actress Sumomo Yazakura. The whole film is very impressionistic and surreal. The world of pornography is represented by nothing but lengthy shots of the boy the girl a cameraman and a light man none of whom talk.Balz admiringly continues with a question that without him we might not have thought of asking Who else would open a movie with a lengthy shot of an empty parking ramp only to shift to a woman clad in a nurse's uniform lying on a bed with a halfwatermelon placed over her genitalia? That style of unabashed risktaking is something we'll never find in mainstream Hollywood not for a long time. Mainstream Hollywood will not be jealous of the accomplishment of a lengthy shot of an empty parking ramp. The lady with the watermelon is hardly a breakthrough either. Unabashed risktaking? Tsai is simply setting a mood or more accurately declaring that this is a Tsai film. But this beginning really might be the work of any pretentious film school student.What is arresting and way beyond film school are the lipsynced musical sequences of a chorus of women brandishing pink umbrellas and Lee Kangsheng gyrating jauntily and gamely the actor is nothing if not game in a yellow raincoat and he in a public men's room costumed as a giant penis with the women's chorus this time wearing orange cones jutting from their breasts and singing a song which can be interpreted as referring to lost erections. These sequences are a mixture of the comical and the purely bizarre that is truly jawdropping and might be very effective if incorporated into a satirical story but Tsai was never made to work this way. His method is to hint and suggest. These sequences are simply interludes that liven up a depressing set of other scenes about lost people in a big apartment building in a city that's so low on water in summertime that people are requested to switch to watermelon juice. Yes the girl is the one who met the boy when he was selling watches. In fact very early on she actually asks him after a long mute sequence where they just stare at each other wordlessly Do you still sell watches? He gives her a look as if to say You must be kidding! What he's doing of course is acting in porno movies. Or he's supposed to be. As I said his rabbitstyle hump jobs are unlikely to be usable in even the most rudimentary kind of real porno movie it's just a sketchedin way of saying This guy is a porn actor now. But what else is there? A final scene in which the porn actress is found by the girl in the elevator naked and seemingly passed out. Shiangchyi drags her back to her apartment. It's a slow process I can tell you. Eventually the porn filmmakers find her again and decide that despite her apparently being unconscious or dead she'll do to shoot another scene. So they drag Ms.Yazakura down to the other end of the hallway. That's a long process too. It was more fun sitting in the kitchen staring at nothing in What Time Is It There? or watching people watch a movie in Goodbye Dragon Inn. If this film is so audacious why is it so often boring? The following sequence which caused observers to walk out of the festival theater in sophisticated Berlin and wherein the boy humps the corpse or unconscious woman while shot by the maniacal but wholly unsubtle filmmakers watched by the girl through a large keyhole window right over the bed till the boy has a big orgasm and gives it to the girl on the face ends the movie.Balz begins In the first chapter of his 1979 book Seduction French semiologist Jean Baudrillard discerned the spheres of sex in relation to pornography Pornography is the quadraphonics of sex. It adds a third and fourth track to the sexual act. It is the hallucination of detail that rules. Science has already habituated us to this microscopics this excess of the real in its microscopic detail this voyeurism of exactitude. I guess that makes this a cool movie for him. I'm afraid I found it a tremendous disappointment. The River was pretty and haunting in its desolate urban melancholy and What Time Is It There? is a delicate depiction of loneliness and separation that playfully alludes to Truffaut. Tsai is playing around in Wayward Cloud in another sort of way but it's one that this time comes dangerously close to complete solipsism. Rent a real musical or a real porno film you'll be better off. Note the French title of this film is The Taste of Watermelon. But that's another story".

	schema:reviewBody "A Tsai film is a Tsai film. You know what you're going to get for the most part. I personally love his work find it very beautiful and often moving. As similar as this might be to his earlier movies though it's a sequel to What Time Is It There? it more frequently brings The Hole to mind this is his most daring production. Of all things it sexualizes watermelons. I won't go too much into that stuff. Tsai does it mostly for the images that it brings him with which I'm fine. The story has Lee Kangsheng that guy who's in all of Tsai's films now working as a porn star as seen in the short film The Skyway Is Gone and Chen Shiangchyi back from Paris meeting up once again. They met briefly in What Time Is It There? but separated abruptly only to find desperate and painfully meaningless connections to other lovers in the film's erotic tripartite climax the third prong if you remember being Lee's mother. I think what makes The Wayward Cloud particularly wonderful is that alone among Tsai's films two people actually find each other and connect in the middle of the film unlike say The Hole where the connection is made only at the very end of the picture. The loneliness that is Tsai's signature is gloriously broken. In sequences of intense joy and eroticism Lee and Chen fall in love and it's real. It's as tactile as anything in the world of cinema. One particularly memorable sequence Lee climbs under Chen's dinner table and plays around with her feet the film is heaven for foot fetishists. Another has Chen lustily attack Lee among racks of porno DVDs. The best sequence in the film is the one in which the two meet again for the first time. Up until that sequence the movie never announces itself as connected to What Time Is It There? Lee has starred in all of Tsai's movies and Chen has appeared in other Tsai movies as well. As far as we know they're just the same actors as before. It takes nearly a third of the film before they meet up and the scene develops in Tsai's signature glacial pace. Chen finds him sleeping on a swing in the park. She steals some of his water but catches a glimpse of his face before she runs off. She slowly approaches the swing one of those large twoseat dealies and quietly sits on the opposite side. For a long time there is silence as she sits and stares possibly napping herself. Lee slowly wakes up looks over at her and sits up staring. Soon a tiny grin appears over his face. She simply says Still selling watches? I mean no other director would have the finesse to pull that off as beautifully as Tsai. It was the palpable love that hooked me to The Wayward Cloud. Of course that love is contrasted harshly with Lee's work which is filmed in a way that makes it feel cheap and mechanical. Well basically it's filmed like real porn in that way except even worse because it's pulled back to reveal the camera the lights and the guy who constantly pours water all over the woman. Of course the conflict in the film is what will happen when Chen finds out what Lee has been doing for a living. And then there's this final sequence where well yeah. I don't want to describe it. I'll admit it's hard to defend. Maybe impossible. Definitely exploitative. However I will say that the strength of the emotions the film made me feel earlier I did find the climax of the film to be quite emotionally devastating. And I didn't even mention that it's a musical a la The Hole.

	onyx:emotionText "A Tsai film is a Tsai film. You know what you're going to get for the most part. I personally love his work find it very beautiful and often moving. As similar as this might be to his earlier movies though it's a sequel to What Time Is It There? it more frequently brings The Hole to mind this is his most daring production. Of all things it sexualizes watermelons. I won't go too much into that stuff. Tsai does it mostly for the images that it brings him with which I'm fine. The story has Lee Kangsheng that guy who's in all of Tsai's films now working as a porn star as seen in the short film The Skyway Is Gone and Chen Shiangchyi back from Paris meeting up once again. They met briefly in What Time Is It There? but separated abruptly only to find desperate and painfully meaningless connections to other lovers in the film's erotic tripartite climax the third prong if you remember being Lee's mother. I think what makes The Wayward Cloud particularly wonderful is that alone among Tsai's films two people actually find each other and connect in the middle of the film unlike say The Hole where the connection is made only at the very end of the picture. The loneliness that is Tsai's signature is gloriously broken. In sequences of intense joy and eroticism Lee and Chen fall in love and it's real. It's as tactile as anything in the world of cinema. One particularly memorable sequence Lee climbs under Chen's dinner table and plays around with her feet the film is heaven for foot fetishists. Another has Chen lustily attack Lee among racks of porno DVDs. The best sequence in the film is the one in which the two meet again for the first time. Up until that sequence the movie never announces itself as connected to What Time Is It There? Lee has starred in all of Tsai's movies and Chen has appeared in other Tsai movies as well. As far as we know they're just the same actors as before. It takes nearly a third of the film before they meet up and the scene develops in Tsai's signature glacial pace. Chen finds him sleeping on a swing in the park. She steals some of his water but catches a glimpse of his face before she runs off. She slowly approaches the swing one of those large twoseat dealies and quietly sits on the opposite side. For a long time there is silence as she sits and stares possibly napping herself. Lee slowly wakes up looks over at her and sits up staring. Soon a tiny grin appears over his face. She simply says Still selling watches? I mean no other director would have the finesse to pull that off as beautifully as Tsai. It was the palpable love that hooked me to The Wayward Cloud. Of course that love is contrasted harshly with Lee's work which is filmed in a way that makes it feel cheap and mechanical. Well basically it's filmed like real porn in that way except even worse because it's pulled back to reveal the camera the lights and the guy who constantly pours water all over the woman. Of course the conflict in the film is what will happen when Chen finds out what Lee has been doing for a living. And then there's this final sequence where well yeah. I don't want to describe it. I'll admit it's hard to defend. Maybe impossible. Definitely exploitative. However I will say that the strength of the emotions the film made me feel earlier I did find the climax of the film to be quite emotionally devastating. And I didn't even mention that it's a musical a la The Hole. Actually the musical elements aren't quite as strong as they were in The Hole although there are a couple of absolutely exquisite numbers like the previous film lipsynced. I can't pretend the film doesn't have its share of flaws. I will however happily declare it to be a masterpiece of the flawed but still tremendous variety.";

Would one really be giving anything away? There's really no point in detailing what there was of a plot. Suffice it to say that the theme of isolation runs throughout.

This is what I first thought when looking at the IMDb page for this movie how can it be possible a movie released here in Taiwan but not in America?!First off I had trouble finding this movie on IMDb since the English title given in Taiwan is The Code where as according to IMDb its Thick as ThievesI didn't know what to expect when entering this movie as I hadn't read a million posts on IMDb saying how its amazing and the others saying it should be the 2nd thing on your list to do after suicide.It's pretty much your average bank heist movie the story is based around a job which is utterly impossible unless you have amazing tools and gadgets which probably take longer to create than the whole security system of the bank they're planning to hit. The story moves along nicely it has a few short moments where it seems to drift away from the main plot but it doesn't distract you from the main track. The acting by Freeman is his usual really the more experienced and wiser man who once again does a decent job. The young rookie crook role goes to Banderas who generally does a good job but in the early stages of the movie just doesn't look right. The young rookie is the same as most the young cocky rookie's you see in most movies unfortunately a middle aged man making wise cracks just doesn't look right on screen.Like you'd expect there's a surprise ending which isn't so easy to figure out or when you think you've figured it out you still end up being wrong. It's what you'd expect from a heist movie and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The directing is nothing special it just seems like standard Hollywood movie making with nothing really standing out as being special. The dialogue is nothing flash its normal dialogue with very little standout lines. The performances are once again nothing stand out all the actors do a decent job in this movie but nothing worthy of an Oscar. Overall this isn't a super awesome big time blockbuster its an OK piece of cinema which is sure to entertain you but its not going to have you shouting from the roof tops".

The worth of each egg in the black market is twenty million dollars and Ripley needs his cut to quit his debt with the powerful mobster Nicky Rade Serbedzija. The reluctant Gabriel accepts to participate after having one night stand with Ripley's goddaughter Alexandra Karolin Radha Mitchell. Meanwhile the persistent Lieutenant Weber Robert Foster who has unsuccessfully tried to put Ripley in jail for twenty years figures how to anticipate the movements of the criminal and arrest him.Thick as Thieves is an unoriginal movie full of clichs that gives the sensation of dj vu to the viewer. There are many movies with impossible heists and this one has nothing new in this regard. Further there are many twists in the story and the conclusion is corny and commercial. The good points are the chemistry among Morgan Freeman the sexy and gorgeous Radha Mitchell and Antonio. Banderas. In the end this forgettable flick entertains. My vote is six.Title Brazil Jogo Entre Ladres Game Between Thieves".

Maybe they just happen to be utterly obsessive Banderas or Freeman fans in which case poor souls presumably they were left bewildered  extremely confused when they tried to award the Shawshank Redemption 20 stars out of 10.How are people supposed to draw any kind of comparison between films when some reviewers only criteria for ratings appears to be 'was it the last film you watched?'.A tired plot half hearted excuses for 'acting' and a big waste of time.

Primarily a story about thieves thieving some complicated lying some sex some features some plot of grand thefts and that's it. I actually didn't like this movie.

Surely they are still getting calls from major studios? Did they really need the money? Anyway they bring their natural charisma to this movie... but not much more. Freeman doesn't seem to be trying very hard in his performance and Banderas doesn't watch his accent making some of the words he says hard to figure out.The production values are mostly very decent a trademark of directtovideo kings MillenniumNu Image Films. Although this setinNewYork film was partially filmed in Bulgaria it doesn't show. The only flaw in the production values was the CGI used in the subway sequences. It looks pretty cheesy.The heist central to this movie has some tension but I found it hard to get involved. For one thing many of the steps the Freeman and Banderas characters use to foil the various security measures are never fully explained to the audience. Even worse is that it's implied that this heist was planned in JUST A FEW DAYS! Seeming all these security measures they have to conquer it would really take weeks even months to plan! The movie is never really boring but in the first half of the movie you can kind of guess what will happen in the next scene. There are twists towards the end but they are expected as in other caper movies like this one. Such twists happening are no longer a surprise. Plus as they start to unfold you will start to guess just what new twists will happen.Wait until it comes on cable... on a rainy day... when there's absolutely nothing else to do or watch.".

Banderas is it's been said dire. At 49 at the time of release he is far too long in the tooth to be playing the young buck and far too fatherly to be the romantic interest. The 'romance' between his character and Freeman's mostly entertaining goddaughter feels sledge hammered in as an afterthought and the less said about the distinctly awkward and far too fleshy sex scene not as bad as The Thomas Crown Affair the better.The wannabeUsualSuspects 'twisty' plot whilst surprising is just too clichd for words. The worst thing is that by the time it comes to the twist you've already ripped out enough of your hair to no longer care if Freeman were to suddenly pull of a mask and reveal himself to be the goddaughter in disguise. I was mildly surprised that Banderas' declaration of I'm a cop was not met with So am I from Freeman...The 'heist' is laughable in its simplicity and the fact that the so apparently wonderful vault can be breached with a simple wire tap a cake a piece of plastic food wrap and a few minutes of trial and error actually feels quite insulting  not to mention Freeman's ever present magic iPhone!The policemen leave a lot to be desired particularly the woefully overblown Feds as do the sketchy melange of Eastern European accents masquerading as an apparently believable crime cartel.The one saving grace is that Freeman's voice is at least a joy to listen to  even if the entire script seems to be cobbled together by lines which were rejected from the script of a bottom shelf Van Damme ripoff.It could have been worse but only by being longer  and at least it is honest from the outset that its a formulaic heist thriller.".

Thick as Thieves is a boring and lazy pastiche of archaic ideas and concepts.In summary Thick as Thieves is a horrible and tedious thriller which is full of clichs.This is the kind of film in which I really feel I wasted my time so do not make the same mistake I did and avoid Thick as Thieves by all means.".

Many found that it lacked grandiose crowds in the battle and acclamation of the Pope scenes but I think that in reality medieval battles and the assembly of Roman plebeians acclaiming the Pope must not have been particularly grandiose events and that added a quality of realism to the movie.Also the structure of the story the equivalent of what Germans call Bildungsromanthat is the process of the development of character through life was presented in a very able manner showing the evolution of Joan a simple but charismatic country girl to supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.The love story subplot was also good adding romance to a tale that would have been dull otherwise and proving that even scholarly girls are not immune to the pleasures of the flesh.I have to comment on the acting of Ms Wokalek which I found admirable in the way that it portrayed the subdued power of the character of Joan under a facade of neutral manners and also the surprise role of John Goodman who played a larger than life exuberant and kindly Pope.The evocation of the age was also excellent avoiding excesses and presenting the mendacity of peasant life in the villages as well as the relative luxury of the ruling classes.Of course the main point of the story concerned the barriers that gender and class posed to a talented poor woman during that dark age. I think the story has similarities with that of Joan of Ark. The final surprise which I will not disclose must have been a novelistic devise relative to modern concerns about the Church invented by the author of the novel on which the movie was based and not an integral part of the Pope Joan legend as preserved through the ages.All in all a very able movie which I greatly enjoyed.

	schema:headline " Boasting a virtuoso lead performance by German actress Johanna Wokalek this historical epic is engrossing from start to finish";
	schema:reviewBody "This legendary tale of a woman who briefly ascended to the papal throne may be set in the ninth century but its themes and its subject matter is as relevant now as it was before. In fact the Germanmade Englishlanguage Pope Joan arrives at a time when the Catholic Church is once again facing calls to allow women to be ordained priests especially since in the wake of the recent paedophilia scandal in Europe some point the cause to the Church's insistence on a male celibate priesthood.Adapted from the bestseller by Donna Woolfolk Cross the legend of Pope Joan goes that said woman posed as a man to enter the Benedictine monastery and rose to the favour of the previous pope due to her great intellect and learning. Yet after a reign of a few years she gave birth to a baby during a papal procession and was torn apart by an angry mob. Whether this is fact or fiction is up to you to decide though this adaptation which begins with a French bishop arriving in Rome to enter Joan's story in the papal archives wants you to believe its authenticity.The bishop's dictation frames the flow of the movie which attempts to chronicle the life of Joan right from the time of her difficult birth to a fundamentalist village priest Iain Glen and his Saxon wife Joerdis Triebel to the time of her death in front of the Roman crowds. Even from a young age we learn that Joan possessed extraordinary wisdom and an insatiable crave for knowledge. So despite her misogynistic father's opposition to girls receiving any form of education she picks up reading and writing and even Scripture itself.These early years are presented with a bleakness and austerity that effectively if manipulatively gets the audience's sympathies firmly with Joan. As her father makes Joan watch him physically abuse her mother for not objecting to Joan's learning of Scripture and then whips her severely for what he perceives as a grievous offence it's hard not to root for the brilliant and bright Joan to break free from the chains of her father's misogyny.But that liberation is not to come till much later even as the chance visit of a religious teacher marks her initiation into the religious life. Together with her brother Johannes Joan is sent to study under the bishop of Dorstadt where she meets Gerold David Wenham a knight whom the teenage Joan slowly falls in love with. After the invading Norse army ambushes their village while Gerold is away Joan binds her breasts and trims her hair beginning her impersonation as her brother Johannes by joining the Fulda Abbey.Unfolding at a brisk pace director Soenke Wortmann of the German hit The Miracle of Bern deftly keeps the proceedings taut and the tension palpable as Joan takes care to conceal her identity. When at the brink of being discovered Joan journeys to Rome where she is first appointed as a physician to Pope Sergius John Goodman and slowly grows to become his personal adviser. After he is murdered by his own courtiers Joan is chosen by the people of Rome as his successor her election as Pope a carefully calculated sweet triumph for its audience.Yet it's not nearly enough for Joan to be Pope her chance meeting with Gerold igniting her feelings for him and their eventual coupling resulting in her pregnancy. This reviewer must admit first and foremost that this turn of events didn't sit with his personal convictions too well not for the fact that Pope Joan was female but for her blatant disregard of the Church's understanding of celibacy. Bearing in mind she was firstly ordained and secondly unwed should Pope Joan have given in to her feelings and consummated with Gerold? Would such an intelligent woman have acted so callously with little regard of the inevitable consequences? Where art thou would she command any moral authority as the head of the Church? Of course such is the controversial nature of the legend that has remained hugely debated over the years but it is inevitable that some audiences will find the material troubling. Nonetheless it isn't less of a film just because it has chosen to tackle a topic of such divisive nature. Rather lead actress Johanna Wokalek anchors the movie with an emotionally rousing performance portraying Joan's steeliness and vulnerability in equal measure. Best known for her roles in Til Schweiger's Barfuss and Uli Edel's The Baader Meinhof Complex Wokalek not only looks the part but plays it with gusto and aplomb.Yet it's easy to overlook Wokalek's brilliant acting in the film because of its subject matter which as this reviewer has pointed out remains as relevant today and therefore disputatious. It's best therefore that one approaches this with an open mind and if necessary a piece of fiction for you will discover that this handsomely mounted historical epic is riveting and rousing from start to finish.".

Not about girl or boy but about the abilities of each of us to advance the human cause on this earth. It's not about Buddist Jew or Christian but about aleivating all the suffering we can. Consider that for one month of the cost of the war in the middle east every human could have access to clean drinking water. Who knows where the next Einstein or TuTu will come from surely the potential exists and needs a chance to show itself without the intolerance of prejudice for one of a different color sex or the distance from your home they come. We have a duty to expand our knowledge and expose all to the light of reason and in that we have no fear. This movie is a gift to parents and adults that want to find the ways to help all. Ignorance is not bliss the scene about the mustard seed is worth the price of this great movie. Allegory is when your teacher thanks you. Thank you mother.Wokalek and Flack are superb and a joy. John Goodman is like your pastor or priest and as amiable as I imagine JohnPaul II. Petherbridge as Aesculapius is exactly my image of Hesse's Magister Ludi and Wenham a developing Chomsky could of evolved into a Smedly Butler! For those in power this could be a great miniseries for all involved IMHO. Villains don't get a mention sry Iain and AT. m.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is about the indomitable spirit of many of our species regardless of race or sex. It's not about liberal or conservative it's about right or wrong. Not about girl or boy but about the abilities of each of us to advance the human cause on this earth. It's not about Buddist Jew or Christian but about aleivating all the suffering we can. Consider that for one month of the cost of the war in the middle east every human could have access to clean drinking water. Who knows where the next Einstein or TuTu will come from surely the potential exists and needs a chance to show itself without the intolerance of prejudice for one of a different color sex or the distance from your home they come. We have a duty to expand our knowledge and expose all to the light of reason and in that we have no fear. This movie is a gift to parents and adults that want to find the ways to help all. Ignorance is not bliss the scene about the mustard seed is worth the price of this great movie. Allegory is when your teacher thanks you. Thank you mother.Wokalek and Flack are superb and a joy. John Goodman is like your pastor or priest and as amiable as I imagine JohnPaul II. Petherbridge as Aesculapius is exactly my image of Hesse's Magister Ludi and Wenham a developing Chomsky could of evolved into a Smedly Butler! For those in power this could be a great miniseries for all involved IMHO. Villains don't get a mention sry Iain and AT. m.";

I love a historical drama and I know a little about Pope Joan and I didn't understand how I missed knowing about this film till now 2013 I suppose the promotion of foreign language films in Ireland is not great. Anyway I got hold of the film.It started off a bit slow but still you could see that this was an intriguing story on its own. How could a woman become a Pope in one of the foremost matriarch hierarchical societies in the world. It was then and still is. So how could it ever have happened. Historical there are no details and there it is probably a myth rather then fact but even the myth is compelling.I watched the film and it was long but always interesting any good piece on that period of humanity is. As the life of man is solitary poor nasty brutish and short as Hobbes put it. Stories and the history of that age gives you a sense of count your blessings you live in this age. The film did have an agenda as a reflection of the position of women in this age. I didn't mind that Joan was forced to struggle and overcome the cultural limitations placed on her sex to express her natural humanity and intelligence as millions of women still struggle with the same in this age. I would love to say things are wholely better in this age for women but I know in parts of this modern world it is still very much the same. Women's march for equality is very far from over. So that seemed a natural agenda to push for a tale about a woman pope and why not? I would regard myself as a male feminist and the message still needs to be told.The film was far from perfect and it could have been a whole lot better there were scenes that could have been added and omitted but I still found myself recommending it to friends and it was one of the best 2 or more hours in front of the tele for me this year. I still loved it to spite its obvious flaws. In the end you can't beat a good story whether that story is true or not. So watch it and see do you agree with the 6.5 rating for this epic film in scope and tale. I think 6.5 is very unfair I rate it 910.".

It was kind of slowmoving and didn't have the lush costumes that are often my favorite part of historical movies but it did have the most accurate portrayal I've ever seen of life in the middle ages. At the beginning of the movie I was surprised to see the title character's mother giving birth right in front of two other children but then remembered that just as people were conceived in full view of the household they were born that way as well. As the movie went along there was nothing missing but the smell! Several years of watching The Highlander didn't give me as graphic a view of what a beheading must actually look like as this movie did and other details were just as they would have been. I'd recommend this movie most heartily to history majors and anyone who thinks the vanished past was glamorous.".

Misquoting Renee Descartes and adding a little bit of the Ontological Argument doesn't make laughably bad lines like I think therefore God exists actually logical. If the writers wanted to give the audience a lesson in philosophy and Church History they could have skipped this piece of historically inaccurate fiction and made a film about St. Anselm of Canterbury but that would have been a snooze. When reading about the woman who wrote the book on which this film is based it turns out that Pope Joan is her only novel the rest of her publications are selfhelp books. Go figure.In a pathetic attempt to convince us that the mission of the Catholic Church is to keep knowledge love and responsibility away from women this film insults the real women of the early Catholic Church who paved the way for female dignity. Those women were called nuns. From the time that St. Scholastica founded the first women's monastery in the 6th Century up until the present Catholic nuns have managed the business affairs of their selfsufficient communities dedicated themselves to learning and knowledge composed music and written scholarly works unsurpassed by men. They fought off invaders risked their lives to found new communities in foreign countries stood up to Popes and kings refused to be used as pawns in arranged marriages and were disowned by their families all for the sake of becoming closer to God through prayer knowledge and love. They did all of this without having to deceive themselves and others by denying their womanhood or hopping in bed with some man unlike the title character of this movie. At least the film mentions St. Catherine of Alexandria and there are hundreds more women Saints whose stories are equally gripping Hildegarde von Bingen Catherine of Siena Clare of Assisi Agnes of Prague Colette of Corbie Teresa of Avila Elisabeth of Hungary just to name a few. Read the letters or autobiographies of many of these women you'd never guess from Pope Joan but yes medieval Catholic women did in fact know how to write! rather than watching a movie most films about the Saints are sugarcoated and poorly acted.That being said even the corniest Saint movies aired on EWTN are better than the cardboard acting in Pope Joan.".

After a harsh and violent childhood and after her brother is killed in a Viking attack she decided to go into the world as a boy enrolling into a Benedictine monastery where she continues her studies and gains medical knowledge that ultimately gives her entry into the papal circles. The film is well directed acted and full with lavish images and scenes from the very distant past of the Dark Ages even if I personally had a problem with the ending I think it was over dramatized.

The medival setting is well done though lacks the glorious costumes of high budget productions. There is criticism that the crowd scenes are a little uncrowded I didn't notice this at all. David Wenham's a gorgeous actor with an amazing voice I love his rendition of the almost gormless Gerold so ruggedly handsome. I also like the all to short role Iain Glen was given as the Village Priest what wonderful acting. Much praise also to the very sweet Tigerlilly Hutchinson Tigerlilly?? she plays the young Joan with aplomb. Not the best historical drama I've seen but an excellent one only thing missing was the fragrance of medival europe.".

Much praise also to the very sweet Tigerlilly Hutchinson Tigerlilly?? she plays the young Joan with aplomb. Not the best historical drama I've seen but an excellent one only thing missing was the fragrance of medival europe.";

For example the elderly grandfather does not know that tin foil cannot be put into the microwave which leads to a scolding by his caucasian daughterinlaw.  All the conflict in the film is grounded in the real world as opposed to some very abstract 'generational conflict'.  Because of this I found this film to be much more rewarding than most other films about AsianAmericans.  A mustsee for ChineseAmericans and Caucasians alike.

His performance was extremely touching as tears jerked into my eyes as I see an aging and traditional Chinese father trying to get along with his westernized family while also trying to adjust to life in a new place and culture. The film encourages people especially new immigrants to emphasize and put themselves in their parents' shoes. Try to understand how difficult it is for them to come and settle in a new place and try not to push them away. Be patient with them take a step back and everything may be better.The movie title Pushing Hands is very appropriate as this is the term for an exercise in tai chi in which a person achieves balance by giving up balance. In this nonaggressive exercise between 2 people a person offers no resistance at all to the pressure or push that the other person is exerting and keeps borrowing this strength until they feel they have fused into one and thus have achieved harmony. This was what Master Chu did. Although his daughterinlaw kept misunderstanding him causing much discontent and eventually got his son to try to sent him away he offered no resentment or a temper tantrum. He simply walked away gracefully. This action caused his son to appreciate him and remember why he got his father to live together in the first place in a tear jerking scene and finally they worked out a solution. They decided to give each other space by living separately instead of pushing each other away. In the end everyone was much happier as even the daughterinlaw learned to accept the father symbolized by her decorating the guest room for him and asking the question if he would ever visit. The father achieved the balance that he seek in TaiChi.Ang Li is simply amazing and sensational. He did what he could with the limited budget and created a very warm and tear jerking film. Although this film was not the highest quality the version I saw was very unclear and skips sometimes and it could feel slow at times especially the beginning sequence the film was a great work in directing. The film picked up its pace after the slow beginning without any big fighting scenes or explosions and never felt boring afterwards. Also from the beginning sequence where he was able to show the dissension and gap between the daughterinlaw and the father by using just different scenes and visuals to scenes throughout the film where he used lighting and different camera angles to show the internal pain and sadness that the father experience it was simply put a great piece of art considering the budget. It showcased the talent of Li and gave the audience a glimpse of the man who would bring us the memorable Couching Tiger Hidden Dragon.".

	schema:headline " Internal arts lonely souls pushing hands";
	schema:reviewBody "'Pushing hands' refers to an exercise in tai chi where lightly touching each other two practitioners learn to yield to and redirect a shared flow of energy. It's actually at the core of tai chi a Chinese form of boxing built around Taoist principles of interconnected balance of opposites and emptiness in form.Nearly impossible to make sense of in film as is meditation and other internal arts of the East because simply showing it or worse in the light of mystical ability obscures what it really is about. Ang Lee however tries in his first film with mixed results.Modeled to the story of an aging tai chi master who comes to America to stay with his son's family there is what you'd expect from a film where East comes West contrasts between two opposite ways of life tradition versus modernity love versus duty. All that is pretty ordinary and some obvious drama and questionable acting bring it further down. To be fair for a lowbudget student film Lee shows considerable talent with a camera and has come far on this strength. All told I'd rather celebrate his success story than Tarantino's. But let's see something more interesting from the Chinese perspective.The overall point is finding a center of stillness in imbalanced life that is constantly in motion in the film we see this in the old master's quest for a home and new life in a new country somewhere to grow roots. This is the tao of balancing in the flow.Life back in China isn't presented as ideal we find that the old man has been persecuted all his life and that his tai chi and calligraphy are the still spot he cultivates his center in a moving universe of suffering. See how a phone ringing startles him from meditation that is life that goes on.In line with tai chi principles all this means 'hard' in several moments of real life conflict versus 'soft' in inwards reflection. There is a love interest in Mrs. Chen soft as feminine yin to his yang who's in a similar situation as the old man and much gentle pushing and yielding to be close to her.So how beautiful if we could have the film as cinematic 'pushing hands' between lonely souls? And carry the flow from heavy drama to soft inner life to what these people do to cool and express their ardor she in her cooking he in his calligraphy. Kar Wai makes it work not quite so here.Why is that? There's a scene of the old man watching videotapes of old Chinese kung fu movies ridiculous from his perspective. The film is meant to offer next to other things a realistic depiction of his arts fighting or otherwise tied to realistic human connection as both soft.But there are scenes like with the fat boy or in the restaurant that in the end are as ridiculous as those movies suddenly jerking us to fiction obscuring what is vital in his art and mirroring that there's a sense of inflated drama in emotional moments. But Lee is too talented for us to be able to easily discard the whole work.The Western perspective introduced later in the film by the son is that his father's internal arts may be his way of shutting off the outside world keeping from being touched perhaps related to the tragic loss of his wife. All through the film we see that he likes Mrs. Chen but is reluctant to be close to her.Now watch again the last scene where he teaches tai chi in the Chinese community center now the 'hero of Chinatown'. Watch how we first see him doing the motions then with a soft flow of the camera materializes behind him as though out of thin air an entire class of students. And who enters as if by chance? Mrs. Chen.Now 'soft' is what we see of his heart 'hard' what we imagine as taking place in his head.See how lightly the real and unreal touch how smooth the parallel flow. So you can afford to miss the rest but not this last moment it's expertly done and too delicious to ignore.".

But still it looks too much like an earnest but nottooskillful novice effort. The story does center around the old man newly arrived to Westchester after more than 70 years in China taken in by his loving son and his almost stereotypical Anglo housewife Martha complete with her curly hair her vegetarianism her obsessive concern about her weight her poor parenting skills her disinterest in sex her... Lots of clichs on the feminine side although to his credit Lee does well with his main character except for making him a mysterious Kung Fu master in this case Tai Chi.The opening scene seems interminable as we watch Martha struggle at her now seemingly primitive computer while Grand Father slowly does his Tai Chi exercises in an adjacent room. He knows no English she knows no Chinese so there is no dialog. We wonder what's happening where is this film going? Finally slowly the story unfolds and we learn details about their respective lives.But this film may also set some sort of record for Most Visible Boom Mic. I swear it makes more on screen appearances than the couple's son which is fortunate because this kid is one of the worst child actors in memory.Yes this is a story of generations cultures ambitions etc. but there are many better examples. Some scenes show promise but as a whole this film does not warrant more than a 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ang Lee's Pushing Hands is not a good movie. It offers a sometimes touching sometimes humorous story about a retired Tai Chi master who comes to America from China to live with his son his son's wife and their young boy. To its credit the film serves up intergenerational cross cultural tensions in a way that avoids seeming too clich and too trite. Old people and young people are different. Dealing with the difference can be hard. This is the film's plain truth. There's nothing wrong with plain truth and in some instances it can be refreshing.Unfortunately the acting the aimless direction glaring production mistakes and  most importantly  an uneven screenplay prevent this truth from coming forward with the grace that much of the filmed Tai Chi has. Regarding the performances all but the Tai Chi master played by Shihung Lung are fairly stiff. It's fortunate that the exception is the main character but lacking a strong supporting cast the film is left uneven. The direction begins interestingly with shots through windows becoming an early motif but soon becomes pedestrian any suggested meaning from interesting framing or mise en scene are lost. The glaring production problem was that on three occasions an overhead microphone was visible in the shots. I'm sure there's an old Chines proverb about this.But the main problem is that one character receives unsympathetic treatment by Lee's screenplay and direction Martha the white daughterinlaw to the Tai Chi master. She is written as a selfabsorbed and even vicious woman. She's a writer who is shot pouting because she has to share her home with a kind hearted old man. As he seeks inner peace through martial arts she only sees him as a disturbance to her peaceful home. Characters needn't be sympathetic but it makes the movie too simple as if were she nicer the generationalcultural tensions would disappear.".

I almost took the movie out of my machine at that point and threw it in the trash I could not watch as these two narcissists who invited this man to live with them redecide and put him in some type of communal living.This is a statement on how American selfishness and individual identity is infecting even those Chinese who are now living in the U.S.Mr. Chu's only respite is a woman friend he meets at the Chinese cultural center Mrs. Chen. Mr. Chu opens his heart to this somewhat reserved divorced lady and as the film progresses we see just how good of a man Mr. Chu is.

She had initially tried to tolerate his presence despite the language barrier between them but it never stopped her on wanting to find a new home for the family which also includes her Chineseborn husband Alex and son Jeremy but without the presence of her fatherinlaw.Chu would come to teach tai chi at a local community centre where he would also meet the cooking teacher Mrs. Chen who specialises in the teaching of making dumplings. There was the skirmishes as the tai chi class has to share their room with the cooking class as the cooking class had often being interrupted by what was going on nearby where one day one of the students from Chu's tai chi class would knock over a plate of dumplings waiting to be steamed. Chu would come to feel bad about it as he sets out to find a way to compensate Mrs. Chen. But before that he would learn from her as they were having the remaining dumplings that she had been living in the United States with her daughter and her family for a year after her second husband has died not long after escaping China to Taiwan from the Cultural Revolution.But back home the contrasting lifestyles and habits between Chu and Martha has come to put Alex on the spot. For Alex in between those times and beyond it was relooking into his own family with the presence of his elderly father in the house who had briefly lost his way when having a walk in the street and how he himself would come to settle in the United States.As Chu would come to get along well with Mrs. Chen where the two would come to find themselves being stuck in the similar predicament over the lives their respective children have to come to get used to in the United States there would be two defining moments for Chu and his family which would shape how Chu come to see his new life in the United States. Trying to tend to Martha who was having stomach pains before she would be admitted to the hospital for a few days and the decision to move out of his own accord before something happens to him at the Chinese restaurant where he worked which would alarm Alex and Martha.The cultural and lifestyle differences references in the film are there from almost the start as exemplified in Chu and Martha. Chu is trying to cling on what he has always know before he left China to join his nowgrown up son Alex in the United States through especially the tai chi he practices and the American daughterinlaw Martha who came from a very different set of upbringing with both trying to get Alex's attention at the same time who tries to blend in both his American way of life while remembering the presence of his father in the house.There are the comical moments and the tender ones as well especially on Chu telling Alex of what really happened to the family in Beijing at the height of the Cultural Revolution when Alex would be sent to live in the United States all on his own. It is a film which makes one think especially for those who are straddling in between two different cultures on when is the time to let go and the time to compromise where the end result for either scenario is something both parties have to come to accept. Anyone who has been through what the Alex in the film has to go through will know the struggles of trying to bridge the past and the present together.".

It is striking that during dinner Martha and Jeremy uses forks to eat while Mr Chu and Alex uses chopsticks. Another striking scene is when Mr Chu and Mrs Chan talk in the community centre towards the end of the film behind Mr Chu is an American flag while behind Mrs Chan it is a piece of Chinese calligraphy. Such subtle display of cultural differences is clever. The film is also heavy on Chinese traditional ideas such as children taking care of parents as a natural duty parents not wanting to burden children of their troubles etc. Such cultural ideas are beautifully explored.It is a pity that this film is shot with a very low budget. There are even three occasions that the boom mike is visible. Fortunately such imperfections do not hinder my enjoyment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning contains small SPOILERS.While other countries have produced excellent comingout movies such as 'Beautiful Thing' 'Krmpack' or 'Get Real' Germany always lacked a gay film that wasn't either totally hilarious or utterly problemridden. Then came director Marco Kreuzpaintner and he 'got real' The plot the language the characters use the way they behave are just very realistic and natural for the most part anyway. Kreuzpaintner is able to capture the feelings of the protagonists in a very subtle and convincing way. Apart from some minor flaws  like the catholic girlsgroup from Saxony which is a little overdone  the dialogues could very well have been taken out of today's Germany. It really makes you feel you're right there in the tent camp. This is no wonder since the director who is also coauthor of the script is himself only 27 and wove many of his personal experience into the story.As for the actors I was equally impressed especially by Robert Stadlober who plays the part of Tobi the main role. Much more than in his previous roles 'Sonnenallee' 'Crazy' he is able to convincingly portray the insecurities that come with growing up. The 'sexscene' for example where Tobi loses his virginity with Leo Marlon Kittel is played in a very straightforward way. Unlike what you see in many other movies it is not corny but quite downtoearth with its suddenness and banality. The rest of the cast also did a great job and apparently put their hearts into the film.But it's not just about a boy coming to terms with his being gay. It's a movie about youth about growing up about respect and about broadening your horizon. And it's dead funny too!I have seen the movie twice in two separate preview screenings in southern Germany. The first time the audience was almost exclusively gay the second time almost completely straight. And the thing is both times the crowd was equally thrilled and the movie as well as the director got long ovations. So I guess 'Sommersturm' has the makings of an allaudiences film that is not only very entertaining but also heart warming and touching. It can help straight kids to better understand what it's like to grow up gay. And it can help gay kids to develop selfconfidence and pride.Personally I think teachers should take their classes to see this movie. And for everyone who doesn't go to school anymore go see it anyway and enjoy!10 out of 10".

As cox and oarsman they have helped their team win several rowing cups in the past and are now looking forward to the big regatta in the countryside. But this trip is no summer camp and the problems soon arise. As Achim's relationship with his girlfriend grows more serious Tobi starts to realise that his feelings for Achim run deeper than he's willing to admit to himself. He feels confused unsure of himself and increasingly left out. When the muchanticipated Berlin girls' team is being replaced by a team of athleticyoung gay men Tobi and his teammates are suddenly forced to grapple with their prejudices fears and perhaps their hidden longings. As the tension grows Tobi Achim and the others head towards a confrontation as fierce and ultimately as liberating as the summer storm gathering over the lake...Summer Storm is an emotionally mature and honest film which deals with the issue of coming out with humour sensitivity and understanding. The performances are excellent with the actors and actresses tending to underplay emotions rather than hamfisting them home which tends to happen in American teen dramas. The performance by the award winning Robert Stadlober Best Leading Actor at the Montreal Film Festival 2001 was particularly standout. All characters are identifiable and likable and although some characters verge on the clich clichs are clichs because they originated in truth. Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and cinematographer Daniel Gottschalk make the landscape lush tranquil yet with a strong sense of isolation loneliness and foreboding. Visual metaphors are seamlessly woven into the films narrative without becoming too clich or distracting. The film is unhyperbolic in its treatment of the familiar themes of coming of age the search for identity friendship and sexuality both homosexuality and heterosexuality. Sommersturm is a beautiful moving and honest film.".

Robert Stadlober is in great shape acting as well as the whole of the cast.

For those who still have some prejudice towards different sexual orientations it's a soft learning lesson... Congratulations to the film team!".

Within minutes I was captivated by the main characters reliving my own doubts in those beautiful days between high school and reality.Those looking for an erotic homosexual expose of yet another ''coming out'' will probably be disappointed. The interaction of the sexes is both subtle and natural damn normal as it should be. Few films let you forget your own sexual orientation and draw you into the scene through the sheer power of love and affection. The tears joys and pain of youth are vividly painted on a backdrop of beautifully photographed scenes that are both authentically modern and nostalgically overpowering. These are the friends you want to meet on your next canoe trip or wished you had met at summer camp 40 years ago.Summer Storm is perhaps the best German film in decades a quiet film that steals your heart. American audiences have had to wait a bit longer to finally see it. In Germany the film was rated PG12. The US version is rated R. That says something about the progress or lack of in dealing with films that address sexuality. US audiences can deal with ''Sex and the City'' and ''Six Feet Under'' but don't dare let our kids see a movie that might help them find their sexual identity. Personally I can't think of a better film as an introduction to sex education in grade school. I highly recommend watching the film with your teenaged son or daughter. They can explain the parts you didn't quite catch.".

Too bad something like SUMMER STORM isn't made more often here in the States.It's summer time and Tobi the engaging Robert Stadlober is in a seething state of sexual confusion. He wants to have sex with a girl but his strongest feelings are reserved for his best bud Achim Kostja Ullmann who in turn is having a hotandheavy romance with girlfriend Sandra Miriam Morgenstern. Meantime carrying the torch for Tobi is the heartbreakingly beautiful Anke Alicja BatchledaCurus who has absolutely no idea where her intended's head is at. At least not at first.The four teens are all on rowing teams and their coach takes them all to camp to bond and train for the seasonal rowing trials. Among the rival teams is an allgay team the Queerstrokers who will soon prove instrumental in the awakening of Tobi helping him realize who he is and eventually to reconcile the lopsided love triangle he is involved in which can only produce consequences destined to bring about an unhappy ending.Not to make the film sound too serious but it deals with the themes of sexual confusion exploration and discovery in a natural and nonjudgmental way that is so lacking in most American features of this genre. The casting of the actors is just about perfect as they all look sound and perform like you would imagine German teens would who are not that much different from any other young people their age anywhere in the world.Even if the audience of SUMMER STORM isn't gay it deals effectively with the kind of emotions and situations that all adults can relate to back when they were younger and kids who are the same age as the film's characters can identify with now.A wellmade comingofage tale for everyone except for conservative prudes and preteens definitely worth your time.".

It's been a long time that I have seen a German film that is so authentic and honest really it was nearly like a documentary you really feel like being there as well.It's one of the rare film in which everything fits together the acting the music the dramatic art the fun the dialogs.The acting is outstanding. Robert Stadlober is so convincing. You really can feel it when he's desperate or angry.The music was touching and moving there are wonderful scenes when the camera floats over the lake while it rains and this wonderful sad classical music is played. So beautiful...I think the director did a wonderful job he  being gay and young himself  of course also knew what it's like growing up and discovering your homosexuality as Tobi does.Clichs and stereotypes are discussed by the actors themselves. For gay people it's a must as everyone surely can partly see oneself in Tobi and for straight people it's a great chance to broaden their horizons as they can learn about the difficulty of growing up while being different.It's a real honest film.Go and see it! It's 1010 from me!".

Just wonderful and a pleasure to watch.The plot can be told very quickly Tobi and Achim live in a Bavarian village are the best of friends and also together in a rowing team. But Tobi has a secret He is in love with Achim doesn't dare to tell him of course and is jealous of Sandra Achim's girlfriend. When Tobi Achim and their team travel to a competition which at the same time is a camp and meet a gay rowing team there the emotions boil over and soon Tobi has to face the truth and find out who he is.To sum it up This film is a masterpiece and in my opinion should be officially one of the best films of all times. It is filmed in a very quiet way with calm shots of nature of teenagers their dreams fears and emotions but also their conflicts. It takes teenagers seriously without being too serious and deals with homosexuality coming out and coming of age without drowning in clichs. Plus it has some hilarious comic situations and great one liners in it. One could say The movie shows pure life for life is sometimes fun sometimes tragic sometimes beautiful and sometimes hard. Also everyone from the protagonists to minor characters is casted perfectly and you have some of the most talented young German actors of our time here Robert Stadlober Marlon Kittel and Hanno Koffler. Sommersturm  a terrific piece of art that you can't help falling in love with.".

	schema:headline " Very nice movie about the discovering of being gay.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's one of those 'coming of agemovies' to give a special place on the mantelpiece the German movie Sommersturm or Summer Storm as it is called in English. It tells about a group of young people. Tobi is inseparable from his friend Achim. They jog together they jerk off together and they join the same rowing club. And they make plans for a journey. But then there is love. Achim falls in love with Sandra but Tobi has his eye on Achim. Achim doesn't want to have anything to do with gays and doesn't know about the secret love of his friend for him.The climax comes during the preparations for a rowing contest. Tobi's and Achim's group will compete with other rowing clubs. Before the actual contest they meet the other groups during a training camp. When it becomes clear that one of the competing clubs exists of only gay men the only issue the others will talk about is homosexuality. In a negative way of course. That doesn't make things easier for Tobi. He is confronted with his own denial constantly. It's really beautiful to see the rapprochement between him and one of the members of the gay rowing club. The scene when Tobi experiences his own real sexuality is fabulous. Moving is the confession of his homosexuality to the other members of his club. The final reaction of his fellow rowers is fabelhaft using a good German word.The danger with this type of movie when young people discover they are gay is that clichs will be used. Fortunately in Sommersturm that doesn't happen very often. The movie was made with passion for the issue of homosexuality and there is a good balance between seriousness and humor. Therefore the movie is 'suitable' for gays and straights.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a gay boy this film is the most amazing depiction of youth homosexuality I've ever seen. I was bored during Brokeback Mountain and uncaptivated by the popular British coming out movies such as Beautiful Thing and Get Real. This one is just so beautiful the power of the movie kept me watching it again and again. After watching it put me into a trance that lasted days and every time I think of it I feel emotions rumbling in my stomach. The movie is somewhat of a wonderful fantasy reenforced by the beautiful actors music and landscape. You feel so close to these characters immediately perhaps because you yearn to be there with them. The Queerschlag was what made the movie so special for me. These are the friends you so dearly needed in high school a period which was so lonely for most gay teens. The dancing scene the evening rowing shot Oli hugging Leo and the dock roughhousing scene almost seem like those perfect memories that never actually happened. That's what made the movie so emotional for me. What I would give to find friends like that and have such an experience..I would dream about drinking and dancing at a beautiful Bavarian lake like the Queerschlag did. Good friendships with other gay boys is something that many gays miss out onfor some other gay boys are only for relationships and sex. Though the Queerschlag had many different kinds of gays in all shapes and sizes manly feminine sensitive overtly sexual they all seemed comfortable with each other and shared the magic of gay friendship. This is the way it should be when growing up gay. Of course gay men encounter difficulties because those same friendships are always complicated by crushes and relationships and the problems that ensue. Oli seemed to fancy Leo and was jealous of Tobi for stealing him away. The two Niels were boyfriends. I wonder if straight audiences noticed these things...that were so obvious to me. We all feel sorry for poor Anke but what about Oli? The acting in the movie is superb. Anke Tobi and Leo are marvelously played. Leo Marlon Kittel is simply adorable the sensitive way he courts Tobi is so wonderful. The love scene on the dock is the most beautiful I've ever seen it is so innocent and pure and gives you true butterflies. We've all been desensitized by porn but the scene is so different and will simply astound you by it's magic. One can't help but fall in love with Leo in every scene he's in. This movie had an profound impact on my life and how I see the world. It is melancholic and nostalgic in subtle ways that just overpowered me. The innocence of the movie is captivating. I have shown this movie to many friends and they have all loved it. Simply Magical!".

Given the fact that director Marco Kreuzpaintner was in his late 20s when he wrote the script and that it was nearly autobiographical the story takes place in the early 1990s when he was 1718 years old and everything from the worn 1970s bus they use for their journey in the beginning to the lack of cellphones no way for a teenager to hide in the forest nowadays  just call him and the ringing will tell you which tree he sits on  !! exactly fits into this period of time. It was also the early 1990 when more and more exclusively gaylesbian sportsclubs occurred in the bigger cities over here for soccer scubadiving rowing etc. and they almost always use some kind of a pun for their namesVorspiel foreplay Gaysha Karate to name a few just like Queerschlag did which exists in reality to this very day. On that background my reception of the movie is that it is more about Tobi's love for Achim than about his coming out. Tobi has fallen in love with his best friend and that is something that is happening to young gays all the time. It is a very painful process when you have to realize that your mate who shared his time and feelings with you for years and years other than yourself will not be able to turn that friendship into love and sexual tenderness. Tobi's coming out at the end is only the result of the fact that he learned that Achim will never be able to love him the way he does and that he has to accept this. So after all this movie is both about accepting heterosexual and homosexual love. By the way as some of the posters here misunderstood the lake were the story takes place is in fact a 100 years old reservoir thats why you see the sandy banks in summer and it is not in Bavaria but in an area called Bergisches Land a few hundred miles north of Bavaria if you want to find it in Google Earth search for Wipperfrth.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is by far one of these best gaythemed films I have seen since Beautiful Thing released in 1996  and one of the best films of any kind that I have watched since Crash.You will laugh out loud and cry as you feel the agony Tobi endures while coming to terms with his sexuality. Tobi played flawlessly by Robert Stadlober is the leader of his rowing team and looked up to by his teammates for leadership. When his team is up against another rowing team comprised of an allgay team his inner feelings are realized. Tobi deals with his feelings and love for his best friend Achim and eventually deals with the complications of coming out to him. All the while dealing with confused emotions for his girlfriend and a new boy he meets on the opposing team.The film is genuine welldirected wellacted and goes headon with the painful emotions most younger people must face when trying to understand their sexuality. THIS STORY IS REAL! And proves once again that we truly cannot help who we fall in love with. Love is about following your heart  it's about people not the sex of the individual's involved.The movie hails from Germany and is in German with English subtitles. Even with having to read the film to understand it the talent of the young actors shines through.Not only was I impressed by the story even the movies scenes and settings were delightful. Kudos to here! Films Genius Products and Liberation Entertainment for producing this movie. It's a shame Hollywood USA can't or doesn't have the courage to produce this quality and style of film.".

It's simply terrific offering humor and heartache in equal servings. The acting from all the characters is brilliant and like other viewers I particularly liked the subtle and sensitive performance of Marlon Kittel in the role of Leo as well as Alicja BachledaCurus's performance as Anke. I wish that the U.S. had the depth or courage to produce films like this. It seems most of my favorite gaythemed movies are foreign films. Others have gone into all the plot points and developments so I won't rehash them but I will touch on one thing I loved and a couple of other viewers noted it as well... There is a lengthy scene late in the movie chapter 17 on the DVD to be exact that for nearly two dialogfree minutes allows the camera to fade in and out of varying scenes from the introspective despair of Achim lying by his girlfriend and obviously hurting over the loss of his best friend Tobi to a series of scenes of the lake and the land in a rainstorm. Each of these scenes has a single focal point whether a ball floating on the lake or a ladder on the side of a dock... it's a stunning montage from a cinematography standpoint and the whole scene is accompanied by an incredibly beautiful haunting melody on a cello. It's perfect and I could have easily watched this scene in rapt attention had it carried on for another couple of minutes.".

The best news is that the actors are great not only are they stunningly beautiful and skilled in their acting I didn't get shivers from the German they were using. Which is a rare thing  The imagery is enchanting naturalistic. Of course the lake takes the credits for that. The music fits in nicely although you might call Go West 'over the top'.The story is definitely a positive one although it is positive in shades. It shows some of the darker sides of the coming of age of a Gay teen dreams are shattered new hopes and fears are displayed without being explicitly mentioned. You have to chew some of the material yourself which is good... at least it keeps you busy once you've seen the movie.I saw it twice and am eagerly awaiting to get my hands on a DVD sold out already here to have a third and possible fourth screening.

	schema:reviewBody "Teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little German film 'Sommersturm' or 'Summer Storm' and the result is a set of minicrises that tumble young people all the time first sexual attraction the ambiguity of close friendships the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers.Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and writer with Thomas Bahmann set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate. Two teams from Bavaria one of boys and the other of girls take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from Berlin a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys. The Bavarian boys' crew team is lead by two longterm friends  Tobi Robert Stadlober and Achim Kostja Ullmann  and while their friendship is strong Tobi is discovering that his feelings for Achim go far deeper. The two share stories about their girlfriends  Anke and beautiful Alicja BachledaCurus and Sandra Miriam Morgenstern who head the girl's crew team. At the summer camp Tobi's feelings for Achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension. Tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding Leo Marlon Kittel and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover. The manner in which Tobi comes out to his team and to Achim is the very tender dnouement of the story. The storm raging in Tobi as well as in other members of the team settles into the aftermath.Some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching. The director seems to be telling us that the 'first experience' whether that is gay or straight is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling. The cast does well there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure. For a young director only 29 years old and this is his fifth film Kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future.".

It is OK to have one or two gay teenagers in a movie but if Hollywood ever makes a big movie such as this one i am sure that the movie studio will have tons of complains from all kinds of religious fanatics.There was only one scene that didn't seem to be possible. After Tobi had sex with another guy from the gay team somehow his girlfriend was waiting for him in the bush right by the lake as if she knew that he will definitely walks pass by that area.Overall this is a refreshing movie that many teenagers and grownups can relate to the anxiety the first time the sex drive fear of being rejected etc. Since I have never seen those actors on screen before that makes this movie even more authentic. Just like everything there is always an end. I felt a little sad that this movie had to end as if a part of their lives have became a part of my memory. I can only imagine what would happen to them after the summer was over.".

The trailer made this movie look like it was soaked with clichs.I finally watched this movie today and I am truly impressed. Sure the main storyline is the comingout story but it is really well done and also there is so much more to this movie.Most of the characters are well rounded they all have their flaws and strengths. The gay guys aren't presented as saints and the heterosexuals are no ignorant gaybashing crowd. It would have been so easy to make this movie play like a gay vs. straight story in which the straight team bullies the gays and the gays gain confidence in fact this is what the trailer made the film look like. But that's not the story here. On a grouplevel it is a story of heterosexuals overcoming their insecurity with homosexuals and gays taking a look behind their own stereotypes.The comingoutstoryline is pretty common stuff. There is nothing really new here but it is still well done. What made this movie really hit me hard and bring me to tears was the comingofage story that goes along with it. Rarely ever have I seen a movie that captures so well how beautiful it is to be young and how much it hurts when your best friendship is torn apart by growing up and falling in love. The scene in which Toby is close to panic because he knows that his friend Achim split from the group in order to have sex with his girlfriend made me remember my own youth and how jealous I got when a good friend of mine suddenly had a girlfriend. I believe that the most painful aspect of this scene is not only that he is in love with Achim himself but that there is a feeling of loss.Sure you know you are being selfish and jealous by not wanting your friend to have sex. You know you wouldn't act any differently. But knowing that right there and then it might all change and you might lose him to another person and experiencing this fear.... I really know and understand this feeling. And when Toby goes looking for them even though he knows he shouldn't and watches them the scene almost broke my heart.The great thing about this movie is that you cannot only appreciate it on a homosexual level but also on a plain friendshiplevel. I am pretty sure that while watching this movie everybody will remember his youth sentimentally the innocence what it was like at the time when we realized that we soon would be free to do whatever we wanted and plans we made. And then... that dreadful experience just a little while later when we had to understand that the prize for this freedom was the loss of our innocence and the end of the carefree days.This movie understands youth and treats it seriously. It is warm funny sentimental sad romantic sexy and truly beautiful. I really hope that the gay element does not turn too many people off before watching it because as I said there is a lot more to it and these people will miss a perfect gem.".

Without revealing too much of the story I think that the ending is sufficiently happy. It is not a fairytale ending with everyone getting their loved one rather it is a promising ending the first step is taken it went fairly well... the end. The obstacles that are waiting parents for example are not dealt with.The acting is good a few minor characters excluded. I especially like Stadlober who give an excellent display of a confused young man and all the pain that comes with that. The moment he says the words ... because I'm gay for the first time ever it is a moment of rebirth how his face seconds afterward tells us that suddenly several tons of mental garbage went away. Wonderful! Just as a note I must add that the photo is very good. Several nice and well composed shots in the film and they give emphasis to the emotions on display.So a realistic and beautiful film of the initial phase of coming out accepting it yourself well acted and with a suitable mix of humor drama and romantic moments never corny and suitably erotic for this kind of film  thats my summary of the film. Well worth seeing.".

Several nice and well composed shots in the film and they give emphasis to the emotions on display.So a realistic and beautiful film of the initial phase of coming out accepting it yourself well acted and with a suitable mix of humor drama and romantic moments never corny and suitably erotic for this kind of film  thats my summary of the film. Well worth seeing.";

	schema:headline " Teen ComingofAge Flick with a Twist";
	schema:reviewBody "Summer Storm 'Sommersturm' is a German comingofage film written and directed by Marco Kruezpaintner starring Robert Stadlober. The film chronicles a week in a rowing regatta where the main character Tobi Stadlober questions the depth of his feelings for best friend Achim Kostja Ullmann whilst attempting to juggle a normal relationship with girlfriend Anke Alicja BachledaCurus. Tobi's confusion is exacerbated with the arrival of rowing team 'The Queerstrokes' who are all out and proud and an impending summer storm.Despite an occasional music video feel specifically a cheesy music sequence of the landscape Kruezpaintner employs some rather striking shots in the film. From a fallen tree literally isolating Tobi from everyone to Tobi letting loose and jumping off a lake dock and to the actual 'summer storm' Kruezpaintner displays intelligent visual metaphors for the internal confusion and fear that builds up within Tobi.Even more impressive are the performances with Stadlober perhaps channelling his own experiences he is openly bisexual into the difficult and sometimes selfish character of Tobi. Also notable is Marlon Kittel's courageous and poignant performance as Leo the 'Queerstrokes' member who helps Tobi accept his sexuality.What is most surprising about Summer Storm however is how it is perhaps aimed just as much towards Queer Film Festival critics as it is to teens. It is both a teen dramedy with honest performances and sensitive direction and a foreign arthouse flick housing a killer soundtrack and fratboy culture.All involved should be congratulated on presenting a film that is both honest with the psyche of homosexual teenagers whilst still accessible enough to appeal to most mature audiences. A definite winner!".

Andy Lau wasn't available so he brought along Ka Fai Leung to take his spot. Elvis Tsui and Sharla Cheung Man costar along with ChienLi Wu and the ever hot Chingmy Yau. The God of Guns also makes an appearance reprising his role as the God of Gamblers bodyguard.This film is pretty grim but it's also funny as well. The God of Gamblers is in retirement but the new Devil of Gamblers wants to play a game with him and he wont take no for an answer and makes life a living hell for the G.O.G.To describe this film wont do it justice. But if you have seen a Jing Wong movie or the first film you wont walk away from this movie disappointed. The slapstick comedy and farcical elements along with a huge helping of bloodshed will keep everyone highly entertained and it's one hell of a ride.Jing Wong made a lot of money with this series and the gambling genre in general. After this film he started up the Saint of Gamblers series a prequel to the God of Gamblers and a new series called the Conmen. In many interviews that Mr. Wong has given in the past he's stated that The Cincinatti Kid It's A Mad Mad Mad World and Die Hard are his favorite movies. After watching this flick you'll understand why. As always the U.S. is slow on the poker phenomenon. But films like these make gambling not as fun as it seems.Highly Recommended!xxx".

It makes the last of the series much more satisfying.I know there's more recent series that has God of Gambler's cameo but it's safe to say that this is the end of God of Gambler's epic story before being a legend permanently.It's good to see the god of gambler himself back in the game with a strong background story and interesting plots and twists that come along with it.Definitely a must watch especially after watching the previous of the series.";

This time after living a seemingly quiet life a new nemesis has murdered his family and he has vowed to seek revenge on those who did him and his family harm while concealing his God of Gamblers identity for one year.As a sequel I think this film does not compare to the intrigue charm humor and drama as found in the original movie as the action scenes were in my opinion overkill and the characters weren't as memorable  even though some respected actors such as Tony LeungKa Fai and Chingmy Yau have starring roles.The kid in the movie was a little annoying and the gambling scenes in the movie were overhyped. There are some intense and suspenseful moments especially when Ko Chun finally takes on his nemesis. There are also some funny moments from LeungKa Fai but overall it's not one of the more intriguing gambling movies.Grade C".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS!!! The original God of Gamblers became an instant classic and revived the genre of gambling films in HK filmdom thanks in no small part to the star power of Chow Yun Fat.  Several years and a couple of series installments without CYF Wong Jing was able to lure this superstar back for another adventure of Ko Chun and God of Gamblers Return is the result of that effort.Wong Jing had the unenviable task in this film of being true to the original material but  striving to tell a fresh story. It is a goal that was admirably achieved as God of Gamblers Return is true to the spirit of the original film but covers new territory resulting in an entertaining foray into the further adventures of Ko Chun The God of Gamblers.The film features an impressive cast of supporting players including the returning Charles Mr. Dragon'  Heung Tony Leung Ka Fai  Jacqueline Ng Elvis Tsui Chigamy Yau Ken Lo and the precocious Miu Tse a large budget and lush production values.The action picks up four years after the original film.  Ko Chun is how happily retired living the good life in France with his pregnant wife Yau played by Man Cheung who portrayed the illfated Janet in GoG.  Mr. Dragonnow referred to by Ko Chun as God of Gun' as a sign of his gratitude for his past servicescomes to visit his old friend and boss to apprise him of the latest developments in the gambling underworld that Ko has left behind.  At the same time the Devil of Gamblers' a truly vicious villainis rounding on his retired rival his goal to draw the God of Gamblers out of retirement by any means possible in order to humiliate him at the gaming tables.While Ko Chun and Dragon engage in a little target practice and male bonding in another part of the estate Devil of Gamblers arrives at the Ko mansion and begins killing everyone in sight. When a wounded servant arrives to warn Ko Chun and Dragon the two race back to the mansion and engage in a fierce battle with the Devil's henchmen.While his lackeys are being mowed down Devil of Gamblers is ensuring his rivals undying hatred by murdering Ko's unborn son and leaving his wife to slowly bleed to death from having the child ripped from her womb. Ko finds his dying wife as the Devil makes his exit.  She extracts  a promise from her husband that he will forestall his vengeance for one year during which time he will neither gamble nor admit his identity as the God of Gamblers.   Ko Yau hopes to preserve her husband's life with these promises feeling that his rage and hunger for vengeance will subside in that year and he will not be drawn to what she fears will be his death.The action moves ahead to eleven months later. Ko Chun has abided by his wife's wishes he has been touring the world alone and  incognito.  In mainland China having just finished a tour of the Silk Road he meets and befriends Hoi On a jovial family man who it happens to turn out is the head of the Taiwan casino empire that Devil of Gamblers also works for and is trying to subvert .  Ko Chun ducking photographs and not revealing his own identity per his promise joins Hoi on his family yacht for an evening of fellowship and entertainment.Hoi On is betrayed by one of his own henchman played to perfection by Jackie Chan's bodyguardkickboxing champion Ken Lo.  The henchman masterminds a raid on Hoi On's yacht to rob the wealthy man.  The gambit concludes with Hoi On and most of his family dead the yacht in ruins.  The only survivorsKo Chun and Hoi's son Hoi Yuen. Ko has promised the dying man to see that the boy gets home to Taiwan to be reunited with his sister. Jumping from the burning ship with little more than their lives Ko and the boy are almost immediately arrested by the mainland police who do not buy their story of being the victims of the crime not its perpetrators.They fall into the hands of  brutal mainland police and are abused and beaten before being shown a small measure of mercy by the Police Captain played with alternating menace and hilarity by Elvis Tsuimercy which proves short lived.  They manage to escape the police compound and become refugees in the countryside eventually landing at the hotel run by Sui Yuiyui  who spends her time mooning over the only known photograph of God of Gamblers which features him from the rear only her idol.  She dreams that he will come to her and they will dance together.  Little does she realize that her daydream has come to pass so instead she makes life as difficult as possible for Ko Chun and the boyrefusing them service in the dining room faking sex phone chat chatter when Ko tries to call Dragon and otherwise being obnoxious.Also being obnoxious is Hoi Yueh the casino mogul's son who blames Ko Chun for leaving his father behindrefusing to believe his father was already dead.  The precocious lad also turns to out be a budding gambler who while Ko fights with YiuYiu to get an outside long distance phone line goes off to gamble hoping to increase his money.  This puts him in the clutches of YiuYiu's brother  Fongfong aka Little Trumpet' Tony Leung Ka fai in hilarious form a small time hustler who cheats any and all comers with his rigged games.  Finding the boy who has just lost all his money Ko Chun goes to have a face off with Little Trumpet. All the while staying true to his promise to his wife not to gamble Ko Chun hypnotizes  the miscreant into losing all his money in a rematch with the boy.Soon however the police who have been in hot pursuit appear on the scene and Ko Chun Hoi Yuen and the Sui siblings are all on the run together.They manage to turn the tide long enough to take the Police Captain as a hostage and make their escape from the mainland aboard the boat of a smugglercumnationalist partysecret agent Condor the captain still in tow.  A fierce communist while in mainland waters the police captain turns budding capitalist once they land in Taiwan.Hoi Yuen is nearly reunited with his sister when Devil of Gamblers appears and kidnaps the boy luring his  sister and Ko Chun and company to the huge casino.He has intelligence that tells him that one of the newly arrived party is God of Gamblers but since no photos exist he cannot determine which.

While once again for most of the film he is out of uniform' playing Ko Chun in mufti here we see not the childlike idiot savant of the first film but a man haunted by the tragedies that have shattered his life using the one means at his disposal to exact his revenge.  His portrayal of  Ko Chun is at turns touching  as he ministers to the sick Hoi Yuen on the voyage to Taiwan by humming the boy a lullaby as he attempts to comfort the dying Yui Yui while maintaining his promise to his late wifechilling as he exacts revenge on those who have violated his home and privacy and killed his wife and unborn child hilarious impersonating Knife and masterful as the God of Gamblers who truly lives up to his name.Those expecting a replay of the elements that made God of Gamblers a classic will be disappointed by the sequel.  However if one enters the viewing of the film with a determination not to prejudge the film based on memories of the original they will find a well  crafted story which provides a satisfying further adventure of a compelling character.0".

Chao Siu Chi kills Ko's wife and unborn child leaving a very unhappy God of Gamblers swearing revenge.The film starts well enough with lots of ballistic action as the heavily armed baddies storm Ko's home although there is a disappointing lack of bloody squibs this time around followed by a surprisingly nasty demise for our hero's wife she has her unborn child pulled from her womb. Another early scene on a yacht where Ko defends a Taiwanese gangster and his family from Chau's men is also well staged. From this point on though it's all downhillKo is landed with an irritating child sidekick and pursued by the police and stumbles from one terrible comedic situation to the next for what seems like an eternity. After lots of cringeworthy gags a spot of political humour that went right over my head and some awful nonsense involving a secret agent called Eagle Ko arrives in Taiwan where he eventually faces Chao Siu Chi in a casino for a supposedly thrilling climax that takes quite a bit of swallowing the whole thing with the hair attached to the cardWTF?.4.5 out of 10 rounded up to 5 for the brief shot of Ko's unborn child in a specimen jar surprisingly nasty and the welcome presence of Chingamy Yau as Hoi Tong the sexy kickass daughter of the Taiwanese crime boss.".

	schema:headline " Builds upon the flaws that plagued the original. Twice as ridiculous but only half as entertaining.";
	schema:reviewBody "God of Gamblers Returns is a drunken repeat of first movie and stumbles down to the ground in comparison. The story is just as simple where Chow needs to take revenge for his loved ones the only way he knows how through shooting smiling and gambling. The biggest flaw of the original God of Gamblers was the breakaway subplot of Chow Yun Fat losing his memory and thinking he was toddler for an hour. In this movie Chow Yun Fat actually has to take care of a toddler and this time the cheesy subplot lasts much longer than an hour which gets progressively more slapstick oriented. Like in the first movie the introduction is both fastpaced and interesting then after 15 minutes immediately dives off into the subplot which has no relief until the villain makes a confrontation in the third act. In a similar structure CYF gains a few comic relief oddballpals except this round he gains two more which brings the count to four comic relief characters which surround him constantly. Despite the movie trying to present a facade of a fun group they're plain annoying and obnoxious overall detracting screen time and charisma away from Chow and the serious characters. The return of the God of Gamblers is disappointing as his return is weakened by flat side characters who treat him as a stooge. Wong Jing didn't learn from his previous mistakes as still the only truly interesting portions of the sequel are where there's gambling and gunfights. Thus the beginning and end are great but the middle act will frustrate even the most patient HK fans. It has its moments but the stuff in between will wear you down. 510".

In this movie Chow Yun Fat actually has to take care of a toddler and this time the cheesy subplot lasts much longer than an hour which gets progressively more slapstick oriented. Like in the first movie the introduction is both fastpaced and interesting then after 15 minutes immediately dives off into the subplot which has no relief until the villain makes a confrontation in the third act. In a similar structure CYF gains a few comic relief oddballpals except this round he gains two more which brings the count to four comic relief characters which surround him constantly. Despite the movie trying to present a facade of a fun group they're plain annoying and obnoxious overall detracting screen time and charisma away from Chow and the serious characters. The return of the God of Gamblers is disappointing as his return is weakened by flat side characters who treat him as a stooge. Wong Jing didn't learn from his previous mistakes as still the only truly interesting portions of the sequel are where there's gambling and gunfights. Thus the beginning and end are great but the middle act will frustrate even the most patient HK fans. It has its moments but the stuff in between will wear you down. 510";

Well simply because they put too much stupid comedy in it which really worked as an anchor and dragged the movie down.Sure it was good to see Chow YunFat reprising the Ko Chun character and he did act well enough. Unfortunately he wasn't joined by Andy Lau which would have been a great addition to the movie having him reprising his character as well. Instead Chow YunFat is joined by Tony Leung Ka Fai and Chingmy Yau on the screen.Storywise then The Return of the God of Gamblers wasn't as enjoyable as the first movie. There were some really great moments in the movie sure but in overall it was just not as good as the first movie. And I repeat myself again here but the implemented attempts at bringing comedy into this movie was so poor that it made the movie suffer instead of improving it.Don't get me wrong The Return of the God of Gamblers isn't a bad movie but personally I didn't think too much of it especially not compared to the first God of Gamblers movie. They have strayed a bit too far into the comedy genre for my personal liking.".

But commercial success doesnt say anything about the qualities of a movie just in view of the greatest blockbuster ever..! Okay the gunfights and the chases are a light version of John Woos action sequences but I dont matter however a really big annoyance is the forced wittyness. Normally I can stand Asian humor without any problems but this time the permanent pesky jokes massively strained my nerves! Another minus point is that real exciting moments are rare in this film! I liked Chingmy Yaus Naked Killer Kung Furoulette and the final pokerduel is an amazing psychological showdown. Unfortunately the rest of the film does not deliver because its a quite undecided genretwist between action and comedy! Welldirected and endowed with a fine cinematography The Return of the God of Gamblers is not as great as it could be!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "CLANS OF INTRIGUE 1977 is another in the series of Shaw Bros. swordplay adventures directed by Chor Yuen aka Chu Yuan and adapted by studio scribe I Kuang from novels by prolific author Ku Lung which present an elaborate alternate universe martial arts world recreated with great care on lavish Shaw Bros. sets. Other collaborations of the three include KILLER CLANS 1976 and THE MAGIC BLADE 1976 both also reviewed on this site. CLANS OF INTRIGUE is less actionpacked than the earlier films and plays more as a detective drama with the emphasis on a largescale investigation as a swordsman framed for murder tries to find out who has killed three clan chiefs and why.Ti Lung stars as Thief Master Chu Liuhsiang a highliving swordsman who travels around on his own private boat attended by three beautiful female students referred to somewhat indelicately in the new English subtitles as the babes. When Chu is accused of murder by a female fighter Nora Miao from the Palace of Magic Water he has to find out who has killed three clan leaders and sent out letters accusing him of the deeds. The investigation takes him to a number of different towns and puts him in conflict with several other factions. A mysterious killer in red stalks him killing off those who give him information. An enigmatic woman in purple known by three painted portraits of her also figures in the investigation as does a flashback telling us the fate of a Japanese ninja who'd come to China and his two children. A desert clan leader's daughter clad all in black first opposes Chu and then assists him.The plot gets very complicated but moves quickly and efficiently keeping close track of its large cast of fascinating characters all played by worthy Shaw Bros. players including Yueh Hua COME DRINK WITH ME Ku Feng THE HEROIC ONES Ling Yun SWIFT SWORD Tien Ching BOXER FROM SHANTUNG and several attractive actresses including Nora Miao FIST OF FURY Nancy Yen 7 GRANDMASTERS Li Ching KING EAGLE and the stunning Betty Pei Ti INTIMATE CONFESSIONS OF A Chinese COURTESAN as the manipulative icily beautiful Princess YinChi who recalls similar femme fatale characters played by Chan Ping in KILLER CLANS and Tien Ni in THE MAGIC BLADE.The energetic Ti Lung plays a hero more charming and goodhumored than the deadly lone swordsman he played in the more serious MAGIC BLADE. His character here is somewhat reminiscent of Hollywood secret agent Derek Flint played by James Coburn in OUR MAN FLINT 1966 who was equally a master of weapons a shrewd undercover investigator and served by three beautiful babes who also got captured by the villains at one point.There are fewer swordfights and more talk than usual for this kind of film which is fine with me given the intricate nature of the plot a sprawling puzzle in which important pieces are added with every scene. The fights are briefer than the spectacular setpieces in THE MAGIC BLADE although Ti Lung and Yueh Hua have a notable climactic kung fu bout. It's a magnificentlooking production staged on massive welllit Shaw Bros. interior sets with a great cast dressed in beautiful costumes and expertly photographed all in the service of a clever entertaining storyline.CLANS OF INTRIGUE should not be confused with SON OF WU TANG aka CLUTCH OF POWER 1977 whose alternate title is sometimes erroneously listed as CLANS OF INTRIGUE.ADDENDUM 10114 When I submitted this review back in 2003 the title on the page was indeed CLANS OF INTRIGUE. LEGEND OF THE BAT is a different Shaw Bros. film by the same crew from the same year. Why they changed the title on this page to Legend of the Bat is a mystery.".

Yueh Hua is excellent as a monk you meet early on who turns into the most interesting character in the film. Wish I could say more about him. And one of my absolute favorites Ku Feng shows up for a few sequences as well. The sets they use are just gorgeous especially near the end. Some GREAT surprises along the way.

	schema:headline " John Ford Never Met A Doctor He Didn't Like";
	schema:reviewBody "The fact that an idealistic medical doctor was the protagonist in Arrowsmith is the reason why John Ford must have been attracted to this story and agreed to film it for Sam Goldwyn.Allegedly it was not a happy collaboration. Two very individualistic men wanted to have their imprimatur on the film. They never worked together on a finished product again though Ford did start filming The Adventures of Marco Polo for Goldwyn and quit.I read the novel way back in the day when I was in high school and we only get the second half of it. There's a great deal in the book before Ronald Colman as Martin Arrowsmith goes to work for the Research Foundation and A.E. Anson as Max Gottlieb. You miss quite a lot of the character development of Arrowsmith.Of course the plot mostly centers on Colman and his other mentor Richard Bennett going to a Caribbean Island where there has been an outbreak of plague. Along for the trip is Helen Hayes who is Colman's wife Leora. Colman is there to test a new serum and he's under orders as a researcher to only administer the real stuff to half his patient and a placebo to the others as a control group. This is where the racism of the time kicks in as these human guinea pigs are black probably the descendants of runaway slaves. There is a black doctor named Marchand in the cast played by Oliver Brooks and it is a rarity among black performers at the time in that the role was hardly servile at all. Brooks seems to go along with the controlled experiment but he becomes one of many in the cast to meet a tragic end. With some of what came out about the Tuskegee experiments later on Arrowsmith may have been quite on target without knowing it. A harrowing thought.Colman and Hayes are an attractive pair of leads. Myrna Loy has a much abbreviated role in the film as a New York socialite that Colman meets down in the islands. In the book he has an affair with her and marries her later on. You won't see that here.Arrowsmith is a good film though I wish more of Lewis's story got into the final product. But it probably would have run for three hours and films just didn't do that back then.".

	schema:headline " Reasonably good acting but Sinclair Lewis should have sued";
	schema:reviewBody "Sinclair Lewis wrote ARROWSMITH in 1923 after the first two of his blockbuster novels that dissected American Society MAIN STREET and BABBITT. Lewis decided to make a complete study about the medical profession. As such it was brilliant  far more brilliant than this movie is. If one can think of the novel as what it is  an expose about what is wrong concerning the medical profession  the novel is a glass of fine champagne and this movie version is a glass of lemonade! Lewis takes us along the entire career of Martin Arrowsmith  through medical school through practice in a small town through his marriage to Leora Tozer through his going to the big city New York where he is connected to a large wellknown Foundation to his battling the plague and losing his wife and his coworker and his finally coming to terms with what he wants from his profession. For the key to the novel is that medicine is extremely lucrative but Martin is very idealistic. He does not seek riches but wants to help his fellow man.The problem as the film proceeds is that the people who run or control the profession or society for that matter can care less for the idealistic goal. For one reason or another they want results that are pragmatic or banal. For example one would think that the Foundation a swipe at the Rockefeller Foundation by the way would be really gung ho about an idealistic medical researcher. They certainly have the laboratories and talent for real progress. But they also have a strong desire for immediate results that can be used for propaganda purposes. So they keep pushing aside certain desires for private testing that Arrowsmith and his mentor Max Gottlieb A.E. Anson are requesting on the bubonic plague serum. The director of the foundation insists that Arrowsmith goes to a plague saturated island with his codiscoverer for immediate SUCCESSFUL results. This leads to massive tragedy in the novel and the film.This doesn't come across too clearly in the film. Instead it looks like Martin Colman would like more time to test but the emergency prevents it. This weakens the novel's criticism. And this is not the only example.When Martin starts out in the small town the local medical community has this idiot running it who knows squat about modern medicine but is great at selfadvertising. The man who looks like Theodore Roosevelt thinks that the height of local medical activity is running a health day parade. This too is not in the movie.The film in short shortchanges Lewis's wonderful novel. In fact more of the spirit of Lewis's attack can be found in the Robert Donat  Rosalind Russell  Ralph Richardson film THE CITADEL based on an A. J. Cronin expose novel. That's rough considering how important the critique by Lewis really was.The film's cast gives it their all particularly Helen Hayes still the young actress who won her first Oscar that same year for THE SIN OF MADELON CLAUDETTE Myrna Loy in a heavily cut role and Colman. John Ford's directing was somewhat mediocre in this film unlike later works of his. So I give it a 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Impossible to squeeze Sinclair Lewis' book into a two hour film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was actually nominated for four academy awards  cinematography art direction adapted screenplay and best picture. Viewing it today there are so many somewhat incomplete story lines and messages present I am somewhat unclear about the director's goal in all of this. Sinclair Lewis' book on which the film is based goes into great detail about the tribulations and triumphs of studying to be a doctor and then practicing medicine back in the 1920's. It is just impossible to convey all that goes on in the novel in one 108 minute film. First of all although young Dr. Arrowsmith comes across as an admirable protagonist who doesn't lose his idealism through all of his experiences his character development and motivations are just not fleshed out in the film and thus he is left an unintended mystery. His passion for medical research definitely shines through in Ronald Coleman's performance but I had many unanswered questions. The film seems to imply that Arrowsmith is attracted to Myrna Loy's character through one scene in particular in the film. Was this intentional? The two have an affair in the novel but if it is going to be omitted from the film  and it is  what was that one scene doing there? Arrowsmith talks a good game about loving his wife but he seems to constantly overlook her in his passion to find new cures for diseases. Is he actually taking her for granted or is this just a common attitude from the past in which wives always took a back seat to their husbands' careers? There is another whole part of the film that is quite troubling to a modern audience. When Arrowsmith is sent to the Caribbean to help fight the plague by testing his new serum he is instructed to basically do what today is called a double blind study. He is to inject half the patients with his serum and the other half he is to treat conventionally. Thus it can be determined whether or not the serum will be effective. When Arrowsmith presents his plan of action to the local plagueridden residents the shocked citizenry deny his help in the name of humanity. However a local black doctor Oliver Marchand tells Arrowsmith that he knows of how he can accomplish his goal  by experimenting on the black residents of the island of course! To me this was all too reminiscent of the Tuskegee experiments and had a large Ick Factor to it.I can't grade this film too severely since I have to take into account its year of production the fact that dialogue had not become that sophisticated yet since talking pictures had only been universally accepted for about two years and finally that a complex novel is being squeezed into just over an hour and a half. This film's value today is mainly as an example of one of the better transitional era talkies. Dialogue and acting were much more natural than they had been just a year or two prior to this film but vast improvements particularly in dialogue and technology were just a couple of years away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ronald Colman is dreadfully miscast and far too old. He is supposed to be in his early twenties. At least as a teenager starting college Ford had the good idea of showing only the back of his head throughout a long scene but the result is dreadful particularly as a middle aged voice is coming out of this first year student's invisible face. Gary Cooper who played opposite Helen Hayes the following year in Farewell to Arms would have saved this movie for me. I didn't believe Ronald Colman in many scenes. He seemed to be giving awkward readings of his lines. And the part where he is meant to be laughing in drunken despair is cringe worthy. The final shot just looks as if he is stepping up to his mark in the studio with no intention of going any further which is of course what he is doing but it really looks as if it is what he is doing. This is Ford as the sorcerer's apprentice making a frightful mess with his wands before he mastered the art of miraclemaking. The high points for me were those strong shots of Helen Hayes and a cane chair earlier with a cigarette and later an open door reminding me of the famous open door in The Searchers. But this clearly touched enough people in the Academy to be up for best picture of 1931. So a must for Oscar completest and a chance to see Helen Hayes in action during the early thirties. Also Myrna Loy quietly choosing sexy clothing in her bedroom is a visual feast. And it's always nice to see Ronald Colman even though he seems to have uncharacteristically failed to engage with his character for most of this rather clunky story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arrowsmith is the big box office winner and wellreviewed movie of 1931 that made the NBR's ten best of the year and one of the big hits that is top 20 of its year. An adaptation of that famous muckraker Sinclair Lewis at least it has made me curious to read the book upon which the movie is based at least to find out if the theme is as muddled as this movie's theme is. First of all what's there to like about this movie. The unstaginess and fluidity of the camera is almost ridiculous for a 1931 movie. In the early days of sound pictures through at least 1931 the camera did not move and most movies from back then feel extremely stagy. You ought to watch a big budget box office hit from the year before called Disraeli to ponder the nadir of such filmmaking. But the always reliable John Ford keeps the action flowing. The lack of studios sets and actual location filming especially in the boondocks is a nice change but Samuel Goldwyn was an independent producer not aligned with any studio. So this might explain that. Now the problem is the always charming and debonair Englishman Ronald Colman. For this fine actor and good line deliverer this is not his finest hour at the least especially a drunk to the point of going crazy scene which he just butchers and is a classic case of cringeworthy acting. The plot as it is appears to be pretty straightforward. Young doctor graduate meets girl falls in love moves to small town to work for the people. Later moves to big city good old New York where results and making the front page is a higher priority to serving science. But what exactly is wrong with the big hospitals with their corporate funding and what is the gain of being small as opposed to big is left unsatisfactorily explained. Instead we suffer through Hollywood melodrama as Helen Hayes suffers away as the good supportive wife who pays the ultimate price for her man and dedication. Ford direction is crisp as always especially a scene in the Caribbean Islands where he builds slow tension with exquisite lighting and framing as only John Ford can. the funny thing is I could see similarities btw the world of scientific research that is presented in this 30's movie and today's current health world we live in so it is not outdated. Just sloppily put together in a fashion that leaves one seeking clarity and resulting in lack of resonance with this viewer.".

	schema:headline " Ronald Colman and the age factor...";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of any other actor from the Golden Age of films who was miscast as many times as he was because of the age factor. So it was with RONALD COLMAN who was already forty by the time he played the idealistic young doctor of ARROWSMITH opposite stage star HELEN HAYES.To his credit he was still playing romantic leads in the '40s RANDOM HARVEST when he was in his fiftiesand somehow audiences accepted him regardless of what I call the age factor. Here in ARROWSMITH it's painfully obvious that he was not the best choice for this title role in a trimmed down version of a Sinclair Lewis novel.Surprisingly the screenplay is by Sidney Howard who had no trouble adapting Margaret Mitchell's lengthy GONE WITH THE WIND to the screen but here seems to be obligated to cut out huge sections of the book to get to the main plot line in a hurry. Possibly because films in 1931 did not run three hours and fortyfive minutes.Whatever the result is a disjointed screenplay that condenses the story in a way that makes motivations and events incoherent at times. Arrowsmith begins his practice as a rather clumsy country doctor in farm country who develops an interest in serum when a neighbor's cattle become infected. When his serum is a success the doctor and his young wife move to New York where he's to work at a big clinic.Soon he neglects his wife while he buries himself in his work to eradicate bacteria. When an outbreak of bubonic plague breaks outwell you can see where the plot is going.RONALD COLMAN is earnest and already quite distinguished looking as young Arrowsmith and HELEN HAYES suffers nobly as his neglected wife infected herself through a careless action by her doctor husband. And toward the end of the story we get a glimpse of the young and seductive MYRNA LOY in a role that is either underwritten or underwent extensive cuts. Cuts seem obvious in the abrupt ending too.Arrowsmith's experiments in the West Indies bring a conclusion to the story. But sad to say the film is a relic in almost every sense of the word. Hard to picture John Ford at the helm of this projecteven though there is a brief glimpse of Ward Bond one of his favorite players in an early scene.Summing up Nothing deep to say about medicine nor does it work as the story of a dedicated doctor who wants to save lives during an epidemic. And it's certainly not Ronald Colman at his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the film has not aged well Arrowsmith was well regarded when it was released and garnered four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Perhaps in those early days of sound competent use of the camera and decent recording equipment were regarded as high values that merited praise. However with the exception of some occasionally striking cinematography by Ray June this John Ford adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel is choppy unevenly acted and betrays its age.Later in the 1930's Sidney Howard adapted the sprawling historical novel Gone with the Wind into a fine screenplay that left viewers with the feeling that they had seen the entire book on screen. However his adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize Winning Arrowsmith omits the core message of the novel and rushes through events in the life of Dr. Martin Arrowsmith in brief vignettes that leave viewers confused. Characters appear and disappear decisions and moves are made without deliberation or motivation and Arrowsmith himself comes off as a shallow individual with little regard for either those he supposedly loves or those he supposedly has dedicated his life to saving.Ronald Colman is generally a fine actor and his idealism in Lost Horizon appeared genuine. However Colman's suggested idealistic behavior in Arrowsmith is not convincing despite a few effective scenes towards the end of the film. Helen Hayes has a few good scenes as the doctor's wife although Myrna Loy has little to do but look seductive which she does quite well.Unfortunately the scenes in the Caribbean seem demeaning to the characters and a local doctor's willingness to allow what is effectively experimentation on his fellow countrymen borders on the criminal. However these attitudes were considered the norm when the film was made and should be viewed in the context of the period. Although most films seem far too long Arrowsmith is much too short to convey the canvas that Lewis painted in his novel. Almost like a Clift Notes version of the book John Ford's Arrowsmith disappoints especially when the talent expended on its production is considered.".

The rest of the movie he's suave cool and completely vapid. Diametrically opposed to the Arrowsmith of the novel.Why Hollywood scenes like the fist fight were added to the script it was not in the book nor could it have been! baffles me. Also I admire the attempt at covering so much territory of a longish novel. But ultimately the movie fails and Sidney Howard would have been better off with a more tight focused and coherent script covering a smaller portion of the novel.There are many excellent scenes. Helen Hayes as Leora and Richard Bennett as Sondelius are often fantastic though it's too bad about the absurd Swedish accent that sounds mostly German and perhaps a little bit Russian.All in all I'd recommend this film only to anyone interested in the history of the cast and production staff or to anyone interested in seeing what I believe is the only silver screen rendition of one of the Nobel Prize winner's best novels...Otherwise don't bother.".

Unfortunately she only appears during the final 20 minutes in a few short scenes probably not worth the price of sitting through the first hour and 20 minutes of this very boring dated film. We do get to see Myrna in a very flimsy nightgown for a few seconds though. It's left open whether anything physical happened between her and the good doctor played by Ronald Colman. The suggestive scenes between them are the film's best.The film plays now as one of those standard B melodramas of the 30s. Reality is sacrificed to create dramatic tension such as Ronald Coleman a dedicated researcher who smokes while conducting the most delicate of experiments carrying around bubonic plague in test tubes closed by pieces of cotton at one end of course one of the cotton swabs becomes loose causing plague to drip on a cigarette Colman had been smoking moments before and of course it is his wife who days later picks up the cigarette and starts smoking it causing her to get plague coincidences coincidences. The movies suffers throughout from such preposterous plot devices. Overall it's not exactly clear what the movie is about what message the muddled script wants to convey. It ultimately seems to be against scientific research funded by big money looking for big profit and publicity but this is not developed well at all.Actingwise Colman is adequate but with his aristocratic mannerisms and speech miscast as a modest scientific researcher he is not very convincing. Helen Hayes looking a bit like Claudette Colbert's twin in the movie is unbelievably annoying. This probably has less to do with the actress than with her character an extremely conventional devoted wife who as she says has no life outside her husband causing her to obsess over his every move.Overall this is a very boring movie and quite a disappointment. While it may have said something to audiences in 1931 it says nothing to us today. I give it 510.".

I am by no means an expert on classic films but I must say that I really disagreed with this film.The Sinclair Lewis novel is way better than this film. Screenwriter Sidney Howard seems to have read the Cliff's Notes version of the book. He smashes the first 13 chapters or so into maybe 20 minutes. Most of the information in the novel is lost here and I assume that the scenes would be a series of nonsequiturs for those who hadn't read the novel.However the section detailing Martin's discovery of the X Principle though probably not called this in the film it is the bacteriophage is decently done. I think that the utter chaos in Martin's life is portrayed as effectively as the miscast Ronald Colman way too old to play the part of a young doctor possibly could.Overall I think that the film would be decent barring background information of the novel. The film however has an entirely different message than the original work.".

I am by no means an expert on classic films but I must say that I really disagreed with this film.The Sinclair Lewis novel is way better than this film. Screenwriter Sidney Howard seems to have read the Cliff's Notes version of the book. He smashes the first 13 chapters or so into maybe 20 minutes. Most of the information in the novel is lost here and I assume that the scenes would be a series of nonsequiturs for those who hadn't read the novel.However the section detailing Martin's discovery of the X Principle though probably not called this in the film it is the bacteriophage is decently done. I think that the utter chaos in Martin's life is portrayed as effectively as the miscast Ronald Colman way too old to play the part of a young doctor possibly could.Overall I think that the film would be decent barring background information of the novel. The film however has an entirely different message than the original work.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even though only around a third of John Ford's pictures are westerns it's still undeniable that his forte or if you prefer his comfort zone was in historical pictures of some sort. Arrowsmith is unusual in that it is a contemporary drama that Ford both directed and coproduced.In spite of the above you might think this was indeed a western from the opening scene in which we see an ancestor of the protagonist as a good ol' covered wagon pioneer. This bit of family history is not brought up again but it was obviously judged by Ford and Sam Goldwyn to be significant enough to open the film with even though it would have been one of the most expensive scenes of the shoot unless that opening shot is lifted from somewhere else which it may well be. The point seems to be to draw a line between the struggles of the pioneers and the main story of a medical scientist torn between his home life and his career. It seems a rather tenuous comparison.On the other hand there could be parallels between Dr Arrowsmith and a typical Fordian westerner. Not in the character as written  I'm no auteur theorist  but in the way Ford shoots their environments. In the majority of Ford films he exaggerates the smallness of interiors and the vastness of exteriors. The homestead is safe yet dull and the great outdoors is exciting yet dangerous. The village where Arrowsmith practices as a country doctor is shot in much the same way as Ford would a western settlement  cramped interiors foreground clutter and heavy use of framing. However the medical research centre while it may be another interior is shot so as to show off its openness and stark cleanliness with corridors and waiting rooms so vast they look almost surreal. This is Arrowsmith's wild west where he is free to be a pioneer of another sort. Another tenuous comparison? Maybe but remember directors have many choices of how to shoot a place regardless of the script or the set design and these choices will reflect how they view that space and what they feel it means to the story.While Ford's use of space developed incredibly early on the camera movement at this stage is not yet of the invisible camera technique that later became his standard. For those that don't know invisible camera means you only move the camera when it's following an action say for example a character walking to the other end of the room. If everyone in the scene is sitting still the camera sits still. If it's done properly the audience doesn't notice the camera movement hence invisible camera. And yet here there is rather a lot of obtrusive camera movement. This is pretty much in line with the general style of the time in spite of the myth that cameras were immobilised in the early sound era. Despite a few teething problems that were mostly solved by the end of 1929 cameras of the early talkies zipped around just as giddily of those of the late silents.Ford is not known to have given his actors much coaching nor allow them rehearsals or repeated takes to hone their performance. For this reason the acting in his pictures tends to be only as good as the raw talent of the performers. Ronald Coleman and Helen Hayes were both good dramatic actors and here they give good  but not outstanding  dramatic performances. Richard Bennett however just gives a fairly standard slightly comical supportingplayer performance as Sondelius and the part should either have been cast differently or he should have been prompted to play it with more conviction.The story goes that the harddrinking Ford was contracted by Goldwyn to remain teetotal until the production wrapped. Apparently Ford eager to get back to the bottle rushed the shooting even more than usual tearing pages out of the script wherever he could get away with it. Whether this is true or just another bit of Ford mythology it certainly makes sense. In particular the love story crucial to the picture's impact is massively underdeveloped. Downplaying the romantic angle is actually very typical of Ford but even the usual Fordian semiimprovised comedy diversions are absent  with the exception of a couple of nice gags in a scene where a boy has his tooth pulled and an almost surreal moment where a comedy drunk inexplicably wanders on and off the set. The resultant picture is full of great moments but overall seems a little undernourished. Arrowsmith could have been an intense and poignant drama but Ford was the wrong man for the job.".

	schema:headline " Why the Movie Is Better Than the Novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is actually more about the novel on which this movie is based than on the movie itself. Normally that is not the way to review a movie. However the movie is better than the novel because there is an absurd event that is described in the novel that the movie wisely or perhaps fortuitously left out. For better or worse I will discuss that event.In the novel Martin Arrowsmith becomes engaged to a woman named Madeleine. During the summer Martin goes Canada where he meet a nurse named Leora proposes to her and she accepts. But Martin is still not sure which woman he wants to marry. So he invites both of them to have lunch with him and when they arrive he announces that he is engaged to both of them and he will let them decide whom he will marry. Madeleine leaves in a huff but Leora stays and cinches the engagement.When I reached this point in the novel I threw it aside in disgust. It was one of the stupidest things I had ever read especially in a wellknown novel by an otherwise good author. I had no interest in reading a novel about a man who is that ridiculous. I would say the same about Leora since any selfrespecting woman would do what Madeleine did which is to get up and leave. But some women are just desperate to get married and that might explain her willingness to marry Martin the lunch date notwithstanding. It was the better part of a year before I could bring myself to finish the novel.Years later the movie turned up on television and I remember wondering to myself how the movie was going to handle this business with the two women. I was pleased to see that the Madeleine character was not in the movie thereby eliminating the scene that caused me to despise the novel. As for the rest of the story Martin is interested in medical research. In testing a new medicine the standard procedure is to have a control group that gets a placebo to compare with the group that gets the experimental medicine. That way the researchers can tell whether the medicine makes a difference and whether there are side effects. This is especially emphasized in the novel where the students are portrayed as being obsessed with controls.When the bubonic plague hits the West Indies Martin decides to go there and try out his new serum. This requires the use of a control group. But if the serum is effective this will mean that most of those in the control group will die on account of having only received a placebo. He ends up giving the serum to everyone. Martin's humanity triumphs over his desire to establish the efficacy of the serum.As the movie came to an end I suddenly realized the point of the lunch date with two fiances. Madeleine was essentially acting as a control for Leora. By comparing Madeleine's reaction with Leora's Martin was able to assess Leora's love for him by contrasting it with Madeleine's. The idea was to show just how obsessed Martin was with the need for controls that he would even try to apply it to love and marriage.That may have been the idea but it is still absurd. And it is unnecessary. A man will typically have enough experience with women in general to be able to decide whether he should marry one woman in particular. Every woman he has ever dated is a control or sorts. Likewise a woman will have had enough experience with men to know that if a man she is engaged to turns out to also be engaged to someone else she should run not walk to the nearest exit.It may be that Sidney Howard the man who wrote the screenplay left Madeleine out of the movie for the simple reason that most movie versions leave stuff out that was in the novel. But I like to believe that Howard thought the lunch date with the two fiances was as preposterous as I did and he mercifully gave it the ax.".

For one thing it was made when Prohibition was still in force and portrays the drinking culture of the time Arrowsmith promising to take Sondelius someplace they can get a real beer the quite openly operating speakeasies revealingly. It was preCode too and the striking dialogless scene in which Arrowsmith married returns to his room while Myrna Loy's character is obviously preparing to receive him next door is quite sophisticated for Hollywood. Most impressive are the angular compositions and starkly lit offkilter shots with which Ford fills the Caribbean section of the movie. This was the period when Ford was absorbing lessons from German expressionist cinema culminating a few years later with The Informer and they help create the proper woozy atmosphere for an island in the grip of the plague. Even the truncated script helps in a sense lending the film a narrative unpredictability that leavens the rather sanctimonious story about an idealistic doctor sorting out his values. When Arrowsmith starts to lose control late in the film we're just a few steps away from Dr. Frankenstein in his mountaintop labwhich would greet moviegoers just a short time after Arrowsmith premiered.".

This is his magic and his curse. This is why i have a shelter in his films and why so many increasingly misunderstand them first reviews on this one show it will go to the same package. Wenders knows this whenever he is making a film he is reflecting on the nature of image and how that affects vision and how vision affects understanding and how understanding affects meaning and essence.Not few times he addresses directly the theme and embeds it in the plot of the film. This is such a case. Film about images. People who are about image. People who become the images they fetch. The very first scene makes it clear. It frames how meaningful this word is with Wenders a landscape through a window of a building which is in itself all about framing. A pure volume full of square holes all of them corresponding to a different frame depending on moment you look position distance to the window. This building reflects the personality of the photographer it is in itself a succession of frames a closed capsule interlaced with partial views to the outside.Than we have a story about creating images. A character photographer who loses his soul because he becomes a faker he forgets the essence he no longer searches for a truth in the image instead he creates his own fake truth. Fake Australian skies reflected on S.Paulo's windows that kind of stuff. The introduction of Milla stands for this as she is photographed 'artificially' and than transported to the true environment. Than the photographer retires isolated to a place he feels to be 'true' a big port Palermo means.Now the big things happen in Palermo.The woman. Her work is to recover images it is to find the truth of images it is to interpret the vision of somebody else. Those eyes of the painter starring at the camera what he was seeing is what she wants to see. Check the oppositions check how that fresco is worked on the film detail versus global sight understanding versus loosing the essence long versus short. Check how the time of an image is understood. The woman takes years working on one image the photographer produces thousands without understanding a single one.The Death. It's not the death it's Dennis Hopper and this matters. To see how Hopper was inserted in this project made the whole thing come clear to me and it completed a portion of my film life that i now know was incomplete. Hopper is here the designated master framer the man who observes life who pulls strings even though he is only doing his job. He is a superior agent someone who is beyond and above all that we see. When people look at him he looks back. He makes the record of all that we see that that metaphor of arrows of shooting with a double meaning. So he is framed as much as he is a framer. Now remember The American Friend. See that film before seeing this one if you can it may strike you as 2 halves of the same idea as it stroke me. Check how similar are the characters Hopper performs. There he was also the master framer the manipulator behind the actions that we had. In fact he was manipulating a framer literaly a man who created frames for paintings. He used the framer as he provided the main image. That film which i consider essential was all about the same game of images. Now we have an update on how times changed and with it changed deeply our relation to images and how Wenders himself changed. Dennis Hopper is the connection and his role is pivotal.Now i believe that if you want to establish a successful relation to a creator you have to take his works for what they are. It's like loving beyond infatuation like friendship beyond day to day chat. You have to enjoy the qualities and most important acknowledge the flaws and you have to live with that. That's my kind of relation with Wenders. His films in the last 10 years or so have become more and more on the verge of being an intellectual monologue something you are supposed to sit and listen and nod affirmatively with you head. That's something i won't tolerate with other filmmakers Stone Tarantino but that i'm willing to put up with Wenders because it matters to me what he has to say. If like i did you are able to put up with discursive dialogs and the sensation that the man beyond the scenes is leading you to believe that he has the Truth you may let this change your life. I did.A side quality you might appreciate is how music shapes the environment regardless of the scenery. Wenders was also great in understanding this now he does it with the aid of portable music. The music editing is greatMy opinion 55httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " Wenders is on the pulse Palermo strikes a high note";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched the film in Cannes with anticipation and great 'trepidation' at the same time given the director's previous flop but came out nicely surprised as did other people that I had the opportunity to exchange views with afterwards. There was an obvious feeling that Wenders has delivered us a very special film and one that is predominantly visionary in every way. But of course this is not the opinion of many who have been for a while unforgiving of Wenders and are still waiting for the next Wings of Desire...well folks that 'aint gonna happen' simply because Wenders is one of those rare directors that never looks back. Maybe someone would care to notice that Palermo Shooting is probably Wenders' most personal and cathartic work since Kings of The Road and that the portrayal of a slightly impassive well known photographer just as in the mentioned classic who has come to a crossroads in is life falls beyond just being a coincidence or a gimmick but it is deliberate and mirrors more often than not Wenders himself. In Palermo we feel to our bones the confusion and loneliness that Campino for whom Wenders wrote this scriptexperiences through the powerful and beautifully composed shots and music that follow him as he comes to grip with Palermo and his own ghosts. Wenders presents us with incredibly varied and well chosen music and introduces the very 'of the moment' use of the ipod to deliver the tracks to coincide with the central character own moves. This concept on its own is not just a clever device but a subtle social comment at which Wender's has always been good. It says an awful lot about modern man at the cutting edge enjoying a successful professional life surrounded by every possible gadget which help him and control him at the same time. All the props that define Campino's character are desirable from the 360 degree rotating camera to the beautiful classic car. So even the way he wanders through Palermo's old streets make the film ultra modern and breathtaking. Here Wenders is in top form in the composition of his scenes and juxtaposition of cultures and ideas.One of my favourite scenes in the film is when the photographer walks into a derelict old theatre following some screaming voices. After walking through the empty corridors he arrives at the source of the screams a heated play is being rehearsed and a man appears to be shouting to a chair that he holds at face level. The lines being shouted are not subtitled for stronger effect and Campino takes a sit on a back bench and just soaks inas does the audience the entire scene the derelict theatre semi open to the elements the passionate play that he cannot understand and it is so alien to his controlled self and culture....unable to tare himself away he stays until he falls asleep. The entire film is full of subtle and poignant moments and the cohesive and straight story is blended to great effect with the surreal and supernatural. The use of special effect is unprecedented in Wenders' work and here he achieves a very different type of film with the help of these permeating the psyche of his lead and pushing him into further confusion to the point were he cannot tell the difference between dream and reality and were the surreal takes centre stage as the film reaches it's climax. Which points at the sheer metaphor that life is. How often do we find ourselves in situations which seem surreal and that go beyond 'coincidence'? I for one could tell a few. The story of a self centred and successful man who after having had a near death experiencegoes through a live changing crisis is is indeed not new and has been tackled successfully before BUT Wenders goes a step forward and in a originaland comic too way makes his character and DEATH played to perfection by a wise old Dennis Hopperconfront each other once more keeping his lead and us always on the edges of reality in a way that is reminiscent of Wings of Desire indeed. He also blatantly turns death into a 'good guy' who is there to advise as much as to scare...two concepts that are just a thread apart. Death makes the photographer question his intentions even down to the presumptuous use of his camera. So when the man says you shot me! referring to a moment when Death shoots at him with a bow and arrow from a balcony in Palermo where the photographer is taking pictures Death answers you shot me first! no one takes a picture of me! Death's speech to the mortal is as relevant here as that which Wenders gave us in Kings of the Road from a frustrated son to an ageing and regretful father inside the newspaper printing workshop. I won't deny that I would've liked the film to end not too long after this point and that I felt that we didn't really need to know about the female character's own ghosts. It could've been a leaner picture with a neater ending without this. I 'd also mention that the beginning dragged a little as Campino's trendy life in Dsseldorf is presented to us a bit too long. These are a bit annoying but can be forgiven of Wim Wenders as nevertheless he has given us a striking original and beautiful film.and he proves himself a true visionary once more. In time I'm sure this will become another one of his classics. With Palermo Wenders is as usual on the pulse of things he has always been a very different type of storyteller who can say as much with a few words than without and here he achieves both beautifully. The fabulous and original use of music combined with astonishing cinematography and pace takes us on a remarkable 'voyage'. Thank you Mr. Wenders".

But of course this is not the opinion of many who have been for a while unforgiving of Wenders and are still waiting for the next Wings of Desire...well folks that 'aint gonna happen' simply because Wenders is one of those rare directors that never looks back. Maybe someone would care to notice that Palermo Shooting is probably Wenders' most personal and cathartic work since Kings of The Road and that the portrayal of a slightly impassive well known photographer just as in the mentioned classic who has come to a crossroads in is life falls beyond just being a coincidence or a gimmick but it is deliberate and mirrors more often than not Wenders himself. In Palermo we feel to our bones the confusion and loneliness that Campino for whom Wenders wrote this scriptexperiences through the powerful and beautifully composed shots and music that follow him as he comes to grip with Palermo and his own ghosts. Wenders presents us with incredibly varied and well chosen music and introduces the very 'of the moment' use of the ipod to deliver the tracks to coincide with the central character own moves. This concept on its own is not just a clever device but a subtle social comment at which Wender's has always been good. It says an awful lot about modern man at the cutting edge enjoying a successful professional life surrounded by every possible gadget which help him and control him at the same time. All the props that define Campino's character are desirable from the 360 degree rotating camera to the beautiful classic car. So even the way he wanders through Palermo's old streets make the film ultra modern and breathtaking. Here Wenders is in top form in the composition of his scenes and juxtaposition of cultures and ideas.One of my favourite scenes in the film is when the photographer walks into a derelict old theatre following some screaming voices. After walking through the empty corridors he arrives at the source of the screams a heated play is being rehearsed and a man appears to be shouting to a chair that he holds at face level. The lines being shouted are not subtitled for stronger effect and Campino takes a sit on a back bench and just soaks inas does the audience the entire scene the derelict theatre semi open to the elements the passionate play that he cannot understand and it is so alien to his controlled self and culture....unable to tare himself away he stays until he falls asleep. The entire film is full of subtle and poignant moments and the cohesive and straight story is blended to great effect with the surreal and supernatural. The use of special effect is unprecedented in Wenders' work and here he achieves a very different type of film with the help of these permeating the psyche of his lead and pushing him into further confusion to the point were he cannot tell the difference between dream and reality and were the surreal takes centre stage as the film reaches it's climax. Which points at the sheer metaphor that life is. How often do we find ourselves in situations which seem surreal and that go beyond 'coincidence'? I for one could tell a few. The story of a self centred and successful man who after having had a near death experiencegoes through a live changing crisis is is indeed not new and has been tackled successfully before BUT Wenders goes a step forward and in a originaland comic too way makes his character and DEATH played to perfection by a wise old Dennis Hopperconfront each other once more keeping his lead and us always on the edges of reality in a way that is reminiscent of Wings of Desire indeed. He also blatantly turns death into a 'good guy' who is there to advise as much as to scare...two concepts that are just a thread apart. Death makes the photographer question his intentions even down to the presumptuous use of his camera. So when the man says you shot me! referring to a moment when Death shoots at him with a bow and arrow from a balcony in Palermo where the photographer is taking pictures Death answers you shot me first! no one takes a picture of me! Death's speech to the mortal is as relevant here as that which Wenders gave us in Kings of the Road from a frustrated son to an ageing and regretful father inside the newspaper printing workshop. I won't deny that I would've liked the film to end not too long after this point and that I felt that we didn't really need to know about the female character's own ghosts. It could've been a leaner picture with a neater ending without this. I 'd also mention that the beginning dragged a little as Campino's trendy life in Dsseldorf is presented to us a bit too long. These are a bit annoying but can be forgiven of Wim Wenders as nevertheless he has given us a striking original and beautiful film.and he proves himself a true visionary once more. In time I'm sure this will become another one of his classics. With Palermo Wenders is as usual on the pulse of things he has always been a very different type of storyteller who can say as much with a few words than without and here he achieves both beautifully. The fabulous and original use of music combined with astonishing cinematography and pace takes us on a remarkable 'voyage'. Thank you Mr. Wenders";

One that is close to his heart is a shoot with a pregnant Milla Jovovich. As far as the work goes he is not satisfied and neither is the actress. He suggests a change of locales. While examining some portfolio he decides to finish the work in Palermo Sicily.Just before leaving Finn has an unnerving experience. One night driving his convertible listening to a loud soundtrack he almost collides with another car driven by a mysterious figure he does not quite get to see. Finn seems to be a man searching for more than what he now possesses. In spite of his fame he is not a fulfilled man. One day Finn who has climbed a tree that overlooks a placid meadow near the Rhine meets another mysterious man dressed in a plastic raincoat who is tending to a flock of sheep. After the shoot with Milla Jovovich is over Finn decides to stay in Palermom for a while. The end result of his work is excellent although for the finished product showing a nude Milla he could have done it in his home base in Germany. The city has an intriguing allure to Finn. While admiring the area of the Quattro Canti he falls asleep by the side of one of the buildings he has been admiring. He is awakened by the mysterious hooded figure who is wielding a bow and arrow aiming at him. He feels wounded but there is no sign of having been hit at all.Walking through the old streets of Palermo taking pictures with his camera Finn discovers a museum. The door is open and he takes a chance going in. The only people in the place are two women that are restoring a giant painting from an obscure Sicilian artist. Flavia who comes down to talk to Finn tells him about the picture. In the center there is an animallike figure that represents death. He is surprised to see a couple of clerics that appear to be dead stabbed by arrows. Through his walks in the city Finn comes face to face with death symbols that in a way give him an uneasy feeling. Flavia shows a reluctance to getting involved with Finn but he wants to continue seeing her. She takes him to the port giving him a chance to see the magnificent views of Palermo. Finn takes picture with his prized camera. While photographing an interesting angle he discovers a figure aiming at him. Trying to avoid the arrow Finn breaks the camera and falls in the water.As a surprise Flavia decides to take Finn to her late grandmother's home in a hill town. The old house has a mystery about it that plays into the surreal antique setting. One night Finn is awakened by a noise. He steps into the old library where he is chased by a man bathed in a white light that makes him appear as a ghost. Finn comes face to face with the man who proclaims he is death. The ghostlike figure points out to Finn's brush with death. It all makes sense to him. Figuring he is about to die he has yet another surprise coming to him.Wim Wender's Palermo Shooting was shown recently on a cable channel. The film does not seem to have been commercially released in the United States but seen in festivals. It is a shame because although the director is not aiming for a broad audience it pays off for serious fans of his work. Mr. Wenders work in this film is almost a continuation of some of his past work more to the point Wings of Desire. The film is dedicated to two influential masters in Mr. Wender's life Michelangelo Antonioni and Igmar Bergman. One can see how Blowup might have impressed him. Campino appearing as Finn does an amazing job for the director. Dennis Hopper gets reunited with Mr. Wenders in a small but pivotal role. The gorgeous Giovanna Mezzogiorno is perfect as Flavia. There are some familiar faces in the film doing cameos for the director notably Lou Reed and Milla Jovovich. The film owes a lot to the editing of two men Oli Weiss and Peter Przygodda. The cinematography by Franz Lustig captures images that add the aura of mystery and suspense. The musical score by Irmin Schmidt blends well with the popular songs being played. Although most people thought this film to be flawed and pretentious it will be enjoyed by fans of Wim Wenders.".

	schema:reviewBody "So let's sum up what this movie is about a guy that has a failed lifeit isn't really shown how his life is out of place they could at least made him a crack addict that is not in touch with the world around him and goes to a small but charming...not Italian town and finds love good food old painting...and the meaning of life.So what can I say? Did I enjoy it? No. Will you enjoy it? Only if you have not seen more than 2 films in your life one being The Princess Bride and the other being Space Jam. If so the film will strike you with it's dark images and themes and will leave you magnified by it's depth. Palermo Shooting was a real disaster for me so it's hard to chose where to start. The acting was pretty bad. Dennis Hopper was too lame in it. Let's not forget that this was the role that predated his performance in An American Carol so this is not exactly rock bottom. Mr. Campino when I first heard his name I thought he was an Italian designer but now that I know that he is fronting a famous German rock band I know that he is really hip reminds me of Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone but with cool tattoos and a nice camera. Milla Jovovich wanted to mix with THE art crowd so she decided to come and show her magnificent belly. The others just are not worth mentioning. The story was clich. It is a mix of The Seventh Seal the Disney adaptation of A Christmas Carol and maybe something wiered like Eternal Sunshine... in the visualsmostly the dream sequences. I watched it in a cinema and it was loud. When the film reached the point when the photographer meets the girl and she says she understands him I thought the movie will turn in to a Indiana Jones type of story and she will go on and tell him about the secret Palermo treasure guarded by the death. Such a shame it did not turn that way... The music is out of place and I must admit there are some hip tunes but they are not at all in tone with the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a Wim Wenders film. It is either going to be brilliant or a complete joke. You have to go. This was the first thing I heard about the film Palermo Shooting and seeing how Matt Noller was usually right about his critiques of film I decided to go.Not a full minute into the film Matt and I simultaneously look at each other under the glow of the screen in the Grand Lumiere Theater and say unanimously Uhoh. To say that watching the film was an excruciating experience would be an understatement of its atrocities. Normally when someone offends me deeply I write a letter to try to sort out exactly what went wrong.Here is my open letter to the film Palermo Shooting entitled You Stole Two Hours of My Life and I Would Like Them Back Please! Dear Palermo Shooting Why are you here in Cannes this year? You seemed so terribly out of place last night. This really really wasn't your year. In fact I'm kind of offended that you showed up. I am wondering if you were embarrassed by yourself last night because you should be. You were acting ridiculous and in the Grand Lumiere Theater and everything! I felt bad for you really I did. Sometimes when you were being particularly annoying I tried to close my eyes and fall asleep just to avoid secondhand embarrassment. But then your loud bludgeoning German voice wouldn't allow for that. So thanks for starters.But let's talk about this. I mean I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose. It was a satire right? Right? You know like a joke? Like Oh here's another film about the meaning of life and seizing the day and don't waste time aren't I funny and witty ha ha? Right? You didn't honestly believe you were being original with all that death is just the absence of love junk did you? You did.Well in that case I feel even worse for you. Most of the movie I felt like I was trapped in a living Myspace page complete with melancholy music out of kilter stares and a tattooclad German man that I never once cared about. OK almost once but then the whirring violin music made me think of a bad Italian soap opera and I forgot to care.In fact that music made me feel the opposite of compassion. There were times when I really hoped that hooded figure you know the one that shoots invisible arrows from the future would kill that guy Finn and the movie would be over just so I didn't have to hear any more music.Now I do have a few questions for you just for my own peace of mind. Did that scene in Death's Library the one between Finn and Frank AKA Death did that really happen? Or did I make that up? I am hoping that it was a figment of my sick imagination my own selfish masochistic ways that wanted the movie to be even worse than it already was. In all of the terrible scenes in all of the terrible movies this one takes the cake. Not only was the dialog completely laughable Finn Not now! I love my life! Frank It didn't look that way to me. And I looked very carefully. Finn Maybe I was too busy! Frank No that's not it. You did not honor life Finn Gilbert! but the lighting the scenery the costumes everything in this scene was terrible. Dennis Hopper has definitely run out of options if he agreed unforced and nondrugged to do that scene.You did give us something though. You did give us a fun game to play after the film a game called Would You Rather consisting of all the things we would rather do besides watching your movie ever again. It went a little something like this Would you rather watch an entire season of Dharma and Greg or watch Palermo Shooting? While the choice was always easy it gave us a break from repeating that was just so bad! over and over. You provided us hours of entertainment for after the movie which I'm not sure was the point.The only way your movie could have been worse was if Keanu Reeves had been the lead role. Actually Keanu might have made it better! It is too hard to say at this point. Which is to say that movie was really awful. So I've been a little harsh I'm sorry. But you should be sorry too. Your movie took the spot of some other director's film that could have had its big break at Cannes. The script the production the financing the editing it all had to go through so many people that I'm not sure exactly how this film got made. Just think of all of the people that looked at this and said Yes! Let's do it! It's disturbing. However it happened it was a waste. For a movie that was so blatant about not wasting life you sure wasted everyone's time and money.Maybe take your own mantra of death is just the absence of love and realize that you should spend more time living yourself and less time making movies. Not only would your life be better but ours would too.Such is life I suppose Morgan".

	schema:headline " A beautiful and brutal film";
	schema:reviewBody "Joan Chen who has had a modest career as an actress in American films and TV makes her directorial debut here in this brutal poignant and beautiful Mandarin language film. Starring Lu Lu as Xiu Xiu a teenaged girl from the city sent to the country during Mao's cultural revolution and Lopsang as Lao Jin a castrated Tibetan nomad who is to teach her horse husbandry Tian yu is not so much an indictment of communist China as it is an indictment of human nature. Xiu Xiu is brutalized by smallminded bureaucratic males as has happened throughout human history be they communist or feudal her innocence and youth traded for an apple her buoyant hope for life dashed by blind political and economic forces and her selfrespect stolen from her by the twisted logic of rape and lust.What elevates this story above what we have seen many times before is the striking beauty of the Tibetan countryside and the fine characterizations of both Xiu Xiu and Lao Jin. Lao Jin is a gelding made fun of by others a man of quiet disposition who falls in love with his beautiful young charge but stands aside because of his impotence. Xiu Xiu has an imperial nature natural to favored girls everywhere be they Japanese princesses or American valley girls a nature very well depicted by the script and very well acted out by Lu Lu whose delicate beauty and spicy temperament clash well with Lao Jin's Taoist stoicism. At one point he remarks wisely that every place is the same meaning of course that it is what we bring to the place that really matters. But his wisdom is completely lost on the teenaged girl who wants and needs society and all that it has to offer. And so the underlying love affair between the two can never be...except...as it is in the end.Lopsang's performance is entirely convincing and Lu Lu is fascinating to watch. Joan Chen did a fine job with both of them while managing to keep politics and political agendas in the background. She concentrated on the human tragedy and made it universal. Both of her central characters had flaws that in some way led to the great sadness that they experienced and yet they were not to blame. In this naturalistic expression we are reminded of the tragedies of novelists Thomas Hardy and Theodore Dreiser and of course Chen was influenced by the work of Chinese director Zhang Yimou in particular his sad but captivating Raise the Red Lantern 1991 in which a beautiful girl is consumed and brutalized by societal forces of a different nature.This film misses being a masterpiece because of a hurried resolution leading to an ending that needed a bit more shaping. Nonetheless this is an arresting and compelling drama beautifully filmed and sensitively directed.But be forewarned. Celestial Bath is a disturbing film not easily shaken from the mind.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Joan Chen has fashioned a lovely slowmoving film Xiu Xiu  the Sent Down Girl about the abuses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution seen through the eyes of one girl Xiu Xiu.  Yet the film is more than a tale about the misguided totalitarian state and its pervasive influence on everyone's lives.  Xiu Xiu is also about a special relationship between the girl and her mentor and protector Jao Lin.  It would be an oversimplification to call it a love story because the film only hints at any romance between the two Xiu Xiu spends much of the film in contempt of Jao.  Indeed their contrasting lives could not be more pronounced.  Jao Lin is a horse herder a man of the soil one who cleans himself when it rains and a victim of a castration leaving him without his manhood.  The much younger girl Xiu Xiu is from the modern city doing her duty until she can return to her loving family and to a boy who yearns for her she with the soft innocent smile and the daintiness to appreciate a kaleidoscope or a freshly dug waterhole.  They must live together in one tent for six months because headquarters' has mandated that Xiu Xiu learn horse herding.  While adapting to each other's needs Xiu Xiu seems to have the upper hand on Lao she bosses him around like a hired hand but there is a strange intuitive feeling between them that is really not appreciated until the very last scene.  As the story develops six months have passed and Xiu Xiu still cannot return home because her family is too poor to bribe officials to take her back.  At the heart of this film is the evil that those in power do to those who are too weak to fight them.  Men from headquarters' regularly have sex with Xiu Xiu sometimes with the frustrated Lao in the same tent since Xiu Xiu mistakenly assumes these men will help her get back home.  All Lao can do is watch because even as he tries to protect Xiu Xiu in other ways he is powerless to stop what is going on.  What develops slowly but surely is another side of Lao besides the father figure  he becomes a man who can touch but cannot possess what he wants.  The latter is made clear when Lao steals Xiu Xiu's shoe and then lies to her that a man has come to steal her shoe so that he can return later to tell her of his love.  Xiu Xiu  the Sent Down Girl succeeds in giving us a poignancy about innocence lost and about the deep meaning of sacrifice and love.".

He does his best to make her life easier in a place that she hates and his pain and frustration mount as he sees how she is destroying herself.  His deep sincere and inarticulate caring for her touched me profoundly.  I wished that a romantic love could develop between them and I am not generally into movie romances  very few of them really work for me but that was out of the question from the beginning since Lao Jin was castrated.  That very fact gave their relationship a sense of tragedy from the beginning.I would love to see more of this Tibetan actor Lobsang.  Imdb info shows this movie as his only film credit.The locale was spectacular and gorgeously photographed. Only intellectually could I understand Xiu Xiu's dislike of such a gorgeous place as well as her lack of appreciation for Lao Jin's caring for her.  But both characters were very believable and involving and this sad movie will stay with me for a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Xiu Xiu the Sent Down Girl is probably a lot like you might expect. We in America only really get to see one or two types of Chinese films. This film is a lot like Zhang Yimou's films like To Live Du Jou and Raise the Red Lantern. Zhang could easily have directed this tragic film. But that's not a reason to criticize it. It is quite a great film. It starts off very slowly but by the time Xiu Xiu moves in with the horse breeder Lao Jin the film becomes great. Their relationship is the heart of the film and it is difficult to find two better performances than those of Lu Lu and Lopsang. Xiu Xiu has been sent to study horse breeding. At first she is nervous about living with a strange man. He was castrated when he was younger she is told. Lao Jin develops strong feelings for Xiu Xiu as well as she does for him but there isn't much they can do about it. Eventually a young man comes around and tells Xiu Xiu he has influence to get her back home. She had come there with a bunch of other young girls and boys with an internshiptype program. It failed and everyone else went home months ago. In exchange for his help Xiu Xiu gives him sex. He leaves and in a couple of weeks another man shows up at the tent looking for sex. Lao Jin can do nothing but watch helplessly.The film is very tense and moving. My main problem besides the slowness of the beginning is that the final sequence is perhaps too melodramatic.SPOILERS The prevaling undercurrent of the film is the love story between Lao Jin and Xiu Xiu. Of course since nothing can happen it is impossible. His pain comes from the fact that Xiu Xiu is destroying her own honor. He wants so badly to protect that. There is another undercurrent that should be there but I never felt I wish Lao Jin felt angrier at the fact that Xiu Xiu would rather degrade herself and eventually die than live out her life with him as a horse breeder. I wish he would have objected at the end verbally. It's insulting and his own suicide should have been caused by that insult rather than the fact that his beloved is dead.".

And of course the story provides a glimpse into the humanity of the Chinese people in that system without polish making a subtle link to other human beings.If this is the Joan Chen who showed Yang form to an American on Washington Square in April 1985 and who consulted with the same one at Taste of China 1988 I would appreciate a note.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Joan Chen is a lovely woman who went to the Chinese outback to learn how ordinary people think visually. So she makes a film about a lovely girl sent to the Chinese outback to learn how ordinary people think agriculturally.The girl ends up feeling she has to prostitute herself to find her way back home. And so with Ms Chen and as with the girl we the viewer get some superficial pleasure.This is a simple film and one can see that it was made by someone with an actor's sensibility. The story is extremely economical so much so that the camera is anchored to the actors. Every shot is an actor's shot either to place the actor in a scene or to show the actor acting. The one exception is a rather heavihanded cloud metaphor. This works because the project has such low ambition but it has the effect of abstracting the story so much we just don't care.A more experienced filmmaker might work at defining the situation setting up some complex dynamics in the world and then placing some characters within those dynamics. That way we watch them in a context that we understand. Bertolucci did that with The Last Emperor' in which Ms Chen worked as one of those actors responding to their environment. Here she has it the other way around. We still get the wilderness the political idealism and associated petty tyrants. But they are the the other way around what our heroine sees. We through our surrogate the camera eye never see the bigger picture.In a sense this is a Taxi Driver' bet a first film where we get things through one character's mind. It worked for Scorsese because he was fearless in putting us on the edge. This project was clearly designed that way like taxi' with the edge being in the sexual exploitation of a young girl. But Ms Chen backs away when the chips are down. Some more visual pain more explicit images more of a linkage of loneliness to the environment for example in the Bertolucci Sheltering Sky'.So what we end up with is a small film where everything seems competent but nothing works quite right. She followed this up with the very similarly conceived Autumn in NY.' Prostitution in the name of getting home. Sad.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Spider Lilies";
	schema:reviewBody "A spider lily is a flower that is said to line along the pathway to Hell. It contains poison which will cause one to lose our memory. Memories are central to the story as the characters involved are questioned as to whether their memories are faulty and if one can choose to repress them in the attempt to forget be they happier times or times of woe.Jade Rainie Yang is an Internet webcam girl living with her grandma and making a living out of smut enticing men to trade money for moments of online peekaboo pleasure. She has a love since 9 years of age and it is the relationship with Takeko Isabella Leong a tattooist that forms the fulcrum of the story. Takeko herself bears a strong spider lily tattoo on her left arm and it is something that Jade wants for herself trying to rekindle and capture memories of her lost love now found again.There had been a recent fad about tattoos nevermind the negative connotations once associated with this permanent body art. Perhaps this movie will change opinions about tattoos as it opens your mind to specifics as to the reason behind each design and the rationale that each person probably had when making their choices on a particular design. And as a plot device it was a hand in glove a tattoo's powerful symbolism of hiding real intentions or emotions behind or to feed off its perceived energy and possessing the design's qualities.Spider Lilies has fine editing which serves the movie extremely well in engaging the audience with the characters' past. In fact the rich back stories created for the characters make the story very compelling to watch. If there is a chink in the armour then it's the characterization of Takeko's brother Ching Shen Jianhung who is a bit slow in mental intelligence and spends a lot of screen time pouting for his sister's attention which totally messes up her social life out of love and obligation to provide the only family care for him.The fear and pain of being forgotten in a modern society might resonate with many and anyone who has spent enough time on the internet will know that its anonymity can often lead to misunderstandings. That subplot perhaps added a touch of lightness coupled with a tinge of sadness and irony. As most youths today turn to the net as an outlet for expression most will be able to identify with this portion of the story arc.I'm quite unsure if this movie will be able to make it to Singapore given its more obvious subject material that the authorities will probably frown upon. But at its core it's a tale of change and to have courage to live the life you want to lead interwoven with a tale of love. If Saving Face can make it to our shores I hope Spider Lilies will too.".

Memories are central to the story as the characters involved are questioned as to whether their memories are faulty and if one can choose to repress them in the attempt to forget be they happier times or times of woe.Jade Rainie Yang is an Internet webcam girl living with her grandma and making a living out of smut enticing men to trade money for moments of online peekaboo pleasure. She has a love since 9 years of age and it is the relationship with Takeko Isabella Leong a tattooist that forms the fulcrum of the story. Takeko herself bears a strong spider lily tattoo on her left arm and it is something that Jade wants for herself trying to rekindle and capture memories of her lost love now found again.There had been a recent fad about tattoos nevermind the negative connotations once associated with this permanent body art. Perhaps this movie will change opinions about tattoos as it opens your mind to specifics as to the reason behind each design and the rationale that each person probably had when making their choices on a particular design. And as a plot device it was a hand in glove a tattoo's powerful symbolism of hiding real intentions or emotions behind or to feed off its perceived energy and possessing the design's qualities.Spider Lilies has fine editing which serves the movie extremely well in engaging the audience with the characters' past. In fact the rich back stories created for the characters make the story very compelling to watch. If there is a chink in the armour then it's the characterization of Takeko's brother Ching Shen Jianhung who is a bit slow in mental intelligence and spends a lot of screen time pouting for his sister's attention which totally messes up her social life out of love and obligation to provide the only family care for him.The fear and pain of being forgotten in a modern society might resonate with many and anyone who has spent enough time on the internet will know that its anonymity can often lead to misunderstandings. That subplot perhaps added a touch of lightness coupled with a tinge of sadness and irony. As most youths today turn to the net as an outlet for expression most will be able to identify with this portion of the story arc.I'm quite unsure if this movie will be able to make it to Singapore given its more obvious subject material that the authorities will probably frown upon. But at its core it's a tale of change and to have courage to live the life you want to lead interwoven with a tale of love. If Saving Face can make it to our shores I hope Spider Lilies will too.";

	schema:reviewBody "GSRAT strongly recommends a new Taiwan lesbian nutongzhi film Spider Lilies. This film will premiere at the Berlin Film Festival February 11 2007. We hope you will encourage any friends who might be in Berlin to attend the premiere. This is Taiwan's lesbian director Zero Chou's new film. It portrays the love of and between two lesbians evoking the hopes and hurts of everyone. It is a film remarkable in its fearless unwavering representation of lesbian emotions while plumbing the depths of everyday lives. The film is further marked by the director's unpretentious concern for people on the margins of society and her humane yet piercing perspective on life.Spider Lilies 2007  Do as you desire Reviewed by GSRAT Spider lily is a flower that grows along the path to the gates of hell it is a tattoo it is a way of remembering and forgetting it registers varied experiences of love and trauma.Everyday rituals are a way of du. Du is crossing over the river to the other side it is also crossing through life to death and one's next life over and over again. Storytelling through creative ritual action works through suffering that cannot otherwise be overcome either in remembering or forgetting in life. The film shows us how ritual storytelling and actions in different forms  webcam blogging tattooing getting tattooed chatting under the guise of police entrapment  allows for crossing over to the other side in life and in death. Spider Lilies helps us see how different people have different ways of doing or duing  acting out acting upon and acting through their desires and therefore crossing through trauma to arrive at the other side where one is no longer imprisoned within suffering but can live with it having lived through it. It thus suggests to us ways in which we could do or du our own impasses.Everyone is nonnormative and must learn to dudo through different actionsstories. In the world of the film violence and trauma are banal and special at the same time. No one is exempt from this everyday violence and trauma no one is normal and without flaw. Through this film all normative positions are under question. Nonnormative roles on the other hand are represented in ways that subvert expectations. In Spider Lilies everyday trauma in two lesbian lives becomes the context and condition of their relation to each other. One of the lesbians obsessively remembers her first love at the early age of nine and is courageous and forthright in pursuing a sign of love in the form of a spider lily tattoo. The other cannot forget early traumas nor can she remember or begin anything else but finds a way to tell the stories for which there can be no words in her work as a tattoo artist. The film's view of its characters and their situations is a bit like the blind grandma's fondly amused and never judgmental. The tattoo is an allegory of cinema as ritual that allows a crossing through as a picture that grows moves and penetrates its subjects as a story told through pictures that reflect the past and help bring the future into being.".

Why do you remember what you remember? Are you sure that you really remember everything? This film noodles with the ideas at times with memories repeated differently. There are several characters who's memory is failing and we see how that effects those around them.The film also skirts around how we perceive people on line as the cop falls for the girl and the girl isn't sure who is telling her they love her.There is something about the characters that made it all real. I mean how can you not help but love a film that shows the dangers of being a webcam girl when you live at home with your grandmother.I need to say I loved how the romance between the characters is handled as something that just sort of was. The fact that its two women isn't really the point its that its two people. Forgive me I'm tired of films that are same sex romance and they beat you over the head with it to the point that you wonder if its about anything other than being gay or lesbian. This is about the people.My only real complaint with the film is that the layers of memory and stories and reality kind of reach a breaking point about an hour and twenty minutes in. Somewhere about that time the film seems to be juggling way too many balls and I began to lose track of what was happening. Its a minor flaw because by that time the characters have built up enough good will it just carries you to the end.I think its worth a look and even a repeat viewing.".

In several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent Taiwan release Eternal Summer. Then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment now we have the same thing with women. Zero Chou presents for your nonexistent edification a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old. They managed some of the art house stance but in the end this results in a most inane simply uninteresting foray.The Hong Kong angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung Bug Me Not Isabella Diary here sporting her most butch look yet. Although somewhat likable in her previous jobs Isabella in Spider Lillies is listless and lacking in most departments. Either her heart wasn't into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch didn't quite appeal to her sensibilities.She does a Taipei tattoo artist who's shy reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother played by John Shen who thankfully grants the movie its only thespianrelated redeeming feature. Isabella's character oddly named Takeko but supposedly hailing from Hong Kong soon hooks up with disaffected youth Jade Rainie Yang from fondlyrecalled Meteor Garden. The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general. Sure the grandmother component works well and is touching but otherwise Jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart Takeko.The two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst with Jade working as a webcam girl while Takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm. Jade also wants to acquire this very design which leads to Takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky Jade.Well if there's little discourse to write the homebase about is at least the intercourse memorable? In a word no. They kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not long ago there's a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they're about to see sexual content.This cynical expectationbuilding seals Spider Lillies' fate. With a weak story hohum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you this one kind of makes Color Blossoms look good come to think of it. At least there we got a bit of Teresa Cheung's mammaries. No Spider Lillies is no AV masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB movie festival.Amazingly for a pseudoindie release not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration. That's just as well since it makes passing on Spider Lillies much easier. Believe you us avoid it and you won't be missing out on anything good.Rating  ".

BUT maybe because of my culture or upbringing i found it rather disturbing that Jade the younger character was acting as if she's two years old and talking in that kinky childish prostitute voice all the time not just on web cam ugh! actually that's what she represented not a woman and an individual but some male fantasy. the only time she looked somewhat real was in the love scene which was ridiculously short as if an afterthought. Takeko was a rather bland character but she appealed to me because she was more realistic that Jade. the plot could have been interesting some imagery and drama but the execution of it less than inspiring and left me with a feeling of being skimmed over rather timidly. i would still recommend watching it if you want to see something not too mentally challenging and cute plus the girls are very pretty ".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Spider Lilies";
	schema:reviewBody "A beautiful yet unfulfilled romance It seems that Taiwanese cinema is finally reestablishing in a manner of art house flicks. With Silk Eternal Summer and now Spider Lilies there is no question of doubt that Taiwanese directors are wonderful talents. While Spider Lilies seem rather commercial on the cover of the artwork with the cuteeyed Raine Yang and the almost unrecognisable Isabella Leong there is little questioning that it attracted a lot of a certain gender's attention. Full credit must be given to Isabella who has now taken a path to a career stepwise an inch closer to Best Actress glory with 2005's Isabella and now this. With that being said Spider Lilies is certainly a beautiful film to watch and the constant cuteness of Raine is always going to add further viewing points but the film ultimately remains slightly lacking and leaving the audience rather unfulfilled.The movie goes like this Rainie Yang plays cute web cam girl Jade who wants to get a tattoo to attract her online clients. She visits the tattoo parlor run by Takeko Isabella Leong and immediately remembers Takeko to be her childhood crush. Jade sees a stunningly beautiful spider lily pattern on Takeko's wall. She pleads Takeko to tattoo that on her body as a mark of love without knowing how special this poisonous flower means to Takeko. Takeko pretends to have forgotten Jade but there are actually traumatic experiences that Takeko can never forget...Director Zero is no stranger to queer movies and apparently won the Taiwanese Best Director Award for some film called Splendid Float. Here Zero seamlessly plays the film like a normal film and making the lesbian scenes all the more natural without a tick of queerness. Perhaps it is due to the pretty face of Raine who performs well enough to be acclaimed as an underrated performance. However the real star of the show is really Isabella. Perhaps it is due to her make up or whatever Isabella is acted like an accomplished actress beaming with confidence. Neo is daring to say that Isabella is an outside chance to be the next Maggie Cheung ManYuk. At times Neo felt as though he is watching someone else a real TB tomboy and now that's a compliment.Still director Zero struggles to create something more something deeper and something more relevant. It is a shame that the built up and structure seems so promising and along with the photogenic faces one can only wish Zero should have done more. When the film reaches its conclusion it fails to answers most of the questions that it initially raised which only further hampers the film.Needless to say the film is beautiful filmed and the lighting and use of colours are amazingly beautiful to endure. However Spider Lilies come up rather short of its lofty ambitions and the result is an unfulfilled movie and leaving the audience wanting a lot more. Aside from these short comings it is almost impossible to resist the moment when Raine kisses Isabella and their steamy hot sequence. Without being bias from a male perspective the film does attempt to say something about memories. Perhaps it is true that it is human nature to remember the moments and people that they like and choose to forget moments that they do not want to remember. While Neo can relate to the aforementioned line the film fails to capitalize on any real issue and once again comes up falling short. Then again any of that is unlike to deter the fans of the ultra cute  Raine YangI rate it 7.510www.thehkneo.com".

It makes exactly Zero no pun intended statements regarding sexuality and the main characters are totally at ease with their orientations.No this is essentially a Cathartic film about trauma and the different ways people deal with it.One of the leads tries her hardest to remember everything to hold on to every single sweet moment few and far between though they were as if they were her last and most precious possessions. She believes that everything is transient and that existence is only as real as the memories of those involved. Be forgotten and you cease to exist. She surrounds herself with all her positive memories and lives almost in a dream.The other is the opposite Stony and cold she has cut herself off from the pain of her past by forcing herself to forget everything and plods lifelessly through the present like a rootless tree. For her only the present has meaning and as soon as something moves into the past it is left behind. Contradictorily she fills her days and nights with guilt for something she perceived as her fault and as apparent punishment she denies herself any solace that would heal her.Flashbacks serve to flesh out the pasts and allow us to come to understand why they are the way they are today one's slow reawakening from a morbid empty state and another's persistence to never be forgotten.We learn how guilt can arise from one's actions in times of stress and cause one to blame oneself and how emotional starvation can present itself in a multitude of ways.As a father in Japan a country which has had more than its fair share of disasters some of the scenes I found indescribably painful the scenes where this film depicts loneliness though brief were some of the most heart wrenching moments I've seen on screen to date and left me in tears for the second time.As for the acting the 18 year old Isabella Leong shows remarkable adaptability for this demanding role She plays a high school pupil a devoted sister a substitute mother and a passionate lover with believability and empathy.Every moment she's on the screen she captivates and convinces the audience pulling them into her world.Rainy manages to pull entirely different heartstrings throughout the film and bares her damaged soul in an extremely convincing fashion.The one other actress whom for spoiler reasons I won't mention is really an unsung highlight of the movie... I found myself blubbering like a babe pretty much every single time she was on the screen...The nonlinear storyline flits from present to past in a slightly uneven and disconcerting way. Some scenes appear cut short and hurried while others appear to linger a little longer than is comfortable. Intentional no doubt but it does make the rhythm of the film a little difficult to follow.Despite this slight incoherence and the loss of focus of the jumbled ending Spider Lilies is without doubt an intelligent and thought provoking drama. It makes a valiant attempt at uncovering the wide vista of human emotional survival in the face of hardship and succeeds where a lesser film would fail to involve.p.s. The subtitles on the DVD I rented were OKish but have distinct errors in places.".

There is even a character representing men who consume said content and yet feel like they can 'save' the person. That was all amazingly handled.

The story is based on the last years of the German actress Sybille Schmitz 19091955 who died due to an overdose of sleeping pills. The performance of Rosel Zech is impressive showing the glamour of a former star in the Nazi period and the depression of an addicted woman in the 50's. Hilmar Thate is also perfect in the role of a simple innocent man that faces a greedy world of pain and death. The magnificent cinematography in black and white using perfectly light and shadows is homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Desespero de Veronika Voss The Despair of Veronika Voss".

The performance of Rosel Zech is impressive showing the glamour of a former star in the Nazi period and the depression of an addicted woman in the 50's. Hilmar Thate is also perfect in the role of a simple innocent man that faces a greedy world of pain and death. The magnificent cinematography in black and white using perfectly light and shadows is homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Desespero de Veronika Voss The Despair of Veronika Voss";

	schema:headline " Third film in Fassbinder's trilogy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the third and last film in the trilogy that included Marriage of Maria Braun and Lola. This also turned out to be one of the last films Rainer Werner Fassbinder made before his sudden suicide in 1982. Story takes place in 1955 where a former German movie star named Veronika Voss Rosel Zech is now a morphine addict and she gets her shots from a doctor who specializes in hooking wealthy clients on morphine to the point where they sign over their homes and belongings to pay for their shots. Veronika use to be a star in the 40's for the state run UFA studios that made Nazi approved dramas. Now ten years after the war and unable to further her acting career Veronika is dependent on Dr. Marianne Katz who lets her stay in a backroom of her office. One rainy night Veronika runs into Robert Krohn Hilmar Thate who is a simple sportswriter for a newspaper and he offers her his umbrella. She is taken in by his kindness and the next day she calls him for drinks. Robert lives with his girlfriend Henriette Cornelia Froboess and she is curious about what will happen between them. Robert gets involved with Veronika and learns of her addiction and he seems to think that he can help her. He meets her exhusband Max Rehbein Armin MuellerStahl and he warns him that there is nothing he can do. Robert learns of Dr. Katz and what she has been doing but he cannot prove to the authorities of her intent. This film was shot in black and white and its Fassbinder's homage to old films like Sunset Boulevard but the black and white cinematography actually resembles the look of the films that the UFA Studios made in the 30's and 40's. The film for the most part is very dark looking except for the scenes in the office of Dr. Katz. All the decor in this place is very shiny and white and I think Fassbinder wanted this area to appear dreamlike or heavenly and its in stark contrast to the very dark tone of the outside world. The character Robert wants to try and save Veronika but its to no avail and Fassbinder wanted him to symbolize how people wanted to change and save others through their own selfish reasons. Not that they necessarily want to do harm but for their own sake of humanity. Fassbinder was a die hard cynic and he portrays Roberts efforts to save Veronika and expose Dr. Katz as pathetic and futile. This simple everyman was in way over his head and its a jab by Fassbinder to the common man who tries to stand up to corruption. The story is loosely based on a real German actress named Sybille Schmitz. This film is not in the same league as Marriage of Maria Braun and even though Zech is pretty good she doesn't give the commanding performance that Hanna Schygulla did. This is still a very interesting film to watch and all three films in this trilogy should be viewed. Fassbinder has once again directed a visually striking film and gives the viewer another look at a character that has sold their soul in the war.".

Like the films of his idol this film is stylish and artificial to an extreme extent which creates quite a distance between itself and the audience. Probably an even greater distance since the style and the artificiality are used more consciously here even as a instrument of alienation. So it is more fascinating than touching or even moving and might leave one even cold. Nevertheless the story is intriguing and it really tells something about the post war society in West Germany so the film is interesting and even fascinating to watch. The scene where Rosel Zech as Veronika sings Memories Are Made Of This is very haunting a gem.".

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's bleakly bitter examination of guilt greed and exploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Veronika Voss 1982 was the final part of director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's celebrated trilogy of films that looked specifically at the period following the end of the Second World War and in particular the sociopolitical and economic rebirth of Germany following the Wirtschaftswunder. All three films in the trilogy look at these situations through the eyes of a strongwilled arrogant and determined femaleprotagonist who strives against all odds to achieve the kind of lifestyle that she has always desired but once she does finds herself still feeling empty and lacking in spirit. The characters in these films come to represent Fassbinder's own feelings about the Germany of this particular period whilst simultaneously acting as an allegorical portrayal and deeper interpretation of the qualities and characteristics of the country itself.The first film in this loose thematic trilogy The Marriage of Maria Braun 1979 looked at the ideas of determination and the triumph of will that would go towards rebuilding Germany from the ashes of the Second World War through the eyes of resolute young woman willing to push her own emotional stability to breaking point in order to secure a better future for her and her incarcerated husband. The second film Lola 1981 which took its inspiration from Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel 1930 looked at how that same sense of opportunism greed and determination can be used for more selfish reasons sowing the seeds of tragedy and eventual air of blind exploitation that will come full circle here. Veronika Voss exists in very much the same cinematic universe as the two other films that would come to form the backbone of what would eventually become known the BRD trilogy though Fassbinder himself had often talked of plans to make more films in a similar vein  analysing postwar German history through to the present day  but was unable to continue the theme due to his untimely death in June of 1982.It would have been interesting to see where Fassbinder would have taken these continuing themes following Veronika Voss which ends on a perfect note of heartbreaking cynicism very much in tune with the Germany and indeed the world itself at the end of the 1970's representing in a sense the same emotional landscape of cold desperation and political confusion presented in his more personal contemporaryset films of the same era such as In a Year of 13 Moons 1978 and The Third Generation 1979. Like those films Veronika Voss continues Fassbinder's reputation as probably the greatest exploitation filmmaker who ever lived in the sense of the crushing despair and continual disappointment that befalls his various characters whenever they put their trust in the hands of others. This can be seen as far back as the masterful Fox and his Friends 1975 as well as the underrated Mother Kusters' Trip to Heaven 1976 with Veronika Voss continuing the themes of those particular films but with the greater sense of visual experimentation and bold use of miseenscene that would be found in his last few films following The Marriage of Maria Braun.Whereas that film employed a much grittier use of production design and almost unglamorous use of cinematography  the complete antithesis to the subsequent Lola and its gorgeous kaleidoscope of luminous colours and expressive use of shadow  Veronika Voss is presented in cold stark gorgeously textured black and white. The use of photography combined with the costume and production design not only give us a definite feel for the period in which the film is set but also a great understanding of the moods of the characters and the atmosphere of the world in which they inhabit. It also allows Fassbinder and his cinematographer Xaver Schwarzenberger to draw parallels not only to the 40's and 50's set Hollywood melodramas that have seemingly inspired the plot and use of character  I'm thinking specifically of references to Sunset Blvd 1950  but also capturing the very iconic style of the early preSecond World War cinema of the UFA film studios which plays an important part in Veronika's spiral into the pits of despair.Fassbinder incorporates other elements such as a romantic subplot and traces of a perhaps volatile love triangle with more elaborate references to detective fiction cinema and the blurring of the past with the present. These stylistic devices help to keep the film moving with a brisk enough pace while the continual use of confinement and claustrophobic camera angles that exaggerate how close yet similarly disconnected the characters are from one another help to convey the more hopeless and alienated aspects of Veronika's internal stateofmind. Without question this is one of Fassbinder's most interesting films a bleak and bitter minor masterpiece that continues the themes and ideas behind The Marriage of Maria Braun and Lola whilst also bringing to a close in hindsight a number of reoccurring themes familiar to anyone with a fondness for or interest in Fassbinder's life and work.Veronika Voss is intelligent and deeply emotional filmmaking rife with ideas that are still relevant both socially and historically such as the aforementioned allusions to the UFA film studios as well as Veronika's hinted affair with Joseph Goebbels and the broader more controversial historical implications suggested therein. As with the majority of the Fassbinder's work Veronika Voss is intense evocative and unbelievably well acted  particularly by Rosel Zech Himar Thate and Annemarie Dringer  though it is perhaps worth mentioning that the bleak arch of the narrative combined with the almost despairing allusions to the again aforementioned Sunset Blvd and films of that ilk may be a little too formidable or uninviting for some. Although Fassbinder would go on to produce one more film before his death the dizzying and surreal adaptation of Genet's Querelle 1982 Veronika Voss  along with the other two films in the BRD trilogy  is a fitting testament to his enormous talent and underappreciated genius.".

After a chance encounter on a bus with Robert Krohn Hilmar Thate there lives are entwined with Krohn finding himself trapped in a catandmouse search for Voss's sanity her past lives and the many sycophants and gold diggers in 1950's Germany. Voss now struggling to find work after a highly successful period particularly in the 1940's is addicted to drugs and alcohol and has paranoid delusions when out on the street Krohn is pulled into this as he did not recognise who she was and she vaguely sees him as protection.One of the last of Fassbinder's films  he died of an overdose the official conclusion was suicide in 1982  which was also the last of a trilogy focusing on Germany's economic boom in the 1950's the others being The Marriage of Maria Braun 1979 and Lola 1981 the film also reflects some of the themes that the New German Cinema at the time. It was a time that Germany was reflective of World War 2 and the trauma that prevailed in a country torn between guilt and a resurgence of decadence and wealth as in the 1920's Weimar Republic. It is stated in the film that Voss's best period was during this period and that she had been the star of Nazi Germany. After the fall of Nazi domination she was cast aside.Like Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard 1950 Veronika Voss highlights an industry that can easily create monsters and also devastate lives. But unlike Wilder's subtle version of lost fame Fassbinder shows the devastating effects of drug addiction and the underbelly of society that is encountered in this process. Historically though this is deeper and a hell of a lot more emotionally charged and interesting than Sunset. After all this is not a Hollywood story but is a postWorld War 2 story of judgement and loss after such a integrally debasing event in human history. How do you continue after working under the despotic power of the Nazi party? The elements of Nazi Germany are still in process in the form of Veronika's control.The film is said to be based upon the reallife German film actress Sybille Schmitz who died of an overdose in 1955 at the tender age of 45. The film shows shows that the shadow of the war had a lasting effect on the German nation that would take decades to come to terms with. This is film making par excellence. Haunting beautiful with a climax that is inevitable shocking but very satisfactory. Rosel Zech's performance is pitch perfect her face in a constant state of anguish.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautifully photographed in simple black and white with some lovely gliding shots and some interesting camera angles and framing the film is an amazement on a visual scope even if the screenplay and acting are nothing special. Fassbinder's choice of lighting is excellent giving true stark contrast between areas of black and areas of white in certain scenes. Sound is a significant aspect too with soft radio recording heard in the background of just about every scene. The meaning behind such an audio style is not clear but still it provides an interesting feel if not much else. As already alluded to however the technical aspects outweigh the rest of the film. It is a rather cold tale with awkward characters which are hard to sympathise with. Towards the end it also goes off on a bit of a tangent from being a drama to a thriller. The film definitely seems more dedicated to its style than its substance but that only makes is a certainly degree less fascinating to watch. The style quite literally sparkles and the film applies a few interesting editing tricks to change from scene to scene. If not involving as a tale it is nevertheless great eye candy.".

The other passengers on the bus look up at the exasperated woman but don't pay her any more mind than that. A bit later the woman proudly tells the man that she is Veronika Voss and all he can do is politely nod. She hasn't been in a movie for three years and hasn't been in a good one for longer than that. Veronika has to try really hard to pin the man Robert down and seduce him and even when she accomplishes this feat he doesn't seem particularly interested. Robert's interest does grow when he begins to discover some nasty secrets about her life notably that she is addicted to morphine. A strange doctor seems to be little more than a local drug dealer when he begins to look into the situation.The plot is decent it would have been a really good one for a classic Hollywood film starring Joan Crawford or Bette Davis or someone like that. Its greatest worth is in the performance of Rosel Zech who has the titular role. Cornelia Froboess as Robert's girlfriend and Annemarie Dringer as the wicked doctor are also good. The character of Robert is never very interesting. The black and white cinematography Xaver Schwarzenberger and the unconventional score Peer Raben are very good. The tape I watched was not in a very good condition so I may have liked it more if I had seen a better copy. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked Veronika Voss surprisingly much. I saw some themes in there that kept my interest. So far I hadn't liked RWF's films of his last period that's out of three periods. I especially liked how it took the word Sehnsucht literally sehnen  yearning Sucht  addiction. It's how I like to ponder on the word.What I think appealed to Robert about Veronika was her public status. She was a prestigious grande dame not unattractive and he thought she was rich. Such a person has a special appeal. Robert's girlfriend also understood this appeal very well and almost accepted the situation without putting up a fight. Robert's appeal for Veronika was that she told herself that he was interested in her for her own fading beauty while in reality he did recognize the film star before he offered her umbrella and protection.A moment that made me break out in laughter was also towards the beginning when Veronika and Robert are having a drink he says something like reality isn't like a movie she agrees and not even a second later she turns to the waiter and bursts out The lighting is hideous in here! Turn those lights off and light the candles! Also unsubtle but very poignant and a humorous moment.For a minute I was a bit disappointed when in the film suddenly a villain emerged in the person of the doctor. It wasn't what I wanted from the film but it unexpectedly actually made this RWF's most suspenseful film because of the second half. I find it to be more of a thriller than 'Martha' was.The scene with Veronika denying Robert Krohn in front of the police I thought would have made a satisfying and poignant ending but it continued the story quite hastily with Veronika dying and Robert giving up which eventually also made for a good and probably even more poignant ending.I'm sure those anythingbutsubtle lens flares had their purpose. For Veronika it wasn't just a happy past but she glorifies this time of her life which justifies this extreme visual effect.The overall bright BW photography is excellent eye candy. It's an unusual approach to tell a dark story in so much white and to tell a relatively sober period piece in stark BW.".

Everything changed during the WWII and especially after its end.Fassbinder's film which was shot in black and white visually is very impressive. Light and shadows are two cinema's best secrets says Veronika in the movie and light and shadows make the film a joy to behold.

	schema:reviewBody "Veronika Voss is a movie in love with movies and also a movie where its maker RW Fassbinder continues on his lifecareerlong obsession with capturing the essence of melodrama on screen. He might have come closest with this story since it allows him to make it a moviemovie so to speak. I saw some echoes mayhap of Sunset Blvd and even Ed Wood and that may just be attributable to it being a true story more or less as one would gather from this cinema tribute to Sybille Schmitz but maybe too in how fascinated Fassbinder is with glamor and decadence decay and selfabsorption the mental faculties to be caring and gentle Robert and with a streak that suggests the very essence of everything arguably wrong in Germans the doctors who keep Veronika quasicaptive hooking her onto morphine. It's a glorious multifaceted critique of a time and place of a 1950s Germany that had moved on from the war only relatively  the madness could and would continue on in ways that involve some subtext and some things so out in the open it's hard to stand it.It's ostensibly in its plot sense about a sports reporter for a paper mildmannered Robert who on a bus one night helps shield the movie star or once real STAR in quotes Veronika Voss very great Rosel Zech. She's interested in him convinces him to buy her an item for 300 and he's interested too  if only for how she's not really how to say 'balanced' and we soon see that she is in fact under medical care of an unusual sort by Dr. Marianne Katz. That and the involvement soon after with Robert's girlfriend in trying to figure out how to get Veronika real help of getting the police involved as well makes up the bulk of the rest of the story. We also get a subplot of sorts with an old couple one look at the arm numbers tattooed is all that's needed to fill the pieces but Fassbinder isn't interested in plot persay. He's interested in how to move it how to transgress a simple melodrama into something more lively profound and moving.He's also invested in creating this look for the film that is at times expressionistic of a 1930s tone of the dark corners and streets and moments of a filmnoir and then sudden blasts of bright light thrown in an early scene has a bunch of lights intentionally blasting at the camera lens a perfect homage to cinema itself with the glamor of a expensive restaurant contrasted with the white walls of Katz's quarters. Fassbinder wants us to see this as a movie in the sense of the usage of crafty dissolves and fades or those wipes that are precisely artificial but at the same time not lose sight of the drama at hand. Part of this is the acting which is by many of Fassbinder's regulars not least of which Armin MuellerStahl in a terrific quiet but haunted supporting role as a screenwriter and exhusband of Veroika's who says a great deal in one look to Robert down a hallway while a scene is being shot or Gnther Kaufmann perhaps the one loose link to the previous film in the BDR trilogy as a G.I. who adds a curiously affecting song he sings to himself in the middle of a dramatic scene between the doctor and Veronika.Another part of this are just many many great scenes and moments put together. Things like when the doctors start to laugh after one of them says around Veronika It's not like we're trying to kill you with it bordering on an Austin Powers level of absurdity if it weren't for it being so cold a moment of satire. Or how we see Robert and Veronika contrasted brilliantly by cinematographer Schwarzenberger with Robert being relatively normally lit while Veronika's face gets slightly brighter with each cutaway as they talk at a table in the restaurant. Or how music is used throughout the collection of tunes from the radio mixing with the actual score creating a sense of illusion and madness that gets us close to the psyche of Veronika Voss while still maintaining the homagequality of the picture. And most notably for me are the closing scenes where without revealing too much though it may be hard in just revealing it's a melodrama at the core Veronika dreams of a farewell party that may be surreal enough to be a dream but in that first moment of singing at the piano who is to say?It's such a stroke of beautiful filmmaking all around from the mix of sets and real locations to the sense of history captured of the given theme of fame being so easy to disintegrate of the melancholic sense of cinema that bears on our lives while civilization crumbles and gets back up again. Maybe this is just what I took away from it but it's all a credit to Fassbinder's dedication to his art form  which soon after this took his own life from a similar excess to that of his character here. Moreover it's one of the superb films of its country.".

The supposed knight in shining amour is Robert Krohn Thate a short ordinarylooking sports journalist in his mid40s who has a stable girlfriend Henriette Froboess and doesn't even recognise her when they first meet during a downpour in the night maybe this is a major reason why Veronika finds him special deems him as someone who can simply treat her as an attractive woman without all the celebrity halos.

Veronika is a damaged good already pompous insecure and selfseeking sees Robert as her last straw to revitalise her life and plans a dramatic return to the limelight yet all will fall flat since her Achilles heel is firmly clutched by the evil doctors she cannot be saved it is physically impossible a fatalistic manifesto to those incorrigibly poisoned corrupted and weakminded. Zech manifests a telling facet of Veronika's jittery unstableness holds great poise while inside she is beyond salvation.Thate's Robert a common victim of an everyman's heroic fantasy to fall for a damselindistress and rescues her from whatever evil force torments her. Only in Fassbinder's book the reality is too gloom to conjure up a gratifying victory Robert has to endure a bigger loss other than Veronika Thate's performance brings about quite a subtle poignancy as the story goes into a more sinister twist.

The black and white is used to a really good contrast and if anything the film is pleasing to look at. Scenes with the leading lady have glitter shining off her jewelery and it looks like you would expect fame in all its superficial but alluring glory.The soundtrack is great I get off on detail in this area and radio interludes constantly playing in the background a'la Midnight Cowboy along with well timed emotional musical cues are very effective. A few songs are highlighted in key scenes such as some twangy country music and the beautiful vocal number towards the end which provides quite an impact on the senses.The thing that really lets Veronica Voss down is the story its good but its just not very interesting. A sports reported has an affair with a fading actress who is involved in a plot by a neurologist that hooks rich patients up with morphine to get their trust and eventually their fortune when they die. Now... it sounds workable and it is. But its rather plodding how it is played out although the actors are fantastic and do a great job portraying their characters it all feels very superficial and it is hard to sympathize with their plight. Some might argue that this is the intention of the film maker to get across the superficial nature of actresses in general but it doesn't feel so convincing to me.In short Veronica Voss is a feast for the eyes at times and the soundtrack is excellent but something feels a tad hollow. Most of the appeal seems to come from that it shows off the era and well I can respect it for that.".

He died the very same year an untimely death at under 40. The title is a giveaway as these Fassbinder films usually include female characters and always sound a bit pretentious. For him it was a return back to the roots as he started his career 15 years earlier with blackandwhite films and this one also lacks color. 4 cast members received German Film Awards nominations here but nobody won and this includes the late lead actress Rosel Zech and also Hilmar Thate who I usually quite like. But sadly I felt he was mostly forgettable in here just like Zech and many other aspects from this movie. It is about the fate of an actress who seems to struggle in keeping her career going or even in terms of improving it. We are told about her fate in terms pf professional life and private life when she is on the lookout for love. Will she find success in either of the two areas? Or will it end in disaster as it sometimes does in Fassbinder films? Watch for yourself. Or don't as in my opinion this film is far away from Fassbinder's most convincing works. Then again I am not the very greatest fan of the man's films so maybe you will think differently here. However if you have seen nothing from the man don't start with this one. It is not easily accessible at all. Thumbs down from me.".

Characteristic of this all the other FassbinderEplilogues are Apocalyptic decoration disruption of any possible plot lines and connections between the characters transportation of a text spoken by a figure onto other figures who repeat that text but in an other context basic topics religion end of life apocalypse revelation resurrection connection between sexuality and church. A special function is given to the rather short epilogue that is embedded in the film in Veronika Voss 1982 After the former UFAstar has gotten a chance to celebrate her own glamorous farewell she dreams the whole evening again and varies sotosay the crucial moments What would have happened if she had told Robert Krohn about her morphineaddiction? Was there a chance to still escape her destruction by her psychiatrist? To start a new life with Robert? To resume her career? Only through this epilogue it becomes clear why Veronika did not take her chance of escaping her addiction and imprisoning when she meets Robert for the first time in the Geiselgasteig forest why she prefers to lie on herself instead of giving up her attitude which alone enables Dr. Katz to turn her into her propriety. Through the epilogue we realize that Veronika Voss had started her trip into the light Fassbinder already a long time ago a trip of no return. So one is seduced to speculate that Fassbinder's last movie Querelle 1982 is nothing but an epilogue chosen by the dying director in order to interpret and reinterpret his life and his 66 films every episode counted. Going back in time changing the switches  and how would the present look then now? Franz Biberkopf gets pace epilogue another change turns back to life and spends his last decades in complete anonymity. Veronika Voss does not get a chance anymore because she is one of Fassbinder's lightpersons like Herr R. in Why does Herr R. run amok Fox in Fox and his friends Lily Brest in Shadow of Angels Effi Briest in Effi Briest Herr Bauer in Fear of Fear Mother Ksters in Mother Ksters' Trip to Heaven ElviraErwin in A Year with 13 Moons  here one might also mention the persons who survive crippled or demented  like Martha in Martha Margot in Fear of Fear Peter in I only want you to love me Franz Xaver Bolwieser in The Stationmaster's Wife and many others of Fassbinder's universe. For Querelle and his friends the question does not rise anymore since the whole story is situated already in an imaginary future to which Zehetbauer's total artificial studioset corresponds marvelously. The end of interpretations and reinterpretations as given in the Epilogues takes place only when the present Topoi have overcome and have been substituted by a future OuTopia.".

Only through this epilogue it becomes clear why Veronika did not take her chance of escaping her addiction and imprisoning when she meets Robert for the first time in the Geiselgasteig forest why she prefers to lie on herself instead of giving up her attitude which alone enables Dr. Katz to turn her into her propriety. Through the epilogue we realize that Veronika Voss had started her trip into the light Fassbinder already a long time ago a trip of no return. So one is seduced to speculate that Fassbinder's last movie Querelle 1982 is nothing but an epilogue chosen by the dying director in order to interpret and reinterpret his life and his 66 films every episode counted. Going back in time changing the switches  and how would the present look then now? Franz Biberkopf gets pace epilogue another change turns back to life and spends his last decades in complete anonymity. Veronika Voss does not get a chance anymore because she is one of Fassbinder's lightpersons like Herr R. in Why does Herr R. run amok Fox in Fox and his friends Lily Brest in Shadow of Angels Effi Briest in Effi Briest Herr Bauer in Fear of Fear Mother Ksters in Mother Ksters' Trip to Heaven ElviraErwin in A Year with 13 Moons  here one might also mention the persons who survive crippled or demented  like Martha in Martha Margot in Fear of Fear Peter in I only want you to love me Franz Xaver Bolwieser in The Stationmaster's Wife and many others of Fassbinder's universe. For Querelle and his friends the question does not rise anymore since the whole story is situated already in an imaginary future to which Zehetbauer's total artificial studioset corresponds marvelously. The end of interpretations and reinterpretations as given in the Epilogues takes place only when the present Topoi have overcome and have been substituted by a future OuTopia.";

If you are looking for something like that then go watch house of the flying daggers or The Forbidden Kingdom because this movie is not about massive FX's and stunts. It simply tells a story with some battles shoved in. The movie is quite emotional and the acting was superb. As for the directing it truly is brilliant the battles were directed with passion and ingeniousness with great sound effects and slowmo shots that makes it even more desirable to watch over and over again.This is one movie that shouldn't be missed by Chinese historymythology fans.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Three Kingdoms Resurrection of the Dragon";
	schema:reviewBody "Sad to say I've only read the epic Romance of the Three Kingdom novels once in my lifetime to date and an abridged English version at that. My only other contacts with this classic Chinese literature is with the China television series that I had to struggle with because the initial episodes came without English subtitles i.e. akin to watching a Shakespearean play for the very first time and marvelling at the richness in language used and of course the Koei computer game that so many peers of my generation would have played at one time or another.And of course one of my favourite general characters was Zhao Zilong. Outside of the Liu BeiGuanYuZhangFei brotherhood together with their unsurpassed military strategist Zhuge Liang at their side Zhao Yun had qualities like valour which I thought was exemplary and an episode though taken on a whole new spin in presentation where he goes rescue the infant son of Liu Bei to demonstrate that gets its fair share of airtime in this movie. As I mentioned in an earlier review of An Empress and The Warriors we're getting plenty of such period war movies coming out in recent months culminating perhaps with John Woo's highly anticipated Red Cliff but amongst the recent releases Three Kingdoms draws first blood.But I suspect that Red Cliff will probably blow all competition out of the water going by the trailer though the final product remains to be proved this Summer. Three Kingdoms rode on its star power to carry its relatively bland storyline forward with Andy Lau as Zilong Maggie Q as nemesis Cao Ying who's male in the novel Sammo Hung as newly created characternarrator Luo Pingan and a whole host of supporting acts in Vanness Wu Andy On and even Ti Lung in a surprisingly nicely presented Guan Yu. You cannot fault the designs of the sets the costumes though of course some would complain it looks so Japanese and I thought the weapons were eyepoppingly beautiful and intricately designed  you just have to take a look at Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade!It's impossible to try and distill the entire classics into a 3hour long movie or even a trilogy would do its richness injustice let alone a 2 hour one. While the runtime for John Woo's movies in two parts? is still not finalized at least his focus is on one key primary battle. Resurrection of the Dragon's focus is on one man  Zhao Zilong and in doing so fairly summarized his tale from beginning to end with plenty of artistic and dramatic license taken of course where purist will probably have a field day discussing all the inaccuracies and departure from the source material. However in doing this we do get to see familiar characters sharing the stage albeit some given very little screen time.And I don't think it's me who's feeling quite jaded from the clanging of weapons against armour. Here the one on one action scenes between characters are wonderfully choreographed by Sammo Hung himself but the quick cuts close ups tight shots and dizzying camera work marred it all. The battle sequences were worse with fake blood splattered all over and the usual hacking of limbs and demonstration of superhuman strength by its chief characters. It did offer some simple philosophical gems to ponder over in between all the chaotic fighting but really the feeling you get out of the battle sequences was that it was like a distant cousin to 300 styled choreography.Don't expect any depth injected in most characters here too as you can smell the plot revelation a mile away from the get go. I thought Maggie Q was wasted with a flower vase role that took less than 20 minutes of screen time just to snarl nastily while Sammo Hung really relegated himself to the backseat choreographing the action. Andy Lau a real life hero was probably the top draw here in putting bums in seats but even he can't save the story from having to insert a needless hint at unattainable romance because of Zilong's sense of duty and obligation to serve his country putting it first before the starting of family.On the whole it's aesthetically beautiful but ringing really hollow. Let's hope John Woo's Red Cliff with the return of some of our beloved characters from Romance of the Three Kingdoms does some justice in its film adaptation of a key battle even if we have to contend with flying doves and slowmotion handling and twirling of swords. Keep your fingers crossed!".

Any sense of plot is cast aside for the fighting and deep pronouncements. To be fair the DVD I watched had barely coherent subtitles but at the same time they were coherent enough to know that they really didn't have a great deal to translate. The plot lurches from thing to thing with very little explanation or rather only explanation to carry the emotion. We're told things rather than shown things. The performances of Lau and Sammo Hung provide a great deal of emotion that isn't in the script. The bond between the two men and the emotion that they impart are the reason you watch the film not for anything else......okay maybe the action. As a film of epic action scenes its quite good. its not great but it is is good in a retro old school style. Its pretty pictures of armies fighting and it is entertaining if rarely engaging something the films scant dialog and character building prevents from ever happening. Never mind that coming as it does on the heels of the Jet Li masterpiece Warlords the film has a great deal to live up to since that earlier film had real characters and real action two things this film never manages to achieve. Add to the mix the over use of slow motion and the film really isn't worth the trouble.Actually its worth looking at if you want to see the fighting and a couple of good performances.".

A first time joint venture a major motion picture project put together by the Chinese and the Korean production teams the Chinese took part in preproduction from writing up the screen play to directing a Chinese guy who made Jet Li's Black Mask acting  filming while the Korean team took care of most of the post production  funding the CGI and scoring.With almost unlimited amount of funding and the pool of worldclass production talents in Asia I cannot help but wonder how an opportunity like this could have gone this wrong. The famous Chinese classic the three kingdoms  is an epic war story that one could not find its proper match in its scale in any part of the world. The movie deserved more than only a 90 min. duration. Why Why Why did the director and its team decide to cut out anything that resembled a real drama? Who knows. Jhon Woo wanted to give the project a proper attention so in his upcoming three kingdoms project'the red cliff' he is devoting 4 hours to tell the story.The action sequences camera works set designs costumes and props and even the score you name it they were all top notch. But Why? Why no Drama? Why could't the director decide to use another 30 more minutes to supplement the sheer absence of storytelling and the sufficient characterization of each of the major characters ? It would only have made the film 120 minutes which is still within the main stream block buster length range. Besides I bet that anyone who came to see the movie must have expected something more of a... brave heart type of epic story and heart wrenching human drama and understood appreciatively even if the movie went more than 2 hours.What a waste...indeed !!! I am a big fan of Three kingdoms and Any Lau so i will always love any project that has anything to do with those 2 elements but this one.... oh... a surprisingly disappointing project indeed. I gave it a 5 out of ten because as I mentioned the picture is only a halffinished and at least that half was pretty good.".

Yet the battle scenes are the majority of the film and there is no character development very limited plot development and the dialog is boring and thankfully there's not much of it.The battle scenes are filled with short cuts which are extremely hard to follow. One cut will have mounted units charging from left to right on the screen and then the next cut will show mounted units charging from right to left. Logically the viewer is led to believe that there are two opposing mounted units charging each other. A few cuts later it becomes apparent that all the mounted units are on the same side and chasing one guy.The film spends 3045 minutes on two battle sequences featuring a young Zilong then 57 minutes on an elaborate ceremony featuring a middle aged Zilong and the rest of the film time is spent on the old Zilong.The cinematography is typical of recent Chinese epics overly beautiful death never looked so pretty and big on ceremony. The problem is that it was chopped up like almondfried chicken. The cinematography could have been the saving grace of this film however it was edited by someone on crack. The result is that it is beautifully confusing.If you are looking for another great or at least entertaining Chinese epic film look elsewhere. There really is no reason to watch this film unless you are curious to the point of being masochistic as I often am.".

While this one couldn't hold up to that it's not able to hold up to other movies too even from recent future like THE WARLORDS with Jet Li and Andy Lau.All in all this is quite nice the action is decent the story moves along with a good pace and it's quite enjoyable overall.

	schema:reviewBody "Three kingdom Resurrection of the Dragon tells about the legend of one famous General Zhao Yun in the Three Kingdom. But unfortunately there are many flaws in this movie.First this movie is a little bit off from the actual history. I never knew that Zhao Yun started his first career as a soldier directly under Liu Bei. He should been under a general name Gongsun Zan before he changed his loyalty to Liu Bei. Then there are Cao Ying and Luo PingAn. Who the hell are they? Because as far as I know the one who fought Zhao Yun in the last battle was Chao Zhen. Secondly for the actor. I personally think that Andy Lau is wellsuited as General Zhao Yun here. But the actor for both General Guan Yu and ZhangFei is a little bit out of the course. While the actor who casted as Guan Yu seems too old the actor's face who cast as Zhang Fei seems so childish. And the actor who played as Zhuge Liang looks like a traditional physician instead of a strategist. Generally I would say the casting is a minus here except for Andy Lau of course For the story it lacks explanation. There's no explanation for any act inside. No briefing before wars no strategy meeting before wars no nothing. It just give off the conclusion of what is happening right now and lead us directly into the war. That's all. And that too is a minus.But still I like the war in this. That's why I still give this movie a rating of 6 instead of 5.Not good enough for all three kingdom fans. But if you're looking for just a war movies than this is definitely for you.".

It has his moments where like a metaphor try to show that a courage of one man can make much more to bow to him and be defeated. Zilong is a true hero a idealistic soldier who fight for peace his village his lord and a dream of a family in a safe world. Andy Lau does a very good role here in the first part is young and fearless and doesn't seem so wise but when he look much older after 32 years he is just great a general who is like a rock unmovable undefeated and named The Invicible General.I really like the epic moments when he is facing a army alone and he is going to freely give his life on the battlefield. Samo Hung as Luo PingAn he plays also good giving life to a character who is invisible to the others and not a hero like Zilong wanting to be much more then the destiny has in mind for him. And not the last Maggie Q is a strong feminine touch to the movie being a great strategist and a good warrior. The overall of the movie is don't miss it if u like war movies with heroes that doesn't fear death you will not be disappointed. The only drawback of the movie is the time much to less to present a truly epic feeling. He doesn't give enough time to all of the characters in the movie with much more potential. If it had like 160 minutes to show you each character as a great personality who fights for honor and strives to reach their goals it will really be a great movie.".

In fact it's one of those patriotic affairs where the opening sequence yet again bemoans the land's splintering into hostile polities and the need to consolidate.Not only have we seen exactly this kind of rhetoric a million times before we've seen it in what feels like a million better more fun movies. This Three Kingdoms isn't about fun it's a laborious film whose greatest achievement is squandering tremendous star power on trivialities and a formulaic story.Just to make sure you know it's got Andy Lau Sammo Hung Maggie Q why can't she just be Margaret Quigley we don't know our beloved Andy On Ti Long AND Yu Rongguang. Even with all of these obviously talented and welltrained professionals on board Three Kingdoms still ends up a disappointment. And we won't even go into this being a DANIEL LEE flick. Yes one of our fave directors in HK and the guy that kindly gave us awesome fare like Black Mask and Dragon Squad.OK it's not all bad. The basic premise is entirely trite but could have worked had it been treated well. We have one Zhao Zilong Andy Lau a regular guy from Changsha who joins the army in defense of his kingdom one of three main ones competing for primacy over the realm. Yes it's the story straight out of the novel and previous iterations more or less with sort of the same characters. Zhao Zilong befriends senior troop Luo Pingan Sammo Hung who guides the younger man into combat where Zhao promptly proves his mettle and proceeds to rise through the ranks until making it as a nigh on invincible hero general.Along the way he meets a cast of warriors including Andy On and Vanness Wu in supporting and ultimately unfulfilled roles and some awkward hairwork on the part of makeup. On the opposing side we find Maggie as warlordess Cao Ying aided by her general Han.None of these characters get sufficient room to breathe and grow resulting in something more akin to Konami's Dynasty Warriors  there's constant hacking and slashing with protagonists hard to believe since they're so powerful but with no likable goal. The only motivation seems to be a jingoistic unite the word by killing everyone which is fair enough but not enough to make a film good.The battle sequences aren't the best and you've sat through much more exciting ones very recently. There's some good CGI blood splattered all over the shop which is an added bonus but the inverse ninja law here simply isn't as amusing as it usually is  the two Andies go through so many enemy black armors it's literally not funny anymore proof positive that if you want to make a massive swordplay movie either endow it with a strong heartfelt message or render it a la the insane wuxia of the early to mid '90's. As it stands Three Kingdoms is like Zhang Yimou's Hero without the pretty artistic visuals and buzz power or like Musa without the visceral grit and cynicism.On the plus side Three Kingdoms ends by mentioning the Jin dynasty one of history's less remembered mainland dynasties. Yes we get to avoid another heralding of Qin Shihuang.This isn't trying to go heavyhanded on the movie. I'm sure they worked hard and meant well but the end result isn't satisfying  not even close. For sure we'll be getting better stuff soon both from the director and his cast. Skip this one you won't be missing much.".

I might think that she is only a refreshing 'image' due to the dominating men scene.The ending is quite disappointing. The ending is that the dynasty was reunited by Jin Dynasty. The question is who the hell is Jin? There are no dialog about it. Must we read the history book first to get the point? I'm sure that 90 minutes are too short for this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "2 stars for action sequences and the 5 pieces of costume mustered to make this film.Enough people have mentioned the horrible armour design so I won't get into it. Now. Where do I start?Zilong is Zhao Yun's courtesy name. Do not throw it around like sardines as this movie did since it is Zhao Yun is what he is more commonly rightfully known as and referred to.Changshan where Zhao Yun is from is located North East of China. It is also one of the earlier territory annexed by the Wei kingdom the antagonists of this film. The screenwriter brings it up relentlessly since he knows nothing more about Zhao Yun's well documented genealogy. So the scene where people were celebrating that he became a well known general is utter cow dun unless its people want to get sacked by their own kingdom. So the supposed plot of Zhao Yun making a last stand at Changshan to complete the full circle that is his life is ridiculous. Changshan has been chilling way behind the frontline for a long time.Zhao Yun was not born a peasant as the movie portrays him to be. He was born of Han's warrior elites and served a northern lord by the name of Gongsun Zan prior to serving Liu Bei. He was also well acquainted with Liu Guan Zhang way before the battle of Xinye  the battle the movie opened with note for director to google. Therefore the scene where Zhang Fei not knowing who Zhao Yun is and fighting him makes no sense.What resurrection of the dragon? What resurrection? What dragon?Who is that chubby guy? You actually need to put in an incompetent and jealous supporting role just to make Zhao Yun seem more awesome? If you've read half a page on Zhao Yun you would've handful of material to justify why he is the most badass person you've ever known. Instead you resorting to pulling an underdeveloped and onedimensional character out of thin air just to kill more of your audiences brain cells.Talking about stupid roles. What is point of of Maggie Q's character? Wei the dominant kingdom during all of three kingdom period with an endless pool of talented generals are all the sudden so incompetent that they need Cao Cao's granddaughter to lead and fight frontline battles for them? There is a truck load of ACTUAL female more relevant compelling characters for Maggie Q to portray if it is imperative that you give your top billed actress some screen time. Without Maggie Q to fill your empty film you'd be losing money I know.Yes Zhao Yun outlived most of his kickass contemporaries. But for him to still be chilling when Shu falls is nonsense. AND THAT CHUBBY GUY who is supposed be older than Zhao Yun IS ALSO ALIVE!!! He must be pushing 170.The ending where Mr. Chubby is like Three kingdom is now one and it's called Jin and then half quote the Ming Dynasty poem that was part of the lyrics for the opening credit song for the Three Kingdom TV series from 1994 is more hastily done than a conclusion to C students paper after he pulls an allnighter for a course no one cares about. Where is my puke bucket?Daniel Lee before you decide on taking what little creative liberty you have on classic material read a book feed your imagination it is starving. But I guess that is not your style judging by the other abomination titles you've created. If I didn't have to endure this film for research on bad film making it'd be in my furnace 5 minutes in. But to look on the bright side now I know to stay away from anything with your name on it.".

Where do I start?Zilong is Zhao Yun's courtesy name. Do not throw it around like sardines as this movie did since it is Zhao Yun is what he is more commonly rightfully known as and referred to.Changshan where Zhao Yun is from is located North East of China. It is also one of the earlier territory annexed by the Wei kingdom the antagonists of this film. The screenwriter brings it up relentlessly since he knows nothing more about Zhao Yun's well documented genealogy. So the scene where people were celebrating that he became a well known general is utter cow dun unless its people want to get sacked by their own kingdom. So the supposed plot of Zhao Yun making a last stand at Changshan to complete the full circle that is his life is ridiculous. Changshan has been chilling way behind the frontline for a long time.Zhao Yun was not born a peasant as the movie portrays him to be. He was born of Han's warrior elites and served a northern lord by the name of Gongsun Zan prior to serving Liu Bei. He was also well acquainted with Liu Guan Zhang way before the battle of Xinye  the battle the movie opened with note for director to google. Therefore the scene where Zhang Fei not knowing who Zhao Yun is and fighting him makes no sense.What resurrection of the dragon? What resurrection? What dragon?Who is that chubby guy? You actually need to put in an incompetent and jealous supporting role just to make Zhao Yun seem more awesome? If you've read half a page on Zhao Yun you would've handful of material to justify why he is the most badass person you've ever known. Instead you resorting to pulling an underdeveloped and onedimensional character out of thin air just to kill more of your audiences brain cells.Talking about stupid roles. What is point of of Maggie Q's character? Wei the dominant kingdom during all of three kingdom period with an endless pool of talented generals are all the sudden so incompetent that they need Cao Cao's granddaughter to lead and fight frontline battles for them? There is a truck load of ACTUAL female more relevant compelling characters for Maggie Q to portray if it is imperative that you give your top billed actress some screen time. Without Maggie Q to fill your empty film you'd be losing money I know.Yes Zhao Yun outlived most of his kickass contemporaries. But for him to still be chilling when Shu falls is nonsense. AND THAT CHUBBY GUY who is supposed be older than Zhao Yun IS ALSO ALIVE!!! He must be pushing 170.The ending where Mr. Chubby is like Three kingdom is now one and it's called Jin and then half quote the Ming Dynasty poem that was part of the lyrics for the opening credit song for the Three Kingdom TV series from 1994 is more hastily done than a conclusion to C students paper after he pulls an allnighter for a course no one cares about. Where is my puke bucket?Daniel Lee before you decide on taking what little creative liberty you have on classic material read a book feed your imagination it is starving. But I guess that is not your style judging by the other abomination titles you've created. If I didn't have to endure this film for research on bad film making it'd be in my furnace 5 minutes in. But to look on the bright side now I know to stay away from anything with your name on it.";

The action scenes were not bad but seemed to have no point to them. The story was hard to follow and at points you lose interest in it. Who is who is confusing and the characters are not well rounded out so much so that this feels like a movie full of extras and no stars. Magge Q is excellent but too underused and her character is just not evil enough. Any Lau may as well not have been in the movie as he is as dull as can be.So a wasted opportunity when this could have been so much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhao Zhilong a legend might not want to spend his hard earned money on this movie about his life. Really i think this movie doesn't quite live it up to the hype that it should be and if you had watched The Warlords before this one you'll really be disappointed with the whole setup of plot and action.I give credit the costumes are quite decently well done the only complain i have is that the soldiers commanders and Maggie Q's Cao Ying are too Japanese armoured. Yes their armour reminds me abit of those armour worn by soldiers samurais during the warring period. I wouldn't have minded if both Shu and Wei had the same armour but different color in this case. I give credit also for the work done for Andy Lau when he appeared as an aged Zhilong the make up really bring out the age and favour when you see the aged Zhilong.Other than that the plot strings itself quite weakly with some narration to string the viewers from one event to another. Fact is it almost felt like those cut scenes in video games where they want to bring you right into the action ... and that's how it felt at some points of the movie ... I just felt that it could be far better executed.The action scenes are nothing much to write home too. Like i said before if you had watched The Warlords you'll find it a yawn. I'm not implying i want a lot of violence and gore but there wasn't much intensity in the fights from the soldier to soldier clashing up to duels between characters i just feel a lack of intensity in most of the battle scenes.You will get to see some additional 3 Kingdom characters appearing in this movie and I really think some of the casting of characters is quite wrong. The 2 big disappointment for me was how Guan Yu looked liked way too short! and the casting for Guan Xi.All in all i wouldn't catch this movie again honestly wouldn't recommend it. To end off in a positive note i do have to say that Andy Lau is able to play a decent Zhao Zhilong just felt bad the movie doesn't really help to showcase his role!".

The similarity is to first world war helmets anyway so they would be German not Nazi for starters. Secondly everything in the film is traditionally Chinese so why are helmets any different. Thirdly there were no goodies or baddies so why do they want to subtly want to make us think that. Finally you don't think that two designs for protective headgear might just look similar.3 Agreed poor non existent characters and objective story telling. But the romance of the three kingdoms is a story which spans many years and a number of lifetimes and has countless characters. It should really have been a trilogy or a series. They really bitten off more than they could chew.Before you go and write something make sure you at least have a clue what you're talking about please.

Some good fighting scenes and nice music.BUT it is only a nice movie if you don't know anything about the actual novel or history this movie should be based on. For people who know the novel or history you can say the movie is just painful to watch at least for me. You ask why? Let me give you an comparison Since it should be based on a novel let's take LotR. So you know the story of LotR you read the novel and you just love it. Now they make a movie out of it and it will be like that Legolas is the main characterwhich is fine since we all like him. And it is about his life how he should be a great undefeated warrioroh and he is wearing a Roman armor. He started as a pawn under King Aragorn and worked all his way up and during that he hat an fight with Boromir and Theoden. And at the end he fought against the granddaughter of Sauronyou think what the heck? I have the same thought when I watched this movie who is leading Sauron's armywhen she was young Sauron took her to battles with him and ended up loosing to her and dies. Ah by the way. Gandalf looks like a beggar and fortune teller. So you see my problem with the movie? It doesn't really have anything to do with the novel. It just borrowed the names and some events.So if you don't know the novel or the story of the Three Kingdom go ahead and watch it. It's pretty amusing. But if you DO know the story and want a movie which fits to it. Don't watch it!!! It will destroy your image of the heroes in the novel. Wait for the Red Cliff movie this summer DSo it is only my opinion. Thanks for reading it.".

And at the end he fought against the granddaughter of Sauronyou think what the heck? I have the same thought when I watched this movie who is leading Sauron's armywhen she was young Sauron took her to battles with him and ended up loosing to her and dies. Ah by the way. Gandalf looks like a beggar and fortune teller. So you see my problem with the movie? It doesn't really have anything to do with the novel. It just borrowed the names and some events.So if you don't know the novel or the story of the Three Kingdom go ahead and watch it. It's pretty amusing. But if you DO know the story and want a movie which fits to it. Don't watch it!!! It will destroy your image of the heroes in the novel. Wait for the Red Cliff movie this summer DSo it is only my opinion. Thanks for reading it.";

Those who are regardless of whether through the immensely popular classic novel or through academic studies may not like the movie. While I am reasonably familiar with the background story through the novel the following comments are written from the perspective of the former.While the movie borrows liberally background and characters from The Three Kingdoms it tells its own story of the fatalistic nature of war. With its welcomed simplicity the plot allows the movie makers to focus on this theme. The story is told voice over by professional soldier Luo Pingan Sammo Hung who gets nowhere after decades of service while watching Zhao Zilong Andy Lau a young lad he recruited initially rise to become the most revered general. With impeccable loyalty to the Zu Kingdom through its rise and decline Zhao comes full circle after 30 years to the same place where he made his name. In his final battle he faces Cao Ying Maggie Q the granddaughter of the enemy he once humiliated now sworn to avenge her grandfather.This movie is a solid wellcrafted piece of coherent work. Andy Lau is perfect for the role of the hero. Maggie Q has demonstrated before that she is more than just a pretty face when it comes to gritty action. In this movie she also projects the ferocious intensity inherited from a grandfather a ruthless cunning emperor and warrior. The action is second to none particularly the stunning combat scenes on horseback. The photography does full justice to the savagely beautiful landscape and desolate mood. There is also a scene when the haunting sound of the pipa takes the horror of the slaughter in the battlefield to a new dimension. This movie is among the very best in its genre in recent memory.".

Armies charging at each other individual battles with ONE person killing everything in sight one swipe of the spear taking out everyone within reach bodies flying and one person being able to defeat an army.The 3 Kingdoms is used as a back drop for this movie. It is only used to set the characters and the time period. At no point is there any plot concerning the 3 kingdoms. The story is base on the military life of ZiLong. His enlistment as a recruit how he won fame and became a general then it fast forwards to his last battle. No character development or even a story. This is strictly an action movie.There have been many negative comments regarding costuming especially how the armour look Japanese. I would say that most ancient armour look alike but in this case the producers have taken artistic license to up the cool factor for the armour. The 1st thing i noticed were the helmets British Tommy Helmets and German Fritz helmets. Also noticed how the more peaceful guys had the Tommy helmets and the invading hordes the Fritz helmets.My main complain not only with this movie but the made in China historical epics is how it reeks of government propaganda. Divided nationpeople and how sacrifices must be made of one self or of the people to achieve unity. Trust the leaders the sacrifice is for the good of the nation.".

Ray uses his common sense and knowledge of the streets to chase the criminal Angel Tezo Ramon Rodriguez that survived the slaughter and is the main witness of the crime. However he also discloses a network of corruption in the police department and has a moral dilemma when he finds that his brotherinlaw and also officer Jimmy Eagan Colin Farrell is dirty and a drugdealer.The complex Pride and Glory has a confused beginning where many situations are disclosed without the necessary development of the characters. However after fifteen twenty minutes the viewer has the big picture of the events and sees many parallel dramatic subplots and the promising movie is highly engaging. Unfortunately the conclusion is terrible from the moment that Ray decides to meet Jimmy in a bar and bring his brotherinlaw arrested with him. Why doesn't he go to the Internal Affairs and tells the truth instead supported by his brother? The fight and the subsequent death of Jimmy would be enough to sentence him guilty in any court.

	schema:reviewBody "The Tierney family is a family of cops across the generations  with cops even married into the family. When a NYPD officer is killed in a violent drugrelated shootout Ray Tierney is asked by his father to be part of the task force dedicated to finding out who it was who killed one of their own. Ray agrees as the unit affected is led by his brother Francis and includes his brotherinlaw Jimmy. With Ray searching the streets for the truth Francis already knows more than him as his men are involved in activities outside the law using their roles within the police as cover. Everyone wants to close the matter but not everyone wants the truth to come out in doing so.The release of Pride and Glory was delayed and the suggestion reason was its similarity in tone and broad theme to We Own the Night. I'm not sure whether this is true or not but I will question whether it was necessary to delay this film if the aim was that it would avoid comparison with other films or feeling like it is something the viewer has seen before. I question this because the film's biggest failing is that we have seen it all before and it doesn't really bring much beyond the star names to justify me being excited about seeing it again. This is not to say it is awful although some have but just that it is very familiar and very sturdy  sturdy being a quality one looks for in furniture rather than films. Thankfully the film doesn't keep the corruption in the cupboard for very long because to suggest it is a mystery would be an insult to the viewer who can pretty much see where the film is heading about 90 minutes before it gets there.With many stories it is hard to plough a new furrow so one does find that often films have a familiar narrative and that this is not a problem. The thing is to draw the viewer in despite having seen it before or perhaps knowing where it is going  make them hope for different make them care about the characters you put the fact that this is a film with an ending to the back of your mind. Pride and Glory doesn't manage to do this though and it surprised me considering the actors involved. The problem is not really with them though but with the material which has too many characters but too little development of them. Norton seems a bit lost in this but still does turn in a solid performance. Likewise Farrell is good and it only further highlights how much of a waste it is not to give them more to work off individually and together. Voight and Emmerich add to this but again neither has the material to really do good work with so although nobody is bad nobody really impresses either. O'Connor does an OK job as director but doesn't get much urgency or emotion into it  although this is the result of failing to do the same as writer.Pride and Glory is a solid but wholly unremarkable film that is distracting but unmemorable. It feels old and dated despite still being in the cinema and I imagine this will only be worse when it arrives on television in about five years time. The names involved are impressive but nobody can really deliver what they are able to because the material is just not there in the depth they require. Not a bad film by any means just one that is hard to get excited about or shake the feeling that you've seen it done better elsewhere.".

I might be one of those small handful that are in the middle Pride and Glory is an alright cop drama not amazing or really terrible. It borrows from many movies and TV shows this much is definite and its directorial style goes between fine competence with actual dialog scenes with the occasional noirish flourish and overbearing with the handheld in action scenes. It seems as if no cop drama in recent memory can quite come up to the height that Narc reached with that coincidentally in this case Narc director Carnahan had a part in writing PG's script and for most of the running time the film suffers from a lack of real stylistic vigor.But thankfully a big but the performances are all stellar allaround. From the big players like Edward Norton who unless under duress or restraint by the studio turns in fantastic work that's subtle for the camera but as intense as a theater performance and Colin Farrell gaining cred fast this year with this In Bruges and underrated Cassandra's Dream Jon Voight who somehow has bounced back from the STPnightmare appearance in Bratz and character actor Noah Emmerich often with one facial expression tension and an inner sadness but still good if not as good as Little Children to Jennifer Ehle who plays Emmerich's dying wife who is for every moment she's on screen absolutely terrific and even makes great scenes out of otherwise OK elements.This is in fact a real actor's movie unlike Righteous Kill which rested entirely on he heels of its two stars and for all the blackandwhiteandsometimesgray areas of the script about a family of cops who become embroiled in one member Jimmy Farrell and his incredulously corrupt dealings and murders the bulk of the cast make it more than watchable one is almost fooled from time to time with all its rampant cursing and crazy bits i.e. threatening hotiron on a baby that it is great. But it isn't. So much of its plot is middling and only sparks of fascinating scenes keep it together like when a sleazy Hispanic character pays a personal call to Jimmy's house while his family is home and its final 15 minutes are a mix of wild hysterics a supporting character part of Jimmy's corrupt crew snaps in a convenience store during a 'pickup' and a big raceinspired protest happens on cue and a trueblue Irish bar fight that perhaps would've benefited from John Ford rising from the grave to guest direct.So catch it on TV now that it's almost gone from theaters if you haven't seen it yet and judge for yourself if it's high low or in the middle of expectations. I'm in the middle though it does seem like the kind of OK movie that may play better on repeat viewings when nothing much else is on. 6.510".

So my friends and I watched Pride and Glory a little over a week ago I was hearing mixed reviews on it but still when you love these actors as much as I do you have to see it. So based on my honest opinion this is a very good story but the film just needed better editing it was a little longer than it should have been. Also I didn't really like the ending although I know they did it more for the cinematic reasons as people wanna see the bad guys pay for their crimes. But Ed Colin and even John Voight make this film very watchable and click right on screen. We've seen a million crooked cop movies I think we're still looking for one that really stands out but Pride and Glory holds itself well and is watchable.Jimmy is a narc who does pretty much all the dirty work when it comes to busting in on drug dealers hookers murderers rapists etc. One night though he among other cops receive a call that 4 policemen have been killed in a building with drug dealers. Jimmy is trying to figure out what went wrong only to find out that one of the drug dealers had an inside man who called in advance to warn them that the cops were coming. But one of the policemen that he suspects is his brother inlaw who does the best he can to justify all that he is doing.Pride and Glory is a very good story I'd say though to wait for the rental but I'm warning you there are some really intense scenes Colin goes really far in one scene with a baby I'm a person who has seen every disturbing film known to man and this scene had my hands over my eyes. If you wanna see this film you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some shocking lines as well and hurtful this was just an intense movie and is not for the weak hearted. It's like the more disturbing episode of The Shield in some ways. Ed and Colin work well together and are a great duo Pride and Glory is a good movie just needs a little more editing.710".

Honest cop Ray Tierney Edward Norton starts with the proper approach getting a statement from an eye witness to what may have gone on in the shape of an innocent unlying child who admits to having seen notorious drug dealer Angel Tezo Ramon Rodriguez fleeing from the scene in fear. With what happened starting to look fairly obvious the hunt begins for Tezo. Unfortunately that includes less honest cops Jimmy Egan Colin Farrell related to Ray through marriage and his men whose corrupt activities have lead to the murders. It all builds up to a devastating battle between family and friends loyalty and justice truth and honour.As any one who's glanced at the trivia section or Empire Magazine! will already know work on Pride and Glory was scheduled to begin as far back as 2001 but owing to America's characteristically patriotic respect for NY cops who risked their lives to save lives that fateful day any suggestion of corruption amongst them was deemed well unpatriotic and it's been left till seven years later for the film to come out. It would appear the most high profile film to come from writerdirector Gavin O' Connor whose other credits appear a smattering of unheard of films that have skipped the sort of exposure this one's got.Though a few have claimed the film has been done before which it surely has it is still far more than a standard straightforward cop thriller with an intelligent twisty turny screenplay that keeps you hooked with it's developments and raw honesty. Despite this the narrative flow fails to keep going as well as you'd like and a fair few scenes gracelessly flow on from the last one rather than keeping you hooked for them. Also on the plus side are strong solid performances from leading men Norton and Farrell not to mention Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich as the other honest well meaning fatherson cop team caught up in the middle of the corrupt shenanigans as everyone else. But Norton and Farrell not only have good presence they have good chemistry together and it's a shame they're scenes together are too few. Another down point is their climactic fisticuffs session which feels corny and out of place amongst what has been a raw unflinching brutally and unsearingly honest cop film up till now belonging more at the end of a Jet Li or Chuck Norris movie to be honest.Still this is a solid well made cop thriller that was still quite worth the wait.

Another down point is their climactic fisticuffs session which feels corny and out of place amongst what has been a raw unflinching brutally and unsearingly honest cop film up till now belonging more at the end of a Jet Li or Chuck Norris movie to be honest.Still this is a solid well made cop thriller that was still quite worth the wait.

Some parts weren't even necessary. As such the beginning the random football game had no point and the ending didn't tie all the loose ends. The lighting was dim and barely visible at times. The camera was unstable and shaky which makes no sense in a dramatic movie such as this does better in a movie like Quarantine. This is probably because the movie instead of using a rail carried it by hand in some parts. It made the unnecessary scene into longer scene whereas the action and the important dialogue was cut up into short pieces. The editing and transitions could also use a lot of work too. There were scenes where a different language was used but no subtitles were given which is practically a middle finger in my case. Everybody swears fuck shit bitch it's as if the actors had just quit smoking or it was their period. Finally the acting was probably mediocre at best all together even with more experienced actors like Edward Norton and Colin Farell. If you like a good movie watch Body of Lies or something that doesn't make you say I was expecting more or What the hell was that piece of crap? Do anything but don't watch this movie.".

The level of violence profanity and some nudity may be offensive to some but it is an R rated movie after all. Definitely not a popcorn movie meant for kids.The artistic direction cast of characters and film technique was superb. It hearkens back to the old days when the true value of a movie was in its plot and acting not a bunch of scifi Hollywood special effects.I actually watched it at the Chicago International Film Festival with the director Gavin O'Connor present for a QA session at the end of the show. His comments were very insightful. The film took over 9 years to come to fruition little had to do with the shoot which took only 60 days.

It's not until after the 30 minute mark that the storyline is finally spelled out for those of us who can't cut through all the nonsense at the start. Thanks to outstanding performances by Edward Norton and Jon Voight this is definitely a MUST see film. All the action will literally have you on the edge of your seat towards the end. However I'd advise you to spend the first 30 minutes doing something more productive with your time like standing outside in the concession line for popcorn and candy. In the bathroom washing your hands. Maybe on your cell phone having a conversation with your mother would be less punishment than watching the poor set up of this cop flick. But do go out and see this film!!! Just be sure to leave the kids at home because the profanity nudity and violence was even a bit too much for some of the adults in the audience. Enjoy.".

The end result is a film that is destined to be one of the many unremarkable titles that line the racks at the local DVD outlet or pad the bargain bins at department stores.As the police often say move along folks there's nothing to see here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Generally when I get caught watching a bad movie I try as hard as I can to stay to the end. As a movie lover I feel obliged to give a movie the benefit of the doubt. Just because the first half was so terrible doesn't mean it can't get better.However there was one scene in Pride and Glory that had me eyeing the theater exit. It involves Colin Farrell's character trying to get information out of a suspect by threatening to disfigure his infant child with a steaming clothes iron. Thankfully the iron never touches the babies flesh but Farrell keeps it about a half an inch away from the baby's face so you know it's burning the poor kid.It's a extremely unpleasant scene in what has by this point proved to be an aggressively lugubrious police procedural.Pride and Glory is drenched in such a suffocating doomfilled atmosphere that it leaves you feeling depressed when it's over. About ninety percent of the movie consists of characters fighting back tears and having emotional outbursts while the other ten is devoted to scenes of police brutality and torture.And it's all filmed in many drab and murky compositions. Director Gavin O'Conner films everything in such thick blues and grays that it lends the movie a spectacularly unattractive visual polish.If this movie has a message it's that life sucks and occasionally good people suffer because of it. It's a spectacularly stupid movie handled in such a lethargic and derivative way that the movie's two hour and nine minute running time feels twice as long.The movie stars Edward Norton in a role that wastes his considerable talents. He plays Ray Tierney a sadeyed New York City cop with a troubled past who spends much of his time working on missing persons cases.However after four cops end up dead in a drug bust Ray is called to investigate by his highranking police officer father Francis Tierney Sr. Jon Voight. His investigation leads him to a circle of crooked cops one that involves his older brother Francis Jr. Noah Emmerich and his hotheaded brotherinlaw Jimmy Egan Colin Farrell.What little plot there is is padded out with clichd side stories involving Francis Jr.'s cancer striken wife Jennifer Ehle and Ray trying to work things out with his long suffering wife Carmen Ejogo.This is all stuff we've seen in a dozen of other movies done with a lot more energy humor and conviction than it is here.Take for instance last year's grossly underrated cop thriller We Own the Night. That movie while far from a perfect film at least had some bitingly intense action scenes and a trio of actors who were able to convince you that they were a family.Pride and Glory has none of these things. Although the movie has an Alist cast there is not a single convincing performance in the entire film which renders the scenes of family bonding painfully artificial. There is hardly any action in the movie to punctuate the tedium save for a risible bar fight between Ray and Jimmy in the final third.However what really sinks the movie is the incredibly nasty vibe Gavin O'Conner gives the material. The scene involving the infant is bad enough there is another particularly stomach turning scene where Jimmy and a couple of his goons were shoving what looked like a lead pipe down one suspects throat.Pride and Glory sat on the shelves for a few years because of its depiction of crooked cops in a post911 New York City. As far as I'm concerned it should've stayed on the shelves because there is nothing in this movie to entertain anyone.".

O'Connor and has crew seem to have gone out of their way to achieve authenticity in their film and they have succeeded for the most parts. The director's sincerity is also apparent as he steers clear from sentimentality.His style of execution cinematography art direction lighting and use of score is very detailed. In addition he has extracted some fine performances from his principle cast that includes Jon Voight Edward Norton Noah Emmerich and especially Colin Farrell this is easily one of the best works of his career. The women do not have much to do but Jennifer Ehle stands out. John Ortiz and Frank Grillo lend strong support.Of course 'Pride and Glory' is not without its share of drawbacks. It does risk being a little too Hollywood at times. For example was it really necessary to have a boxingwrestling barfight sequence near the end?

	schema:reviewBody "With a script that entered into production in 2001 Pride and Glory was one of the most highly prized screenplays in Hollywood with names like Mark Wahlberg and Hugh Jackman attached to the leading roles. But because of the attack on 11th September 2001 the idea of film about dirty NYPD officers would have been in bad taste. It proposed until 2008 and had Ed Norton and Colin Farrell in the lead roles. So was it worth the wait?Pride and Glory tells the story of a family of Irish American men who are members of the NYPD. Ray Ed Norton is a skilled investigator and a plain clothes detective whilst his brotherinlaw Jimmy Colin Farrell is a midranking uniformed officer. The family seem close but all have their problems Ray is suffering from guilt of a previous case gone wrong and his marriage falling apart. His brother Francis Jr. Noah Emmerich a senior station chief is having to support his wife whom suffering from cancer and their father Francis Sr. Jon Voight is a even more senior police officer and a borderline alcoholic. Only Jimmy seems to have a strong family life. The family and officers are called into action when four of Francis Jr. officers are killed in action and all of them are colleagues of Jimmy. Ray is assigned the case but soon discovers that it a much more complex case of a simple shooting. Jimmy and his colleagues had been running amok within Francis Jr.'s station as the man is struggling with his personal life. Jimmy is a corrupt cop selling drugs robbing and acting like a paid assassin. He uses violence and imitation to get revenge and retrieve money his crew has lost. But Ray is slowly closing in on his brotherinlaw and a professional and personal conflict is about to arise.Gavin O'Conner is an effective director trying to make a gritty and violence film about the NYPD. His effects are noble he does not tone down the violence and the physical poverty that some people would have to live in. He films it in a slightly grey ting and uses handheld cameras very effectively giving the film a realistic and almost documentary style to it. There is also strong performances from Norton and Farrell though he is forced into angry mode for most of the film. Voight is also pretty good throughout the film. But some of the supporting cast members were weaker in comparison particular Emmerich who did not seem to match Norton or Farrell.What makes the film not as strong as it should be is the script. It should have been a simple straightforward policethriller and attempt to be a update of the Al Pacino film Serpico. It attempted to be realistic and could and should have shown how corrupt cops can work in a modern setting and how other police officers would investigate them. But the screenwriters of O'Conner and Joe Carnahan do two big problems first is that it's a bit unrealistic that a whole family this day and age would all be cops and even more unlikely a senior father cop could assign cases to his sons. In real life wouldn't the police authorities split them up to ensure there is no favouritism? Second is the plot is bogged down with too many subplots it's noble of the writers to bring about some extra character development but there was too much that detracts from the main plot of the film and some areas lead to no where like the journalist subplot. What the two writers could have done was either cut out most of the subplots to make a tort film making the film longer extend the subplots and made the film a bit longer or really extend everything about the film and a make an effective 'The Wire' type TV series. The film also suffers from so very silly unrealistic scenes like Ray and Jimmy clearing a bar and then having a big fist fight. The dialogue too was weak suffering from the usual copfilm clichs we have all heard before. Finally the film also drags a little in the beginning and goes a little silly in the end. It was the middle part of the film which was the best.There was potential in the film but it was not fully realised. It needed some rewrites before it should have been made. But it is a noble effort of film.".

	schema:headline " One of the best narrative films of the 1980's";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is a fictional reworking of the true story of the Esslin Sisters one of whom was a successful social democratic feminist writer and the other a revolutionary member of the terrorist BaaderMeinhof Group also called the Red Army Faction. Three members of the real Badder Meinhof group Andreas Baader Gudrun Enslin and JeanCarl Raspe mysteriously committed suicide while in prison after other members of the RAF allegedly participated in the kidnapping and eventual murder of a wealthy businessman and an aborted hijacking attempt. Popular opinion in Germany and most other places has always held that Baader Enslin and Raspe were murdered by the state. Much evidence seems to point towards reasonable doubt that the three took their own lives. Von Totta takes the story of these two women and creates a kind of historical canvas much as Orson Welles does with Hearst in Citizen Kane to explore a wide range of issues concerning modern political and social life. The film is remarkably fair minded. Although the narrative spends much more time with Julianne the social democratic journalist it does not stack the deck towards her. Her reformist views towards social change seems forced and at times desperate. Nor does Von Trotta romanticize Marianne the revolutionary. Her actions are often ill conceived and her confidence that history will prove her correct seem equally forced and desperate. Amazingly Von Trotta creates a dialectic in this film by actually sympathizing with both women. She seems to suggest that in the remarkable confusion and despair of the late 20th century simply to attempt to remain engaged with a project that desires fundamental change is an act of hope. The film is probably best known for its impeccable acting. The two leading performers Barbara Sukowa Marianne and Jutta Lempe Julianne are extraordinary. There scenes together are examples of some of the finest acting in contemporary cinema. The supporting performances in this film are also superb. One of the remarkable things is the way the film shows that two children from the same family could become radicalized in such different ways. The film definitely roots the women's politicalization in their family and national history. Why does one Sister become convinced that violent revolution is possible and necessary while the other becomes convinced that a nonviolent war of position is the more appropriate choice? Both women have clearly broken from the conservative tradition of their upbringing in the home of their Protestant Minister Father but what is it that has caused the ideological differences? Von Trotta is wise enough not to answer this question directly or didactically.The late Canadian film critic Jay Scott said in a review of the film The methodology is Proustian Von Trotta cuts with effortless clarity back and forth through the sister's lives. This seems to be a remarkably efficient way of explaining the films structure and effect. The remarkable editing of this film by Dagmar Hirtz whose excellent work has won him three German film awards Check out his equally amazing contributions to Maximillian Schells END OF THE GAME Jeanine Meerapfel's MALOU and Volker Schlondorff's VOYAGER and the cinematography by Franz Rath whose lensed most of Von Trotta's films should be studied as textbook examples of narrative film craftsmanship. The technical aspects of the film make the time tripping narrative technique seem natural rather than distancing. Later in the same review Scott says what I think is the most precise statement ever written about the film Marianne and Julianne is a document that struggles to come to terms with an impossible past in a barely feasible present and its director appears to realize that her film like its heroines is trapped by history which is why she avoids pretending to be definitive  either about the sisters or about the agonies of the nation she has presumed to concretize in their story. This defiant stance of refusing to be definitive about character motivations and ethicalideological essences connects the film to a wide variety of other masterworks that have also used contemporary history in a similarly complex way I am reminded particularly of Alain Resnais esp. Hiroshima Mon Amor and Muriel. I can't recommend this film highly enough. It is to my mind one of the most".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1960s and early 1970s radical student groups frustrated with the lack of results from peaceful protests against the Vietnam War channeled their energies into campaigns of direct action. In the U.S. The Weathermen engaged in widespread civil disobedience including bombings of the Pentagon and the Capitol buildings. In West Germany a leftwing group that came to be known as the Baader Meinhof Gang or the Red Army Faction attempted to foment a Marxiststyle revolution by engaging in terroriststyle attacks a campaign that led to robbing banks kidnappings and ultimately murder. The three main founding members were Andreas Baader Gudrun Ensslin and Ulrike Meinhof. All were captured and sent to prison.Maragarethe von Trotta's 1981 film Marianne and Juliane is based on the life of Gudrun Ensslin and her sister Charlotte. Though supporting the same causes the sisters have a wide divergence of opinion about how to achieve their aims. Juliane Jutta Lampe is a feminist reporter who believes that social change can be achieved through political channels while her sister Marianne Barbara Sukowa is a member of a terrorist group and believes that violence is justified by the righteousness of her cause. Ms. von Trotta assumes that the viewer has some knowledge of the historical context and does not show specific incidents of direct action or even the source of the group's disaffection. Rather the film is a character study of the two sisters and how Marianne's radical activities affected the people around her.As the film opens Marianne has left her husband and has gone underground as an urban terrorist. Her exhusband Werner visits Julianne to persuade her to care for their young son Jan telling her that he has accepted a position in Bali for one year and cannot take Jan with him. Juliane who lives with her long time companion Wolfgang Rudiger Vogler is unsympathetic and tells him that she can only accept Jan for a few days that arrangements must be made to place the boy in a foster home. Soon after we learn that Werner has committed suicide. The story is told using episodic flashbacks that cut in and out of present time often disrupting the narrative flow. We see the sisters in various stages of their childhood and adolescence in a conservative household where their father was a rigid Presbyterian minister. One flashback depicts how viewing films of the Holocaust in school impacted them deeply.Juliane's compassion leads her to try to prevent Marianne from continuing her unproductive rage but she is not successful. Marianne is arrested presumably for her part in a bombing campaign and sent to prison where she is kept separate and apart from the other prisoners. Although Marianne recognizes that her sister is her last remaining contact with the outside world she rejects Juliane's attempt at support through her magazine and goes on a hunger strike protesting the group's isolation. When Marianne refuses to back down or compromise the result is sad but inevitable.At the end Juliane calls her sister an exceptional woman yet the film does not show us much evidence of this. Although I'm inclined to believe it is true von Trotta depicts Marianne as rigid and doctrinaire and clearly leaves the impression that any attempt to foment violent revolution in a consumerdriven society is doomed to fail. In any event what does emerge clearly however is the bond of love and support between each sister brought to life by the magnificent performances of Jutta Lampe and Barbara Sukowa who render their characters with psychological insight and emotional truth.".

For me Marianne's conviction as an adult and cheeky behavior as a young woman was enticing and contagious but Juliane's gentle soul was lovely and engaging the cause for her is built from woman to woman with sorority at the center supporting each other establishing strong bonds and for that same reason I think her role is even a little more hopeful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die bleierne Zeit or Marianne  Juliane or The German Sisters is a West German 105minute film from 1981 so it has its 35th anniversary this year. The major plot in this film is all about women's rights so it is fitting that this was made by Margarethe von Trotta one of Germany's most successful female filmmakers. She worked on several occasions during her career with Barbara Sukowa and this is just one of these. Sukowa won a German Film Award for her portrayal here her first and she was around the age of 30 at this point. Her colead Jutta Lampe who was also nominated but lost to Sukowa was a bit older already. They play sisters here that both fight for rights of females. One does it as something you could perhaps call a terrorist already so no surprise that she gets arrested. The other gives it a more reserved approach as she is a writer. The main male character the boyfriend of one of the two women is played by Rdiger Vogler whom you may know from Wim Wenders' early works perhaps. This movie was really successful back then as it won many awards including Best Picture at the German Film Awards that year. But almost ironically given the film's topic von Trotta did not get the Best Director trophy. My personal opinion about this film is not too positive. I think Lampe did a good job and if anybody deserved an award for it then her. But Sukowa who always plays the same characters and shows the same mannerisms has been overrated by awards bodies for decades. Admittedly here she is not as bad as in some of her worst work but also far from good and certainly not deserving of any individual honors. The script is soso. You probably need to care a whole lot about emancipation to see the good outweigh the bad in this one. I must say that I was never really too much interested in the main characters or what happened to them the way the story was depicted. That's why I have chosen to give it a thumbsdown. The German Film Awards got it wrong that year. It may have been the right choice not to submit this one to the Oscars. I don't recommend the watch.".

It is much smaller in scale due to the lower budget and is basically a retreat of the group of people trapped formula. There can't be any doubt that the movie could have been made better with more time and money its still however a considerate addition to a storyline with vast potential.

During a scuffle with some Witch hunters Carnby is stabbed with the dagger  gets infected with 'lines'  has dreams  visions of a woman named Elisabeth Dexter Allison Lange being scarified with said dagger during a supernatural ceremony. Now Elisabeth is back as an evil ghost Witch who kills anyone who has become infected with the 'lines'  Elisabeth also wants to possess her ancestor Natalie Dexter Rachel Spector who along with her worried father Bill Moseley form half the Witch hunting team. The Witch hunters believe that by finding Elisabeth's remains she can be laid to rest for good  that Carnby's visions hold to key to where Elisabeth is buried but the evil ghost Witch tries to kill them all before they get to her remains...Written  directed by the duo of Michael Roesch  Peter Scheerer this is the direct to video sequel to Alone in the Dark 2005 which itself was based on a video game of the same name although had very little to do with the video game besides featuring lead character Edward Carnby  Alone in the Dark II has nothing to do with the game either but also has nothing to do with the original Alone in the Dark beside the returning character of Edward Carnby. Got that? Good. Alone in the Dark II is a spectacularly bad film on all levels from the incomprehensible script to the cheap production values to a wasted cast of veterans who deserve to be in better films than Alone in the Dark II. The script is a mess from start to finish there's so much supernatural nonsense that the makers keep bombarding the audience with that it becomes hard to keep up. By the time the end came  Carnby was holding that birds head in a wooden barrel with light shooting out I was thinking just who the hell did the film end up at this point? From things like a disintegrating dagger that never does disintegrate at all to an infection that causes'lines' on a person body that move for some reason to the ability of the Witch to track the infected to moving foundations of laboratories to character's firing machine guns at the ghost even though bullets don't do anything at all to people trying to look scared in a wire fenced cage to a guy who has kidnapped Carnby leaving his gun next to where Carnby is sleeping to a trap filled laboratory where all the answers to the traps are written on a piece of paper in plain sight to a senseless twist ending in which the Witch wanted the events that happened to happen exactly the way that they did  a climax where to bring his girlfriend back from the dead Carnby has to stab her in the chest with a dagger. At 80 odd minutes long I was throughly bored it tries to be a mystery but each new part of the puzzle the script gives us just confuses things even more  the script ends up being a complete mess of character's talking supernatural rubbish that means nothing  trying to look serious or scared at the appropriate time.There isn't even any decent horror scenes here to get a kiddie friendly PG rating there's no blood or gore apart from a leg wound  a dead body. The CGI computer effects are OK but a swirling mass of lines that merge to form a CGI Witch just doesn't look that impressive. There's no real buildup or tension or atmosphere the whole film is quite bright  just looks like noone involved tried that hard. Surely fans of the video game series  film fans in general won't be happy with this senseless  confused supernatural ghost story that lacks logic scares  any sort of gore.The IMDb says this had a budget of about 4600000 which I find hard to believe surely it was a lot less than that? Where did all the money go? Sure it's competently made but totally uninvolving  bland. Apparently shot in California  New York. There's a good cast here with the likes of Lance Henriksen Danny Trejo Bill Moseley  Jason Connery but the material is awful  they are slumming it here.Alone in the Dark II is an awful fantasy horror thriller that is a total mess from start to finish with a senseless script that tries to do too much. No real horror thanks to the PG rating several well liked stars wasted  a really boredom to the whole affair I would say that the original Alone in the Dark is far better than this.".

By the time the end came  Carnby was holding that birds head in a wooden barrel with light shooting out I was thinking just who the hell did the film end up at this point? From things like a disintegrating dagger that never does disintegrate at all to an infection that causes'lines' on a person body that move for some reason to the ability of the Witch to track the infected to moving foundations of laboratories to character's firing machine guns at the ghost even though bullets don't do anything at all to people trying to look scared in a wire fenced cage to a guy who has kidnapped Carnby leaving his gun next to where Carnby is sleeping to a trap filled laboratory where all the answers to the traps are written on a piece of paper in plain sight to a senseless twist ending in which the Witch wanted the events that happened to happen exactly the way that they did  a climax where to bring his girlfriend back from the dead Carnby has to stab her in the chest with a dagger. At 80 odd minutes long I was throughly bored it tries to be a mystery but each new part of the puzzle the script gives us just confuses things even more  the script ends up being a complete mess of character's talking supernatural rubbish that means nothing  trying to look serious or scared at the appropriate time.There isn't even any decent horror scenes here to get a kiddie friendly PG rating there's no blood or gore apart from a leg wound  a dead body. The CGI computer effects are OK but a swirling mass of lines that merge to form a CGI Witch just doesn't look that impressive. There's no real buildup or tension or atmosphere the whole film is quite bright  just looks like noone involved tried that hard. Surely fans of the video game series  film fans in general won't be happy with this senseless  confused supernatural ghost story that lacks logic scares  any sort of gore.The IMDb says this had a budget of about 4600000 which I find hard to believe surely it was a lot less than that? Where did all the money go? Sure it's competently made but totally uninvolving  bland. Apparently shot in California  New York. There's a good cast here with the likes of Lance Henriksen Danny Trejo Bill Moseley  Jason Connery but the material is awful  they are slumming it here.Alone in the Dark II is an awful fantasy horror thriller that is a total mess from start to finish with a senseless script that tries to do too much. No real horror thanks to the PG rating several well liked stars wasted  a really boredom to the whole affair I would say that the original Alone in the Dark is far better than this.";

The main thing that ticked me off was that the characters made stupid choices that no logical person would think were a good idea. It was established pretty early on in the movie that bullets don't work against ghosts so why do the the Protagonists fail to realize this constantly trying to mow down the witchy phantom with machine gun fire?! Its like trying to kill the Blob with a knife it ain't gonna work folks.I didn't see the ending because I was watching it online and once I reached 70 min in the movie the website showing it pulled the good ol' you must pay to watch the rest of this movie. I assume the remaining characters all die horribly and in a manner so that an Alone in the Dark 3 can never be made.".

Film snobs obviously will think it sucks but people who love a good campy horror film will be bored out of their mind as well.

Perhaps we have traded out the bad from the previous film actually everything aside from the name has been taken out of the last film and the games but what have we gained in return?In this story Edward Carnby has somehow transformed from Christian Slater into Rick Yune whose only relevance to the Alone in the Dark universe seems to be his name. He accidentally gets stabbed by some crazy guy with a magic knife it looks like a decorative butter knife An immortal witch stalks Carby in visions and some random family and their animal husbanding friend decide to protect him owing to family history. Despite being Carnby's protectors they threaten to kill him some generic captain of the guards type goon talks tough to him and everyone generally yells at him at a moderate volume I've never seen so many people so angry at random things yelling so quietly. Then again I've not seen many films with acting this bad.What baffled me most of all about the reviews I read was the acclaim for Bill Moseley. I love a lot of things he has done but a combination of the worst character and a general lack of enthusiasm made his role one of the least appealing parts of this film. He is constantly angry at the most moronic things like at Carnby for getting stabbed and being hunted by an immortal witch and deals with it by speaking loudly in a monotone at everyone.The bottom line the plot is stupid and barely justified the script amateurish the acting ranging from acceptable to atrocious and there isn't even enough gore or jumps in the dark to make it fun to laugh at. As others have noted nobody is alone because they all stand around in bovinelike herds the sets are rarely very dark and everyone unloads machine guns into the walls separating them from ephemeral ghost witches.

This movie had potential. The story and especially the themes are interesting and the movie did have a huge cast of names. Lance Henriksen Bill Moseley just to name a few.

Also Lance Henrikson did the best he could with this Cleveland steamer of a film. Rick Yune is more wooden than a tree with no charisma at all. Ralf Moeller has fallen very far from his great performance in Gladiator and Rachel Specter is just plain bad. B movie regulars Michael Pare Natassia Malthe and Danny Trejo all have very limited screen time in this flick too. The film is all over the place making one wonder if they had missed some important information in a previous scene but you don't. The new info appears out of nowhere. At no point was i even startled by the witch. This i blame on the directors as very little tension or atmosphere was created for action scenes. This film just plods along quite slowly in fact. I was glad to see it end at 80 minutes. Dare i say it I enjoyed number one much better. Shoot me now for i just said i liked a Uwe Boll film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hear Me or Ting Shuo as it referred to in native language is a semirecent Taiwanese film that is part of the current wave of Taiwan cinema that's making a name for itself outside of the more traditional Asian movie making powerhouses. Welcome to the party Taiwan! The more the better I says!SPOILERS AHEAD!Is this movie gimmicky?...YES!. In fact it's totally dependent on its gimmick to make it all work. With regards to gimmicky movies I often try to think about what it would be like if you removed the underlying gimmick from the equation in order to better judge it i.e. would it still be a good movie if you did so?...You just can't do that here though because there would be no movie without the gimmick.Story This is a romantic drama that revolves around two deaf sisters who can only communicate through sign language this is the gimmick. The two sisters do their best to make a living while realizing their goals in a world where the cards are heavily stacked against them. One of the sisters is an aspiring swimmer and the younger sis tries to encourage and support her while trying to make ends meet for the both of them. Life is tough though and they keep getting more crap piled on them no matter how hard they try to succeed.Enter our young hero. He works for his family's restaurant and delivers meals all over town. On his route is the athleticswimming facility for the deaf where he happens upon the younger of the two sisters. He's not deaf but he does happen to know sign language and he's instantly smitten with the young deaf sister upon meeting her. So he pursues her and there's your romantic angle of the story line. The actress playing the young deaf sister is the tiniest and cutest thing ever and the lead actor who portrays the guy interested in her is suitably adorable  likable. She's pretty cautious and somewhat standoffish but he persists and perhaps love can one day bloom between the two if everything works out. They would make the cutest couple ever if so.The two actresses starring as the deaf sisters are really good in their roles. I obviously don't know the Taiwanese version of sign language but it sure does look like the 2 actresses do. As a result there's a number of thoughtful and touchingemotional signed scenes between the two of them throughout the film that are very nicely done. The main male lead gets the job done quite well. Aside from them the only other meaningful characters in this movie are the mother  father of the male lead and they are just flat out awesome in their respective roles.This movie also had a very well done end game goalresult that caught me off guard a bi. IIt's really really really rare that a movie or TV show will make me say HmmmI wasn't expecting that to happen!There's a lot to like with this movie the story is pretty good and well thought out all the characters are likable and it's well shotfilmed throughout. Perhaps the most impressive aspect about this film is its musical scoring  sound effects the soundtrack hits all the proper notes when  where needed throughout and the subtle use of background noise when the deaf are communicating is nothing short of outstanding. Bottom Line This Movie is pretty good. It's an uber cute dramatic love story with a gimmick that makes for a great date night watch. What's wronglacking?...not much other than its too freakin' long. As such some fat trimming would have definitely benefited this film. Nevertheless it is quite well done overall as is. And I just absolutely loved it!So 8 out of 10 stars for me!...Solidly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Hear Me or Ting Shuo as it referred to in native language is a semirecent Taiwanese film that is part of the current wave of Taiwan cinema that's making a name for itself outside of the more traditional Asian movie making powerhouses. Welcome to the party Taiwan! The more the better I says!SPOILERS AHEAD!Is this movie gimmicky?...YES!. In fact it's totally dependent on its gimmick to make it all work. With regards to gimmicky movies I often try to think about what it would be like if you removed the underlying gimmick from the equation in order to better judge it i.e. would it still be a good movie if you did so?...You just can't do that here though because there would be no movie without the gimmick.Story This is a romantic drama that revolves around two deaf sisters who can only communicate through sign language this is the gimmick. The two sisters do their best to make a living while realizing their goals in a world where the cards are heavily stacked against them. One of the sisters is an aspiring swimmer and the younger sis tries to encourage and support her while trying to make ends meet for the both of them. Life is tough though and they keep getting more crap piled on them no matter how hard they try to succeed.Enter our young hero. He works for his family's restaurant and delivers meals all over town. On his route is the athleticswimming facility for the deaf where he happens upon the younger of the two sisters. He's not deaf but he does happen to know sign language and he's instantly smitten with the young deaf sister upon meeting her. So he pursues her and there's your romantic angle of the story line. The actress playing the young deaf sister is the tiniest and cutest thing ever and the lead actor who portrays the guy interested in her is suitably adorable  likable. She's pretty cautious and somewhat standoffish but he persists and perhaps love can one day bloom between the two if everything works out. They would make the cutest couple ever if so.The two actresses starring as the deaf sisters are really good in their roles. I obviously don't know the Taiwanese version of sign language but it sure does look like the 2 actresses do. As a result there's a number of thoughtful and touchingemotional signed scenes between the two of them throughout the film that are very nicely done. The main male lead gets the job done quite well. Aside from them the only other meaningful characters in this movie are the mother  father of the male lead and they are just flat out awesome in their respective roles.This movie also had a very well done end game goalresult that caught me off guard a bi.

	schema:reviewBody "How do you express your love to someone dear? Thiz movie teaches us how to get through all the boundaries and speaks only from our heart. I went to see thiz film without any expectation. But surprisingly it becomes a spellbinding movie. The Director Fenfen Cheng made a directorial debut through thiz Taiwanese Romantic Comedy. It's about a delivery boy Tian Kuo Eddie Peng who falls in love with hearing impaired girl named Yang Yang Ivy Chen. Without any difficulty both of them can communicate easily although using sign language. The Cast members are not just good looking but they deliver some dazzling performances as well. The story also revolves around Yang Yang's sister Xiao Peng Michelle Chen who is pursuing her dream to become paralympic swimmer. Most of the times the scenes are filled with mute dialogue and silentness. I am amazed every time I watch thiz unique couple talk to each other with their sign language how their hand movements and face expressions interact more effective than our daily language. Meanwhile the comical interaction between Tian Kuo and his parents is one of hilarious parts in thiz movie. Thiz is definitely not a shallow love drama but it's also an inspiring story about dreams and aspirations. There are some melancholic and hearttouching scenes particularly in one of the scenes when Yang Yang and her sister remind each other among their desperation how hope should always be there to light up their life. The movie confidently teaches us how we should appreciate every single hard work that is done by someone where every penny has its worth and value. A beautiful drama speaks loud and clear beyond words. The sound of love is perfectly captured. I hear you clearly  Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE  httpjonnyfendi.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hear Me";
	schema:reviewBody "The gimmick in the film that allows it to transcend the usual teenybopper puppy love stories filled with an eyecandy cast is undoubtedly the use of the nonverbal medium of sign language in a film. I don't recall watching any recent contemporary film where the lead characters engage in sign for the most parts of the story leaving us the audience relying very much on the subtitles both English and Mandarin with subtle differences to tide us through. It's a novelty factor though one that works and hopefully can help to garner interest such that it shouldn't been seen as a language of exclusivity because of impairment but one which is actually very beautiful with its fluid motion and as the film suggests with a certain degree of creative improvisation hey so long as you're understood right?For Eddie Pang's Tian Kuo the delivery boy for his parent's restaurant going from place to place to bring their delicious rice sets to hungry masses is part of his daily routine until a destination at a swimming pool would begin to set his heart fluttering when he falls for Yang Yang Ivy Chen the sister of his customer Xiao Peng Michelle Chen the paralympic swimmer. So begins the usual scenarios he puts himself into just to be able to reach out and befriend Yang Yang with the usual dating pursuit complexities that plague any if I may use the word normal budding relationships in the modern world where telecommunication devices such as Messaging Email and SMS prove to be essential when communicating non verbally.The rest of the story is pretty straightforward with toeing along a formula though it's kept extremely engaging by the light hearted story and its extremely good looking casts who obviously had put in a lot of work to be natural believable signlinguists. Though some may cringe at the more melodramatic moments the sentimental old me somehow saw it as being able to bring something extra to the table with the relationship between two sisters so reliant on each other that it makes you appreciate the nature of that innate love between siblings and that between family with TianKuo's parents playing key roles here that accentuates the sensitivity and at times irritability of how parents can sometimes fuss over their only child. Not to mention too that they almost always steal the show because of their quirkiness and comic timing each time they come on screen in addition to some slapstick humour that director Cheng Fenfen slips in from time to time.Running almost two hours long the story may be a little bit stretched or at times required the suspension of disbelief for instance that a missionary father could just bear to up and go preach in Africa leaving two lovely children to fend for themselves. The finale too seemed a little too long and suffered from the usual syndrome that it didn't know exactly when to end and stop at a nice crescendo but chose to finish things off in predictable expected fashion. For sharp eyed viewers you'll probably would have prepped yourself for that big surprise reveal even right from the start but that will not alter the enjoyment of witnessing how things will develop especially when their first real date really tanked with that unavoidable adversary and with themes like how one should live our own lives instead of living out someone else's.I can't help but to raise another plus point in the film. There's a bit of the use of Hokkien and Cantonese in the film and lo and behold they were left intact though one can argue that the duration of use wasn't significant. To me it was because it's that continued one small step forward before eventually making that giant leap. It's easy to have dubbed the languages over using Mandarin but it wasn't so I'll interpret this positively. And since we're on the topic of languages I've already mentioned that sign language is beautiful and after watching this film you're likely more inclined to be a bit more aware of how emotions can be expressed exactly through delicate or more hardpounding motions.Hear Me reminds us no matter what medium is used to express love so long as it comes straight from the heart honestly and sincerely that emotion will be heard loud and clear. Highly recommended and works perfectly as a date movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a lighthearted romantic teen movie from Taiwan. I felt just like many recent Taiwanese movies the dialogs could be a little awkward at times even though the majority of the film was communicated in sign language. The diminutive yet terminally cute leading actress was good at her role serving as a reserved character. The male lead character was more expressive in nature although I felt at times came out a bit obnoxious. The language aspect reflects fairly accurately among the current Taiwanese society today where the parents speak in Taiwanese while the children replied in Mandarin. In a way it is sad to see a native language is replaced by an invading tongue and I hope there is a trend coming to slow up this trend. Overall this is a harmless romance Taiwanese movie.".

Their scenes wherein some of it was just purely sign languages their eyes emotions and their actions were so powerful that I really felt their character. The connection between each and every one of them was fantastic. There were a lot of melancholic and hilarious scenes on the film but they blended very well. This movie is for all ages. It teaches us that we should not look down with people who has disabilities but rather accept them for who they are. Disabilities are not a hindrance for us to love a person. This movie tells us that we should appreciate the hard work that one is doing especially when they do it for others. Every single cent of your money is worth it if you watch this film!
