They are close to 300000 in debt. Finding out this information Bridget comes to the conclusion that she needs to get a job  any job  that at least provides them with some benefits. She reluctantly takes a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Almost immediately Bridget is enthralled with all the old worn out money that is being shredded. She comes up with a plan to get her old lifestyle back by stealing much of that money which she believes is an easy job since the locks used on the money carts are standard equipment and as she notices that no one ever checks the garbage as she goes about her work. Her plan needs the cooperation of one person who works the shredder and one person who pushes the carts of money. The two people ...";

	schema:reviewBody "My friend and I were looking for a movie to see this weekend and Mad Money was the only movie that looked like fun. When we finished the movie the audience was happy and we were happy this was a fun and cute movie. So I have to say that I am very very surprised by this harsh rating on IMDb I mean a 4.4?! You have got to be kidding me this is by no means movie of the year but for what it was this was just a fun comedy to watch. There wasn't any major problems with this movie that deserves that kind of a rating that makes it look like the first major flop of the year. Diane Keaton Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes were absolutely adorable together and had great chemistry. They made the story an Oceans Eleven for the girls sounds like such a chick flick but I think this is one that most could actually enjoy.Bridget and her husband Dan are in major debt really bad debt like 282000 dollars in debt. They are about to loose everything they own so Bridget gets a job as a janitor for the financial bank. When she notices the ultimate torture of how they shred worn out money she gets a clever idea with the help of two other girl employees Nina and Jackie to find a way to break the system and get that money to get out of their poor situations. Once they get what they need Bridget is so satisfied with how smooth everything went she wants more and they go for it but they should learn not to get so greedy since someone is on their tale.Mad Money is a chick flick but it's one of the rare one's that I liked. I didn't think there was anything wrong with this film. I think they could have explained the situation with the boss of the bank a little better I don't know if he was in on it or what but it's something that could slide I think. Queen Latifah was just so funny and Diane Keaton was a perfect choice for Bridget Katie Holmes was pretty decent for the comic relief. Please don't take the rating on IMDb seriously I think that Mad Money was just a fun little comedy that deserves a better chance.610".

	schema:headline " Interesting Idea for a Financial Stimulus Package";
	schema:reviewBody "Mad Money has reasonable entertainment value great characters and even a nice little unexpected twist at the end to satisfy the escapist moviegoer. The essential plot of Mad Money is not that original as heist movies go. The formula usually goes something like this the characters are in a bad financial or similar situation they find out about some booty supposedly completely unobtainable devise a scheme to lift the booty which has some intriguing elements to it and then go about getting the booty. Along the way there are some twists and turns to keep it interesting. If it's too easy it won't work. Part of the fun is whether or not they will get away with it and how they will do it. Heist movies are almost a dime a dozen these days with fair such as Oceans 11 both the old and the new versions its subsequent sequels Heist The Score etc.What gives Mad Money a unique flavor is the characters who enact the heist essentially the Neapolitan kind vanilla chocolate and strawberry. Most Hollywood heist movies star middleaged men devising elaborate schemes requiring PhD's to perpetrate the heist. In Mad Money the team of schemers are three women working at belowsealevel jobs at the Federal Reserve building a white grandmother of the upper middleclass variety Diane Keaton a middleaged AfricanAmerican single mother trying to stay above water Queen Latifah who actually stuffs packs of bills into a large shredding machine and Katie Holmes as a 20something scatterbrain who will probably lose the better part of her hearing by movie's end. How Holmes ever landed a position at the Federal Reserve is one of the many intriguing mysteries of the movie. A rather unlikely swashbuckling gang of hoodlums who sport wash cloths and garbage bags instead of swords.Keaton and Latifah have the most at stake in their interesting idea for a financial stimulus package to lift ragged and torn bills from the Federal Reserve before they are about to be shredded. In other words stealing money that really isn't money. However I wouldn't try this at home. Yearround the Federal Reserve acquires tons and tons of ragged and worn bills from banks and other large financial institutions and swaps them for new crisp clean bills. The ragged bills go by way of the shredding and pulping machines. How they pull off the heist sort of works although it does fray into a little bit of the fantastic as stealing from a Federal Governmental agency like the Federal Reserve is sort of akin to trying to raise the Titanic. It probably ain't gonna happen. However a unique chemistry between the actors somehow makes the movie work and the writers took the story seriously enough to give a lot of unexpected laughs the way comedies of this type should be written. In other words luckily the writers didn't try to make the movie funny.On a final note the outstanding talent of the cast has to be Queen Latifah who does an excellent job of portraying a single mom who wants the booty but has ambivalence about the entire scheme. In fact the entire cast is excellent with Diane Keaton believable as the guiding force behind the heist and Ted Danson as her bewildered husband. My only criticism is that I would have liked a little more of a hint regarding the twist at the end which did come out of left field. Enjoyable and worth the price of admission although I doubt I will shell out another 20 bucks for the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Callie Khouri best known for writing the famous Ridely Scott film Thelma  Louise Mad Money tells the story of three women working at the Kansas Federal Reserve Bank though the movie was shot in Louisiana who work out a system to steal money that is about to be shredded. Obviously stuff happens.Mad Money is far from being the best heist film out there. Recent efforts such as After The Sunset The Italian Job The Thomas Crown Affair Entrapment or The Ladykillers are all much cooler. But just as Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's series is extremely overrated this widely panned film is quite underrated. Actually though it is central to the plot the movie doesn't really focus on the heist element that much preferring to stick with character interactions and light comedy. Here also it's far from the funniest movie out there but the humor is pleasant and harmless.The acting is pretty good all around. Diane Keaton is certainly better here than in her horrible performance in the previous year's Because I Said So and while some may find baffling that Katie Holmes chose this over The Dark Knight she certainly does a better job here at playing a ditz than her uselessness in Batman Begins. Who knows? Maybe she just doesn't like Batman maybe she wanted a role that would center more on her maybe she just loves Thelma  Louise and is willing to have a lower paycheck which being married to Tom Cruise she can totally afford to do. Queen Latifah is her usual self and it's always cool to see Ted Danson and Christopher McDonald even if it's little more than a glorified cameo.The movie has flaws yes and shouldn't really show up on anyone's top 10 or top 200 list. The flashback narration doesn't really work that well and the ending is pretty ludicrous but what the hell it's just a movie folks. I don't think anyone involved in the making of Mad Money declared that this movie will radically change your views on life. It's just simple harmless entertainment something pleasant to watch if you stumble upon it.".

Suddenly bills are piling up and there is no solution in sight. Needing to maintain her lifestyle Bridget takes a job as a custodial worker for the local branch of the federal mint. Now she has the health care coverage she needs and the means to pay her creditors. But she wants more especially considering the menial tasks she is asked to perform and the smug attitude of the mint's bossman. Being a tough and smart cookie Bridget hatches an elaborate plot to help herself to some of the wornout bills that are headed for the shredder. But in order for the scheme to work she needs the aid of Nina Queen Latifah who operates one of the shredders and Jackie Katie Holmes whose task it is to transport the cart of paper money to and fro. They agree after some initial reluctance to become Bridget's partners in crime for Nina wants to send her two little boys to a fine school and Jackie has a need for some excitement. But will they really be able to pull one over on the Feds? This is really a fairly funny movie with a great plot and a nice cast. Keaton especially is fabulous as the conniving high maintenance housewife and the Queen is equally wonderful as a single mother with big dreams. Danson Christopher McDonald and the lesser players are fine too. Only Holmes strikes a flat note as her Jackie is rather forgettable. Since Katie has shown she is a fine actress see Pieces of April or Abandon one can only conclude that the director failed her miserably. Then too she sports an awful hair style and terrible costumes throughout the film as well. This is most odd for Keaton and Latifah look great. Although the sets are not noteworthy they are certainly adequate as is the look of the film. If you have heard that this film is a bomb don't believe it. While it may not be a masterpiece it definitely has its funny moments and zany charm more than enough in fact to make it a worthwhile watch.".

I could never look away because I was so interested in the plot they set everything up really well and the movie was nicely paced with some fun and surprising twists and turns that keep the viewer on edge.Like I said easily the best thing about this movie is it's performances which ultimately make the only decent movie otherwise more than decent and highly rewatchable and the cast pull off the material that could be seen as poor amazingly and overall make the movie worth the while. I enjoyed it highly and like I said I wish more people would see it and not be so critical on it. It is entertainment at it's most charming even if it is not a masterpiece.".

I could never look away because I was so interested in the plot they set everything up really well and the movie was nicely paced with some fun and surprising twists and turns that keep the viewer on edge.Like I said easily the best thing about this movie is it's performances which ultimately make the only decent movie otherwise more than decent and highly rewatchable and the cast pull off the material that could be seen as poor amazingly and overall make the movie worth the while. I enjoyed it highly and like I said I wish more people would see it and not be so critical on it. It is entertainment at it's most charming even if it is not a masterpiece.";

Spike Lee was smart and experienced enough to know that even with a great cast and clever caper you need a vision to bring out greatness. Mr. Lee also knew that you must choose a style.Director Kallie Khouri best known for writing and producing the feminist cult classic Thelma  Louise failed in every conceivable way  she demonstrates no eye for cinematography a tin ear for dialogue no timing for pacing no point of view and no talent for directing actors.Mad Money is based on an British caper television movie Hot Money produced by Granada Television. The screenplay translation to America was written by Glenn Gers whose best known screenplay to date was Fracture staring Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. Mr. Gers failed miserably to take any chances. A more talented writer would have created the characters from whole cloth rather than substituting American stereotypes in Mad Money there is the headbopping early twentysomething the black single mother in the projects and the upper middle class desperate housewife. There is no excuse for laziness. If Mr. Gers had create real people then perhaps he wouldn't have created characters that came out of other people's poor imagination. Writing requires an understanding of humanity and cannot be faked. The screenplay for Mad Money had not one shred of genuine emotion. Spare me the notion that these characters were suppose to be light and frothy drawbacks to characters like in the caper classic Ladykillers with Sir Alec Guinness. There were just about 3 laughs in the entire picture. If I ever was so lucky to have a cast with Queen Latifah and Diane Keaton I'd be embarrassed that I had put such a blemish on their filmographies by giving them so little to make great.No comedy no drama no thrills no real danger and no romance creates no film worth watching. I wish they could have afforded Carrie Fisher to doctor this screenplay and imbue it with a glint of genuine greed or true wit or anything that would have made this film any more watchable.I also wish that the studio would have kept Ms. Khouri in the producer's chair and brought in a director who knew how to fix a script bring style rather than shoot from an anywhere goes point of view and attempt to make something memorable.".

Don has been looking for a job for a whole year. With the threat of losing everything Bridget must find a job. She has an English Lit degree but no job experience. She finally takes the only job that she can find as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. The onetime corporate wife now works with Nina Queen Latifah a single mom with two kids who shreds old money and Jackie Katie Holmes young beautiful and a little strange who moves the money cart. Every day the bank shreds over a million dollars. Bridget begins to think of what she can do with some of that old money and she comes up with a plan. Bridget needs Nina and Jackie for the plan to work. They all join forces and start taking home the money. These three women have pulled off the perfect crime.My Comment This movie is a good example of what three average women who have learned to work the system for their own advantage can do when they want something bad enough even though it is illegal. It also shows you what will eventually happen when you have enough money and should stop but greed sets in. Diane Keaton was wonderful in her part as a stay at home wife who must get a job to survive. Life can be hard when the breadwinner losses his job. Everybody already knows that the difference between a bum and a respected person is a job. These three women had a job however they turned to the life of crime only to get what they did not earn. I know it is only a movie but working for your money is important especially since Nina had two kids at home. Queen Latifah's performance was convincing and at times touching. Katie Holmes' performance was funny but a little unusual. It is an enjoyable movie but you can wait for the DVD to come out. Overturn Films Run Time 144 Rated PG13510".

The story is simply told and is absorbing entertaining and unusually for a modern comedy funny. Not uproariously but it made me smile on many occasions. The viewer cares about the characters and what happens to them and that is a testament to the writing and direction.

	schema:headline " Larcenious Ladies Living the Crime of their Lives";
	schema:reviewBody "Diane Keaton hasn't made a really good movie in a long time and the protagonists that she has been playing lately wallow in the same stereotypical rut. Usually she plays a mother close to her actual age and she sports those godawful granny glasses. In short nothing that she has been in has deviated from the routine. For example she was a mother in The Family Stone Because I Said So and Something's Got to Give. Keaton's last truly great movie was Woody Allen's Manhattan Melodrama and before that it was Annie Hall. The Little Drummer Girl provided her with her most offbeat role. Sure she was okay in The Godfather but she wasn't the star attraction. Indeed she plays yet another mom in Mad Money but she tampers more with her image here than she has since the offbeat but disastrous Mafia movie Plan B. Great idea for a movie but Plan B bombed. Mad Money  out of  finds Keaton teaming up with Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes. Talk about casting coup! Who would have thought that these three would gang up in a hysterical comedy crime caper about a trio of dames who steal the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank blind? These three have terrific chemistry together too. Poor Bridget Cardigan Diane Keaton sees her life going down the drain when her outofwork husband Don Ted Danson of CBSTV's Becker cannot find another job. Not only are they 200thousand dollars in debt but also they're going to have to sell their sprawling house. Bridget tries to find a job but she has been out of the workforce far too long. One human resources lady laughs Bridget out the door when she points out how worthless Bridget's English lit degree is. Eventually our leading lady lands a lowly job as a janitor at a Federal Reserve Bank swabbing out toilets and bagging the trash. The sight of Diane Keaton in rubber gloves and dark coveralls with frizzy hair is a hilarious change of pace for the Oscarwinning actress.Once she grows accustoms to her surroundings Bridget notices lapses in the security and masterminds an incredible scheme to steal the old wornout currency that the Treasury Department destroys and then replaces with crisp fresh bills. She makes friends with single mom Nina Brewster Queen Latifah of Set It Off who shreds the old money. Mind you she doesn't shred just George Washington dollar bills. She obliterates 100 dollar bills and on up. They bring in young ditzy Jackie Truman Katie Holmes of Batman Begins. Bridget discovers that the same type of lock that the Federal Reserve keeps the carts that contain the old money is sold at a local hardware store. She fixes things up so that Jackie can stash the old money in a trash can while she is being watched by the security monitors without giving away any clues. Indeed our heroines are constantly under pressure about their dastardly doings. Bridget gets it from both Don and Nina especially after six months elapse and everybody has gotten more than enough money. Nevertheless Bridget wants to keep on keeping on and she refuses to listen to calmer minds. She does agree with them that they must keep a low profile. Nina warns them that if they start spending too much then they will arouse the suspicions of their employers. In fact in one sidesplitting scene Nina confronts Bridget in a restroom wrenches the rubber glove off Bridget's hand jerks a 66thousand dollar ring off her finger and flushes it without a qualm down the toilet much to Bridget's chagrin. Furthermore our heroines must contend with Federal Reserve Security principally the guards that lust after Nina and the chief of security Glover Stephen Root who lords it over everybody with his scheduled as well as unscheduled security shakedowns.Director Callie Khouri best known for her feminist masterpiece Thelma  Louise maintains headlong momentum throughout the action. Clocking in at a trim 104 minutes Mad Money never wears out its welcome. Moreover Khouri isn't half bad at orchestrating a robbery that occurs under the security conscious noses of heavily armed guards and omnipotent surveillance cameras. The first heist generates considerable suspense as our heroines steal the money but later have to negotiate the gauntlet of the routine searches at the doors. They conceal the bucks in their bras but Jackie stuffs her dough in her panties with U.S. Grant peeking out of her waistline as she waits inline for the inevitable purse inspection. Sure Jackie hides the money before anybody discovers it but you wind up laughing your butt off at Bridget and Nina's antics as they struggle to alert her. Eventually the girls go just too far and they notice some suspicious people keeping tabs on them. However to reveal any more about the intricately worked out plot and the whiteknuckled suspense scenes that Khouri sprinkles through this lighterthanhelium heist would give away far too much. Sufficient to say Mad Money boasts a deliriously happy ending that will have everybody slapping hands in high five gestures at fadeout.Interestingly enough the producers lensed Mad Money in Louisiana instead of Kansas but you wouldn't know otherwise from what transpires in this tall tale. Khouri and scenarist Glenn Gars who penned the aboveaverage Anthony Hopkins wifekiller movie Fracture keep the audience in suspense up to their necks. There is one hell of a surprise ending. Ted Danson is good as Keaton's husband and Stephen Root steals every scene that he has as Keaton's paranoia chief of security. Ostensibly Mad Money is a remake of Hot Money a 2001 British madeforTV movie. Women who love to see women triumph over men in the end should flock to this movie in droves and have the crime of their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mad Money was a pretty funny movie all together. The story to this movie was a little bit corny but funny at the same time. It was about three women trying to rob money from a place that they work at. The three women who are trying to rob the bank are Diane Keaton Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes. I thought that they all did a pretty good job overall. Especially Queen Latifah who played her part very good. Diane Keaton did a pretty good job but not her best. I think she could have done a lot better. This was definitely not one of her better performances. Katie Homes did a so so job. The movie was trying to teach you that money does not buy you everything in life and that is true. Money can make and brake your life. That's what pretty much happens to the women in this movie they are either going to be rich or caught and broke and have nothing left in their life. The thing that stealing money can do to you is make you end up loosing your kids or your life. I thought that the women in this movie took the bank robbery way to far. They stole once and then wanted to keep going and going over again. Sooner or later you are bound to get caught. I think the movie could have been a little bit better by just having them rob it once and not for like three years. This was also a pretty cute movie with a couple of laughs. It would have been much better if it was just a tiny bit more realistic. I mean I wasn't expecting it to be realistic but the planning could've been better. They didn't plan the robbery out that much. They just went and rushed right into it. Overall this movie was pretty funny and had some cute scenes in it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy movie that have an unrealistic story.".

	schema:headline " An absurd premise but a really really good time!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I know exactly why this is getting skewered by reviewers on IMDb. People nowadays that see films can't just have a good time. You can't just be entertained or ignore reality for two hours so you can get caught up in what is supposed to be an escape from real life!! Sure some movies are just rotten but sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the ride and that is exactly what Mad Money requires you to do and it's well worth doing exactly that. Mad Money pits the whole trio of gals into a mad cap adventure that isn't exactly true to life but it's fun and well written and they are fun!! Mad Money is exactly what they attempted to put together and they may have been aiming at the demographic of women but its fun for everyone and the characters are terrific. Its not really a laugh out loud roll in the aisles kind of comedy but its certainly worthwhile in a fun laid back kind of way. I am surprised that more focus and controversy hasn't been put on the fact that the film is about robbing a bank essentially embezzling hundreds of thousands maybe millions of dollars from where they work and they ARE the heroes of the story. I mean they should be painted at the very least as anti heroes but this is always treated like fun and that they deserve this and they aren't criminals.Now Diane Keaton has had some great roles. I don't dislike her usually as an actress. She's also probably the most experienced actor of the bunch but in some ways I think she gets out done by everyone else. Her slightly neurotic pampered portrayal of Bridget Cardigan. She's the master mind the brains behind the idea but needs help. Her comedy feels kind of forced and she looks constantly like she has her hand in the cookie jar making it kind of hard to believe that they wouldn't be suspicious of her. She has this perpetual 'I'm robbing you blind' look on her face. She just kind of sticks out in this cast. Queen Latifah has played her role several times before and should be a pro at it and she does a good job. She's the down on her luck single Mom enamored with the cute buff black guy and willing to do anything to save her kids. Latifah is better than this film but she's still fun to watch and she adds that touch of fun and class to the cast. Guess who is the shining spot light in Mad Money? Mrs. Katie HolmesCruise. Holmes does an awesome job as shining star unique personality Jackie Truman. She's kind of this wild child and has this flare and she's kind of ditzy but completely pertinent to the plan and I think she is the shining force in this film!! She does a terrific job and kudos to her. She's adorable sexy fun to watch and has some great lines. She really kills this role!! When I saw Ted Danson was in the film I was excited to see him in something other than Cheers reruns but I figured he'd hardly be in it BUT they actually use him a lot!! He plays Keaton's down on his luck husband and he's really good. He's straight faced and serious and him and Keaton have really good chemistry. I hope this gives him some other roles because I think he's terrific. Adam Rothenberg plays a small role as Holmes' less than intelligent husband who comes out with some great lines and looks cute with Holmes although you'll never see them kiss an homage to her husband perhaps which I think is very upstanding. Honorable mention to the very clever Stephen Root who plays the overbearing head of the vault and does it wonderfully. Roger Cross is decent as Latifah's love interest but he's mostly quiet and brooding and doesn't really do anything to stand out.The most important thing I think with a buddy crime comedy is that the main characters in this case the trio of gals have great chemistry and in the end they are the best of friends and you believe it and Mad Money successfully pulls that off considering how different the characters and the actresses really are. If anyone should know how to do the female best friend crime caper it should be director Callie Khouri who wrote and produced Thelma and Louise and I don't think Mad Money will ever get that cult status but it still fulfills some of those key elements. The film is ludicrous...I mean they're robbing a maximum security vault of money that is being shredded although I think their plan is pretty ingenious but they constantly look guilty they do things that would could only end up being filmed when there are cameras everywhere...so if you're going to pick the film apart then you will hate it. But if you can just sit back smile chuckle and enjoy this crazy ride then you'll see Mad Money for what it was meant to be and you'll love every minute of it. I happen to think it was excellent and I had a great time watching it. I left the movie with a smile on my face and that is the mark of good entertainment. 8.510".

Sure some movies are just rotten but sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the ride and that is exactly what Mad Money requires you to do and it's well worth doing exactly that. Mad Money pits the whole trio of gals into a mad cap adventure that isn't exactly true to life but it's fun and well written and they are fun!! Mad Money is exactly what they attempted to put together and they may have been aiming at the demographic of women but its fun for everyone and the characters are terrific. Its not really a laugh out loud roll in the aisles kind of comedy but its certainly worthwhile in a fun laid back kind of way. I am surprised that more focus and controversy hasn't been put on the fact that the film is about robbing a bank essentially embezzling hundreds of thousands maybe millions of dollars from where they work and they ARE the heroes of the story. I mean they should be painted at the very least as anti heroes but this is always treated like fun and that they deserve this and they aren't criminals.Now Diane Keaton has had some great roles. I don't dislike her usually as an actress. She's also probably the most experienced actor of the bunch but in some ways I think she gets out done by everyone else. Her slightly neurotic pampered portrayal of Bridget Cardigan. She's the master mind the brains behind the idea but needs help. Her comedy feels kind of forced and she looks constantly like she has her hand in the cookie jar making it kind of hard to believe that they wouldn't be suspicious of her. She has this perpetual 'I'm robbing you blind' look on her face. She just kind of sticks out in this cast. Queen Latifah has played her role several times before and should be a pro at it and she does a good job. She's the down on her luck single Mom enamored with the cute buff black guy and willing to do anything to save her kids. Latifah is better than this film but she's still fun to watch and she adds that touch of fun and class to the cast. Guess who is the shining spot light in Mad Money? Mrs. Katie HolmesCruise. Holmes does an awesome job as shining star unique personality Jackie Truman. She's kind of this wild child and has this flare and she's kind of ditzy but completely pertinent to the plan and I think she is the shining force in this film!! She does a terrific job and kudos to her. She's adorable sexy fun to watch and has some great lines. She really kills this role!! When I saw Ted Danson was in the film I was excited to see him in something other than Cheers reruns but I figured he'd hardly be in it BUT they actually use him a lot!! He plays Keaton's down on his luck husband and he's really good. He's straight faced and serious and him and Keaton have really good chemistry. I hope this gives him some other roles because I think he's terrific. Adam Rothenberg plays a small role as Holmes' less than intelligent husband who comes out with some great lines and looks cute with Holmes although you'll never see them kiss an homage to her husband perhaps which I think is very upstanding. Honorable mention to the very clever Stephen Root who plays the overbearing head of the vault and does it wonderfully. Roger Cross is decent as Latifah's love interest but he's mostly quiet and brooding and doesn't really do anything to stand out.The most important thing I think with a buddy crime comedy is that the main characters in this case the trio of gals have great chemistry and in the end they are the best of friends and you believe it and Mad Money successfully pulls that off considering how different the characters and the actresses really are. If anyone should know how to do the female best friend crime caper it should be director Callie Khouri who wrote and produced Thelma and Louise and I don't think Mad Money will ever get that cult status but it still fulfills some of those key elements. The film is ludicrous...I mean they're robbing a maximum security vault of money that is being shredded although I think their plan is pretty ingenious but they constantly look guilty they do things that would could only end up being filmed when there are cameras everywhere...so if you're going to pick the film apart then you will hate it. But if you can just sit back smile chuckle and enjoy this crazy ride then you'll see Mad Money for what it was meant to be and you'll love every minute of it. I happen to think it was excellent and I had a great time watching it. I left the movie with a smile on my face and that is the mark of good entertainment. 8.510";

Hot Money in my opinion is a far more entertaining watch than Mad Money as it is gritty and realistic keeping you on the edge of your seat whilst still being light hearted. Sadly Hot Money is not available anywhere it seems to buy or rent as it was made by Granada TV and from what I can tell has not been released.

On the other hand this could be Dylan's way of telling us who he really is.  Maybe I'm just a singer and nothing more he tells us.  He's tired of being made to be a counter cultural liberal protester.  He's tired of people who think he only writes antiwar songs. Think of the scene where a woman brings her daughter to see Dylan.

This movie is about so many things  You just have to see it and every time you see it again you'll see more.Concerning the dialogue.

Mickey Rourke Ed Harris Christian Slater all surprised me with brilliant acting.If you have the chance to see this movie just once do so.

	schema:headline " Approach it like Duchamp's Orpheus";
	schema:reviewBody "For those who have read or heard the various reviews calling Masked and Anonymous a mess all I can say is if you enjoy the work of Bob Dylan you'll enjoy it and if you don't enjoy his work you probably won't enjoy it. It's that simple really.It's a surreal social critique of the current state of things as well as an attempt to illustrate to the audience not only what the world looks like to Bob Dylan but also what Bob Dylan looks like to the world much like his music. So if you are familiar with and enjoy that about his music you'll enjoy the film.And also much like his music has always done if you're up on your historical references and cultural detritus you'll find yourself giggling a lot. The puns and inside jokes are scattered everywhere as are his songs not necessarily performed by him.Just let it soak over you like a long Dylan album and you'll know what I mean.All the reviews are basically saying It's not like how other movies are made these days. What is this crap? In many ways it's similar to Renaldo  Clara but it's much more mainstream than that ever was.There's even a few seconds of the Seattle WTO riots in 99 in the film.I think the best way to approach the film is as if you were watching a Duchamp. I could see it on a double bill with Orpheus. There's many allusions and references to other films like a pocketwatch with a broken face.It's not a Hollywood film even though it's got a lot of Hollywood people in it. It's more like a very expensive foreign indie film.  They all do great jobs especially John Goodman his character not being too far a stretch from his role in Barton Fink. But the characters are caricatures archetypes just like in Desolation Row it imagines what the future might be like or maybe it just looks a little too clearly at what is happening right now.From a straight acting perspective method would be wasted on these sketchy characters because like in a noir film you know them enough to know who they are and what they do but their lives are all so repressed their dreams are all of trying to comprehend the world they live in where there is constant revolution either dire poverty or obscene wealth and a lot of violence lies between the two both physically and emotionally. Even the president of the television network has bodyguards with assault rifles. Other reviews all try saying that it takes place in some Central American country but the irony is it was all filmed on the streets on the other side of LA.Time is played with sometimes to make someone get something right and the parade of faces peopling the movie are the mythological icons of not just this age but stretching back past the 20th century. Ghandi Pope John Paul II Abraham Lincoln Koo Koo The Bird Girl they're all here. The characters all have names like Jack Fate Uncle Sweetheart Tom Friend Bobby Cupid Valentine Prospero Nestor Bacchus. There's as many overriding themes as there are submotifs but it's chockfull of details too and the details are fast and furious. You learn just to let one drop if you don't get it because another one will be coming up soon.Many threads are pulled together and the plot is thought through as much as anything but Dylan has always been more about questions than about answers so traditional expectations of identifying with a simple plot and easily sympathetic characters won't leave you very nourished as much as if you just accepted that like life anyone could say anything at any time which just might not be what you expected to hear.So you can't see the framework that the plot is on very easily because the themes and questions asked are far more interesting and ultimately more overwhelming and therefore concentrated on more than the plot. The themes are big the questions are huge after all this is Dylan. Mortality desire loyalty purity confession nurturing freedom imprisonment corruption manipulation poverty madness.The camerawork is impressive because a lot of the scenes have to do with who is more powerful than the other character and overhead shots and shots up stairs really underline a lot of the relationships of the characters to their world their friends and their enemies.And of course like a Dylan song you could watch it over and over and find new things every time even though you'll get most of it in one viewing. Some things you immediately realize what he just got away with. Who else could put Ed Harris in blackface and have him in a scene where he's looking down on Dylan from the top of a stairwell. Then the next time Dylan looks up he's changed to a young Rastafarian janitor.When Dylan's character gets out of jail the first song you hear as he struts along with his suit and his guitar is an Italian rap remix of Like A Rolling Stone.The center of the film is when a small black girl sings an amazing a capella version of The Times They Are A'Changin' to Dylan and his band while they're resting on the bandstand. It sends Dylan's character inward until he finally says It's all just ordinary things in one of the films very effective voiceovers. If you think of the film as a new album by Dylan the voiceovers would be the liner notes he wrote himself. Another one closes the film and when you hear what his last words are you realize that Dylan has basically just taken the same things he always addresses in his music as well as the way he presents such things in his music and has simply tried to do the exact same thing in a film. If you approach the film as a set of songs it will be easier to follow. The scenes are what are important as well as who is who to the other person. The plot is controlled by the unpredictable events of the dictatorship in power and the dying king and who is the rightful heir.".

	schema:headline " I don't know whether it's a comedy or a tragedy but it's definitely a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "You would probably have to go back to early Godard to find a movie as audacious shockingly funny and brilliantly incisive in its analysis of the uneasy alliance between art and commerce as Masked and Anonymous the new movie from Bob Dylan and Larry Charles. As with some Godard I can't say whether it's a comedy or a tragedy  but it's definitely a masterpiece. Less than a year after news of the film was first announced Masked and Anonymous has arrived. Shot on digital video in just 20 days and apparently made in the same freewheeling spirit that Bob Dylan likes to record albums the end result is a wonder to behold a dense collage of sound and image that threatens to overwhelm the senses but never quite does thanks to the rigor and precision of director Larry Charles and his team of talented collaborators. The film is at turns poetic playful political personal terrifying funny and deeply moving in short all of the virtues we've come to associate with Dylan's greatest work as a recording artist. In an interview in 2001 Dylan said We're living in a science fiction world whether we realize it or not. Masked and Anonymous then is the story of that world. This is the world that Bob Dylan sees and responds to Tom Friend an aggressive reporter played by Jeff Bridges is clearly meant to stand in for all journalists even while Dylan puts his own words in Friend's mouth. Similarly the organizers of a benefit concert make demands of Fate that must represent the kind of idiotic commercial concessions that Dylan is faced with on a regular basis the setlist they want him to play includes teehee Eve of Destruction. If Dylan's vision seems bleak there is a ray of hope. There is one genuine human relationship in the film  between Fate and his former roadie Bobby Cupid Luke Wilson in his prime. I believe the warmth and real affection between these two characters which stands in stark contrast to all of the other relationships depicted in the film is key to understanding the agenda of Masked and Anonymous and especially its surprise ending which I won't give away. Of course it is impossible to separate the story of Jack Fate from the legend of Bob Dylan. There are so many references to Dylan's life and career studded throughout the film that it ends up being a kind of selfcriticism of the myth by the author. In this respect the only film in the history of cinema that is comparable is Chaplin's Limelight  not coincidentally another masterpiece by an artist in his autumn years. One obvious example is the character of Uncle Sweetheart a portly overbearing manager played with great panache by John Goodman who is meant to suggest Dylan's own former manager Albert Grossman. If Goodman's size and obnoxious demeanor don't give it away the glasses do. What these personal references ultimately suggest is that Jack Fate the washedup troubadour is both Dylan's fear and more importantly his victory over that fear. To direct the Hollywood cast to speak in the script's poetic ornate language could not have been easy but the actors do an exemplary job. Nearly all of them manage to hit just the right note of cartoonish hysteria to give the film a sense of unity and harmony. Except that is for Bob Dylan. Jack Fate is the calm in the eye of the storm the one rational character surrounded by a world of swirling insanity and director Charles gets a lot of comic mileage out of the contrast between Dylan's deadpan delivery and the overthetop performances of nearly everyone else it's like taking a Humphrey Bogart character out of the '40's and plunking him down in the middle of a massively absurd sciencefiction landscape  the resignation and worldweariness of the film noir hero remains hilariously intact! The very idea is inspired and the execution is flawless. The performance footage of course is terrific. Dylan and His Band play seven songs live on camera and there is a warmth an intimacy and a relaxed quality to the performances that you will only see at Dylan's best club shows. Although none of the songs are heard in their entirety these sequences are nonetheless beautifully filmed. There is none of the rapidfire editing and pointlessly roving camera moves that mar the filmed footage of so many live performances. Instead Charles' strategy is to have the band crowd together and film them in closeup with a wideangle lens. There are numerous long takes in which all of the band members can be seen and when the camera does move it's deliberate and meaningful. In a recent interview Larry Charles said he never worried about finding a distributor for the film and that Dylan had told him long ago not to worry about the film in the short term. However the film is received in the short term the richly orchestrated tapestry of sound and image that is Masked and Anonymous is sure to keep Dylanologists and film fans alike busy for decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time when music mattered and the people that made that music mattered too. Bob Dylan was one of those people. Dylan has floated in and out of the public eye over the years but has made somewhat of a return with the release of his 2001 album Love and Theft. He has tried to increase his current comeback and extend his hand into another form of art by written and staring in a new film.Masked and Anonymous is good no matter what your opinion of Bob Dylan may be. For Dylan fans this is a tour de force of film making. Written like a Dylan epic tune think Desolation Row Masked stays just out of reach of the explainable. Coupled with great cameos Val Kilmer is far and away the best of many Masked delivers. John Goodman and Jeff Bridges hold supply the majority of the nessecary acting with Luke Wilson helping out on occasion. However this is the Wilson of Old School and a far cry from the Wilson of the Royla Tennebaums. None of that really matters however because this film was made for Bob Dylan and he is the single most important character on screen.In Jack Fate Dylan has created a chracter that personifies his style. Fate an aging rock star returning home for a benefit concert symbolizes what h as become of Dylan's career as a musician. Masked isn't really the story of Bob Dylan's life no more then any of his songs are it can be however his response to what his life has been like. The story itself lacks a little and the characters are never fully defined but like the supporting acting none of that matters. The important part of Masked and Anonymous and the only reason it was ever made is Bob Dylan. Taken that way Masked and Anonymous is a truly excellent and original piece of film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Roger Ebert was so turned off by it is a damn good clue as to what's so great about this movie. Remember when Dylan went electric in '65 at Newport and ped off everyone especially the old tyme die hard folkies? Folk singers were supposed to be the voice of acceptance inclusion democracy. But there was righteous Pete Singer threatening to take an axe to the power cables to shut down Dylan's second set. Hypocrites. Bob's done it again with Masked and Anonymous a fake pseudo mock parable set in a far off exotic land that's much closer than we know. It's all done with a wink and a grin and done very very well. Jessica Lange is absolutely amazing as an Industry Hustler John Goodman is a riot and in the zone as a larger than life small time shmoozer. Jeff Bridges is as always Jeff Bridges! Penelope Cruz has never ever been so watchable her cute accent exploited to the max. There's a crap load of supporting stars that just blaze in and out sight. Some you have to really squint to recognize like Mickey Rourke as a slimy conniving politico. Giovanni Ribisi delivers a silver bullet monologue on the dilemmas of a revolutionary. And Bob Dylan is OK. OK may not sound like much but with this high power super star mega talent mix he's lucky to not be totally squashed. Bob's smart enough to say as little as possible and it's a great contrast to all the uberacting going on all around him. Along with the very clever maybetoosmug dialog are some great unusual Dylan cover songs and a scant few divine live performances  Bob with a terribly good band aiming for the throat and killing effortlessly. Transcendent moments like lush oases on the desperately bleak American Film landscape Masked and Anonymous is very cool refreshing entertainment.Ever see one of those corny french philosophy lessons from the 60's that they like to call a film? This flick will help ya get over it.".

Bob's smart enough to say as little as possible and it's a great contrast to all the uberacting going on all around him. Along with the very clever maybetoosmug dialog are some great unusual Dylan cover songs and a scant few divine live performances  Bob with a terribly good band aiming for the throat and killing effortlessly. Transcendent moments like lush oases on the desperately bleak American Film landscape Masked and Anonymous is very cool refreshing entertainment.Ever see one of those corny french philosophy lessons from the 60's that they like to call a film? This flick will help ya get over it.";

If you know why the man in the coonskin cap wants eleven dollar bills and you only got ten then maybe you understood this movie. The rest of us struggled with mundane dialogue disjointed vignettes thinly veiled allusions to Dylan's life some sort of statement on revolution and perhaps an admission by Dylan himself that even he doesn't have a clue as to what most of his songs mean.  Maybe if I saw this film another 23 times I would unravel the deeper meaning peel back the layers of symbolism and better grasp the metaphors that give deeper significance to the movie.  On the other hand it's been 35 years and I still don't know why I should hang around an ink well or watch the parking meters.I wish I could say that I enjoyed this movie.  But the fact is I rarely laughed certainly didn't cry and I didn't really care about any of the characters.  I could barely follow the plot line.  And I didn't understand most of what was lurking under the surface.  None of the actors appeared to have clue as to what was going on either.  But then maybe that's what Dylan meant all along .

It just requires some brain cells to work not just passively follow the action. This is a very special movie it is not for people who just want the entertainment. The casting is awesome all the actors are admirable in their roles. Bob Dylan doesn't even talk a lot but his character is very very charming.

	schema:headline " Only recommendable to hardcore Dylan fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in an unspecified wartorn country during an unspecified era Masked and Anonymous weaves a number of threads around Uncle Sweetheart John Goodman a shady businessmanpromoter and Nina Veronica Jessica Lange a television producer. They're trying to raise money by putting on a benefit concert but because of their country's political quagmire no stars will do the show. The best they can manage is Jack Fate Bob Dylan who is currently being held as a prisoner. The gig enables him to be released from jail and undertake a journey to the venue. We meet a cavalcade of quirky people along the way most of whom say very quirky things and just as the concert begins the country's political situation worsens. What will happen to our cast?Even though I'm a huge Dylan fan and Dylan is the focus of this film I'm being very generous in giving Masked and Anonymous a 7 out of 10 which is only equivalent to the letter grade of C in my way of looking at ratings. If the film didn't feature Dylan and his music throughout if there weren't a number of songs performed by Dylan and his band I would probably have given Masked and Anonymous a 4 out of 10 a high F or less. Understanding that if you don't like Dylan's music you should steer clear of this film.That's a shame because there are a number of interesting ideas in Masked and Anonymous. It has great potential but the potential isn't developed at all. Any viewer giving the film a complete coherent and favorable interpretation has put far too much time and energy into being an apologistthey've basically constructed an elaborate fiction for themselves Are they journalists or novelists indeed. Because in the end the film is just an incoherent mess anyway you slice it.Under the most literal interpretation Masked and Anonymous begins as a clever satire. The setting is a country overrun by a military dictator and various bands of rebels who have changed sides and causes so often they can't keep the factions straight. Initially it seems like it might be a modern version of Woody Allen's Bananas 1971. Directorcowriter Larry Charles goes to great pains to keep the country anonymous. We're given visual clues that suggest a tropical nation but in the next shot it looks like we're in Detroit or some other Midwestern U.S. city. He uses an ethnic rainbow of extras and the production design incorporates tokens from cultures around the world. On this literal level Masked and Anonymous works fairly well until Dylan's first song performed on stage at about the half hour to fortyminute mark. After this point Charles who cowrote with Dylan progressively abandons the interesting story. The focus becomes poetic but anachronistic dialogue and surrealistic skits almost exclusively set within the artificial environment of a large soundstage and that seem like they arrived on a late train from another film.

It's a bit disingenuous especially when the film is often not as deep cryptic or mysterious as it wants to be and it's a bit absurd to deny that Dylan is deep cryptic or mysterious.Charles also tends to waste his bloated castit seems that everyone was interested in having a cameo in a Dylan film and who can blame them.

	onyx:emotionText "Set in an unspecified wartorn country during an unspecified era Masked and Anonymous weaves a number of threads around Uncle Sweetheart John Goodman a shady businessmanpromoter and Nina Veronica Jessica Lange a television producer. They're trying to raise money by putting on a benefit concert but because of their country's political quagmire no stars will do the show. The best they can manage is Jack Fate Bob Dylan who is currently being held as a prisoner. The gig enables him to be released from jail and undertake a journey to the venue. We meet a cavalcade of quirky people along the way most of whom say very quirky things and just as the concert begins the country's political situation worsens. What will happen to our cast?Even though I'm a huge Dylan fan and Dylan is the focus of this film I'm being very generous in giving Masked and Anonymous a 7 out of 10 which is only equivalent to the letter grade of C in my way of looking at ratings. If the film didn't feature Dylan and his music throughout if there weren't a number of songs performed by Dylan and his band I would probably have given Masked and Anonymous a 4 out of 10 a high F or less. Understanding that if you don't like Dylan's music you should steer clear of this film.That's a shame because there are a number of interesting ideas in Masked and Anonymous. It has great potential but the potential isn't developed at all. Any viewer giving the film a complete coherent and favorable interpretation has put far too much time and energy into being an apologistthey've basically constructed an elaborate fiction for themselves Are they journalists or novelists indeed. Because in the end the film is just an incoherent mess anyway you slice it.Under the most literal interpretation Masked and Anonymous begins as a clever satire. The setting is a country overrun by a military dictator and various bands of rebels who have changed sides and causes so often they can't keep the factions straight. Initially it seems like it might be a modern version of Woody Allen's Bananas 1971. Directorcowriter Larry Charles goes to great pains to keep the country anonymous. We're given visual clues that suggest a tropical nation but in the next shot it looks like we're in Detroit or some other Midwestern U.S. city. He uses an ethnic rainbow of extras and the production design incorporates tokens from cultures around the world. On this literal level Masked and Anonymous works fairly well until Dylan's first song performed on stage at about the half hour to fortyminute mark. After this point Charles who cowrote with Dylan progressively abandons the interesting story. The focus becomes poetic but anachronistic dialogue and surrealistic skits almost exclusively set within the artificial environment of a large soundstage and that seem like they arrived on a late train from another film. Charles also largely abandons the interesting cinematography and production design found early in the film.On a less literal level Masked and Anonymous can be viewed somewhere between a thinly veiled parable based on Dylan's actual life and a cinematic realization of a number of Dylan lyrics.

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Dylan may well be a great poet  but he can't sing...and he certainly can't act. Bob sleeps through this film with an expression that remains the same no matter what he's doing. He can be fighting loving being invaded by men with guns...going down for something he didn't do and he still just stands there. Emotionless. Fans of his and no doubt the man himself will say that he's playing an emotionless character but at the end of the day this isn't acting it's just appearing in a film. It's a real shame that Bob is the star because when the star can't act there's going to be problems. He could have gotten away with a small support turn or even just singing his songs but people that cant act shouldn't be given a starring role. It's as simple as that. A whole host of big names have been hired to try and hide Dylan's awful acting however and the list includes the likes of Jeff Bridges Penlope Cruz John Goodman Mickey Rourke Jessica Lange Luke Wilson Ed Harris Val Kilmer Chris Penn Giovanni Ribisi Cheech Martin and even Christian Slater joins the...ahem fun. But sadly not a single one of these big names can save this mess.I was surprised to find that this crap was cowritten by Bob Dylan himself. Judging by his lyric writing abilities I always had Bob down as a wise man but according to his work here he's a selfindulgent egomaniac. The film is really just a poor excuse to show Dylan performing his songs and far too much of the running time is spent watching Bob perform. The rest of the film is spent watching Bob stand around while the big names try and make the scenes interesting. Watching Bob clutter up the scenes is really funny at first but it soon gets boring and the messy plot with it's even messier message doesn't help the proceedings at all. It's not even like you can ignore the lead and just enjoy the plot because that's terrible as well. In fact the only positive element of this film that I can think of is Sertab Erener's cover of Bob Dylan's One More Cup of Coffee which isn't a far cry away from being as good as The White Stripes' version. The only reason I watched this film was because it was late and there was nothing else on. If I could have turned it over I would and if you haven't got a real good reason like that one you really shouldn't be watching this film.".

They promised to love their son unconditionally no matter what.This film is filled with magic and wonder and should be seen by all audiences. An RRating is absolutely ridiculous!

His family passes the incident off as a joke but Ludovic proves remarkably singleminded and when he draws a neighborhood child into his fantasies he also incurs neighborhood hysteria. The result is at once comic and unpleasantly vicious as his classmates his neighbors and eventually his family gradually turn upon him.Although there are one or two problems with character development in the script the castparticularly Georges du Fresne as Ludovic and Helene Vincent as freespirit grandmother Elizabethis superlative and director Alain Berliner balances the seriocomic story with a very light touch. Viewers will laugh a little cry a little and ultimately come away from the film feeling an uncertain hope. The fact that this film is rated R is merely so much more evidence of the power of the herd to dictate standards of normalcyone or two profanities aside there is absolutely nothing in the film to offend any intelligent viewer and the film will hold a special appeal for older children who have been targeted as in any way different by their peers... and for the many adults who remember what it was like to be a victim of a society that prizes conformity over imagination creativity honesty integrity and selfawareness.

The movie taught me the word tolerance as I was one of these stupid guys who mocked on effeminate people. Maybe to reject my desire at this age to be free to disguise myself like Ludovic did in the movie. What I know is that being in a place that was supposed to gather cultivated people journalists and movie reviewers cinema lovers artists etc. I was chocked to hear people laughing at some scenes that were supposed to be moving sensitive and very important humanely. Also the sound going out public mouth tsss tsss tsss was so chocking that I felt more the pressure of nontolerant' society inside the movie theater itself more than the pressure Ludovic had to endure in his story. My personality was projected into Ludovic who suffered his moments in the film while I was personally suffering inside the theater and trying to vibe with the movie despite chocked snobbish people's reaction. An excellent movie. Rather a drama than a comedy!".

	onyx:emotionText "Being a movie fanatic and reviewer I was invited to the Semaine du Cinema Francophone in Beirut francophone cinema week. The movie taught me the word tolerance as I was one of these stupid guys who mocked on effeminate people. Maybe to reject my desire at this age to be free to disguise myself like Ludovic did in the movie. What I know is that being in a place that was supposed to gather cultivated people journalists and movie reviewers cinema lovers artists etc. I was chocked to hear people laughing at some scenes that were supposed to be moving sensitive and very important humanely. Also the sound going out public mouth tsss tsss tsss was so chocking that I felt more the pressure of nontolerant' society inside the movie theater itself more than the pressure Ludovic had to endure in his story. My personality was projected into Ludovic who suffered his moments in the film while I was personally suffering inside the theater and trying to vibe with the movie despite chocked snobbish people's reaction. An excellent movie. Rather a drama than a comedy!";

	schema:headline " A disturbing film that's more about the trauma of bad parenting than anything else";
	schema:reviewBody "I find myself at an unusual loss trying to decide how to rate this film. All in all I think I don't think I liked the film but some of that is due to problems in the film while some stems from problems in the characterizations and the degree to which I was bothered by how the parents of the child related to him. I also think that it is ultimately a sad film that is hurt by the attempt to attach a sort of sunny everything's gonna be OK ending.In parts I think this film does a great job of portraying how a young boy who might be effeminate or who might be gay or who might be transsexual experiences the world as his personality begins to come into conflict with the ways in which a the world expects a young boy to behave. I think it captures well the sense of confusion and panic that can occur to any child when the sense of a warm safe family environment is suddenly punctured when it bumps up against societal expectations  when YOU aren't doing anything different than before but suddenly everyone is unhappy with you. I do feel that the reactions of the community to this child seemed overthetop and unrealistic. The idea that the whole neighborhood would band together to ostracize a family who has a 7year old boy who likes to wear dresses and play with dolls is hard to believe. Of course we live in a world where in the same week the Texas legislature can vote 1356 to ban gay foster parents while the Connecticut Senate votes 268 to allow allow samesex civil unions so geography may be destiny and maybe there really are parts of France where parents would sign a petition to oust an effeminate 7year from his school and the school would agree.To me the emotional heart of the movie was in how the parents behaved rather than in how the child was reacting. I was horrified by many of the things they said and did or didn't say and didn't do to their son as the movie went on. One of things in this movie that left me sad is that while I think we are supposed to believe at the end that all is well and that the parents have accepted their son as he is there is really nothing in their behavior throughout the rest of the movie that helps you believe this. They both reject him so thoroughly and are ultimately so MEAN to him especially the mother who on more than one occasion blames him to his face for their troubles that one has to think they will continue to do so. They seem to underreact to the freezer incident which was after all a SUICIDE attempt by a 7 year old !!!! And the fact that the family appears so loving and supportive in the beginning of the film and that the other straight children appear happy and welladjusted only underscores the horror of what the their other son must be experiencing as HE is rejected by these otherwise supportive parents. But I also felt that all of the parents' bad behavior was outofcharacter given what we are otherwise shown about them in a way that suggests there is a problem with the scriptcharacterizations. As an aside I also found it odd that many conversations in the film that I would expect to take place privately took place with a larger audience  i.e. the child is present when the shrink talks about the boy's behavior the other children are present when the parents fight about the boy etc. But I don't know if this is bad writing or if these are just USFrance cultural differences in play.Either way and no matter what the end of the movie would have you think the boy has been pretty battered by how he's been treated especially by his parents  it's one thing to have the world against you but if at any age let alone 7 years old you don't have a safe secure home world you're really screwed and I don't think you get over that very easily. Heck he MOVES OUT at the age of 7 to live with his grandmother because everyone recognizes he'll be better off there. And then is effective forced back home because the family is moving. He's lost the innocent security of childhood years before the age that most people are forced to go through that.So I didn't hate the movie and it had moments that felt very truthful I loved when the psychologist tells the boy that there just may be things that his parents will never understand  I'm just not sure he was at an age to really hear her but there is a lot of stuff in the movie of which I am suspect and which feels contrived. If it is contrived there's a problem but to the extent that it's just reflecting a reality other than what I think exists then maybe it's good. But either way I am bothered by the suggestion in many reviews that this is some sort of feelgood movie. At the end of it all you still have a boy who has been traumatize by this family and neighbors and who is likely to continue to face similar problems for years to come.".

I didn't expect much to sympathize with a young boy who wants to dress in female clothing and take on womanly characteristics but as the film went along I not only felt a sympathy but a connection to him.  Anybody who's ever felt alienated for any reason should relate to Ludovic's character. Yet at the same time I related to the parents in the film too.  It's easy for an audience to say Why are the parents being so hard on the kid?  But if I had a son who wanted to dress up like a girl I wouldn't take it lightly at all.  If this were an American movie it would be treated like an afterschool special.  SPOILERS AHEAD If this were an American film by the third act all of Ludovic's peers would've embraced him with open arms you'd hear some cheesy score and he'd make some uplifting speech.  As a matter of fact there's a recent movie called Bruno also listed as The Dress Code which has an identical plot to this movie and it is given that corny sentimental treatment.    Ma Vie En Rose is strictly characterdriven.  There's never a moment where Ludovic's peers treat him with a ton of respectas it would be in real life.  I've expressed it before and I'll express it againkids and young people are cruel.  Their number one goal in life is to torment the lives of others.  I am a young person myself and I don't feel like I'm being a hypocrite when I say I'm not part of that majority.  The film is also filled with humor.  Some of the best movies are touching and powerful while managing to be very funny at the same time.  If you get your hands on this gem it's a mustsee!  My score  9 out of 10".

Yes its sad but also true.My Life In Pink definately ranks HIGH on the list of spectacular international films for me. I only wish I heard about it sooner but like every other thick headed westerner I was brainwashed into paying to see subpar movies like Men In Black Lost World Jurassic Park Con Air and Face Off in 1997 instead of this. Those movies weren't horrendous but they didn't have nearly as much depth and meaning as My Life In Pink.If you can find the video or DVD or even VCD then pick it up and watch it. Many will not like it at all because they may feel its weird or too taboo for them. But for those of you who are more open minded and are in search of a great piece of film making then this is for you. I felt nothing but sorrow and compassion for young Ludovic all throughout the film. His pain and sorrows his sadness and loneliness it brought some tears to my eyes seeing how horrendous he was treated. Everybody looked upon him like a monster. That him wanting to be a girl was outrageous and wrong. Yet again an accurate interpretation of society. Nowadays your not allowed to be anything that society deems unacceptable. Frankly it sickens me. Whether your gay straight bisexual lesbian or transgender its your decision and nobody has any right to tell you other wise.My Life In Pink accurately portrays the struggles that hundreds of youth face today. Youth that are struggling to discover their identities having to deal with family and friends that tease and taunt them for being different.I really don't want to say much about the movie because you should experience it without knowing much to get the whole impact of its message. See this movie. Its a prime example of AMAZING French cinema.A MUST SEE!!!! 4.5 OUT OF 5!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am astonished about some reactionsI am amazed to read things like this To me this was not a film about a disturbed child but about parents. The parents made apparently no effort to explain the biological difference between boys and girls. Second nobody enlightened the child on the difference between your secret internal sensitivities and those that one displays publicly. have you really not understood this movie or was it me?Of course this movie is not about a disturbed child! Maybe this movie is about the fact that all people from the moment they are born are conditioned to be like this and like that and especially not to be themselves. Boys have to play with cars and guns and girls with barby puppets and most definitely not the other way around otherwise you should take your kid to a therapist. Boys have to wear trousers and girls skirts or frogs just check school uniforms there are still quite some schools where girls may not wear trousers except for the really cold winter months. A child can not explore the world in a natural way whenever it yells to test the capacity of its lungs and any adult might dislike that it is silenced with other words whenever they are themselves they are silenced. We are all conditioned like rats in a skinner box and we are no more and no less than rats in a skinner box until we can say fk you to that society those politicians law enforcers teachers parents employers media so called friends that don't accept us like we are etc that gratefully fulfill the role of skinner.

Great! Great! I've told everyone I know to see this one! Really a fun entertaining charming sweet film. It will take you emotionally all over the place. But believe me it is really a great emotional ride. I love to see films like this that show all aspects of life! Enjoy this one with several friends!I think this film was everything except charming entertaining sweet fun... I think this film tries to confront people with the DISGUSTING society to which they all contribute it is a good movie but it has nothing to do with sweetness and charm and the like.

	onyx:emotionText "I am astonished about some reactionsI am amazed to read things like this To me this was not a film about a disturbed child but about parents. The parents made apparently no effort to explain the biological difference between boys and girls. Second nobody enlightened the child on the difference between your secret internal sensitivities and those that one displays publicly. have you really not understood this movie or was it me?Of course this movie is not about a disturbed child! Maybe this movie is about the fact that all people from the moment they are born are conditioned to be like this and like that and especially not to be themselves. Boys have to play with cars and guns and girls with barby puppets and most definitely not the other way around otherwise you should take your kid to a therapist. Boys have to wear trousers and girls skirts or frogs just check school uniforms there are still quite some schools where girls may not wear trousers except for the really cold winter months. A child can not explore the world in a natural way whenever it yells to test the capacity of its lungs and any adult might dislike that it is silenced with other words whenever they are themselves they are silenced. We are all conditioned like rats in a skinner box and we are no more and no less than rats in a skinner box until we can say fk you to that society those politicians law enforcers teachers parents employers media so called friends that don't accept us like we are etc that gratefully fulfill the role of skinner.

The most disturbing factor of this movie is that Ludovic remains innocent and rather naive as to why his wants are so wrong and no one really bothers to explain to him why it is seen as unseemly and even perhaps immoral.The most fascinating point seems to be how his relationships with his family members shift throughout the storyline his father takes the standard role of masculinely denying that his son is very effeminate and then gradually accepting his little quirk while his mother acts supportive and concerned for him only until her social life and connections are threatened by the way others view Ludovic.  She becomes the ultimate antagonist because a mother's role is to be loving caring and supportive of all of her child's wants and she throws those all away just so that she can blame their family's downfall on someone other than herself.I seriously recommend this film to anyone who is either an emotional masochist or is interested in studying varied interpretations of how a family may react to the uncommon wants of a little innocent boy.".

These uncomfortable moments are brilliantly cut against wonderful dreamlike scenes and also a few hopeful moments. It is so rare that a film captures a bit of the essence of what it means and entails to be transsexualtransgendered and oddly it's the ones that never even mention the 't' words. Unfortunately though the audience probably feels appropriate sympathy for the main character and experiences a more proper emotional reaction to a transgendered person they still remain uneducated on the details even proper words that are necessary for understanding the transgender experience. Ma Vie en Rose as a film has some terrific cinematography and even in translation alot of the dialogue is unique. Pacing is fantastic and the story is absolutely unforgettable.

It's easy to get that impression from the reactions and misinterpretations of Ludovic's parents but not if you empathise with his perspective.  It's a film about a young transsexual.  He doesn't just act like a girl he feels that he IS a girl trapped in a boy's body with such a passion that he believes he will one day become female.  Dressing as a girl and playing with girls toys is an obvious extension of that and if you truly believed you were or would become a heterosexual girl marrying your male friend would feel perfectly natural.The film treats the subject from a nonjudgemental viewpoint contrasting the destruction of family and work relationships against Ludovic's wideeyed innocence about the consequences of him just being himherself.  In the process of his parents coping with their lack of understanding they try to mould him into something more socially acceptable and normal like forcing a left handed person to use their right hand instead.  Adult acceptance only comes in the form of treating it as childhood navet and the film fails to confront the fact that this may not be just a phase.  Given this the ending is a little weak abrupt and too openended but overall it's a tender emotive and enjoyable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Ma Vie en Rose conveys the struggle of a little girl who was into the world genetically male.  She struggles with societal norms and biases encountered while trying to come to terms with her identity. The audience witnesses one family's struggle in accepting their daughter as female not as the little boy Ludovic whom they believed she was. The family has trouble accepting Ludovic as a little girl because of the pressure from society more specifically their neighbors. As the neighbors become surveyors of Ludovic and his family the family internalizes being surveyed and change their nature towards her on account of this the basic premise of a theory by John Berger. The application of panopticism a feeling that one is always being watched by the neighbors creates a pressure on the family to reprimand Ludovic for her own acceptance of the guidelines set by society of what it means to be a little girl. To Ludovic being a girl means wearing dresses marrying boys putting on make up and a number of other stereotypical concepts of femininity. The film addresses the problem with the inflexible gender lines in modern day society and society's reinforcement of stereotypes that have come to define femininity. Ludovic believes she is a girl which she claims repetitively in the film. She believes that to show everyone else that she is a girl she must play the part and to do that she must accept the symbols of femininity set by society. It is society that classifies gender and it is society in this film that tells Ludovic that she is not a girl but a boy.  In the film the community involved exemplifies the inflexible gender lines by ostracizing harassing forcing Ludovic to leave school and even forcing the family out of the community. The film does an excellent job of demonstrating that gender is not something assigned at birth but rather a construct of society. It shows that children are taught to think that blue is for boys and pink is for girls. This is not a natural thought pattern but an accepted one.".

Later on  the Corporal along with two rebels Barta Barri  Tito Garcia are imprisoned by Indians  being mistreated and tortured  but a good Indian girl Diana Lorys frees him . Paul falls in love with the gorgeous Indian and both of whom suffer hot pursuits  risks and dangers . This is effortless and below average story in Paella Western subgenre style  thus the picture includes the Canadian theme similarly to Unconquered by Cecil B De Mille and The Canadians by Burt Kennedy . As the movie follows more the American models than Spaghetti Western wake . Other Spanish films about Canadian Mounted Police are Mestizo by Julio Buchs and Revolt in Canada by Amando De Ossorio  concerning similar events  battles between Red Skins and Red Long Coats. As it results to be a familiar film  with no much violence  though there are many deaths . The picture contains an exciting and spectacular final battle  though badly paced  including hundreds of extras  when the regiment is besieged by Indians . However  nobody seems to be wearing any clothes more than a week old and modern day police special pistols are used alongside of propish looking firearms with little or no concern about authenticity . Characters use knives that are brand new reflectively shiny and don't appear to be sharpened . Regularly played by Alan Scott and Frank Latimore who overacts as an upright and stiff commander . Many other familiar faces from ChorizoSpaghetti  there appears ordinary secondaries in SpanishItalian Western such as Alfonso Rojas  Barta Barri Luis Barboo  Fernando Bilbao  Xan Das Bolas  Frank Braa Rufino Ingls  Alfonso de la Vega  Tito Garca and special mention to Rafael Hernndez who plays the starring's partner  acting as comic relief . Colorful photography by Ricardo Torres  being necessary a right remastering  and filmed on location in Las Rozas  Manzanares  Navacerrada Madrid . Atmospheric musical score by Daniel White  Jesus Franco's usual . The movie was produced in enough budget by Regia FilmArturo Gonzalez and Jose Frade productions that financed several Western during the 60s and early 70s such as Cuatreros  Mestizo  Challenge of McKenna  The mercenary  Los Compaeros twenty dollars for seven and Saddle tramps  among others. The motion picture was regularly directed by Ramon Torrado . Ramon was born in 1905  Galicia Spain. He was a director and writer known for directing some vehicles of known Folklorics stars such as Peret in Amor a Todo gas 1969  Manolo Escobar in Un Beso en Puerto 1966 and Paquito Rico in Malvaloca 1954. Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1965 Los Cuatreros  1964 La Carga de la Polica Montada  1964 Relevo a Pistolero and 1963 Bienvenido Padre Murray .".

A film about execution and tragedy often falls flat on its face because the viewer walks away feeling empty sad and depressed but here is an entirely different situation.The director paints a true picture of the love all family members had for one another and at the same time shows the type of callous and cynical people were in power after the revolution.Finally we are showed footage of the canonization of the family as martyrs for the manner in which they accepted their death without any prejudice to their evil executioners.It is a heavy film but one that does inspire.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of the best films concerning the last Imperial Russian family.It shows a sympathetic look at Tsar Nicholas II as he is losing control over his empire. Which then leads to his and his family's arrest.Unlike most movies which deal with the Russian royalty this film leaves out the infamous Rasputin and shows more of a historic portrayal of the last few months of the Imperial family from being arrested to being executed.Also this film is not just dealing with Grand Duchess Anastasia it includes all four daughters and Alexei. spoilers There is a hinted romance of one of the guards for Grand Duchess Olga. All actors played their roles beautifully the love between Nicky and Alix shows such a great chemistry while the Grand Duchesses show their sisterly love for their ill brother Alexei who seems very mature and wise near the end.The execution scene is quick and bloody. Showing the cruelty of what happen 90 years ago.If your looking for an acute Russian Imperial movie to show to a Modern history class I suggest Romanovy. You can watch this on youtube with subtitles.".

They did not show the mistreatment of the family while they were under housearrest. The acting is amazing however. From the soldier refusing his superior's orders to the person responsible for moving the family against his will? ambivalence to the Tsarevich's friend sad to see the family go. The children behaved like real children the mixed feelings everyone had about everything... it's quite deep even if the story is very straightforward. The moment the monarch is dethroned it becomes apparent that there was no escape for the family. Dissolving the monarchy did not satisfy the Bolsheviks so the writing was on the wall.All in all it's a great lighthearted film even if it's very sad at the end.

But because there are so many angles for the filmmakers to come fromcollapse of stairs wild animals lurking bad wiringit manages to hold itself together for around ninety minutes. A big credit goes to Hanks who's facial expressions are priceless at times. Such as when he accidentally hammers his thumb. Too stunned to curse he does what we all do as he begins to beat the hell out of the object he was hammering. Even his charm in the earlier scenes like dealing with a bratty kidstar are funny. Long is good as his sort of straightwoman but Godunov steals all his scenes as her selfabsorbed ex husband. Bosco is great as the grandfather of the entire construction crew and even the subsubcharacters are engaging as everyone always has a goofy line to chime in with i.e. the infamous Two weeks. But the coup de gras of the entire thing is a slapstick setpiece that brings down the house literally. All I'll say is that involves Hanks going on a proverbial rollercoaster ride in and around the house for a good two minutes. The choreography and timing starting with Hanks and going all the way down the extras is amazing. Even if you aren't into the film at least stay until that moment. There's an extramarital subplot that usually in a comedy never fits. But because we like Hanks and Long so much we get into it. And it leads to one of Hanks' funnier line readings ever.

Some of the scenes involving Hanks in this movie made me laugh so hard I couldn't breathe. This movie is intended to be a farce and it succeeds totally. The rest of the cast is not very strong  I have never and I assume never will be a Shelley Long fan  she doesn't do anything but provide a sounding board for Hanks anyway. But then again she really doesn't need to. This movie is definitely worth taking a look at if you haven't seen it  the first time you watch it it is genuinely hilarious. I just watched it again after about three years without seeing it and found it to still  hold up. The scene when the chimney falls apart is my favorite.

I just watched it again after about three years without seeing it and found it to still  hold up. The scene when the chimney falls apart is my favorite. I wish hanks would do another comedy but he's all serious now. oh well.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Money Pit is directed by Richard Benjamin and written by David Giler. It stars Tom Hanks Shelley Long Alexander Godunov and Maureen Stapleton. Music is by Michael Colombier and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Plot finds Hanks and Long as a young couple who buy what they think is their dream house only to find the house falling apart around them.Mozart is dead his troubles are over.He went on to be a big mover in the acting world did Tom Hanks so much so it's always a little weird revisiting his comedy output in the 1980s because he's a vastly different actor now. Yet for many of us that decade holds many treasures where nostalgic fever takes a hold and a warm glow does come with watching the young Hanks bound about with comedic glee. The Money Pit doesn't have the cult worship of Splash or the internet respect of Big yet it's a wonderfully funny picture that finds Hanks on optimum energised form. The plot might be thin and Long kind of gets pushed to one side but this has much to enjoy with a bottle of vino and snacks. That is of course if you don't mind laughing at the misfortune of new home owners?! I am sinking fast into the money pit.A number of sequences are pure farce but in the good way stairs collapse as does the chimney doors floors and a leaking roof bring the mirth as does a laugh out loud bath moment. It sounds a little chaotic and it is at times but the screenplay allows Hanks  Long and the wonderful Godunov time to breath life into the characters. There's a lovely romance at the core of the story one that inevitably will be tested by the chaos of the house renovations and Godunov's third party ex. They are a very likable couple and easy to root for. Helps that Hanks is full of effervescent boyishness and Long is so homely and pretty the latter of which I don't think has ever looked better than during a red dress sequence here.If the foundation is OK? Then everything else can be fixed.It doesn't have any surprises in store it goes exactly where you expect it too which naturally renders the final third as being all about the sentiment and the message. With the comedy gone picture struggles a touch to put the final coat of paint on the project. But it's nicely underplayed by the actors and really this is about love triumphant against adversity. With the laughs that came previously more than making this a blues lifter for the nostalgic amongst us. 7.510".

Even being used to films treating me like an idiot I was mildly surprised by The Money Pit 'Spielberg Presents'.The 'film' presents a beautifully symmetric structure. It is framed by a ludicrous prelude and a preposterous postlude. At the centre stands one long gag repeated over and over. Lacking any kind of plot or character development this lovely mindless RomCom is brutally brought to a brutally lovely end by the most painful of narrative clichs.  NO MUCH TO SPOIL SPOILER So here are a little more details if you are curious about Hanks's worst film but have wisely decided not to watch it. If it's surreal fun what you're after you might be better off going back to Lynch.The central part of the film is one long gag about a house literally  oh yes so very delightfully literally  falling apart. Hanks's character keeps injuring his spinal cord and getting electrocuted but alas he does not die. Eheh that's funny.Then 20 minutes to the end when I was almost getting used to the total lack of narrative drive and was learning how to sink deep into my sofa to enjoy the film as mere abstract visual pleasure something started to happen. It was like  the filmmakers suddenly realising that this was meant to be a romantic comedy. So yes they come up with the twist She has dinner with her exhusband and wakes up in her bed! Ah! Her husband tells her they had sex! Ah! She does not remember but believes him! Ah! OBSTACLE to the ROMANCE! Just now that Hanks had learnt how not to get electrocuted. Oh dear. Hanks is hurt the two split up. But then 5 minutes to the end... oh well I am not going to spoil this for you... but you're up for a big surprise!".

	schema:headline " Wild Girl has it all action romance bear cubs and skinnydipping";
	schema:reviewBody "When this rare Western was shown recently at the Museum of Modern Art I happened to overhear a conversation just before the screening between two women sitting in the row ahead of me. One had already seen Wild Girl and assured her friend that it's very enjoyable then added that the opening credits alone are worth the price of admission. That struck me as puzzling but once the movie started I understood what she meant. The first thing we see is an oldfashioned photo album on a desk with a lit candle nearby. As if by magic the book opens itself and the film's credits appear on its pages which turn one by one in a forerunner to the storybook style credits the Disney studio would favor for their cartoon features in later years. It's pleasant enough but the truly memorable part comes with the introduction of the featured players. We see them one at a time first Charles Farrell then Joan Bennett Ralph Bellamy etc. each standing as if posing for a formal portrait in costume. And each in turn delivers a brief speech telling us something about the character he or she is playing. This photo album motif continues throughout the film recurring at key points in the story when the pageturn effect reappears as an optical wipe that provides a change of scene.The motif is charming and well suited to the material. Wild Girl is an adaptation of Salomy Jane a novella by Bret Harte published in the late 1800s. There was also a 1907 stage version called Salomy Jane's Kiss. Director Raoul Walsh's highly cinematic presentation reminds us that what we're experiencing is above all a movie and not a book or a play and also helps us make allowances when the plot turns melodramatic or when the acting occasionally comes off as stagey. What isn't at all stagey is the scenery Wild Girl was filmed on location in Northern California at Shasta National Forest and it's plain from the opening sequence as Salomy Jane Joan Bennett blonde and dazzling and her Mammy Lou Louise Beavers run through the woods among bear cubs that the giant redwood trees we're seeing are the real thing not a studio set. The scenery is amazing and beautifully photographed and it's also noticeable that the editing tempo is brisk and the use of sound in this outdoor setting is sophisticated. There's no need to make excuses for this film as an early talkie in terms of its technique for Walsh was past that phase and well ahead of many of his contemporaries in utilizing the still new still evolving technology.Naturally the title refers to Salomy Jane a very attractive tomboy who lives in a mountain town where naturally several of the men folk compete for her affections. There's Jack Marbury the gentleman gambler Ralph Bellamy whom she likes and loutish Rufe Waters Irving Pichel whom she dislikes. And then there's the pseudopious political climber Phineas Baldwin Morgan Wallace whom she loathes. But the man of the hour who appears out of nowhere and swiftly steals Jane's heart is a handsome stranger Charles Farrell who comes to town to settle an old score with Baldwin. Colorful characters abound in this locality.

	onyx:emotionText "When this rare Western was shown recently at the Museum of Modern Art I happened to overhear a conversation just before the screening between two women sitting in the row ahead of me. One had already seen Wild Girl and assured her friend that it's very enjoyable then added that the opening credits alone are worth the price of admission. That struck me as puzzling but once the movie started I understood what she meant. The first thing we see is an oldfashioned photo album on a desk with a lit candle nearby. As if by magic the book opens itself and the film's credits appear on its pages which turn one by one in a forerunner to the storybook style credits the Disney studio would favor for their cartoon features in later years. It's pleasant enough but the truly memorable part comes with the introduction of the featured players. We see them one at a time first Charles Farrell then Joan Bennett Ralph Bellamy etc. each standing as if posing for a formal portrait in costume. And each in turn delivers a brief speech telling us something about the character he or she is playing. This photo album motif continues throughout the film recurring at key points in the story when the pageturn effect reappears as an optical wipe that provides a change of scene.The motif is charming and well suited to the material. Wild Girl is an adaptation of Salomy Jane a novella by Bret Harte published in the late 1800s. There was also a 1907 stage version called Salomy Jane's Kiss. Director Raoul Walsh's highly cinematic presentation reminds us that what we're experiencing is above all a movie and not a book or a play and also helps us make allowances when the plot turns melodramatic or when the acting occasionally comes off as stagey. What isn't at all stagey is the scenery Wild Girl was filmed on location in Northern California at Shasta National Forest and it's plain from the opening sequence as Salomy Jane Joan Bennett blonde and dazzling and her Mammy Lou Louise Beavers run through the woods among bear cubs that the giant redwood trees we're seeing are the real thing not a studio set. The scenery is amazing and beautifully photographed and it's also noticeable that the editing tempo is brisk and the use of sound in this outdoor setting is sophisticated. There's no need to make excuses for this film as an early talkie in terms of its technique for Walsh was past that phase and well ahead of many of his contemporaries in utilizing the still new still evolving technology.Naturally the title refers to Salomy Jane a very attractive tomboy who lives in a mountain town where naturally several of the men folk compete for her affections. There's Jack Marbury the gentleman gambler Ralph Bellamy whom she likes and loutish Rufe Waters Irving Pichel whom she dislikes. And then there's the pseudopious political climber Phineas Baldwin Morgan Wallace whom she loathes. But the man of the hour who appears out of nowhere and swiftly steals Jane's heart is a handsome stranger Charles Farrell who comes to town to settle an old score with Baldwin. Colorful characters abound in this locality. There's a family headed by noaccount Red Pete whose wife Lize loves him anyhow Willard Robertson and Sarah Padden portray this pathetic couple and both are excellent. But despite all these folks jostling for our attention stagecoach driver Yuba Bill played by the one and only Eugene Palette deftly steals the show. He's a timorous longwinded braggart and the scene where he breathlessly attempts to describe a holdup only to digress into a series of horse whinnies and snorting noises is an indisputable highpoint.

Harte's characters were not onedimensional he approached them as complex human beings with conflicting sets of emotions and selfjustifications. As a result this movie derived from Salomy Jane's Kiss has a lot going for it. Add in the outdoor shooting among the redwoods around Mount Shasta and the lovely conceit of using frame wipes that freeze the frame and then make it look like a page being turned and you have a beautiful motion picture.Unhappily few of the performances are up to the visuals. Perhaps it was due to the fact that handling of sound outdoors was still pretty primitive and some of the performers are either unseasoned for the screen or still not out of the silent era and the line readings sound very stagey. Whatever the reasons they act best when they are doing things not saying things  the hanging sequence is devastating.Even with that cavil this is a wonderful picture. Everyone looks right and Joan Bennett is stunningly beautiful. If you get a chance to see it  mine came with the 2012 Museum of Modern Art 'To Preserve and Project' festival  take it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since Warners revamped the ScoobyDoo franchise in 1998 feature length mysteries have been inconsistent. The first few had real monsters with no rubber masks but far too many disgustingly PC mommies in America complained and the Brothers Warner folded and went back to the guy in a suit to scare away the locals stories. A shame.What a surprise then that Scooby's latest adventure is actually quite good despite its PC shortcomings. This time around the Mystery Inc. gang are in Hawaii catching some rays and relaxation. Typically this is the exact moment the local volcano starts brewing over and a big monster called the WikiTiki rears its ugly head scaring away all of the surfers from the Hunahana resort and kidnapping a local babe. If you are incredibly sad like me you will realise this is too much like the 1970 episode A Tiki Scare Is No Fair.The usual long list of suspects includes a sleazy real estate agent an ambitious mayor and an eccentric holiday rep Adam West. And just as soon as their mysterysolving begins the real culprit is immediately noticeable. It's a poorly written whodunit but what saves it are crazy set pieces and a varied atmosphere which keep the mystery interesting if obvious. Or at least obvious to a 24yearold. It may well come as a surprise to an eightyearold.Locations such as the beach the deep jungle the catacombs and Auntie Mahina's cabin are beautifully animated. The best thing about the modern Scooby is that production values are a zillion times what the original 1969 series was. Aloha ScoobyDoo looks incredibly slick and the eyepopping colour schemes would keep you interested no matter how poor the mystery was.One could accuse the film of being slightly xenophobic and somewhat stereotypical in regards to its Hawaiian setting. But it's no worse than the unrealistic Scotland seen in last year's ScoobyDoo And The Loch Ness Monster.I was also surprised at how little of it actually relies on Scooby voiced by Frank Welker who also does Fred. He barely gets a chance to do his thang. Most of the laughs come from the rest of the gang. But as it is Aloha ScoobyDoo is still loads of fun and proves that while the story quality of modern Scoobys remains inconsistent the animation just gets better and better.".

This is always something I've enjoyed about these ScoobyDoo cartoons while in the cartoons where the monster were real are still very good I always find the original way is much better as it gives the old feeling back.The storyline this cartoon follows is great it gives us all a barrel of laughs and a great mystery to watch. Although it has a predictable ending it is still something you will want to watch over and over again.This has to be the best all star voice cast I've ever seen in a ScoobyDoo cartoon so far it has so many great and famous actors such as Frank Welker as ScoobyDoo and Fred Mindy Cohn as Velma Grey Delisle as Daphne Casey Kasem as Shaggy Tia Carrere as Snookie Mario Lopez as Manu Tuiama Teri Garr as Mayor Molly Quinn and they even have Adam West as Jared Moon.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really had no let downs for me. The setting is stunning and down with great animation. I would recommend this movie based just on that. The plot is fairly good as well. It takes a while to figure out who did the crime. There are some good laughs along the way as well. I can't say anything bad about the characters they all seemed to live up to expectation. I thought scooby could have been a little more involved though. As I mentioned briefly before the animation was done very well. At points everything looked 3D rather than cartoon. The opening and closing songs were pretty good as well. All in all scooby doo fans cannot miss this one its definitely one of the best out of the movies that have been produced within the last decade.".

It takes a while to figure out who did the crime. There are some good laughs along the way as well. I can't say anything bad about the characters they all seemed to live up to expectation. I thought scooby could have been a little more involved though. As I mentioned briefly before the animation was done very well. At points everything looked 3D rather than cartoon. The opening and closing songs were pretty good as well. All in all scooby doo fans cannot miss this one its definitely one of the best out of the movies that have been produced within the last decade.";

The animation I thought was beautiful with wonderful exotic backgrounds and some sinister looking ones too. I thought it was very funny especially Shaggy voiced by the one and only Casey Kasem who just brings a sense of vitality to the character and it is always a delight to see. The other voice talents are also great Adam West even makes an appearance. The music is lovely here quite atmospheric. The characters are very likable and I must say the WikiKiki is quite something in a scary sort of way. I also liked the fact that Daphne's hair actually came useful for once to point the gang north. However the story is fairly predictable and sometimes unevenly paced. And I did find the character of Molly a bit annoying. Overall not a bad movie as a matter of fact I really did like it and I give it an 810. Bethany Cox".

Well within a few minutes I was dying to see how it turned out. Because I had NO clue what was going on I really thought this was a documentary about the nowknown fake Nick Decker. I really felt bad for this guy because he was a putrid horrible actor. However the actor playing Nick was convincing me that this guy was a really bad actor while when he was not in auditions was what I consider a GREAT performance. He really made me think this guy was real his struggles were genuine and his angers real. He seemed like a young naive honest guy from the midwest trying to make it in a killer type of acting atmosphere. The best scene in the movie is when Angie finds out he's been lying to her.What had captured my attention was when I heard the name Adam Rifkin...who I had heard of but wasn't quite familiar with. Well I think he did a terrific job with this movie!  Sometimes the normal way of doing things gets old and this was very refreshing. It also goes to show how hard it is to get work in Hollywood.What the big surprise of this movie was lies with that of the redheaded vixen Angie Everheart. I REALLY THOUGHT THIS HAD happened with the fake press clips newspapers clips etc.  She was fantastic!!!  Look at her career before this movie and you will see like 6 jobs in 5 years in movies. Since this movie she's had like 15 jobs in 3 years! Angie has really matured as an actress...I also like how the angie character was sincere and genuine it really made me like the personality of her and want to know more about her....overall very entertaining..surprisingly good performances when you find out afterwards it's fake but based on someone else's story".

I really felt bad for this guy because he was a putrid horrible actor. However the actor playing Nick was convincing me that this guy was a really bad actor while when he was not in auditions was what I consider a GREAT performance. He really made me think this guy was real his struggles were genuine and his angers real. He seemed like a young naive honest guy from the midwest trying to make it in a killer type of acting atmosphere. The best scene in the movie is when Angie finds out he's been lying to her.What had captured my attention was when I heard the name Adam Rifkin...who I had heard of but wasn't quite familiar with. Well I think he did a terrific job with this movie!  Sometimes the normal way of doing things gets old and this was very refreshing. It also goes to show how hard it is to get work in Hollywood.What the big surprise of this movie was lies with that of the redheaded vixen Angie Everheart. I REALLY THOUGHT THIS HAD happened with the fake press clips newspapers clips etc.  She was fantastic!!!  Look at her career before this movie and you will see like 6 jobs in 5 years in movies. Since this movie she's had like 15 jobs in 3 years! Angie has really matured as an actress...I also like how the angie character was sincere and genuine it really made me like the personality of her and want to know more about her....overall very entertaining..surprisingly good performances when you find out afterwards it's fake but based on someone else's story";

	schema:reviewBody "Paul and Michelle begins three years after the title characters ended the story of Friends.  Although it is not as good as the original the film comes together very well.  In Friends a teen romantic classic the British Paul and French Michelle ran away and lived together in a secluded romantic dream.  In Paul and Michelle the couple must face the hardships and boredom of everyday life.  They soon learn the responsibility of working for a living and bringing up the child they had in Friends.In the beginning Michelle and daughter Sylvie who was born in Friends are living with Gary a young American businessman in a French coastal town. The three have an almost normal family life in which Sylvie has bonded with Gary.Paul now a college student abandons academic life to search for Michelle. When he arrives in town there is a very funny sequence when Paul keeps searching every street and shop for Michelle and just keeps missing her every time.  At last the two literally bump into each other on the street and embrace in a joyful reunion.  The very gracious Gary always knowing that Paul is the true love of Michelle's life leaves to let Paul move into the apartment.The main plot of the story is Paul and Michelle's brutal discovery that it is tough to make their romantic love work in the everyday world.  Having been raised with wealth Paul finds the life of a working man difficult as he takes a job as a meatcutter to support his family.  Paul and Michelle work jobs in different shifts and take turns watching Sylvie.  Their jobs tire them out and raising an active threeyear old wears the romance very thin.  Paul finds it very hard to bond with his longlost daughter. Even though she calls him Daddy it is a long time until she loves him as much as she loved Gary.  The director highlights these realities by inserting a number of flashbacks of Friends to contrast with their new life.Paul misses his exciting student life.  There is one anachronistic scene where Paul participates in a poor excuse for a 1960's style student riot that is broken up by the police.  In a much more dramatic incident Paul goes out to a bistro with a young woman friend leaving Sylvie alone in the apartment.  As you might guess it isn't long before the active tyke gets out.  When Michelle returns from work to find her daughter gone and sees Paul outside with this woman she nearly panics.  Paul and Michelle have to chase all over town to rescue their daughter.  Michelle is quite angry.I can relate to this story more today than I did in 1974 now that I'm older married with children and have been working for a living for many years.  Paul and Michelle is not the dreamy classic you saw in Friends but the movie will entertain you as it portrays the strains of growing up and trying to keep romance alive in the real world.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the sequel to the unlikely 1971 hit Friends a movie about rich British boy living in Paris who meets a poor orphaned French girl and runs off with her to play house in the countryside only to end up with a child. It's three years later and Paul has just graduated as head boy from a tony private school and is planning to attend the Sorbonne in the fall. He decides to spend the summer seeking out Michelle and his illegitimate child apparently they'd never heard of legally obligated child support in France at the time. He finds her living with another man Keir Dullea who is an accomplished judo master. Just when you think Paul is finally going to get his teeth kicked down his throat after he takes Michelle to a cheap hotel for sex on their first getreacquainted date Dullea's character does something quite unbelievable instead which clears the way for the movie to needlessly cover the EXACT same ground it had already trod in the first film.The best reason to see this film is no doubt beautiful French actress Anicee Alvina who is obviously no less appealing here at 20 than she was at 17 in the earlier film. Once again she has plenty of nude scenes including a flashback that are each of course completely essential to the plot. Far be it from me to complain about THAT but by this time Alvina had begun to appear in deranged Alain RobbeGrillet artporn films and the abovepar Italian giallo Anima Persae which make just as good of use her but are also much more worthwhile viewing than this rather saccharine film. And Alvina also didn't have to speak English in those films. Usually cute French girls with accents are even more sexy but Alvina seems to speak English only phonetically in both of these movies and it gets more than a little irritating.I also can't rave about Elton John who provided the surprising hit song for the first film but the music in this sequel is much much worse than even the worst dreck in the Elton John oeuvre. This film is not really a bad film but it simply has no reason to really exist no real raison d'etre hey I think my French is better than Alvina's English. They should probably have just quit while they were ahead. . .".

It was all such a long time ago now. But it has lingered in the hearts of so many and I am always humbled to receive mails from those for whom it had a special meaning.  As you say Anicee was a very beautiful kind lady. I have just had my 60th birthday a few days ago.... and am still receiving verytouching letters from all over the world. I keep the fond memories of the making of the film in my heart and so appreciate the touching response from those who like you have taken the trouble to write to me. I recently made contact with a chap in Thailand at scorpion DVDs   Amazon Nathan has been kind enough to sell me a few copies of Friends that was released by Paramount Japan so I am led to believe. It might be worth your while looking him up and seeing if he has a suitable copy for your part of the world. I know the copieswork here in the UK as my step grand daughters have recently finally got to see it.  P and M was never released on DVD as far as I am aware. I have no contact with the industry I used to know since the small part I played in the Bond film The Spy who loved me... and I only did that because Lewis Gilbert was kind enough to ring me and ask if I wanted a small part in it..... so more out of curiosity than serious professional commitment I did it... with my elder brother in it too!  I have absolutely no IT qualifications I'm afraid so an electronic signature would not be possible. I would be interested to know if you manage to get a copy that suits your machine there as I do get asked more and more.  I think the film captured a moment in time of 2 young kids growing up in real life..... and Lewis's very careful handling of not only the characters but also of Anicee and myself during the process of rehearsals and subsequent shooting. The wonderfully good fortune of Elton's music and the musical arrangement of Paul Buckmaster..... like so many things in life..... you can have the best ingredients in a cooking pot.... but you are never sure of the outcome. The result was I still think just a very sweet little film that caught a moment in time that resonated with so many.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart and wish you both a wonderful continuation of life.... andmay joy and happiness follow both you and Judith all your days.  Kind regards and very humbled  Sean Bury".

What I think that the other reviewer is noticing is the overly intellectual just plain poor lyrics that go with that melody. The lyrics are too heavy and wordy and it kills the melody. The jazzy arrangement at the beginning of the film doesn't do justice to the melody as the singer at the beginning of the film doesn't do justice to the melody either. So on its own the melody is not dreck or worse it is hauntingly sad when played in its orchestral arrangement alone but the lyrics and singing of the song using that tearful melody never should have happened!".

Some of the scenes in both movies gave me quite a chuckle...they seemed so forced!  But I suppose it is pretty hard to act that depth of emotion when you hardly know one another and having to take your clothes off.  Overall I marvelled at the subject matter...that puppy love would be seen as commonplace now.The saddest part of both films is the end of course especially in the second one. SPOILER  You know they will never see each other again. sighI wonder what ever happened to Sean Bury....?  Looked all over the net and came up with nothing.All in all watching these films was nicely escapist...".

	schema:headline " A film about human choices lusts and consequences";
	schema:reviewBody "Adrian Lyne is fascinated by human sexuality and he presents it in a way that is adult but without being pornographic. Unfaithful tells the story of a perfectly normal and happy couple Edward Richard Gere and Connie Diane Lane. They look ideal he is a very successful businessman she is a wonderful and loving wife and mother to their young son and they live in a beautiful home. Everything is perfect until one day Connie goes into the city to shop for her son's birthday party when a wind storm makes her bump into a handsome French librarianbook collector named Paul Olivier Martinez. She is injured and unable to get a taxi Paul helps her and when he was unable to get her into a taxi he offers her to come upstairs to his apartment to use a telephone and bandage up her injury. Connie is immediately attracted and fascinated by the handsome stranger but nothing happens and she goes home but she cannot stop thinking about Paul. She goes back and finds him. In the second encounter with Paul nothing happens but she still cannot stop thinking about him and it seems very obvious to Paul that he is also attracted to her. In the third encounter Paul and Connie have sex and it is the beginning of a tumultuous affair that will set a chain reaction of guilt jealousy obsession heartbreak and murder.I love how Adrian Lyne very much like he did in Fatal Attraction adds the human drama of the family breaking apart because of an infidelity. Connie was not looking for an affair and her relationship with Paul was the result of an accident. We don't even question why Connie has an affair with this person. She did it out of impulse out of lust and for the pure excitement of how far she could take it until she realizes the effect it begins to have on her she begins to obsess over Paul she is hurting the man she truly loves Edward and she begins to see the toll it takes on her as a mother. After another encounter with her lover she is late to pick up her son from school who is waiting for her on the steps of the school. We see the slow fall the family begins to take and we are even touched at the little child's innocence and how he never ever picks up the signals that his parent's marriage is breaking apart. The performances by the actors are especially effective particularly by the two leads Richard Gere and Diane Lane. Gere is heartbreaking in a role that plays opposite to the playboy image that made him famous as he plays the role of a man whose own world falls apart as he begins to suspect his wife's infidelity and his own humiliation begins to take a toll on him. He never even asks his wife if she is cheating but hires a private detective. The ending when he tells Connie that it was her that he hated and it was her that he wished would die...what a great Richard Gere moment! And of course there is Diane Lane she was beautiful at 13 and she is beautiful today. She is magnificent in this role which was originally intended for actresses like Sharon Stone and Kim Basinger who were the original choices for the role of Connie. But one word describes Lane's performance luminous. The classic Lane moment was the scene with her on the train on her way home after her first sexual encounter with Paul. A scene that was shot only once and Lane's expressions changes from giddy guilty shameful embarrassed and excited as she cries and laughs and giggles. All of these expressions flashing through in a matter of seconds all in one shot! The scene where she finds the pictures of her and her lover taken by the private detective How she looks through them and waves of nausea embarrassment guilt and absolute regret. The scene where she sits by the fireplace as she burns the pictures taken by the PI and she looks back and wishes that she had never gone up in the apartment and if she had just gone home. Lane doesn't make us hate her character but at the same time doesn't really allow us to condone Connie's actions. She rather shows the audience that Connie is only a HUMAN being and she is not perfect and she made a mistake and that she feels lust and also feels guilt. It is a touching and sexy performance. Even Olivier Martinez plays his role effectively. He is if anything an innocent. He didn't fall in love with Connie and he wasn't searching for anyone. He was simply fulfilling his own desires and hers and it aroused him but his desires in the end made him the victim of a tragedy that didn't need to happen. He is also very sexy and very mysterious and what woman in the planet wouldn't lust after him! Unfaithful really plays itself out as a human story about lust and the consequences but it doesn't preach. It's message is that no one is perfect and everyone is only human and we respond to the basic human desires and needs but there is always a consequence for every decision or impulse made. An excellent film.".

I guess not that many movies for women in their 30's plus exist these days!I expected this movie as I'm sure many people did to be a Fatal Attraction but with the genders switched around.I was pleasantly surprised and shocked by it NOT being what I expected and I definitely enjoyed it alot more than Fatal Attraction.The summary of this movie is that Diane Lane's character starts cheating on her husband Richard Gere with a beautiful French manOlivier Martinez. Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son Charlie who adds alot of humour to the movie but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting to say the least and perhaps very honest.The acting is great especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy and made me uncomfortable at certain points but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending although others may argue differently. This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much from 'Unfaithful' as I thought it would be another 'The Perfect Murder' type thriller. But 'Unfaithful' is so much more than what 'The Perfect Murder' could ever be. It's deeper. It's darker. It has so many psychological layers. It's more a character driven drama rather than than plot driven. The plot may not be exactly original but it's the influence of it on the characters is what 'Unfaithful' is about. The film is very engaging as we witness the psychological effects of the consequences of Connie's decision. Lyne deserves praise for his excellent artistic execution. I loved how he used symbolism such as metaphors and pathetic fallacies and shows great attention to detail as is evident in the visuals. The editing is clear cut. Biziou's cinematography is great and Kaczmarek's score sets the tone. Note that during the key moments when the main characters are conversing the background music is absent. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez though a little too old do decent jobs. However it is Diane Lane who gives a careerdefining performance. Her sublime portrayal of the incredibly sexy Connie is awesome. She carries the film. It is Diane Lane and Adrian Lyne's film. 'Unfaithful' is a magnificent engaging artistic drama. I don't understand why some were even harsh enough to call it softcore. Do they even know the definition of softcore? Others seem to have a problem with why Connie who had the perfect life would have an affair. But I feel it necessary to stress that nobody is perfect and therefore the perfect life does not exist. Connie's affair wasn't a planned thing. Who knows why it happened? Perhaps she wanted to feel younger perhaps she was bored or perhaps she wanted more from her husband. I don't think it was with the intention to ruin her 'perfect' life. There doesn't have to be a clear reason...as affair's don't necessarily happen for the best reasons.".

Ok granted this is not the most original filmscript ever written but I think that many reviews both Professional and Ametuer alike have missed the point of this film. Behind the obvious guise of a morality tale showing what can happen if you stray from your marital vows there is a rather amazing piece of art to be seen. This film is not about marital infedelity but rather about DRAMA.  This is what we in the Theater refer to as Drama As Art meaning that the plot is less important than the impact that the various plot points have on the characters creating more and more and more drama as the story unfolds. As is the great ballets or stage plays 'Giselle' 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf' 'Swan Lake' 'A Streetcar Name Desire' the DRAMA is the star of the production not the actors or the plot lines.And in this respect 'Unfaithful' excells!  Watch carfully as the world slowly turns itself upside down and rips itself to shreds around these two people based on a SINGLE MOMENT IN TIME the first scene outside of his apartment  Should she go in?  Should she go home?  One choice one mopment in time a world of difference.  Based on her choices the drama begins to build to a point when at the end of the film the DRAMA is the star not Geer and Lane.  And Drama does a fine job holding this otherwise middleoftheroad film above the frey.".

Should she go home?  One choice one mopment in time a world of difference.  Based on her choices the drama begins to build to a point when at the end of the film the DRAMA is the star not Geer and Lane.  And Drama does a fine job holding this otherwise middleoftheroad film above the frey.";

Because this is a stunner that will put both back on the map  big time. For all their star power though it is the female star Diane Lane who must take huge credit for making this such an effective movie.I've always liked Lane as an actress from when she was a kid in Francis Ford Coppola films but she rarely got the chance to 'carry' a film. Well she not only 'carries' UNFAITHFUL she delivers one of the most haunting and powerful performances I have seen from an actress. Think Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH or Ellen Burstyn in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and you get the picture. Stunning acting.While the committed performances are what make a great movie greater it is Adrian Lyne who has constructed such a wonderful and effective rhythm and style to UNFAITHFUL. This is not an artfilm but it is not a blockbuster either. It lays somewhere between the two and delivers on all fronts. I was totally glued to my seat from start to finish.".

It is about a woman who allows a passing fancy to become an obsession and finds the obsession devouring her entire life.Her husband ends up murdering her lover. He at first appears to have escaped consequences but as the movie closes it is apparent the crime will be discovered. At the end of the movie the couple are talking in the car about love and their lives together  then the camera pans back to show they are outside a police station. To me the thought that some have that they may run away may not is out of the question. The synopsis is dead wrong. This last dialog is not hopeful but forlorn and anguished. All that they have had is irretrievably lost due to the wife's foolishness and her husband's anger.Some members of the audience forget that characters in a movie are supposed to behave realistically. The couple in Unfaithful are far too entrenched in their upper middle class lives to have any genuine chance of flight. That last dialog is intended to underscore how much has been lost and what devastating consequences the affair has had. It is NOT a discussion of possible alternative. The moment after the picture ends the husband is going to surrender himself to the police. He really has no other choice.To me this ending was sad profound and absolutely logical the fitting end to a picture in which there had been a great deal of commentary on the risks of infidelity.".

I was glued to my seat from start to finish.  This is sassy sexy thriller that delivers the goods and then some.  But the actors make it work.  The chemistry between each of the characters is electric. Though Richard Gere gets star billing it's the beautiful Diane Lane who has the most screen time.  I'm always delighted to see her beautiful face on screen but this is her most powerful performance uptodate.  Newcomer Olivier Martinez shows great charisma.  He is a very talented actor and if he goes on with his career in American movies he can become the next Antionio Banderas.  I swear there were moments in the film where even I felt charmed by him.  Richard Gere hasn't had a successful movie in years and hopefully he'll get back on the ball with Unfaithful.  He delivers a fine subtle performance and though I may be out on a limb I'll say it's one of his best.  I haven't seen any of Adrian Lyne's past work but I know he's an acclaimed director and now that I've seen this film I'm curious to check out Fatal Attraction and his other past films.  He definitely knows how to set the tone.  The scenes have a cohesive rhythm and I even spotted moments of symbolism.  Unfaithful is an intriguing compelling piecea real edgeofyourseat nailbiter!  My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then I read a review of a film which is so drastically different to my own reaction to it that I wonder if we have watched the same film. This is the case for almost EVERY review of Unfaithful. Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the Australian Movie Show four and a half stars if I remember correctly this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good slightly arty film with good performances particularly from Diane Lane who really impressed me in Coppola's The Cotton Club. What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.The criticisms that I have read of Unfaithful don't confuse me because they disagree with me. I can accept that  no really I can although I don't see how anyone could miss the brilliant acting one user comment said that any Hollywood actress could have done Diane Lane's performance  well I DO look forward to the J.Lo remake in a few years or the amazing photography this being one of the most lush and seductive films I have seen in a long time. It's the way in which the reviewers have seemingly missed the entire point of the film or fell asleep halfway through it.Firstly I will concede that Connie's motivations were unclear although I'd call it subtlety rather than poor scripting but they weren't as unclear as many people would have you believe. Nor did Lyne simplify the relationship between Connie and Paul someone called him Marcel  perhaps they DID watch another movie or just couldn't spell his surname  in fact I would suggest that anyone who thought Connie was willing to sleep with the first guy she met would do well to rewatch this film and see the way that her mind works or do you need a voiceover narration in addition to Lane's phenomenal performance?. In addition to this I have read complaints about nudity because apparently has no place in an erotic dramathriller technical problems the reviewer who mentioned this loved the movie but had issues with constant shots of the entire microphone shots which heshe found very hard to ignore but which I managed to miss completely and the apparently cliched narrative. In response to the latter I don't want to give anything away but this film although addressing a common topic ie. adultery is by no means a traditional Hollywood film and certainly doesn't treat the topic in the same way that every other film has. Many may find the ending unfulfilling but I can't comprehend the idea of it being cloying and unoriginal. And even if the narrative itself is conventional the way in which it is handled by cast director and technical crew if you can forgive the microphone shots I suppose puts it so far above any of its counterparts as to warrant a much warmer reception than it seems to have been given.Diane Lane deserved the Oscar for this without question. Unfortunately her film came in a year when every single Best Actress nominee was of nearly equal quality. As you can see I liked it  and wish that more people felt the same way about it. The only suggestion I can offer is that if you have yet to see it then don't go into it expecting a standard thriller  in fact it can be quite slowmoving at times. But let it be what it is because it does a damn good job at that.".

Also the ending is very interesting I won't say it's bad or it's good but interesting.  You'll see what I mean when you see the film.I will warn you though there are some pretty intensegraphic sex scenes in this film so be careful who you see this film with.  I'm just saying that you may feel uncomfortable watching these scenes with certain people sitting right next to you.All in all I thought it was a very interesting movie and the story was told quite well.

	schema:reviewBody "There is no such thing as an indifferent movie directed by Adrian Lyne. You'll either love it or hate it. I liked Fatal Attraction though I prefer the original ending not the revised wayoverthetop grade B shock ending. I was not impressed with his other hit Flashdance. I've chosen not to see 9 12 Weeks and Indecent Proposal for various reasons. Many viewers have said that Unfaithful is simply a role reversal of Lyne's earlier hit Fatal Attraction. It might be accurate but I don't think it's totally a fair comparison. I felt that the affair between Connie Sumner Diane Lane and Paul Martel Olivier Martinez was just a basic physical attraction. It was a need that for some reason was not met with her husband. At the same time the affair became more of an addiction for Connie. There's no love at all in that relationship. There is love between Connie and Edward Richard Gere but from what is presented on the screen their love is on low tide. They certainly took each other for granted. What impressed me the most about Unfaithful was that director Lyne and screenwriters Alvin Sargent  William Broyles Jr. adapted from Claude Chabrol's La Femme Infidle did not shy away from the consequences of having an affair. There was no easy out for Connie and Edward and no tidy endings. Gere was O.K. That's not to say he was bad. He didn't impress me very much. It was odd but rather interesting to see him play this rather drab nerdy character. Something to consider if the movie was remade in the late 70s or early 80s Gere definitely would've played the other man. I was angry at Connie for having an affair and betraying her family. I also felt some sympathy toward her She was not a bad person. She's basically a good person who made some very bad choices. One sequence that stood out for me and apparently for many others was when Connie is on the commuter train heading back home after her second encounter with Paul. Her facial expressions are so subtle but also tells more about what's going on with her with no dialog. The reactions range from excitement to anger to resignation to fear.In the Special Features section of the DVD check out the interview with veteran film editor Anne V. Coates. She brings an interesting perspective on how she was able to edit the sequence.Diane Lane has received many welldeserved accolades for her performance. It's perhaps her best adult performance in her career which started in 1979 when she was just 14 in the wonderful comedydrama A Little Romance.Unfaithful has a few weaknesses but luckily they are overshadowed by the film's many strengths especially Diane Lane.".

Unfaithful is a superbly directed and superbly acted character study and the tragic consequences of someone's actions. It sounds very familiar but it isn't. It's a first class and very absorbing thriller with a standout performance by award winner Diane Lane. In fact it is Diane Lane's unforgettable performance which lifts Unfaithful from superb to greatness. A new classic of the genre has been delivered and delivered with style and heart.".

The film is an acting tour de force especially on Diane Lane's part. Her portrayal of Constance Sumner a housewife torn between the attraction she feels towards a predatory Frenchman Paul Mortel portrayed by Olivier Martinez and the guilt she feels because of it is stunning. The scene where she returns home on a commuter train after their first sexual encounter and alternates between exhilaration and despair is unforgettable. Paul Mortel is reckless and causes her to take all sorts of risks of being discovered as their affair progresses which makes her struggle to maintain the appearance of a normal life all the more interesting. Richard Gere also gives a good performance as the husband who crashes down to earth after first suspecting and then obtaining confirmation of what is going on.The movie has some weaknesses. For example I am wondering why the police detectives couldn't get a listing of the people who called at the victim's apartment on the days before the murder. They would certainly have been able to establish a connection with the murderer. The movie also does not have an explicit ending which may not please some viewers.However Unfaithful is worth seeing just for the acting and tends to sit on your mind long after you've seen it a bit like Hitchcock's Vertigo. You'll think twice before having an affair now.".

	schema:headline " intriguing but flawed spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Like his earlier smash hit Fatal Attraction' Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful' is a cautionary tale for wouldbe adulterers.  More muted and less of a rabblerouser than the previous film this new work provides generally good solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.In terms of the plot Unfaithful' is really Fatal Attraction' viewed from the other side.  In this case it is the wife not the husband who becomes the philanderer and the betrayed spouse not the oddangled home wrecker who becomes the killer.  Richard Gere and Diane Lane star as Edward and Connie Sumner a seemingly happily married couple who live with their son Charlie in a bucolic suburb of New York City.  One day in the midst of an urban windstorm Connie literally bumps into a handsome French hunk named Paul Martel Olivier Martinez with whom she ends up having an affair. Paul's nationality is probably no arbitrary plot point since the Alvin SargentWilliam Broyles Jr. screenplay is based on Claude Chabrol's famous 1969 film La Femme Infidel.'  As a director Lyne certainly knows how to spin a good yarn and despite the fact that everything that occurs on the screen seems conventional and familiar we are nevertheless drawn into the emotional plight that this attractive woman finds herself going through.  As with all films of this type Unfaithful' features the obligatory scene wherein the adulterous party bumps into her gossipy girlfriends within a stone's throw of the new love interest and has to pretend that everything is hunky dory and peachy keen in her marriage.  We also have the inevitable sequence in which the bold lovers are passionately making out in a restaurant while an acquaintance of the woman unbeknownst to her is busy taking copious mental notes of the proceedings.   I also find it interesting that movies featuring female adulterers as main characters always seem to have an inordinately high number of scenes set on commuter trains.  This convention goes all the way back to the 1940's and David Lean's great film Brief Encounter' and can be seen in 1984's Falling in Love' with Meryl Streep as well.  It's just an observation for what it's worth.Much of the success of Unfaithful' can be attributed to Diane Lane who manages to make her character both believable and touching even in those moments when she is seen as being at her least morally attractive.  Though we may reject what she is doing on an intellectual level we can certainly identify with the immense internal struggle she is going through between intense physical passion on the one hand and a sense of duty to husband and family on the other.  Had the movie been content to play out the story in a more realistic way it might have avoided the disappointment that comes in the second half.  I guess that the filmmakers felt that trying to resolve this dicey situation without resorting to melodrama would make for less of an impact at the box office so we are confronted with the inevitable shift to a crime thriller scenario.  In a way the filmmakers are to be congratulated for at least toning down this aspect of the plot which  as it did in Fatal Attraction'  could easily have spiraled off into overthetop excess.  Yet for some odd reason the result of this subtle approach is paradoxically to give to the movie an unformed and unfinished feel as it dribbles away into a ladyorthetiger copout ending.Although Lane does a beautiful job capturing the subtle emotional nuances of her character the same cannot always be said for Gere who comes across as stiff and stodgy much of the time.  Even worse is Olivier Martinez who barely registers at all in the poorly written part of the dashing young lover.  In all fairness to the actor however one should note that he isn't really given much to work with here.  The real scenestealer turns out to be young Erik Per Sullivan the youngest brother from Malcolm in the Middle' who lights up the screen with his unaffected goodnatured charm.It's been a long time since I've seen Chabrol's La Femme Infidel' but I remember feeling as I was watching that film that despite the fact that the story itself was conventional and almost hackneyed I was in the hands of a master artist who could make me see truths contained in the material that I had never perceived before.  Lyne's film though involving at times never gets close to that level of mastery and insight.  Unfaithful' has its moments but it ends up settling for competency at the expense of artistry.".

	onyx:emotionText "Like his earlier smash hit Fatal Attraction' Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful' is a cautionary tale for wouldbe adulterers.  More muted and less of a rabblerouser than the previous film this new work provides generally good solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.In terms of the plot Unfaithful' is really Fatal Attraction' viewed from the other side.  In this case it is the wife not the husband who becomes the philanderer and the betrayed spouse not the oddangled home wrecker who becomes the killer.  Richard Gere and Diane Lane star as Edward and Connie Sumner a seemingly happily married couple who live with their son Charlie in a bucolic suburb of New York City.  One day in the midst of an urban windstorm Connie literally bumps into a handsome French hunk named Paul Martel Olivier Martinez with whom she ends up having an affair. Paul's nationality is probably no arbitrary plot point since the Alvin SargentWilliam Broyles Jr. screenplay is based on Claude Chabrol's famous 1969 film La Femme Infidel.'  As a director Lyne certainly knows how to spin a good yarn and despite the fact that everything that occurs on the screen seems conventional and familiar we are nevertheless drawn into the emotional plight that this attractive woman finds herself going through.  As with all films of this type Unfaithful' features the obligatory scene wherein the adulterous party bumps into her gossipy girlfriends within a stone's throw of the new love interest and has to pretend that everything is hunky dory and peachy keen in her marriage.  We also have the inevitable sequence in which the bold lovers are passionately making out in a restaurant while an acquaintance of the woman unbeknownst to her is busy taking copious mental notes of the proceedings.   I also find it interesting that movies featuring female adulterers as main characters always seem to have an inordinately high number of scenes set on commuter trains.  This convention goes all the way back to the 1940's and David Lean's great film Brief Encounter' and can be seen in 1984's Falling in Love' with Meryl Streep as well.  It's just an observation for what it's worth.Much of the success of Unfaithful' can be attributed to Diane Lane who manages to make her character both believable and touching even in those moments when she is seen as being at her least morally attractive.  Though we may reject what she is doing on an intellectual level we can certainly identify with the immense internal struggle she is going through between intense physical passion on the one hand and a sense of duty to husband and family on the other.  Had the movie been content to play out the story in a more realistic way it might have avoided the disappointment that comes in the second half.  I guess that the filmmakers felt that trying to resolve this dicey situation without resorting to melodrama would make for less of an impact at the box office so we are confronted with the inevitable shift to a crime thriller scenario.  In a way the filmmakers are to be congratulated for at least toning down this aspect of the plot which  as it did in Fatal Attraction'  could easily have spiraled off into overthetop excess.  Yet for some odd reason the result of this subtle approach is paradoxically to give to the movie an unformed and unfinished feel as it dribbles away into a ladyorthetiger copout ending.Although Lane does a beautiful job capturing the subtle emotional nuances of her character the same cannot always be said for Gere who comes across as stiff and stodgy much of the time.  Even worse is Olivier Martinez who barely registers at all in the poorly written part of the dashing young lover.  In all fairness to the actor however one should note that he isn't really given much to work with here.  The real scenestealer turns out to be young Erik Per Sullivan the youngest brother from Malcolm in the Middle' who lights up the screen with his unaffected goodnatured charm.It's been a long time since I've seen Chabrol's La Femme Infidel' but I remember feeling as I was watching that film that despite the fact that the story itself was conventional and almost hackneyed I was in the hands of a master artist who could make me see truths contained in the material that I had never perceived before.

Especially in some of the final scenes where Edward is sitting with his son by the piano.Flaws?? hmm perhaps why Diane Lanes character seems to be so intrested in the Paul Martelcharcter. I think he was very disgusting the whole film.another flaw that is more serious is that its going too slow from time to time.

	schema:reviewBody "Diane Lane is a knockout and Richard Gere shines in sexy cool and engrossing thriller.Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful is sensational sexanditsconsequences melodrama at it's very best. It's a movie in which an ordinary woman from the New York suburbs played with startling conviction and amazing range by the beautiful Diane Lane begins to sneak away from her beautiful white dream home in the Hudson Valley deceiving the family she loves so much in order to indulge in a cathartic sexual fling with a simply gorgeaous French hunk who's built like an Adonis. Her husband slowly suspects and then learns of the affair and when he discovers how far it's gone his reaction comes as as big a shock to him as it does to us.''Unfaithful'' is a domestic thriller that's been made with so much sultry juice and power that it is bound to have you thinking and talking about it long after the end credits roll. What the film observes very very well is the deep rich comforts of family life aren't always enough to keep even a contented person from straying.Connie Sumner Lane loves her doting slightly fuddyduddy security contractor husband Edward Richard Gere as well as the life they share with their perky 8yearold son.  So why does she let herself be seduced by Paul Olivier Martinez the insinuating Gallic book dealer who rescues her from a SoHo New York windstorm? Is it because he's the sort of philosophe stud who drops penses like ''There's no such thing as a mistake  there's what you do and what you don't do''? The film refuses to offer the usual excuses e.g. coldfish husband and that makes the real reason all the more compelling. Connie slides into a fling because she's a sensual woman whose contentment is tinged with complacency and because the opportunity presents itself in a way that's too sexy to resist.Once she gives in to Paul's charms though she gets addicted to them. The further he pushes her a bit of SM a shag in a bistro bathroom the further she wants to go. Lyne shoots the sex scenes like slivers of delirium that flirt with but never slide into fantasy and Lane in the most urgent performance of her long career is nothing short of incredible  a revelation. The play of lust romance degradation and guilt on her face is the movie's real story. I hope the Academy remeber this performance because it is Oscar worthy without doubt.Diane Lane's work in the film's intriguing and gripping second half however wouldn't be possible without Richard Gere's own understated performance that is one of his very best. As these two circle each other their marriage held together by the very cycle of forbidden acts that's also tearing it apart ''Unfaithful'' like a more languid ''Fatal Attraction'' becomes a thriller myth of the perils of adultery which few filmmakers can heighten like Adrian Lyne.Unfaithful is a first rate sexy cool and engrossing Hollywood thriller that is also refreshingly intelligent. 10 out of 10 for a GREAT movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "June Knight is a London musical star with little talent but a huge press following.  Bit players Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier nearly get cut from her show.  They can't believe the fuss that the press makes about her lost dog because the dog was only lost a few minutes. They devise a publicity stunt where Chevalier will stage Buchanan's murder.  If Buchanan can walk into the courtroom after Chevalier is convicted of murder they know that they will get a lot of newspaper coverage.  The only problem is that nobody seems to care that Buchanan is missing.  And when Chevalier finally convinces the police that he is a murderer Buchanan is mistaken for a Balkan revolutionary and is kidnapped. As Chevalier is waiting on death row Buchanan is lined up for a firing squad in the middle of a revolution!This long unseen British comedy by French director Rene Clair is very funny and has a lot of black humor that we don't associate with 1930s comedies. It was only released by povertyrow distributor Monogram in the United States and then with some footage cut out.  The ingenious screenplay will keep you guessing until the end of the film.  Highly recommended!".

It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque.

But again this too serves no end whatsoever. In the Blair Which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film there's no other explanation than Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!! The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also no effort has been made to make anything any better soundwise or other wise.Than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap eurohouse to the worst grungy hardrock...My advise Don't watch this under ANY circumstances.".

From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script god only knows why the writers thought dialogue such as No don't go out there don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead is of movie quality.This film displays very little character development and to be honest I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities'. All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing when they do converse the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer.The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven.The camerawork is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very shaky camera grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography.I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting poor scripting shoddy camerawork and no story. In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief. Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying arguing aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations. However how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car.".

The inexperienced Bell is driving her mother's van and is worried about the late hour. The quintet decides to stop in an isolated store to ask for directions and Bell accidentally bumps one headlight of a parked SUV. The girls decide to leave the place and drive in the dark and lonely road trying to reach the main road. They decide to make a uturn and they are chased by the driver Veronica Garcia of the SUV along a night of terror. After the idea of The Blair Witch Project many filmmakers have found a way of making lowbudget movies in a kind of American version of the Dogma 95 some of them engaging like the Spanish REC but most of them complete failures. Five across the Eyes is completely amateurish film and debut of the directors writers cast and crew and uses the same style with hand held camera poor lighting and few locations. The hysteric girls are annoying screaming and crying along the 95 minutes running time. Further they have unreasonable silly behavior along the most loneliness road of the world giving the chance of a maniac killer attacks them several times. This film is painful to watch with the excessive sadism and violence and should be shorter and shorter. The only consolation is that I have seen films worse than this one reason for my rating. My vote is two. Title Brazil Atravs dos Olhos Through the Eyes".

Such is the case with Five Across the Eyes  a title I'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out .The story or at least what the ahem writers think passes for one centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fenderbender in a gas station parking lot.In fairness it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. It's in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its barebones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither. What we get instead are redundant scenes of chase torture release chase torture release in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching moaning and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding inbetween chase sequences.The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark which in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism. Here it's merely annoying. The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hardpressed to find anything to sympathize with them. One character stops to get a firstaid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed. Another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like Don't go out there she'll get you if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kill's you you're dead.It was an accolade from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out. Talk about a fake orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section. I'm all for lowbudget Indie horror but this one takes the crapcake.

Another film a short film you can watch for free on youtubethat does offer a lot of emotion in a horrifying but comically painful way is Phantom miscarriage. Five across the eyes don't really give me anything! The story is simple a couple of young girls get lost bumps into a strangers car by accident and escapes. Pretty soon they are chased by a maniac woman who tries to kill them. A typical slasher story.Its nice that the creators of this film have made an attempts to create something unique but wiggly camera angles bad acting and a plot not worked through enough gives me nothing. I saw a bunch of amateur movies made by media students while I was studying drama and these movies ware far better. Every scene should be worked through in a good movie. The purpose for the scene the camera angles for the scene and the actors should have enough time to get into character no matter how bad they are. What the movie really lacks is suspense effects that are worked through and a feeling of realism. They had the intent to create something but failed. Oddly enough they worked hard enough to get the movie released!".

A typical slasher story.Its nice that the creators of this film have made an attempts to create something unique but wiggly camera angles bad acting and a plot not worked through enough gives me nothing. I saw a bunch of amateur movies made by media students while I was studying drama and these movies ware far better. Every scene should be worked through in a good movie. The purpose for the scene the camera angles for the scene and the actors should have enough time to get into character no matter how bad they are. What the movie really lacks is suspense effects that are worked through and a feeling of realism. They had the intent to create something but failed. Oddly enough they worked hard enough to get the movie released!";

Just screaming and more screaming.I gave up after fifteen minutes and fastwound through it to see if anything happened. It doesn't  except for screaming of course. Odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem  there is no camerawork to speak of.

After accidentally rearending a SUV they find themselves pursued by an unhinged female maniac who has suffered a psychotic break deriving from it seems her husband's infidelity and children's bad behavior. Delusional and crazed this psycho targets one of the girls..while treating the others cruelly as they resemble her children as the supposed adulteress and will not stop until they are punished. It's a fight for survival and these teenagers will never quite be the same.Consider me in the minority because I actually liked this backwoods terror tale quite a bit. An object of scorn for it's amateurish roots directors Greg Swinson  Ryan Thiessen shoot the film mostly from the inside of the van displaying intimate closeups of these frightened traumatized girls who are systematically run through the emotional ringer for 80 minutes the female crazy unleashing a barrage of violent often psychosexual attacks on them when she can get her hands on them. The camerawork is rather ugly which actually kind of worked for me it represents a chaotic representation of a situation out of control. The lens blurs at times and often we see only certain violent acts as the camera captures most of the ongoing carnage from inside the van. The directors hesitate..intentionally I thinkto veer too far from the van such as when the girls run into the woods as the psycho chases them with a rifle. One girl Jamie remains as we hear gunshots erupt in the distance followed by the screams of the other four. Jamie siphons gas from the nutcase's SUV which will play an intricate part in the final showdown later on. I'm sure the reactions and decisions of the teens will draw boos from naysayers but I think this just might be an accurate display of what might happen if such innocents were stuck in such a horrifying situation. I think the main strength of the directors is capturing the terror in an outofcontrol situation where these girls have trouble figuring out how to deal with such a problem as the psycho and her persistent desire to harm them. I think they craft a raw and brutal tale which shows these girls slowly growing savage. Most feel the opposite as I so take this review for a grain of salt. While the directors do shy away from always showing what the sicko is doing to her teen victims I think the finale delivers the goods. I honestly found this gripping but other than like four others you may think it's the worst film ever made. To each his own I guess.The weapon which delivers the most brutal violence is a screwdriver such as when the psycho uses it to violate one of the girls and the notorious multiple stabbings at the end. But like I mentioned above the directors shoot the film in a way which has you imagining the sadistic violence rather than bludgeoning the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people seem to really hate this movie at least from the comment here on IMDb. It does have some problemsextra shaky camera work a repetitive story annoying screaming that never stops. Somehow I enjoyed it anyway.Five girls are on the way home from a football game when they become lost on a back road. They stop at a country store to ask for directions and accidentally hit another vehicle as they leave. They argue amongst themselves what to do about it and eventually decide to leave without informing the driver. A few moments later the same truck they hit is behind them on the road. The girls panic and speed up getting further off track as they take highspeed turns without knowing where they are. Finally they hit a dead end. That's when it begins...Spoilers The driver of the white truck is crazy woman who pulls a gun on them makes them get out and terrorizes them. Before she hurts anyone however she leaves. It is clear from her dialog that she is out of her mind shouting at the girls about things that have nothing to do with them. The girls are extremely upset about how they have been treated and it takes them several moments to get themselves together and get back in the van.However as they head back down the road they happen to pass the same woman again and she begins chasing the girls again. At this point they viewer might be expecting something different to happen but it ends up with the woman catching the girls again and this time hurting them physically. The girls are still to frightened to fight back. This happens a couple more times over the course of the next hour with the woman doing increasingly terrible things to the girls. It gets to be a bit much after a whileyou expect the girls to pass out bleed to death or go into shock. Finally the girls have had so much punishment that they are able to fight back and they beat the woman down. They stab her repeatedly with a screwdriver then set her body on fire. At this point I was thinking that they shouldn't destroy the woman's body by burning it because they are going to want the police to be able to identify the woman and they need them to believe they acted in selfdefense.The girls head back towards home still lost. They pass the country store and see that the woman killed everyone in there before leaving. We are left to imagine how their lives will be different from now on.The camera stays in close on all of the actresses which often makes it hard to see what is happening especially when there is a lot of movement. The camera tends to look like it is rolling around on the ground along with the girls so I missed a lot of details that I think were meant to be more clear than they were. For some reason I liked this movie anyways. I can't really defend it. It has lots of weaknessesthe writing the acting the visual style. I think maybe I had lower expectations because I was able to see some screenshots of the movie before watching it so I had lowered expectations about what I was getting. It is definitely not a slick production. You have to be willing to sit through a movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's home camcorder. After seeing it once I will give it a six out of ten. I was entertained along the way and satisfied with the conclusion.".

The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually aCt....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm dumbfounded. Yes that's right. I'm really caught here. No way did I find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency. The idea behind such a trim minimal lowbudget Indie production isn't bad but it's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me. It's amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that oflate fashionably rapid filming style. We have the documentary laced handheld camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out. Lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating. Keeping it still will help. The context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads. At a roadside store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight. Scared they flee and not too long that onelight SUV appears behind them. Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game. As for being disturbing I guess that depends. Some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound FX that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also I found myself snickering too. In passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable. The injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be. Watch how blood runs freely but it's not entirely convincing and can get dull. The constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive. We get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on. Quite unpleasant details followed too. With little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up. Too many cringemoments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in. It was about setpieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough. Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern. The performances Jennifer Barnett Angela Brunda Danielle Lilley Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workmanlike with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its characterfoundation . Veronica Garcia's flippedout bugeyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something yeah something. Her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually nonexistent. I guess being psychotic was good enough. Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack. Terrible techno music to cheesy hardrock and an overwrought closing score. It never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb. Codirectors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle. Maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasn't the case.".

	schema:headline " Excellent horror movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Five Across The Eyes is an excellent horror movie. It's presents itself as nothing more then horror it doesn't try to please you or sugar coat anything for you. The movie begins with a group of high school girls who actually look like high school girls in a minivan traveling to a party. They've taken a short cut gotten lost and stop to ask for directions at a roadside store. While there they begin goofing off in the van and wind up hitting an SUV parked in the lot. Instead of staying to exchange information with the owner of the truck they decide to leave and what ensues is nothing but sheer horror.The movie is not about an angry SUV owner as you might think and not about road rage as others have said who clearly didn't watch the whole movie. I don't want to give the film away so I'll leave it at that and get on to the good points. I've seen a lot of bad low budget movies this isn't one of them. Although obviously low budget overall the acting is solid you really feel through almost every scene that the girls are average teenagers and that they are absolutely terrified. The emotions of the girls and the insanity of the person chasing them are well conveyed from start to finish. The film makers were smart enough to realize that they didn't have the budget for lavish special effects so they use sounds to get to you. They will get to you. The sounds of screaming the sounds of beatings the thoughts generated in your mind when you see a shotgun barrel heading for the rear end of a girl bent over the hood of a van. A screwdriver being rammed in a place no one ever intended a screwdriver to go.The film is incredibly effective and far better then some of the tripe that indie film fans are always pushing as god like. The music both type and timing is good and fits perfectly with the movie. The locations are perfect if you've ever been out of a city and driven down a back road you've been where these girls end up. You've felt the feelings they feel as you drive down a dark road and joke nervously when you know your completely exposed to break down running out of gas getting lost or being run off the road by some nut. You know those people who fly by you on a gravel road because your not moving fast enough with no concern for the hundreds of little rocks spitting back at you. They show no concern for the fact that your an inch away from the ditch what if one of those people ran you into a dead end turned around and blocked the exit? You could very well wind up exactly where these girls do.The big selling point for me with this movie is the fact that the girls actually look like teenagers. Lately I have been so sick of seeing obviously twenty somethings and thirty somethings passed off as teens in peril that I think I'll lose my mind if I see it again. It's a never ending torture to me seeing a 30 year old woman with stretch marks walking down a school hallway with her hair in pig tails wearing a cheerleader's outfit. Or that guy that looks like your father who supposed to be sixteen smoking pot next to a locker...yeesh. None of that with this movie thank god.Dramatics aside if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel 1971 updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in you'll love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was so impressed by this movie. It completely took me by surprise. In the oftenfrustrated quest to find something that can frighten me I have become a horror movie connoisseur collecting hundreds of films from every corner of the globe. It is fair to say that I have seen the great majority of the best horror films available today.After having viewed a massive number of these films I can honestly say that no more than five percent really frighten me. Yet this movie jumped up and scared the hell out of me. I was so frightened that after the characters had their first conflict I could not continue to watch the movie until a friend joined me the next day.This movie may not reach everyone one on the level it did me. One of the reasons I believe it hit me so hard is that I have a close understanding of the personalities and behaviors of girls of this age. The director was able to reach the truth of how many middleclass American teenage girls view their reality. The portrayal of the fragility of our perception of safety is what makes this movie very similar to Last House on the Left 1972 Dead End 2003 Wrong Turn 2003 and others like them. Yet these other movies were less frightening to me because the characters were either more mature or found their fates as the result their bad choices the quest for drugs in Last House on the Left. The girls in Five Across the Eyes were truly still innocents in many respects when they found themselves in the midst this horrorfilled night.Some viewers might think the girls were silly or too unbelievably naive. But I know how impossibly immature kids in late high school can truly be. The director and the young actresses captured the personalities of girls of this age perfectly. My knowledge of how truly innocent these children can be made the trauma in this film jarringly realistic for me. In a matter of minutes I found myself relating to these girls. Quickly I began to sense the thin barrier that existed between their comfortable contented young lives and the darkness of the world beyond a darkness that could be no farther away than one wrong turn. Five Across the Eyes explores the destruction of innocence better than many largebudget features have. It's a great movie for horrorlovers particularly those who feel compassion for the naivet of youth.".

Judith Ralitzer Fanny Ardant is a famous crime writer who has a funny way of finding material for her novels. Actually she has a ghost writer. But she doesn't tell anybody that. We see a French TV show featuring writers with new books and learn Judith has a new one. Is she guilty of a crime? We also see her being questioned at the Paris police headquarters about her possible connection to a pedophile serial killer who lures his victims by doing magic tricks. Then we watch a little man speeding out into the country and doing magic tricks. At a rest stop a young woman named Huguette Audrey Dana has a roaring fight with her fiance and he drives off in her car and leaves her to spend the night watched by the little man. She was on the way with Paul Cyrille Eldin a doctor her fianc to meet her parents at their primitive farm.Louis Dominique Pinon does a card trick and gives Huguette a ride. Is he a killer? It turns out Huguette has a connection with Judith Ralitzer of sorts. She's a hairdresser and did her hair. Well her nails anyway. And then Louis says he's Judith's ghost writer. And he's collecting ideas for her next novel. Huguette the fiance dumped by her man all night at a rest stop is a good premise for one he thinks. He agrees to a great favor he will go to Huguette's family's farm with her and pretend to be the finance. She has a beautiful teenage daughter. . .What's real and what's made up? The fun of it is that the movie surprises us with false trails at every twist and turn. But it reveals its secrets at the end more or less.What makes it all more interesting is that Lelouch is a confirmed improviser in his filmmaking and the meandering path of the movie dominated by this ghost writer or is he a serial killer? who's making up a story for a famous crime novelist is a kind of metaphor for Lelouche's own method of creation. But what keeps this from being gimmicky or uninvolving or fluffy as some of Lelouch's other films especially the recent ones have seemed is that the story is told with some of the same vividness that made Moll's With a Friend Like Harry compelling and creepy.Pinon is a very busy and successful film actor in France but not well known to Americans though he's in The Return of Martin Guerre and the JeunetCaro film Delicatessen. He has enormous flexibility he's half cute and appealing and half creepy. He carries the film. But Audrey Dana is also important and has a similar flexibility. She seems a neurotic rageaholic but she can be warm and beautiful at the drop of a hat. But as Lelouch knew it would be the film is anchored by Fanny Ardant. The famous actress doubling as a famous writer living in her glamorous though dubious world is central to the rich effect of Roman de Gare the name means cheap crime romance the kind of pulp fiction you used to buy in train stations.

Finally the core of this film takes us to the kind of French countryside we never see... French hill country that is like a ramshackle farm in West Virginia where education is poor and the house a modified stable.Instead of being a mess all of these elements pull together so simply in a way that feels everyday and natural because ultimately this film is about the complexity of modern life.For those who like to look deeper we have the significant meaningful themes of wanting to run away from your life and the modern inability to know who anyone really is  the essential modern mistrust. Ardant's character doesn't even know who she is herself and it is shown in persistent yet such subtle ways throughout.For those who don't like to look deeply the good news is that you don't have to. ROMAN DE GARE glides along and keeps you engaged throughout. It keeps you guessing... we know we are seeing one of the books being talked about but we don't even know for sure which book we are watching.The film SWIMMING POOL mined similar territory in the literary world and has a mindbending ending that alters your perception of the whole film.

We go from a yacht in Cannes to a highway rest stop and there is no comment on the social contrasts it just is.

	schema:headline " The Magician and the MothRoman de gare";
	schema:reviewBody "Roman de gare is a very complex film that begins almost too convoluted but ends on a perfect note of closure. A story about a man on a journey for research on his next book becomes a visualization of the same suspense aspects he is manifesting in his head for the novel. We as an audience are hardpressed to decide whether this man is truly a writer a teacher who has left his school and family behind an escaped serial killer magician or yes God himself. Much like the soon to be lead role in his latest masterpiece of fiction he actually becomes each one playing the parts at just the right time until we finally see how everything that occurs has been orchestrated by his actions. It is not that he meant for it all to happen no chance and fate played a part as well. However when all is said and done Pierre Laclos has put his hands to the dough and molded a series of events in the real world to mirror the freedom he has in his mind when composing his thrillers. An unlikely God Laclos takes himself seriously for once and decides to step out of the shadows that have been shrouding him for too long. The ghost is ready to take shape.The first twenty minutes or so of this film can be quite disorienting. Timelines jump and characters appear and disappear making way for a completely different set of people to take center stage. What is shown becomes so oddly juxtaposed that I began to think this was to be a sort of Lynchian piece showing multiple planes of reality maybe even visualizing the novel in conjunction with the author's search for inspiration. The fact that we are introduced to the celebrated writer Judith Ralitzer straight away talking about her new novel God The Other yet are soon whisked to meet Laclos as he travels just after the release of her previous book confusing us as to where we are in time begins to make us question what is real and what is not. Allusions to a killer magician and the disappearance of a woman's husband plant the seeds that our hero Laclos could be some sort of nefarious creature playing a role with the young woman he kindly drives home after her blowup with her fianc. Maybe this is the man that abandoned his family or maybe he is the killer that murdered said man and took his identity or maybe still he is neither and just a pawn in the hands of the filmmaker. My mind was racing trying to work out what might be happening but thankfully as the story progresses these questions are answered every single thread finds a connection to each otherand not in the simple ways you assume they willand the tale hits its stride as it sticks to one present time until finding its way back to the beginning of the film which in reality is the end of the story.That last convoluted paragraph might have your mind reeling now before you even experience the film itself but rest assured it all does make sense. Roman de gare isn't some trite piece with its only goal being to manipulate and confuse no it does have a place it wants to go to and eventually reaches that destination. Every move is carefully orchestrated and infuses a lot of humor with the dark subject matter being portrayed. When you hear the description that will be used for the back of the book jacket of God The Other just remember it because I could have probably copied those words down here and it would have served perfectly as a review of the film. Because in essence the novel being written as the movie goes on is the movie itself. Like that scene in Spaceballs when they decide to watch the movie they are in and eventually find themselves on a live feed as they fastforwarded too farthat is this film. What is shown to us is what is written in the book even that which happens after its publishing. It is the perfect crime in double.Writerdirector Claude Lelouch has crafted a very special thing here always keeping the viewers on their toes surprising even when it is obvious what will happen next. I will admit to never having heard of this former Oscar winning screenwriter but suffice it to say he has been added to my consciousness to try a seek his previous and future work. The story is what really succeeds but it couldn't have done it without a really well versed cast. Fanny Ardent is great as Ralitzer conniving and persuasive you can never tell what she is capable of and in some instances aren't given the opportunity to find out as other characters are one step ahead of her Audrey Dana is gorgeous and affecting as Huguette the heroine of the film and novel alike and Dominique Pinon is wonderful as always playing Laclos stealing the show with his affable charm and kind heartno one plays the ordinary man alive with life better. A common face amongst the work of auteur Jenuet Pinon shows that he can carry a movie and hopefully will continue to do so in the years to come.".

	schema:headline " A tale of intrigue and deceit that has a vibrant energy";
	schema:reviewBody "A serial killer is on the loose in the vicinity of Paris described on radio broadcasts as a magician who lures young women with magic tricks. Meanwhile a young woman Huguette Audrey Dana is dumped at a gas station by her fianc on the way to her parent's farm in the French Alps. Stalked by an intriguing older man Dominique Pinon who is also a magician she accepts a ride with him to the South of France. Who is this strangelooking unshaven man whose eyes are unreadable? Is he the serial killer? a lonely man looking for a pickup? the teacher whose distraught wife has notified the police about his disappearance? or perhaps a writer in search of a character and a plot? And why is Judith Ralitzer Fanny Ardant a phenomenally successful novelist being questioned by the French police about the disappearance of her secretary. These questions and many more tantalize us in Claude Lelouch's playfully intense thriller Roman de Gare a film with more twists and turns than California Highway 1 at Big Sur. Our first impressions of Huguette Dana are not positive though Audrey Dana is quite impressive in her first starring role. After a very slow fade out we find ourselves speeding along a French highway. Traveling with her excitable fianc Paul Cyrille Eldin to visit her parents and teenage daughter the young woman who is either a hairdresser or a hooker or both makes life miserable for her lover.Smoking nonstop selfpitying whiny and in her own descriptive phrase acting like an airhead Huguette drives Paul to the snapping point. Though he tries to remain calm he finally abandons her at a gas station and unceremoniously drives off. Huguette is now subject to the whims of Pierre Laclos Pinon the mysterious stranger who asks her repeatedly if she wants a ride even though she tells him to please leave her alone. After many hours the young woman relents and asks him to drive her to her parent's farm in the French Alps and to save face to pretend to be the fianc who dumped her. The scenes in which Pierre attempts to convince her mother Myriam Boyer that he is a doctor and they are in fact lovers expecting to be married there is a trumped up sex scene with a lot of heavy breathing are very funny especially since the mother is a suspicious sort who questions everything including why she does not know her supposed fianc's cellphone number.Roman de Gare translates as airport novel a book you might read on a trip and then toss when you arrive at your destination but the film is more than just lighthearted fluff. It is a smart and very enjoyable suspense caper that is about pretenses and appearances and who we really are behind our masks. Lelouche states in an interview that we put too much emphasis on looks in relating to one another. In the film no one is who they seem to be. Pierre tells Huguette that he is Judith Ralitzer's ghostwriter then denies it though he claims to be driving her car. Although as in most films of this ilk when all the pieces of the puzzle are in place the end result is not half as intriguing as the process of trying to fit it together.

	onyx:emotionText "A serial killer is on the loose in the vicinity of Paris described on radio broadcasts as a magician who lures young women with magic tricks. Meanwhile a young woman Huguette Audrey Dana is dumped at a gas station by her fianc on the way to her parent's farm in the French Alps. Stalked by an intriguing older man Dominique Pinon who is also a magician she accepts a ride with him to the South of France. Who is this strangelooking unshaven man whose eyes are unreadable? Is he the serial killer? a lonely man looking for a pickup? the teacher whose distraught wife has notified the police about his disappearance? or perhaps a writer in search of a character and a plot? And why is Judith Ralitzer Fanny Ardant a phenomenally successful novelist being questioned by the French police about the disappearance of her secretary. These questions and many more tantalize us in Claude Lelouch's playfully intense thriller Roman de Gare a film with more twists and turns than California Highway 1 at Big Sur. Our first impressions of Huguette Dana are not positive though Audrey Dana is quite impressive in her first starring role. After a very slow fade out we find ourselves speeding along a French highway. Traveling with her excitable fianc Paul Cyrille Eldin to visit her parents and teenage daughter the young woman who is either a hairdresser or a hooker or both makes life miserable for her lover.Smoking nonstop selfpitying whiny and in her own descriptive phrase acting like an airhead Huguette drives Paul to the snapping point. Though he tries to remain calm he finally abandons her at a gas station and unceremoniously drives off. Huguette is now subject to the whims of Pierre Laclos Pinon the mysterious stranger who asks her repeatedly if she wants a ride even though she tells him to please leave her alone. After many hours the young woman relents and asks him to drive her to her parent's farm in the French Alps and to save face to pretend to be the fianc who dumped her. The scenes in which Pierre attempts to convince her mother Myriam Boyer that he is a doctor and they are in fact lovers expecting to be married there is a trumped up sex scene with a lot of heavy breathing are very funny especially since the mother is a suspicious sort who questions everything including why she does not know her supposed fianc's cellphone number.Roman de Gare translates as airport novel a book you might read on a trip and then toss when you arrive at your destination but the film is more than just lighthearted fluff. It is a smart and very enjoyable suspense caper that is about pretenses and appearances and who we really are behind our masks. Lelouche states in an interview that we put too much emphasis on looks in relating to one another. In the film no one is who they seem to be. Pierre tells Huguette that he is Judith Ralitzer's ghostwriter then denies it though he claims to be driving her car. Although as in most films of this ilk when all the pieces of the puzzle are in place the end result is not half as intriguing as the process of trying to fit it together. Yet Lelouch Oscar winner for A Man and a Woman has fashioned a tale of intrigue and deceit that has a vibrant energy that bubbles along with the style of a plotdriven Hitchcockian film of the sixties. I was half expecting Cary Grant or Grace Kelly to show up.";

I guess I was partly on the right track but reading other's comment I do agree with typical Novel one would buy at the station to fill time on the train journey. I'm not familiar with airport novel but imagine it must be very similar All thisthough did not prepare me much for what was to come. I did enjoy the trip but I had some reservation about the twists and turns it took. I do mind improvisations that mislead almost solely for the sake of misleading. Personally I would have preferred to see these improvisations done in a much smarter way instead of being there just because we are told these 'situations' are there with 'would be' links but we have to guess what is what.I probably would have enjoy the story just as much or even better if it had been simpler but kept the main element in one direction. Instead I found we were told a fairly straight forward story with a lot of adds on that really did not do much beside confusing the audience but to lead to a rather conventional ending. It is possible I'll have a different reaction on a second viewing however today I had a good time but I found there was something not quite right for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is this? A thriller? A murder mystery? A romance? A way to pass the next two hours or so? It's all of these as the title tells us. Roman de Gare is also an intricate fascinating and very amusing story with so many cleverly overlapping threads you'll need to pay attention. There's Judith Ralitzer Fanny Ardant a bestselling author of popular novels. Wait...there's also her ghostwriter Pierre Laclos Dominique Pinon who seems to have gone missing perhaps permanently. There's Huguette Audrey Dana bruised around the edges and abandoned at a service station stop by her fiance who drives off with her car her purse her money and her identification. There's a schoolteacher who leaves his wife and kids. His wife turns out to be Pierre Laclos' sister. She finds solace by sharing Laclos' bed in his abandoned apartment below hers with the police officer that started out looking into her husband's disappearance and now is investigating the possible murder of Laclos by Judith Ralitzer. Got all that? I almost forgot. There's also an escaped pedophilerapistmurderer on the loose. We don't know what he looks like but he loves to do the same kind of magic tricks for young girls that the man who may be Laclos likes to perform. When the possibly Laclos character meets Huguette offers a ride and agrees to play her fianc and meet Huguette's family we're now in the kind of farm that makes Cold Comfort Farm look tidy. We listen to a jaunty happy tune sung by is it Laclos or not? and Huguette as they go to fish for trout while in the background we can hear the terrified squeals of a hog being butchered by her family. Roman de Gare is a delight. And all the while the man who may or not be Pierre Laclos is dictating notes in his pocket recorder. There's going to be a book in this somewhere. Will it be a new bestseller for Judith Ralitzer? Perhaps a book by a new author named Pierre Laclos. Might depend on who survives. Fanny Ardant is intriguing complex and has no trouble at all commanding the camera but it is Dominique Pinon who carries us along. He's short with a large head and squashed features. No one would call him handsome much less a leading man and yet that is what he turns out to be. One of his earliest movies was Diva in 1981. He had a supporting role as a short ugly vicious hood. His looks have mellowed a little at 52. His talent however has taken over. It's a pleasure to see how he takes this role and turns it into a whole catalogue of subtle emotions and possibilities. He keeps us thinking that his character could be a real problem yet we wind up liking him the more we see him. He might even get the girl but which one and dead or alive? It's a wonderful performance. Keep in mind what roman de gare means...the kind of trashy glossy thriller we pick up at the airport to help pass the time. Director Claude Lelouch gives us a clever take on the form with his tongue a bit in his cheek. It works superbly in my view most of the time. Roman de Gare is a great way to spend a couple of hours.".

Technically it's fine and the players are agreeable although the leading man doesn't look like a leading man and may not even fit the conventional definition. This I would consider a very positive point in another movie.But for this one I had a problem. The writerdirector has complete control over the reality of the film and so can do anything he wants with it but I found the manipulation to be irritating. I can't go into details because I want to keep spoilerfree but there is suspense which is suspenseful only because the creator decided to mislead and some of the action involved didn't really make much sense. Now when Hitchcock misleads us in Vertigo for instance he gives us a resolution which makes everything we've seen up to then suddenly come together and make sense. Here when we discover we've been misled we've just been misled and what we've seen and heard to mislead us played no other role than to mislead.That applies more or less to the first part of the film. The second part is a more conventional murder mystery which I found extremely predictable in its suprise resolution.".

It is precisely this artistic predicament French author Claude Lelouch has attempted to depict in his latest film Roman De GareCrossed Tracks.It is a pity that such a film with some cogent inventive elements falls flat primarily due to its technical as well as artistic shortcomings.

Is it a mere coincidence that Claude Lelouch has decided to name his film's protagonist as Pierre Laclos ?

It is rather unfortunate that Roman De Gare could not turn out to be a piece of cake for Mr. Claude Lelouch as he is no Alfred Hitchcock of France. A word about casting which is a downright disaster. It is great that Dominique Pinon has bagged the biggest role of his career but it is wasted as Roman De Gare is full of banal dialogs. Fanny Ardant acts so badly that one can easily hazard a guess that her mentor Monsieur Truffaut must be shamelessly groveling in his grave.

JeanPierre Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon takes an unusual turn as the film's male lead. The suspense revolves around the identity of the obliging man meaning to give a ride to the deserted young woman at the roadside rest stop. There are no less than three likelihoods. One of them is extremely dangerous seeing as he could be a rapistmurderer. What can we accept as true and when can we? No one can even find common ground with the English translation of the title. I have heard that it is French slang for trashy novel one reads in a train or train station. I have been told by a fluent Frenchspeaker that it means war story. I have read that it means airport novel.Pinon is an absorbing actor. Through having the face of an aborted phoetus who has somehow survived and gone on to lead a normal life a gaunt beard and a modest indicative comportment he matches she who spends the most time on screen with him Audrey Dana. Dana is an unknown actress sexy beyond belief just humming with ardor and talent. The third central role goes to Fanny Ardant who has a mystique that allows the film to let us wonder just what to think of her until the very end.When a movie like Roman De Gare succeeds it's inspired deceiving and crafty. When it doesn't it's just blowing smoke. This film is entirely driven by a carefully weaved plot and it is intended solely to keep us wondering and then surprise us but despite its later slips into silliness I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot and I concede the loose ends are tied up sort of. One person who sees this movie could feel that just one of the characters played by Pinon would have been enough for this movie but not in both of them interchangeably. But there is a lot of creativity and exacting work that goes into a thriller that doesn't quite give us a place to stand. Because of its carefully manipulated ambiguity we care about Huguette because we believe that one of two things is for sure Her favorite novelist is a fraud or her daughter may be in grave danger.Roman De Gare may not be tight as a drum as far as thrillers go but I had a great time as someone who went with a friend on impulse into a sixscreen moviehouse to see it without any knowledge of its plot or cast experiencing a story completely removed from any formula or convention. It is very engaging and diverting till the final credits during which the camera is still rolling in a peaceful sense.".

Meanwhile Audrey Dana en route to her parents' remote and primitive farm is driving her boyfriend to distraction so much so that he dumps her in the gas station where Pinon is hanging around for no discernible reason and soon performs a card trick for her. But this is only the beginning hardly has the viewer decided that Laclos Pinon IS the magiciankiller than a husband reports her teacher husband missing and Pinon who has mentioned to Dana that he was once a teacher is being tapped for a new role when Dana tells him she is both a hairdressermanicurist and fan of novelist Fanny Ardant whose nails she recently buffed Pinon claims to be Ardant's ghostwriter. And so it goes layer upon layer so much so that Lelouch might as well have written it on onionskin parchment. What it is is not a thriller not a romance not a suspense not a drama but a Total Delight. See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early Joan Crawford War Drama silent with the FrenchIndian war as a backdrop. Joan is the love interest for Tim McCoy but definitely takes a back seat to the drama that unfolds between the French Indian and English populations who are at war with each other and will fight to the death. Tim McCoy is a stalwart actor more accustomed to westerns and with the same kind of approach as he was in the battle scenes. Somewhat historically accurate but took certain situations and make them rife for drama. Joan pleading to be saved and not having her lover killed and wanting to sacrifice herself. The copy I saw online was pretty choppy but nonetheless an interesting curio complete with powdered wigs in many scenes since this was pre revolutionary war. The Native American characters were actually portrayed somewhat sympathetically and by actual native Americans. Jean Arthur has a bit part but I could not recognize her in the print I reviewed. This is a good antique for those interested in seeing the FrenchIndian war depicted. For Joan Crawford fans it was hard to recognize at first for her mannerisms are quite demure in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen Curse of Frankenstein then you must follow up with this excellent sequel. The magic which is in the Hammer Films allows that aura to continue in this followup story. In this second chapter of the infamous doctor who nearly wills his creature to live we see that he has somehow escaped death by guillotine. Once again we have the superb talents of Peter Cushing who played Dr. Victor Frankenstein in the original and successful 1957 version. In that prequel the good doctor was sentenced to death and last seen approaching the guillotine. In this followup film we see he has somehow survived execution and has chosen a new name Dr. Victor Stein. Arriving in a new city he sets up practice but is shunned by the city's medical authorities who send a representative to demand he join their union. Francis Matthews plays the envoy Dr. Hans Kleve a fine doctor and a member in good standing with the union. In time however he suspects the mysterious visitor is not only an superior doctor but perhaps the greatest medical genius ever and wants to join him as his assistant. What follows is the the perhaps the best adaption of the Shelley story as we learn that Hans proves Dr. Stein correct. Dr. Kleve proves to be an excellent pupil and Dr. Stein proves equally prophetic. They will never be rid of Dr. Frankenstein! A great film and earns its place as a classic".

Before long however the doc is up to his old tricks collecting body parts and transplanting a brain into a new stitchedtogether creature. This time his experiment seems to be a rousing success. However things soon go awry.Like the 1935 Universal classic Bride of Frankenstein this is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original. Although Revenge is not quite in the same league as Bride The Creature played by Michael Gwynne is a much more complicated and therefore more interesting character than Christopher Lee's Frankenstein Monster who was basically just a homicidal maniac. Karl The Creature is not evil merely misunderstood and terribly unlucky.Peter Cushing's Baron Frankenstein is also a much more sympathetic character than he was in Curse of Frankenstein. There he did not hesitate to engage in coldblooded murder to further his goals. Here we have a kinder and gentler Baron resolute to be sure but not murderously ruthless. This remarkable character transformation is never explained nor even alluded to. But it makes the Baron a character we can root for something that we could never do in the original movie. In that regard the title is somewhat misleading since revenge is not a major theme and the Baron is not out to get those who may have wronged him.The same steady hands who guided Hammer's first Frankenstein film to boxoffice success  Terence Fisher as director and Jimmy Sangster as screenwriter  are also at the helm in this one. Cushing's presence adds a certain gravitas to the proceedings and the other actors particularly Gwynne also turn in firstrate performances. Although there are few scares the movie is well written and maintains the viewer's interest throughout.It should be noted that like most of Hammer's Frankenstein sequels this one chronicles the further adventures of Victor Frankenstein and not the Frankenstein Monster. In that respect they are quite unlike the Universal sequels where the Monster eventually ran out of things to do and ended up being a virtual parody of himself. The original Monster would in fact return in the next Hammer sequel The Evil of Frankenstein and again a few years later in Horror of Frankenstein which was a remake of Curse this time with Ralph Bates as the Baron rather than a sequel. Both of these films while enjoyable in their own way particularly for Hammerphiles are inferior to this one and in my opinion not as good as the other sequels most notably Frankenstein Created Woman that do not feature the original Frankenstein Monster.Highly recommended.".

When Margaret finds Karl in the attic he convinces her to release the straps that hold him to the bed.

When Dr. Stein and Dr. Kleve arrive in the laboratory Karl has already gone leaving two deaths on his path.

Even though this movie is called The Revenge of Frankenstein and the baron himself who escaped the guillotine also tells that he is planning on taking revenge he never does so in this movie. Sloppy perhaps and also a missed opportunity. Nevertheless The Revenge of Frankenstein remains one of the best put together and most atmospheric Hammer movie. Esecially for late '50's standards this movie is a surprising good and effective one that more than serves its purpose and has plenty enough to offer the viewer.The story is well written and told which is the main reason why this movie works out great. It also helps to make this movie one of the better ones out of the long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. It's an interesting movie to watch with a great perfect horror atmosphere all combined with the typical Hammer studio's style. The movie also features some morbid humor which suits the style of the movie even better and makes it an even more pleasant and entertaining one to watch.Unlike other Frankenstein movies this movie relies on original and self developed and written elements. The Hammer studios throughout this way practically recreated the entire character of baron Frankenstein with its long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. When I now think of baron Frankenstein I automatically think of Peter Cushing portraying him thanks to the Hammer movies.The movie doesn't waste any time on things like character development which is also the reason why the movie is only 89 minutes short. It makes the story flow well without any drags or unnecessary moments but one of the consequences also is that some of the characters don't quite work out because of this such as the Eunice Gayson character who doesn't seem to serve a purpose in the movie. The movie also doesn't have enough emotional depth because of this. Even though the movie does some attempts to give the movie some depth mainly in its sequences with the monster the movie is too short and distant to really care about any of it. But at least they did a worthy attempt which makes this movie an improvement over the first Hammer Frankenstein movie The Curse of Frankenstein.Peter Cushing is really great as the baron who has taken the name Dr. Stein after escaping from the guillotine to conceal his true identity. Cushing really seem at ease with his role and he draws all of the attention of the movie toward him. Unlike most other Frankenstein movies the Hammer Frankenstein movies aren't really about the creature but more about baron Frankenstein and his eternal morbid search for cheating the death and creating life. It's a good thing that this movie is about the baron and not really about the monster for the actor who plays the monster in this movie Michael Gwynn is exactly convincing or a good enough actor. Further more the movie does feature some good British actors for the smaller parts of the movie who all seem to fit their parts very well. Through its atmosphere the movie does manages to create an overall overly present creepy atmosphere which does provide the movie with some good horror moments as well. Of course nothing too scary since obviously all Hammer movies are obviously more entertaining than scary or serious. The movie also does feature some nice looking sets costumes and effects which help to set up the mood.A mustsee for the Hammer fans mainly thanks to its well written and told story.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Largely thanks to the performance of Peter Cushing who became one with this  protagonist for 6 entire movies. Cushing perfectly knows who to make the most out of his character. As a viewer you don't know whether to have sympathy for himor despise him. He's a dedicated and hardworking scientist yet he's doesn't seem to care much about human emotions and he's ultimately cruel. The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster is wellwritten and rather originalthe development of the monster' is completely different than usual and the script contains a lot of twisted and sadistic humor. The Revenge of Frankenstein has two extraordinary good sequences. Namely the entire beginning in which the Baron is brought to the Guillotine condemned for the crimes against humanity he did in the past The Curse of Frankenstein  1956. This entire opening to the movie is very atmospheric morbid and the perfect launch for a decent horror movie. Secondly there is the magnificent climax containing an experimentgonewrong that brutally interrupts a high society party. This particular scene is the start for a very suspenseful finale with a few shocking parts and a terrific end scene. Certainly a must for all Cushing Fisher and Hammerfans and a nice waste of time for everyone with a little sympathy towards the genre of horror. Recommended!".

The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster is wellwritten and rather originalthe development of the monster' is completely different than usual and the script contains a lot of twisted and sadistic humor. The Revenge of Frankenstein has two extraordinary good sequences. Namely the entire beginning in which the Baron is brought to the Guillotine condemned for the crimes against humanity he did in the past The Curse of Frankenstein  1956. This entire opening to the movie is very atmospheric morbid and the perfect launch for a decent horror movie. Secondly there is the magnificent climax containing an experimentgonewrong that brutally interrupts a high society party. This particular scene is the start for a very suspenseful finale with a few shocking parts and a terrific end scene. Certainly a must for all Cushing Fisher and Hammerfans and a nice waste of time for everyone with a little sympathy towards the genre of horror. Recommended!";

Most horror film fans know that Baron Frankenstein was a lot more interesting than his creation. Hammer wisely chose to follow the exploits and give more screen time to Baron Frankenstein. Peter Cushing turns in a superb performance as the Baron Francis Matthews is quite capable as his assistant Dr. Hans Kleve and Michael Gwynn is very good as Karl Dr. Frankensteins' creation. This film picks up where The Curse Of Frankenstein ended. Along with Horror Of Dracula The Brides Of Dracula Night Creatures The Mummy And The Curse Of Frankenstein these are my favorite Hammer Horror Films. Sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy.".

It is interesting to note  that principal photography began scant days after the completion of 'Horror of Dracula'  and it does not require a trained eye to see the redressed and painted Dracula sets  throughout the film.  Production Designer  Bernard Robinson  and Director  Terence Fisher both told me the paint on some of the flats had yet to dry when shooting began. Peter Cushing had the opportunity to refine and develop his portrayal as the driven Baron Frankenstein.  His dialogue is caustic  witty and at times humorous.  This again was the Golden Age of  Hammer that magic period that lasted but a short time.  The team of Fisher Robinson  Lighting Cameraman  Jack Asher and a completely dedicated cast and crew shines as brightly as those newly painted sets.  One of the best of the period  and still plays well today.".

	schema:reviewBody "An asceticlooking scientist stands before a curtain concealing something unknown and asks his idealistic young assistant if he knows why Baron Frankenstein was condemned to death. The young doctor replies that everyone knows Frankenstein created a man who became a monster. The older man glares and says  It should have been perfect. I made it to be perfect. If the brain hadn't been damaged my work would have been hailed as the greatest scientific achievement of all time. Frankenstein would have been declared a genius. Instead he was sent to the guillotine. I swore I would have my revenge. They will never be rid of me. Here is something I AM proud of. He rips open the curtain and the young man gasps at the sight of a bandaged half nude figure of a man suspended in a steamfilled glass case. With this dramatic moment Terence Fisher as director Peter Cushing as lead actor and Jimmy Sangster as author achieve a high point in the history of Hammer Films' Frankenstein series. Cushing is completely convincing in his portrayal of Frankenstein as a coldblooded intellectual who will stop at nothing in pursuit of his goals. But Sangster's ingenious script demands a continual audience reevaluation of this complex paradoxical figure. Frankenstein can be seen as a progressive genius far ahead of his time or a man obsessed with his scientific theories to the point that he cares little about anyone else but himself. Frankenstein is an enigma in that he is shown as a more thoughtful quietly determined man than the ruthless fanatic of the first film Curse of Frankenstein. He shows unexpected loyalty to his handicapped assistant and appreciation of his young pupil while being capable of amputating the limbs of his charity hospital patients for supposedly legitimate medical reasons . Sangster's script is filled with dry humor odd and memorable characters brought vividly to life by Hammer's marvelous players and unexpected twists and ironic developments. The cinematography music and set design are all effective as usual. The opening sequence of the execution is a small masterpiece of suspenseful story telling all in itself without a word of dialogue. This is a a great movie that should be seen by all Hammer fans and horror movie fans everywhere.".

Story has Victor Frankenstein Peter Cushing being saved at the guillotine and popping up in Carlsbruch as Dr. Stein. The other doctors in the area are always talking about this mysterious doctor and one young doctor named Hans Kleve Francis Matthews discovers who he really is and wants to help him in his future experiments. They take the brain out of a deformed dwarf named Karl and put it into a body that was built by Dr. Stein and the operation seems to go well. Karl is healing well and responding to everything okay but he doesn't want to be a medical spectacle for everyone to gawk at so he convinces a woman named Margaret Eunice Gayson who works there to loosen his straps and he climbs out the window. One of the side effects of the transplant is cannibalism and he has a hunger for flesh. Also Karls brain is telling him he is deformed so the rest of his body begins to change! This is one of the few films that Cushing made for Hammer studios that didn't have Christopher Lee in the cast as well. The sets look great as they always do and it really captures the look of what this part of Europe must have looked like back then. The best thing about this film is the story. After they transfer the brain from one body to another the brain tells the new body its deformed and it reminded me that this aspect of the Frankenstein story was dwelled on only rarely. There is some horrifying moments during this film but its really a science fiction story with the emphasis on science. Great atmosphere and solid performances add to this overlooked Frankenstein entry. Also veteran character actor Lionel Jeffries plays a grave digger! Well worth a look.".

The original outing almost followed the original story with a few changes but for this sequel the rule book has been completely thrown out which leaves the Hammer team to do what they do best  invent and adapt! Peter Cushing returns in one of the roles that cemented him as a horror superstar  namely Baron Frankenstein. Cushing's performance as the evil doctor is magnificent and he does it so well that you really imagine it being done by anyone else. Cushing has a demeanour that lends itself well to subtly evil characters like Baron Frankenstein and that is capitalised upon brilliantly for this movie. Cushing is most certainly the star of the show but also impressing is Francis Matthews as the impressionable young doctor who becomes Frankenstein's assistant and Michael Gwynn as the monster. He's no Christopher Lee but Hammer couldn't really have hired him back now could they? Terence Fisher shows us why he's Hammer's finest director with this film. The direction is more than solid and Fisher makes the best of many intriguing scenarios including the opening which sees a guillotine ready to punish the Baron for his past sins and a lovely sequence involving Frankenstein's monster crashing a high society dinner. Anything can happen in a Hammer film and quite often does and that's what makes them such great viewing. Hammer films have a great style that is very easily to like and make for fun viewing. However this film isn't without a point as it depicts the horrors of vanity and wanting a new body while also tying in the classic Frankenstein theme of the ills of playing god.This sequel is continually compelling and very entertaining. It features a brilliant performance from Peter Cushing and for those reasons and more it comes with my highest recommendations.".

However just like the case with the original Universal FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN this sequel is actually a bit better than the previous film.So why is THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN a better film than THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN? Well the biggest reason is the plot. The first film was a simple retelling of the older story and really added nothing especially notable to the Karloff tale of 1931. However in this sequel it follows the evil Baron as he creates a new identity though he sure should have chosen a better alias!. In this new identity Frankenstein is seen as a bit of a saint and is beloved be everyone but the established doctors in this new town they are jealous because everybody loves Dr. Stein and they lose customers to him. However while he sure seems like a changed man it's not too surprising that he's up to no good and the creation of yet another monster.Now the creation of the monster is really different this time and why it all goes wrong is interesting because at least at first his creation is a smashing success and I mean that in a good way. But an odd series of events conspire against the project and in the end there is a supercreative and wonderful twist that actually makes further sequels make senseand in fact necessary.A very exciting film due to great writing good acting nice special effects and a real reason to have a sequel in the first place. Watch this one if you love the genre!".

Meanwhile a police inspector John Stuart investigates bizarre killings.Another Jimmy Sangster written Terence Fisher directed movie being distinguished by their great earlier entries into the genre. Nicely and creepily made  but inferior followup to the original The Curse of Frankenstein though superior to the subsequent sequel The Evil of Frankenstein .

	schema:reviewBody "That is saying a lot because I was underwhelmed but did not hate Evil of Frankenstein and Horror of Frankenstein both of which were very well made and acted but both of which also had some lacklustre pacing stories that took too long to set up bad makeup for the monster and the monsters in both were lifelessly and unmenacingly acted. Evil of Frankenstein was guilty also of feeling like preexisting plot linesfrom Hammer recycled and cobbled together and in a way that was muddled and was also contradictory and Horror of Frankenstein being dialogue heavy and action starved and unfortunately the dialogue clumsily utilised some juvenile and misplaced humour.The Revenge of Frankenstein however was a wonderful sequel and quite easily the best of the Hammer Frankenstein sequels. It also comes very close to outshining its predecessor The Curse of Frankenstein which this viewer considers one of Hammer's finest hoursas well as their first and does things different that comes off successfully with focusing more on Frankenstein than the monster and not making the monster misunderstood. Comparing the two together I put them on the same level something that is not achieved with most sequels. Like Curse there is very little wrong with Revenge it's not as chillingly scary as Curse and once againthough nowhere near as fake as that of Evil and Horror the makeup for the monster is not convincing too normallooking.Like all of the Hammer Frankenstein and most of Hammer's filmography Revenge looks absolutely great with typically outstanding Gothic set design some of the richest uses of colour for any Hammer film strikingly shadowy lighting and photography that is both handsome and atmosphere. Revenge also boasts a haunting score that compliments the atmosphere adeptly and is terrifically directed by Terence Fisherwho directed Curse as well the only director of all four films to be fully up to the job Freddie Francis for Evil and Jimmy Sangster for Horror have strengths elsewhereFrancis as cinematographer and Sangster as scriptwriter but being out of their comfort zone. The script is on the same level in quality than that of Curse there are no contradictory elements it's not too talky and the humour is better used and of better quality. The script here is intriguing witty and one of the most nuanced of any Hammer film and the humour is thankfully the very opposite of juvenile instead it is of the darkly macabre and ironic kind and some of Frankenstein's lines were a real treat.Revenge also has a completely engrossing story it feels swiftly paced has a lot of suspense and excitement is filled with surprises and unexpected twists without being convoluted and gets to the point quicker than the sequels after it. While the film is never scary it manages to be creepy. Like Curseand Evil and Horror it does focus more on Frankenstein than the monster but that came off wonders because Frankenstein is a wellwritten and interesting character and the monster has more screentime than the other three and is written in a more sympathetic way than the others as well. Not only is it compelling and atmosphere but it also has heart and an emotional core which Curse had but Evil and Horror didn't. The ending is brilliant and certainly not the anticlimax that was in Horror. And there is some excellent acting with a onceagain remarkable Peter Cushing in the definitive interpretation of Frankenstein. Francis Matthews is loyally impressionable and Michael Gwynn is astonishingly good as a poignant but subtly menacing monster not as imposing of that of Christopher Lee in Curse but he brings more nuances and brings much more feeling and personality than Kiwi Kingston and David Prowse did for Evil and Horror.Overall a wonderful and almost superior sequel to one of Hammer Horror's best films also ranking in the better half of their filmography. 910 Bethany Cox".

Music is by Leonard Salzedo and cinematography by Jack Asher.Baron Victor Frankenstein Cushing sentenced to death escapes execution by the guillotine and moves to the town of Carlsbruck. Under the alias of Dr. Stein Frankenstein sets himself up as a successful physician but still stung by his treatment from his so called peers he has plans to still create medical history...The Curse of Frankenstein didn't need a sequel it stands on its own as a wonderful reinvention of the Frankenstein legend and it was a big hit for Hammer Film Productions. But a sequel did come and how delightful it is to find that it not only pulses with everything that was great about Hammer when they were on form but that it also didn't go for the easy cop out route and follow the same formula of its predecessor.The returning presence of Fisher Sangster Asher and Cushing is very reassuring and there is nothing samey here because Sangster comes up with a story that puts the man Frankenstein as the focus his medical dalliance this time is to put the brain of a deformed man into a perfect body. This gives the Frankenstein legend a unique twist whilst offering up ponderings about vanity and scientific advancements while there's also a deft observation of the class divide with the goodbad doctor perched Jekyll and Hyde like on either side of the social structure. From the natural flow of the beginning that follows on from Curse to a quite brilliant twist at its end it's a screenplay that pulses with care and intelligence and avoids all the pitfalls of many other Frankenstein movies.Filmed backtoback with Dracula 1958 Hammer use many of the same sets but dress them accordingly and they are sights for sore eyes. This really is a tip top production the costuming to Salzedo's luscious musical score and from Asher's piercingly beautiful Technicolor photography some quarters have it incorrectly listed as Eastman Color to the raft of great performances Cushing and Matthews make for a very impressive thespian coupling this showcases Hammer in their pomp. It's not all ideal for sure there's a lack of scares since it's a very human sort of horror picture the revenge hinted at in the title and Dr. Stein's attitude is a bit of a curved ball while the set up for the creation to go bad is a bit weak but small complaints and The Revenge of Frankenstein is one of the better sequels in the world of horror. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Is there anything more entertaining for a lover of Gothic Horror and cultcinema than the macabre and ingenious Frankenstein films from Hammer? I don't think so and this second entry to Hammer's brilliant cycle starring the immortal Peter Cushing is yet another reason why I can watch all of Hammer's gems about the obsessed Baron over and over again. I am a great Hammer fan in general and love both the great Dracula cycle starring Chrstopher Lee as the eponymous villain and the Frankenstein cycle with Peter Cushing. Yet if I had to choose between the two I would give the Frankenstein series my preference. Even though all the Frankenstein films had the same premise about the ingenious Baron who is obsessed with resurrecting the dead and creating new life the sequels never ran short of brilliantly macabre new ideas. The film starts off in 1860 when Baron Victor Frankenstein is lead to the guillotine for the acts committed by a monster of his creation. As we know however Frankenstein is far too brilliant to fall victim to a hangman... I will not carry on with a plot description since I do not wanna spoil anything to those who haven't seen the film but I can assure that this second entry to the brilliant series is an absolute mustsee for my fellow Hammerfans.Baron Victor Frankenstein is insanely obsessed with the creation of a new human being and he has no scruples whatsoever to achieve his goals. Yet he could not possibly be described as a villain as he does what he does in the strong belief of doing what's necessary the good of mankind. I am not sure whether this is the same with all the viewers but I personally can't help but sympathize and identify with Baron Frankenstein in these films except for Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed of 1969 the secondtolast of the Hammer Frankensteins with Cushing in which he is truly evil. Even though their repertoire includes many masterpieces and as versatile as they all are the great Horror icons in film are mostly immortal due to a few certain roles. The brilliant and versatile Boris Karloff will always be most avidly remembered for the role of the monster in James Whale's masterpieces Frankenstein 1931 and the even superior sequel Bride Of Frankenstein 1935. Even though his repertoire includes greater films White Zombie Bela Lugosi owes most of his fame to Tod Browning's Dracula 1931. As Roger Corman's brilliant Edgar Allan Poe Cycle is to Vincent Price and Hammer's Dracula series to Christopher Lee Hammer's Frankenstein cycle is what gives the great Peter Cushing immortality. Cushing starred in many outstanding Horror masterpieces in many ingenious roles films such as The Flesh And The Fiends or Horror Express are just two of many examples yet the role of Frankenstein is the one he will alway be the role he is most famous for. And for good reasons as it is not possibly imaginable that anybody else have played the Baron with such brilliance as Cushing did. As a matter of fact it is not possibly imaginable for anybody else to play the role at all. Actually there is one Frankenstein film from Hammer The Horror Of Frankenstein in which the role was played by Ralph Bates. Bates was not generally a bad actor but compared to Cushing he's an awful joke. Apart from Peter Cushing The Revenge Of Frankenstein also includes a bunch of great supporting performances especially Michael Gwynn is great in his role. Lionel Jeffries and Francis Matthews also deliver solid performances and Eunice Greyson is good in the role of the beautiful and kindhearted but naive or should I say silly young lady. The Frankenstein films are revolutionary in many ways. They were outrageously gory for the time they were made and while the gore may seem tame now they still are delightfully macabre. Directed by Hammer's most brilliant director Terence Fisher The Revenge Of Frankenstein is once again excellently photographed and has the typically eerie Hammeratmosphere. This is not even one of the greatest films in this brilliant series my personal favorite is the brilliant Frankenstein Created Woman of 1967 and yet The Revenge Of Frankenstein is a mustsee for any lover of Gothic greatness. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Revenge Of Frankenstein is the second instalment in Hammer studio's Frankenstein series.  The first film The Curse Of Frankenstein was the company's debut horror feature and a commercial success.  It paved the way for a plethora of horror films and made 'stars' of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Lee is absent from Revenge. but Cushing returns in the titular role along with director Terence Fisher and writer Jimmy Sangster.Having narrowly escaped the guillotine Dr.Baron Frankenstein retreats to a new town to pledge his trade.  Adopting the 'cunning' pseudonym 'Dr. Stein' he opens two medical practices.  One serves the wealthy financing the second which treats the poor and needy.  This humanitarianphilanthropist setup masks the fact that both practices support in terms of money and body parts respectively the good doctor's true interests.  He has a secret laboratory in a disused wine cellar where he continues his infamous experiments.  After three years in the new town his practice is such a success that the local medical council is becoming redundant.  The members hold an emergency meeting to discuss the problem of Dr. Stein.Terence Fisher's Frankenstein series concentrates on the doctor and in turn science as the source of 'evil'.  Frankenstein's blind ambition and lack of moral code is the real source of horror.  This premise is strikingly different from earlier Frankenstein stories.  In the Mary Shelley original both the doctor and the 'monster' are portrayed as victims of science.  In James Whale's celebrated duet the doctor is the misguided hero.  In both cases the doctor is misled by scientific ambition but retains a strong moral code throughout.  The sinister Dr. Pretorius in Bride Of Frankenstein could be seen as a better prototype for Fisher's doctor.In Revenge. rather than retreading the familiar experiment of the previous films a spin has been put on events.  Here Frankenstein's construction of the 'monster' has reached its zenith and is given short shrift.  Instead the problem and focus of the film is that of the brain.  A living brain is required so transplants are in order.  Cue a bloodied brain slopping into a specimen jar.  Loopy proceedings include a priceless handeye coordination experiment every lab should have one and a cannibalistic chimp with the brain of an orangutan.  The brain transplantation theme is taken the logical step further in And Frankenstein Created Woman which involves the transfer of the soul.Although it evokes some viewer sympathy the 'monster' is not as innocent as the creations in earlier films and in a way deserves its fate.  Its appearance is not that impressive either when it goes on the rampage the facial expression and makeup reminded me of Michael Palin.  The fact that the 'monster' starts to regress back to his half paralytic state suggests that the condition stemmed from the brain Frankenstein's diagnosis was wrong.This is the only error Frankenstein makes.  His assistant Dr. Kleve and workers the cleaner is an 'expert' on zoology make them for him.  Thus the experiment ends in disaster.  If Dr Kleve had not helped Frankenstein with the final transplantation he could be considered to have been a 'plant' from the medical council.  The final creation is of course ludicrous.  How could the body be a perfect likeness?  Still it paved the way for further sequels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant but unorthodox scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein superbly played by the always splendid Peter Cushing gets rescued from the guillotine and relocates to the small town of Carlsbruck where he continues his experiments and runs a clinic for the poor under the name Dr. Stein. Assisted by the eager Dr. Hans Kleve the excellent Francis Matthews Frankenstein plans on transplanting the brain of his loyal but crippled dwarf assistant Karl a solid turn by Oscar Quitak into a normal and more healthy body. Director Terence Fisher working from an intelligent and provocative script by Jimmy Sangster relates the absorbing story at a steady pace delivers a flavorsome evocation of the repressive Victorian setting and maintains a properly serious tone that's punctuated by a nice line in wickedly funny macabre humor. Cushing brings his customary dignified presence to the role of Frankenstein. Michael Gwynn likewise excels in his strong portrayal of the scared and sympathetic creature. The fetching Eunice Gayson also does well as sweet and willful nurse Margaret. Lionel Jeffries and Hammer film regular Michael Ripper have amusing minor roles as a pair of lowlife grave robbers. Jack Asher's vibrant color cinematography and Leonardo Salzedo's moody score further enhance the overall sterling quality of this worthy installment in the series. This movie's main triumph is its depiction of Frankenstein as a likable protagonist who's progressive ideals clash with the rigidly conservative beliefs of his disapproving colleagues. Director Fisher delivers a few spoton set pieces with the sequence showing the creature disrupting a fancy recital rating as a definite highlight. The conclusion is deliciously ironic Frankenstein gets so badly beat up by the patients at his clinic that his assistant Kleve has to transplant his brain into another body thus making Frankenstein one of his own creations. Highly recommended to both Hammer fans and general horror feature buffs alike.".

	schema:headline " One Musketeer Too Many";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite a stellar cast The Fifth Musketeer still remains just an average retelling of The Man In The Iron Mask Alexandre Dumas's sequel novel to The Three Musketeers. Ironically in the role of the aging D'Artagnan is Cornel Wilde who I would love to have seen in The Three Musketeers back in the day. Wilde in fact was a fencing champion he was on the US Olympic team before he became an actor. No preliminary tale of the birth of the twins to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. We meet the grownup Louis XIV and Phillipe of Gascony as grown young men. Phillippe's been trained in the military arts by his foster father D'Artagnan and the other Three Musketeers Jose Ferrer as Athos Alan Hale Jr. as Porthos and Lloyd Bridges as Aramis. Louis and Phillippe are played by Beau Bridges.That seems to be the main weakness of the film. I think Beau himself would be the first to agree he hasn't the swashbuckling lan of Louis Hayward but he also isn't as good Leonardo DiCaprio in a later version. As for Queen Maria Theresa whom we meet as the Infanta of Spain Marie Kristel also lacks some passion. If I were either of these twins I'd have taken up with royal mistress Ursula Andress in a Parisian minute. Now she's full of passion.Rex Harrison and Ian McShane are an interesting pair of dueling ministers Colbert and Fouquet both of whom did vie for Louis XIV's favor but well into his reign. McShane is not as sly as Joseph Schildkraut in the 1939 The Man With The Iron Mask. Harrison seems preoccupied like he was waiting for his salary check to clear. For the very few minutes Olivia DeHavilland is on screen as Queen Mother Anne of Austria she's completely wasted.The cinematography is grand it always is when Jack Cardiff does it. The film was shot in Vienna which apparently looks more 17th century than Paris does now. But Ken Annakin who usually does films that roar with action and adventure seems not to be able to get this one to rise to the occasion.".

BEAU BRIDGES in a dual role as a commoner and Louis XIV does a competent but bland job in the film's major role while assorted guest stars fill the supporting cast with some name value. One of the guest stars is OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND who might just as well have phoned in her role. She has about three minutes of screen time at the most.None of the main roles are really fleshed out and the plot is a muddled mess. JOSE FERRER CORNEL WILDE ALAN HALE JR. and LLOYD BRIDGES are competent enough as the four musketeers while REX HARRISON and HELMUT DANTINE merely add some name recognition to the cast as does de Havilland in her tiny role as Queen Anne about whom little is explained.It's a retread of familiar material done much better in the past territory that would be revisited in the future with even more dash and vigor. A sleep inducing film that probably only gets male attention because URSULA ANDRESS and SYLVIA KRISTEL provide some feminine pulchritude in provocative period costumes.The most unforgivable aspect are the fight scenes of the swashbuckling kind but badly choreographed duels unlike the sort of thing done so splendidly in the Flynn epics. The blades flash without much flourish.Summing up Totally uninspired piece of work notable only for some lavish costumes and good location photography in Austria.".

In fact when you think about it all the various filmed depictions of musketeers are just made for that very reason...just to have a little fun.The film has a good cast. I've always liked Beau Bridges and thought him to be a more enjoyable actor than his brother however his performance here as Louis XIV  Philippe of Gascony in certain scenes seems just a tad hyper. Rex Harrison as political plotter Colbert is very good and I can actually hear him here I once saw him in a play at the Kennedy Center and though we sat 5th row middle we couldn't hear his mumbling as was pointed out by the review the next morning in the Washington Post. Sylvia Kristel most famous for her roles as Emmanuelle is quite attractive but it difficult to say if she was a good actress as Princess Maria Theresa since all her dialog was dubbed by another actress! Ursula Andress was around...as the king's high class whore...and her acting was as good as always...which isn't saying much. The 4 Musketeers are played by Cornel Wilde Alan Hale Jr. Jose Ferrer Lloyd Bridges and they all did very nicely and it was good seeing them in these roles. Ian McShane played the bad guy...and did well at it he seems to have a talent for such roles. Olivia deHavilland is here briefly as the King's Mother a small role and her final before retiring.With some variations this is The Man In The Iron Mask. It's a good story and great fun. It was filmed in Austria and is beautifully done. Trivia  the Musketeers made a cameo appearance on Perry Como's Christmas special that year which was also being filmed in Austria.Is this the finest version of this general story? Probably not. But I enjoyed it. You probably will too.".

In contrast the namebrand musketeers did not catch my attention so much.Finally what detracted me most was the mismatch of the French dub and subtitles DVD labeled Bakker 7812773.

	schema:reviewBody "Since the copy I acquired of this film bears the year of copyright as 1977 I can only assume it was delayed by 2 years because it was preceded by the 1977 TV version of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK  given that the title under review is merely another adaptation of this classic Alexandre Dumas tale! Made on a grand scale with a large and international starstudded cast the film apparently intended to ape the jokey style of Richard Lester's recent twopart 19731974 rendition of Dumas' The Three Musketeers. However director Annakin was too much of an oldstyle filmmaker to make that work and in any case his handling is generally uninspired  merely content to let the script reworking James Whale's superior 1939 version! the actors and Jack Cardiff's gorgeous color photography tell the tale as it were aided of course by Riz Ortolani's suitably rousing score.Amusingly top billing here goes to the ladies heroine Sylvia Kristel fresh off the erotic Emmanuelle series she even gets away with some very mild nudity! and villainess Ursula Andress at the tailend of her stardom really but surprisingly enthusiastic. Incidentally one of the novelties here is that Andress' Mademoiselle La Valliere I was not familiar with the character when I encountered her in J. Sheridan LeFanu's The Room In The Dragon Volant which I subsequently turned into a script! gets much more screentime than her equivalent in the 1939 'original' indeed the two women have a number of confrontations throughout  notably when Andress sets a falcon on Kristal. The male lead however was a gross miscalculation as Beau Bridges' style of acting is too modern to pass muster in a period romp and in this company though he must have relished getting close to two beauties such as he is flanked by here! A measure of the cynical times however is the fact that the assassination attempt on the King for which being aware of it he has deliberately sent his unwitting twin resolves itself not by a persuasively sympathetic speech as in the 1939 version but rather a fullbloodied yet highly improbable action sequence! The Four Musketeers then are played up as much older than in the earlier version they still get involved in plenty of derringdo but only 2 expire at the end Cornel Wilde is D'Artagnan Jose' Ferrer Athos Lloyd Bridges yes Beau's dad! Aramis and Alan Hale Jr. in his own reallife father's old role as Porthos  interestingly 27 years prior to this Wilde and Hale had appeared together in a similar swashbuckler actually playing the sons of their respective characters here AT SWORD'S POINT 1952! Likewise an overage Rex Harrison 'replaces' Walter Kingsford as the Musketeers' court insider  though the muddled script fails to properly explain the reason behind the beating he receives towards the end! Ian McShane on the other hand is perhaps too young for the villainous Fouquet and again he emanates from a school of acting which jars with the rest of his colleagues though he is certainly fun to watch. Olivia De Havilland in her final theatrical appearance then is something of an embarrassment  popping up in a couple of scenes confronting one Bridges and acknowledging another as the former QueenturnedNun and Bernard Bresslaw who seems to have strayed in from the Carry On series is a blind innkeeper! The prologue depicting the children's birth and enforced separation has been dropped here  presumably to instill an air of mystery into the proceedings oddly too the allimportant mask is given an impossibly clunky design looking very much like a cookingpot!. Finally I have just realized that the version of the film I acquired and watched was 13 minutes short of the fulllength runningtime!".

The prologue depicting the children's birth and enforced separation has been dropped here  presumably to instill an air of mystery into the proceedings oddly too the allimportant mask is given an impossibly clunky design looking very much like a cookingpot!. Finally I have just realized that the version of the film I acquired and watched was 13 minutes short of the fulllength runningtime!";

	schema:reviewBody "It was real surprising for me to find out how watchable this movie actually was. I mean a movie in which a shark attacks a bunch of people trapped in a supermarket after a tsunami hit doesn't exactly sound like high quality stuff. As a matter of fact. you would normally expect a movie like this to be extremely bad and cheesy but the movie as it turned out was far from cheesy and simply was being pretty good for what it was.I still expected the worst after the first 15 minutes or so which wasn't exactly being a very promising start for the movie. It looked horrible and I feared for the rest of the movie. I expected it to be a very formulaic genre flick in which nothing exciting or original ever happened. And even while the movie isn't being all that original it still feels like a good watch since it manages to entertain and takes itself serious enough.That was perhaps being the key as to why the movie worked out it took itself serious. Normally modern Bmovies are very self aware and actors and directors obviously don't take their work all that serious. They make things deliberately cheesy to add to the fun factor and while this does work out at times at others it makes the movie noting less but bad and annoying. In that regard it also was being refreshing to see how serious everybody involved took this movie. It definitely adds to the overall quality of the movie and its nice to see that this is a movie that took its audience serious and didn't treated them like a bunch of popcorneatingnobrainers who only wanted to see lots of blood and nudity. The movie is not like that at all even though the first 15 minutes would still suggest otherwise. Perhaps it was all deliberate and in the first 15 minutes they were like 'this is what you expect us to do' and what after that follows was 'but this is what we are going to do with the concept'.Thing I also liked about the movie was that it didn't featured one main heroic character in it who saved everybody. instead there is a wide range of different characters in this who all just about share an equal amount of screen time. None of them is pretending to be a hero which also lets all of them all feel somewhat realistic and humanlike.On the downside the special effects in this are pretty horrendous. Sort of funny that after 40years Jaws still has the most convincing looking shark in it. This movie too often relies on CGI effects which aren't exactly of the best quality. But still as far as shark movies go this definitely is being one of the better ones believe it or not.Definitely watchable!610 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The acting was good suspense was good it had some twists that were nice too! and a great character development with humor. I enjoyed character development and relationships and the team work was great too. Yes the CGI shark wasn't the best but there were a lot of good scenes with nonCGI shark and gore scenes too. This wasn't an average flick with no effort it was a good movie. With effort put into it and does not deserve to get trashed by dumb kids with ''oooh the movie was bad! I expected this too be God Father but it disappointed me!!! skip it!!! 310 durr'' no and that also applies to the first user reviewer no offense this is not cheap bad shark money grabber for me. It's good flickYes some facts about the shark may have been unrealistic but so? doesn't make it a bad movie cause it's a movie! and the idea is also nice and rare. You don't see a lot of movie with sharks tsunami and markets. Check it out if you like Shark horror movies. It's not a masterpiece but it's entertaining. Don't listen to ''average'' IMDb Mr.Negatives who won't give the movie 7 unless it's Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction. Check it out.610".

The casting was perfect the dialogues were well written the location was great and the suspense was very well created.

Phoebe Tonkin of the Secret Circle Julian McMahon of TipTuck and Dr. Doom in the Fantasitc Four Xavier Samual from the Twilight Movies not to mention a few other actors I did recognize from the movie Sanctum. First the good news the use of 3D in this movie is spot on everything coming at you from shark attacks to the minor details of other sea life like jelly fish and crabs this movie is everything Shark Night wasn't. No its not boring its well paced with solid actors who take the material seriously. The movie never winks at itself and your become drawn in by the relationships there is no one person who is the big hero and some unexpected deaths add to the drama. Now the bad while I will admit the special FX could have used a bit more work they are miles above those seen in your typical SyFy Saturday Flick. I enjoyed the movie will watch again with friends and recommend it especially for those of us with 3D TV's you'll enjoy it all the more.".

In fact its so bad I registered just to review this movie. Skip  skip skip... hey maybe the tsunami scene is better than the crap up until now... oh no its even worse!

Stop insulting Jaws and acting as if sharks are evil killing machines when they're not and make something which is actually funny. Yet another shark B movie this one is The Mist meets Deep Blue Sea as following a tsunami a supermarket is flooded and 2 horribly rendered great white sharks start snacking on the survivors trapped in the supermarket. That is a faintly awesome premise and it could possibly happen in real life. The bad acting and writing were to be expected but surely it would be fun and funny right? Wrong. This is about as exciting and interesting as your routine trip to the supermarket and despite its potential it doesn't do anything or go anywhere. You can't criticize something which really doesn't care about actual quality too much and the direction is actually decent but here's a tip If you can't afford realistic CGI don't use it at all! So terrible writing. That's alright because it's a B movie. The film's biggest crime is that it's not fun or funny. It's actually played relatively straight and it's totally lazy. None of these characters are interesting or funny and there's no actual tension. Much of the film consists of underwater shots of sharks which could have come straight out of an old Play Station 1 game swimming around in circles. A good example of a dumb shark movie done right is Deep Blue Sea which at least had some tense moments and clever shocks. This has none of that at all and it's just another depressing descent into B movie tedium only this time we're in a supermarket. Some may find this a guilty pleasure kind of movie and that's what I was prepared for but instead the film takes itself too seriously even though it's ludicrous and nonsensical. Also why so many annoying plot holes? If a film features so many stupid things it should at least make them funny. Throw this one to the sharks.310".

But let's boil it down a little more 1. Where andor why does the Tsunami come from? While not unheard of I doubt that a Tsunami of this magnitude it pretty much destroyed half the city and flooded many buildings wouldn't have been predicted.2. How the f did the sharks get into the supermarket and what are the chances of two of them ending up there  let alone two great white sharks? 3. The whole layout of the supermarket and how the survivors were spread out after the tsunami hit was completely unbelievable.4. Where was the shark while they were all still in the water.. SLOWLY moving towards the shelves? 5. How could the shark have had enough space to gain momentum for most of his outofwater attacks? 6. What was the sharks motivation to kill? We see a scene where he refuses a pig and they explain he only wants fresh meat  fair enough but how much meat does he actually need? We saw him kill and eat at least two humans within a short amount of time I doubt a shark can or even needs to eat that much  especially if he can be picky about what he eats 7. Loud noises were explained to attract the sharks in this movie  the opposite is the case. If you make loud noises the sharks will be slightly thrown offconfused  certainly not attracted though.8. The shark cam at least I presume it was supposed to be the point of view of the shark was swimming in water WAY too shallow for the shark to get there. In general the water in the supermarket was insanely shallow for a shark of that size.Now the really ridiculous 9. They had at least 2 or 3 guns  only one of them held on to his gun and he never even thought about using it on the shark? WTF almost everything is wrong about this.10. They just had to shut off the electricity? Are there no fuses in Australia? I have a hard time believing that there was still electricity in this building to begin with. And now if you tell me that even if the fuses kick in there's still electricity in the cable  true but flipping the switch  in effect doing the same thing the fuses would do  wouldn't change that.11. Electricity has such a high voltage that it will visibly produce sparks along the cable? bs.12. The way both sharks were killed was also unbelievable and ridiculous.All the acting was terrible.".

And now if you tell me that even if the fuses kick in there's still electricity in the cable  true but flipping the switch  in effect doing the same thing the fuses would do  wouldn't change that.11. Electricity has such a high voltage that it will visibly produce sparks along the cable? bs.12. The way both sharks were killed was also unbelievable and ridiculous.All the acting was terrible.";

	schema:reviewBody "What do you do when you are trapped underground in a flooded supermarket with sharks in the water? You fire off your underwater shotgun and taser the shark of course!Actually Bait turned out to be quite entertaining and not at all as cheesy and stupid as I had initially anticipated it to be. Given the plot line of the story first impressions don't bode well for Bait. But give it a chance because it was actually quite good.The story is about a group of people getting stranded underground in a supermarket as a tsunami strikes Australia as sea water rushes in and floods the complex the people find that drowning is not the biggest of their problems. They are trapped with two ferocious white sharks.There is a good amount of action and thrills in the movie which turned out to be a great combination. The movie despite being super predictable does keep you thrilled and almost at the edge of your seat.The concept idea is a bit far out there but oddly enough it did work out well enough because the movie was entertaining and interesting from start till end.Obviously they didn't have real sharks there duh but the CGI effects were actually good and the sharks did look realistic enough. And the use of prosthetic shark heads was also working out well enough. The effects in a movie like this is a determining and crucial factor between having the movie working or being utter rubbish. Luckily here the effects were good.There were two things in the movie that were not all that great. The scene with the swarm of crabs in the ventilation duct. What were the odds of them being right there at that exact moment? It was a bit too much in my opinion. And the second scene that really shouldn't have made it to the final cut was the ending scene. Are you kidding me? I will not reveal it here just watch it yourself.I will say that the people cast for the various roles in this movie were actually doing a good job with their given characters. The dialogue was good the acting was good. Well all except for one guy playing some cocky guy with spiteful remarks and jokes about everything he just came off as fake and forced so perhaps another actor would have been better there? Just my opinion.All in all Bait is a good shark movie thrilling lots of action and a good amount of blood.".

I admit some of the gory parts were not too bad but it wasn't enough to save the film. And the acting was below average compared to some Aussie horrors I've seen. You could tell that the accents they were trying to do were orientated towards the U.S market as most Americans wouldn't understand what they were saying if they were speaking with the full Aussie twang unless there were subtitles and that made the film even more laughable for me as a Kiwi who lived in Aussie for years. The idea was there but they failed to deliver here again I'm sure it was aimed towards the U.S market. So I give this movie a 3 out of 10 the extra points for the gore even though there wasn't a lot.".

It's a staple of doomsday movies to have couples who have separated to reconcile to overcome their difficulties.To make things worse there's another giant shark in the basement car park of the supermarket. By the way the car park is dark and dingy and is the perfect place for crimes to take place. Malaysian shoppers would never tolerate this as some have been attacked even in brightly lit underground carparks.Meanwhile the photography and editing are mediocre. The movie starts off so slow that viewers will wish that the Goddamn sharks just get into the picture and get on with their jobs.Later a woman in a tanktop is filmed to look like a sexy model in one shot. This happens when there's a respite between shark attacks.Anyway how did our heroes end up in the supermarket? To start off we go back one year before the tsunami hits Australia's Gold Coast.Josh Xavier Samuel of The Twilight Saga Eclipse a lifeguard is about to marry his fiance Tina Sharni Vinson of Step Up 3D. Our first shot of her is her bikini rear.Tina's brother is also a lifeguard. But on this fateful day a shark has him for breakfast. Josh is too late to arrive to save him and finds time to let out a plaintive wail in the middle of the sea.A year later Josh is single and working at the supermarket. Before the perfect storm hits a teenager Phoebe Tonkin is caught shoplifting at the supermarket and handed over to her policeman father. Tina is back in town and bumps into Josh at the supermarket. Hei where else would they meet in a coastal town?However she's not alone as she has a dourlooking Singaporean boyfriend China's Yuwu Qi with her. This could be his first Englishspeaking role as he speaks haltingly. Why didn't the filmmakers get an actor who could speak English fluently? Now everyone would think that Singaporeans can't speak English.As the cop father puts his daughter in his car in the underground car park he spots a robber Julian McMahon of TV's NipTuck ready for action. He gets a gun from a box in the back of his car and goes after him.I mention the box because it will play a big part in the finale. However do cops carry a box with a gun shotgun and a Taser and leave them unattended in their cars?Anyway the tsunami hits the coastal town and the robbers cop daughter and supermarket workers are trapped in the supermarket. Singaporean Adrian Phang plays the supermarket manager who gets cut down to size.Now there are two parallel actions going one one in the supermarket and one in the underground car park.An amorous couple Kyle Lincoln Lewis and Heather Cariba Heine just finished rocking their BMW when the tsunami strikes. Why a middleclass couple feels excited in an underground car park is beyond explanation.But this couple prove to be the best thing about the movie as their niggling arguments about fake Gucci bags and a cute dog are funny and lighten the situation amid the dreariness of the movie. However I don't think they could have survived so long and remain chatty while being trapped in their submerged car.The Singaporean boyfriend has a mantoman talk with Josh and tells the latter that Tina was always talking about him. This makes me wonder why the Singaporean wants to be with a woman on the rebound and whose heart is with a Twilight actor.The Singaporean then dons a weird contraption made up of supermarket baskets and weighed down by cans to walk underwater to turn off a power switch. A hose funnels air into his mask.However he stops a few feet away from the switch because the hose is short.He removes the hose switches off the power but fails to escape because of the weight of the cans. This begs the question why didn't he also remove the cans before he switched off the power? In this way he could have swam to safety.In the finale Josh gets to use the shotgun found in the box to kill a shark but not before the shark hurtles at him and gets close to the shotgun. He then uses a taser to kill another shark.www.jeffleemovies FB and Twitter".

Bait throws a whole assortment of fun characters into a tightly packed water filled feeding ground. A freak tsunami leaves a group of people trapped in a supermarket with a 12ft Great White Shark. Sounds over the top? Well actually the level of realism in this movie comes as a shock because at first I thought this was a cheap straight to BluRay but yet again the Australian's have proved that with strong set design great casting and acting and nail biting tension scene you can create a realistic shark attack movie that never goes campy or unintentionally funny. Xavier Samuel and Sharni Vinson are outstanding two great hero leads plus the rest of the cast are so exciting. There's an injured cop two criminals a down on his luck assistant an argumentative couple an asshole manager old partners and shop workers all these trapped in one room create rising tension surprising laughs and plenty of development meaning you dig for the survival of this unlucky bunch. The 3D is brilliant depth is apparent in every scene and the pop out effects are insane from the actual shark jumping out at the screen as well as the supermarket shelves sprawling into the distance this is how 3D should be and the opening beach scenes are jaw dropping! This is great fun a must own and cannot be missed.".

The dialouge was worse then the Young and the Restless. The acting was sloppy and when I saw the CGI shark. It makes Bruce the Shark from JAWS look more realistic.The only great actor in this film was the little dog.All I can add is the concept sounded great however the script was clearly in need or work and it makes me wonder why the actors accepted an acting job in this poor movie any way?

That sets him haring off to the local dive looking for The Mutt Cunningham the local loan shark. The Mutt tells Michael he is short  but is doing a job that night and needs a third man...So starts a hectic forty eight hours for Michael as he has runins with his father Broadbent the girl in the flat below her onoff lover two sadistic car clampers the local dog fraternity the snooker hall drug pusher the ASBOdodging car thieves.......I could go on mentioning the doublecrossing and the underlying love story triumvirate.Funny in parts but more chucklesome than guffaws the whole leaves you wanting more meat to chew over  there is not much to bring you in to the story completely. When it concludes  and I had a doubting question over the way it ends up in the hills not to give it away but there WOULD be repercussions after the fact  it leaves you with a sense of it having just petered out.I give this film a seven out of ten  the violence is gritty and realistic  Brendon Gleeson is a marvel!  but is bogged down by unnecessary plot angles and sidelines.

We certainly don't shy away from foreign films and this gangsterfatherson story looked to be right up my alley.Like I mentioned in the title  there is quite a bit of humor here that can be hard to pick up because of its' dry nature and because of the thick accents. It can really make the difference between this being a completely average film and this being a truly enjoyable albeit lesserknown humorous and darkly adventurous tale.The cast is strong and the story moves at a brisk pace. It's in the storyline vein of Tarantino or Ritchie but lacks a bit of the panache of those directors' work.Perrier's Bounty has good performances throughout and there is little doubt that those fans of the afore mentioned directors will find this to be an exciting film. It's rated R for brief nudity drug use and violence.The only standout negative would be the music. The music selections were great but the volume of the music was WAY too loud compared to the dialog and the rest of the movie. Maybe the music director was a bit too proud of hisher selections. I had to turn the TV down every time a song came on and then turn it back up when the dialog resumed. The only other negative would be a slightly rushed and underdeveloped love story that could have really put this overthetop.Recommended. THose who liked pulp fiction and lock stock will find this to be a goodnot great film along the same lines. LIsten carefully as many of the hilarious lines can pass you by. The strongest characteristic of this film is the relationship between Cillian Murphy and the actorwho's name escapes me as I'm writing this who plays Cillian's father. Also having two fantastic actors playing in the two lead Gangster roles helps immensely.71100You'll like it if you liked Layer Cake State of Grace or Harry Brown.".

	schema:reviewBody "Granted this movie had its share of moments but it's still more dependent in the comedy spectrum which is a bit misleading in its billing as an action comedy and the humor might be easier to decipher if you were from the land of the Celtics. Intermission helmsman Ian Fitzgibbon exhibits Perrier's Bounty is an overall letdown as it merely touches the pinnacles of comedy that Intermission displayed in spite of a very pedestrian plot. Cillian Murphy stars as a young bloke who's in a financial predicament as he owes 1000 smackers to a local hoodlum. After several attempts in earning the dough his neighbor unintentionally murders one of the hoodlum's accomplices. This puts Michael his neighbor and his father Jim Broadbentin a deeper hole as they are now on the run. Sure it sounds like a crime caper with a touch of humor but it's overall a misnomer. It's just a standard comedy as Perrier played by Brendan Gleesonhas a few minutes of screen time and his presence is seen during the dying hours of the film. The centerpiece of the film is on the failed relationship between Michael and his father. Some of the humor is quite hilarious but most of them are staler than ageold bread. It starts to fizzle in the middle but recovers in the conclusion when the hoodlums become the center of attention. The acting was very impressive overall though Jim Broadbent's accent was a bit hard to decipher at times. The main scene stealer is Cillian Murphy who really shows his comical talent and Michael was the funniest of the zany bunch.Not a terrible film by far but just lacks the qualitative humor that Intermission possesses. And knowing the ensemble of talented Irish performers this movie should have been 10x better.".

And knowing the ensemble of talented Irish performers this movie should have been 10x better.";

London Boulevard was a little underwhelming with a sprawling narrative that got nowhere and in some ways Perrier's Bounty didn't quite leave a favourable impression.Granted the film boasts great character actors from Murphy as the down and out protagonist Michael McCrea Jim Broadbent as his dad Jim and Jodie Whittaker as the hot next door neighbour Brenda who all get embroiled in Michael's affairs with the titular gangster Darren Perrier Brendan Gleeson whom is probably known to worldwide audiences better for his role as MadEye Moody in the Harry Potter franchise when they inevitably knock off two of the latter's foot soldiers when they come knocking violently to get back money owed and a bounty is declared on Michael and the group which runs its course in an overnight tale of hunter versus prey.The better parts of the film come from the incredibly chemistry that Murphy and Broadbent share as son and father especially when they got introduced in the film not really speaking or on good terms but for the inevitable improvement when Jim's death sentence by way of a medical condition gets made known and the wicked modus operandi of Perrier coming into play. The complimentary romance subplot was credible between Michael and Brenda but you just know it had to give way to more pressing survival issues on hand especially when Perrier demonstrates why he is not to be trifled with. That of course gives way to plenty of scenes with graphic violence which to a modern audience is something already quite numbing if the intention is to shock.Still director Ian Fitzgibbon keeps Mark O'Rowe's story moving at incredible pace set against an eclectic soundtrack but alas it is the pace that doesn't allow for the film to breathe and give a little bit more dimension to the characters especially the villains who come across as pretty one dimensional goons out for blood and constantly cursing through their limited vocabulary. It's touted to be a comedy but unless you have a ear for thick Irish accents then most of the verbal jibes would probably have gone unheard which is a pity since I would have loved it if it was subtitled to assist non native English speakers.Perrier's Bounty lacked a certain Xfactor to its rather bland storyline which had the actors to thank for making it a lot more enjoyable if not for their presence since you're likely to be able to stay ahead of plot developments which spell mediocre and average.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an urban Irish crimecomedy so between the slang and the sort of accents where Michael is pronounced MOYcul I'm sure I missed some of the subtleties of Perrier's Bounty. I think I got the gist of it though and what I understood was pretty good. I'm not sure if the cavalcade of colorful characters who sprint through this tight but sparse little story are reflective of true Irish selfimage or if they're playing to the prejudices of cinema tourists. Either way they're a fun group with which to spend a fast hour and a half.Michael Cillian Murphy is a lowlevel denizen of Ireland's criminal underworld which isn't so much under anything as sort of off to the side and behind the local pub. I always love how British films treat crime as though it was just another vocation. American thieves and killers are always cast as outlaws. With the Brits it's like some people simply grow up to be gangsters the way others grow up to be mechanics or butchers or meter maids. It gives their crime stories a refreshing workaday sensibility.Anyway Michael owes a thousand Euro to his local crime boss Perrier Brendan Gleeson. He doesn't have it and faces the prospect of two broken bones if he can't come up with it in a few hours. Michael's also got to deal with the girl he clearly loves Jodie Whittaker getting strung along by her douchebag boyfriend. Then his estranged Da that's Dad to us Yanks shows up in what appears to be one of Don Johnson's Miami Vice outfits after it's been dipped in ink and proclaims that he's dying. As if that's not enough when Perrier's thugs come to collect one of them winds up dead and that means Michael is facing a lot worse that a couple of fractures. With a 10000 Euro bounty on one side his melancholy but surprisingly violent father on another his unspoken love's heartbreak on a third side and an unresolved conflict with his mother on a fourth Michael is boxed in and needs a hell of a lot of Irish luck to get out alive.About the only complaint I have with this movie is that the character of Perrier though ably brought to life by Brendan Gleeson never lives up to his advance billing. He's repeatedly referred to and built up in the viewer's mind. Then as soon as he shows up on screen the character is sidetracked into this homosexual tolerance digression that's amusing at first but just becomes puzzling as it goes on and on. I can appreciate the dramatic logic of leading the audience's expectations in one direction and then going a different way but the character of Perrier is left stumbling out of the gate and never finds his footing. This story needed a great comic but still threatening villain and Perrier's personality and agenda never congeal enough to make him that. There are too many times when Perrier is put in service to the Almighty Plot Hammer to make him a real enough antagonist for Michael.As for everything else it's a delight. Jim Broadbent is particularly good as an irresolute old dude forced into action by his looming mortality and there's a pleasant depth to the relationship between Michael and his father. You can feel the layers of history between them in their dialog and you can see in their behavior how the two are similar and how they're separate. There are also quite a few funny lines though frequently a bit hard to decipher honestly humorous situations and even some gratuitous nudity. And while this isn't an intricate plot there are more than enough times when it heads in an unexpected direction to keep you glued to what's going on.Perrier's Bounty is a clever and energetic piece of entertainment. If I could have figured out everything that was said I probably would have liked it even more.".

I'm still in two minds about Cillian Murphy who is brilliant in Nolan's films but I'm yet to see the same quality in the lower budget movies. I'm quite a fan of Gleeson who always puts in good performances and Broadbent seems to have got better with age.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael a history teacher in a small East Coast town has written a scholarly book about the American Revolution.  Hollywood has decided to turn it into a movie and cast and crew are descending on Michael's hometown to shoot the location scenes.  The author gets a shock when he sees how is work is being revamped for the big screen.    Alan Alda wrote directed and stars in this goodnatured romantic comedy.  We are in classic Alda terrain here the unspectacular smalldetail world of domestic discord and couples who feel compelled to analyse their love lives.  You buy dishes together ventures Michael and you invite people over.  Then you talk about them in the bathroom while you're brushing your teeth.  This is the microsmic universe that Alda loves to explore.    Michael has three problems all linked which are currently exasperating him.  Firstly his aged mother Lillian Gish is very dotty and in need of care something she steadfastly refuses to accept.  Secondly his lover Gretchen Lise Hilboldt won't cohabit unless he marries her.  Thirdly the Hollywood company which has come out east to make the film has desecrated his work by turning it into a lightweight and historically worthless love story.  I just wrote the book from which the movie has NOT been taken fumes Michael.    Faith Healey Michelle Pfeiffer is a method actress and a very big star.  When in costume she is in character even to the point of talking in 'colonial' English offscreen.  Michael and Faith become romantically entangled until Michael realises his mistake.  There is no person at the core of the actress  just a creature voracious for the period detail that only Michael can supply.  She was playing the part of a lover in order to draw from him what she needed.    Elliott James is selfish and shallow but incredibly charming and enormous fun to be around.  A leading man who cares nothing for films or even other people he lives his life as one long party.  Michael Caine parodies himself and in the process turns in a commendable performance as the eternal matinee idol.    Alda can certainly write.  His dialogue always flows beautifully and his understated characters are utterly believable.  When Michael's 'authentic' 18thcentury dialogue is spoken the venerable cadences are gorgeous.      Essentially the film is about the artifice of moviemaking.  Who really knows what happened a coupla hundred years ago? asks the director Saul Rubinek.  The issue is how far should filmmakers go in disregarding historical truth in order to obtain audience approval?  Films are of necessity separate and distinct from their source material  but in the tradeoff between authenticity and popularity where is the balance to be struck?    A New England community such as this one is fiercely proud of its heritage and indeed very knowledgeable about it.  The guys who stage War of Independence reenactments know in minute detail about the manoeuvres skirmishes equipment and ammunition which constituted real events and which form their living culture.  It is an affront to these people for ignorant West Coasters to play fast and loose with their sacred lore.    In a film about the artifice of film Alda makes intelligent use of cinema tricks and conventions.  Elliott insists on doing his own stunt work  and yet for his triumphant fall into the pond Michael Caine is doubled by a stunt man.  The blizzard scene is shot in glorious New England sunshine. The steadycam revolve shot which marks the romantic climax of the 'film' film is repeated at the romantic climax of 'our' film.    With delicious malice Alda satirises the internal dynamics of cast and crew.  Bob Hoskins is the writer with no brains and no class who helps Michael understand the power struggles within the movie's little community and how best to exploit these envies and vanities in order to get what he wants.    Sword fencing is a subtle metaphorical strain running through the film. When we see Michael and Gretchen fencing in the opening scene the playfight represents the involvement and the conflict inherent in their relationship.  The 'audience' of fencing masks on the wall stands for the public attention to which they will shortly be exposed.  Newlyarrived film crew members unload Scottish broadswords showing from the outset that there will be brash disregard for authenticity.  Elliott and Michael sublimate their clash of wills in a protracted sword duel.    We are told and shown that teenage cinema audiences expect three things in a movie defiance of authority destruction of property and nudity.  Alda's film complies with the formula but also intelligently undermines it.  Gretchen's quiet jealousy is excellent as is Michael's stiff back expressing vehement disapproval without moving a muscle.  A film can stimulate eye ear and intellect it doesn't have to follow shallow formulae.      If the action climax is a little too smug and convenient Alda can be forgiven.  He is making smart literate films for grownups.  Long may he continue.".

This film originally came out around the same time as Top Guncase in point.  Saul Rubinek plays the obnoxious Hollywood director what?  An obnoxious director? who turns Alda's historical and serious book about the American Revolution into a romantic comedy complete with big stars who take their clothes off. What makes this movie different from Alda's other films is that there are no serious undertones.  Everyone is having a great time and it shows. Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her first starring roles has rarely been funnier.  Michael Caine struts his best comic stuff.  And Bob Hoskinshow can you go wrong?  The film has an obvious mid '80s feel the music is terrible and Alda's direction seems more suited for television but this is still an enjoyable movie less successful and acidic in its approach to Hollywood and its stars and blockbusters compared to Sunset Blvd. The StuntMan and of course The Player but still worth watching.".

Cinema is just a lie to make a thrilling time whether history is damaged or not to create the artistic lying version of it! Movie stars are sick people after that creative lying sneaked into them from their work to their daily behaviors to become whether unfaithful to their wives Michael Caine or at least schizophrenic Michelle Pefiffer. The director is a cat'spaw in the hands of giant studio that wants nothing but money and down with the credibility. So the writer becomes the last man standing or the last honorable worrier for the truth which turns him into the enemy. Consequently he finds that the only heroic solution is to deal randomly and impudently like all the others to achieve just one thing he believes in by the way he exactly wants. To grow eventually  despite all of his pure idealistic principles  into one of the liars and a shield in the machine of cinema not history ! as the last shot reveals to us sarcastically where Alan Alda listens to the TV reporter and her question about the secret of his movie's success to find no answer but smiling with vanity or as a ridicule of everything !This movie is hilarious however so believable. The performance was flawless. In fact the whole cast was great to an extent where you feel how this is not acting at all ! The comedy is ironic and thoughtful in the same time because of that top notch script by Alan Alda which was genius with some talented details  The short storyline of the old mother and her needing of lying to be happy the big climax to achieve one victory by the historical truth side and to embody the real conflict of the movie through a wonderful droll battle not to mention small moments but so rich like the scene of Michael Caine and his story about meeting Winston Churchill it could say a lot about the effect of WW2 on a character as disordered as his however leaving the story as it is true or false is one wicked wink to us about the meaning of the movie and its main irony.Finally did Alda mean that illusion is the Sweet Liberty from all the annoying facts that we live in our lives ? Or that truth nowadays is the Sweet Liberty from all the lies that we sunk under them ? Whatever the answer is asking the question proves how Alda is an intelligent moviemaker and how he managed to make profound and entertaining comedy. Actually it's wholly rare plus interesting for me as a scriptwriter myself and a previous student of history too.".

He's the quintessential Hollywood man who drags Alan Alda along through the highways and byways of movie speak. Saul Rubinek is also good as a most harassed and egotistical director.I would like to have seen more of Lillian Gish playing Alda's dotty mother who wants to hook up with a bricklayer she had a LONG ago fling with.

	schema:headline " The First American Film to discuss the American Revolution in the South";
	schema:reviewBody "As a followup to his wonderful FOUR SEASONS Alan Alda wrote directed and starred in SWEET LIBERTY  a film that explores the way movies unmake books and historical accuracy and film productions on location upset local populations. It's a good followup film but not as good as FOUR SEASONS because that film had some serious underpinnings about friendship and aging at it's center.In SWEET LIBERTY Alda plays Michael Burgess who lives is a southern college town with his mother Cecilia Lillian Gish. He is a professor of history who has just written a carefully researched best seller about the events in the region from 1779 to 1781 when the British under Cornwallis invaded Georgia and the Carolinas in the American Revolution. I have mentioned this somewhat forgotten aspect of the Revolution in other reviews on this board and how Cornwallis' actually had a clever scheme that could have worked there were far more loyal Tories among the population there than further North but how through the jealousy and foot dragging of Sir Henry Clinton Cornwallis' superior the scheme slowly unraveled. Forced by the Americans under Nathaniel Greene into a series of phyrric victories wherein he lost more men than the battles were worth Cornwallis decided to fight his way to Virginia and to have Clinton pick up his men there. This led to his defeat at Yorktown. Burgess's book deals with the diary of a local woman who witnesses these events. It also deals with her having a love affair with Cornwallis' Green Dragoon the notoriously deadly Sir Banastre Tarleton.Tarleton has appeared under a different name in Mel Gibson's controversial THE PATRIOT as the cavalry leader who did not mince words with the rebels. He exterminated them. The most notorious incident was when he ordered the massacre of rebels who had been captured at the Wraxhall River. But this was 1780 so war crimes trials were never heard of and General Tarleton lived to die in his bed in 1833. By the way  Tarleton never ordered burning alive civilians in a church to set an example that was a Gibson invention. Particularly an Anglican Church. King George III as head of the Anglican Church and a serious believer in the religious rights of his flock would probably have ordered Tarleton's arrest and execution for such an act.Burgess sells the rights to his book to a film company and soon realizes the hurricane he has released on his sleepy community. Burgess finds that he is working on the screenplay with Mr. Stanley Gould Bob Hoskins who loves the book  but is constantly changing it to fit film consumers attention spans. The director of the film is little better than a presumptive kid named Bo Hodges Saul Rubinek who has a ludicrous theory of what people want to see it includes mayhem buildings being blown up and people who are naked. Burgess has a close understanding with a fellow teacher named Gretchen Calsen Lisa Hilboldt which may lead to marriage. But both find themselves enthralled by the film leads Elliot James Michael Caine and Faith Healy Michelle Phifer. Both are temperamental egotists but they can lay on the charm to improve their roles or enjoy themselves. Soon Burgess finds himself approving changes in the script that benefit Healy which leads to counter improvements for the insistent James.On top of all this Burgess has problems with his mother a kindly woman who is partly insane. This also leads to him trying to resolve an issue regarding her past and a love affair she claims she had.The changes range from the ludicrous to the insulting. Remember that Tarleton was known as the Green Dragoon. A wealthy man he dressed his crack cavalry regiment in green outfits not in red. Hodges has James wear the traditional red uniform  American audiences expect red coats. The culmination of the film is the socalled turning point in the war in the south the American victory over Tarleton at the battle of the Cowpens a bit of farmland  the victor was General Daniel Morgan and it has been called the best tactical victory of the war. But Hodges wants to make it comic with the Americans running around stupidly as the British bombard them. This and a nasty confrontation between the film extras and the locals sets Alda up for leading his own revolution and showing the film people just where to get off.SWEET LIBERTY works as a comedy and is worth viewing. Besides Alda's growing frustration at the extremes of movie making Hoskins friendly but ruthless script reworking and Gish's comic insanity and the obnoxious Rubinek Caine does wonders showing ego and charm in it's turn see his rendition of Knees Up Father Brown when going out and Michelle Phyfer's twisting Alda around her finger. It is certainly a fine film comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had hoped to like this film a bit more than I did and I certainly expected to laugh more. Sweet Liberty is an Alan Alda project through and through. In it he plays a history professor whose historical novel is going to be made into a movie during one crazy summer in the little college town. Everyone is excited about the upcoming shoot but Alda's excitement turns to disgust once the cast and crew arrive. He finally gets a look at the script and finds out that the movie will be sort of a sex comedy with little regard for historical accuracy. Alda then sets out with the screenwriter to try and convince the actors and director to film his own version. While all of this is going on we sit through several arguments about Alda's relationship status with his girlfriend. We are also treated to the eccentricities of Alda's ancient mother played by legendary actress Lillian Gish. Overall there is just too much going on and the film never quite sustains any comedic momentum.The film has some genuine strengths. The cast is an eclectic bunch of old stars new faces and genial nobodies. Alda and Michael Caine basically play themselves and do a very good job. Michelle Pfeiffer is not only beautiful as hell but she also gives a strong early performance as the lead actress. Bob Hoskins' character is wellwritten but he plays the man in too shrill of a manner to be taken seriously. His screenwriter character has some wonderful points to make about using flattery to get the attention of the actors and director if you want them to change what they are doing. But he is just so hyper that you cringe whenever you hear his voice. Saul Rubinek is good as the hotshot pompous young director who is only out to show the audience three things People defying authority destruction of property and people taking off their clothing. That's what industry research shows that younger audiences want he informs Alda more than once.There are other problems besides the annoying Hoskins character. I'm sure it would seem desirable for an icon like Lillian Gish to be included in just about any film at that time. However her character and scenes are just not needed and end up being more of a distraction than anything else. Alda and his girlfriend have about the same argument at least half a dozen times. Another scene looks like it will give a huge laugh payoff but it falls flat. In it a group of stunt men are in a bar with some of the local recreators of the Battle of Cowpens who will also be used as extras in the film. The stunt men are trying to tell the amateurs how to fall in the battle scene. One of the stunt men breaks out one of those harnesses that people use to get pulled backwards through doorways in bar fight scenes. And you think you are going to see one of the amateurs get unknowingly hooked up to it and taken for the ride of his life. But alas they apparently thought it would be funnier for the guy just to fall down on his back like an idiot. Another missed opportunity! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "This and others will feel this too not just me that this colorful entry doesn't rise up to the rest of Alda's works. If you're involved in any facet of the film industry even a budding new screenwriter you'll identify with this film. What SL manages to do is be so darn bloody entertaining in a good way with a lot of good performances by many none more than the late Gish while I really liked Caine in this as a narcissistic womanizing lead and hopeless leadr and again one who likes to drink while Alda is just Alda again. He plays a English lit teacher who's just written a book on the American Revolution which is gonna be transpired to a decent sort film he can be proud of via a script but that's where the trouble first starts in the name of loud zesty scriptwriter Hoskins who's instead written like a sex farce. This really gets Alda irked but Hoskins becomes an ally and the two try to see they can slowly adjust it to what he wants under the uncaring and greedy eyes of the film's director the ever reliable Rubinek typecast. Alda has a beautiful girlfriend and of course he falls for actress in the story Pfeiffer who pretty much resembles I gather what she would be in real life regarding the serious craft of the acting world. Gish just steals every scene obsessing over an old flame he implores Alda to track down but of course he has other worries. I'll never get the opening theme out of my head. Again if involved in any facet of the film industry you'll find this film a blast. One scene at it's end even has an actor engaged in a perpetual kiss fare welling an extra. This film is never dull and manages to be colorfully entertaining all through. Actually writing this review has me wanting to videe it again. Though it's not without flaws and doesn't fully rise to the standardanticipated what could of been SL not the less just boils down to such a enjoyably entertaining sit down movie which kind of disappointingly shares the same song to Outrageous Fortune the following year. The film shows what can be achieved about righting your disapproval and the fruits of liberty when you reclaim your realization. Even Rubinek whose character is such an ass of a director tells Alda after he's tampered with it I'll just cut those scenes out later on. What was really inspiring was when the extras rallied with Alda to right one part.".

	onyx:emotionText "This and others will feel this too not just me that this colorful entry doesn't rise up to the rest of Alda's works. If you're involved in any facet of the film industry even a budding new screenwriter you'll identify with this film. What SL manages to do is be so darn bloody entertaining in a good way with a lot of good performances by many none more than the late Gish while I really liked Caine in this as a narcissistic womanizing lead and hopeless leadr and again one who likes to drink while Alda is just Alda again. He plays a English lit teacher who's just written a book on the American Revolution which is gonna be transpired to a decent sort film he can be proud of via a script but that's where the trouble first starts in the name of loud zesty scriptwriter Hoskins who's instead written like a sex farce. This really gets Alda irked but Hoskins becomes an ally and the two try to see they can slowly adjust it to what he wants under the uncaring and greedy eyes of the film's director the ever reliable Rubinek typecast. Alda has a beautiful girlfriend and of course he falls for actress in the story Pfeiffer who pretty much resembles I gather what she would be in real life regarding the serious craft of the acting world. Gish just steals every scene obsessing over an old flame he implores Alda to track down but of course he has other worries. I'll never get the opening theme out of my head. Again if involved in any facet of the film industry you'll find this film a blast. One scene at it's end even has an actor engaged in a perpetual kiss fare welling an extra. This film is never dull and manages to be colorfully entertaining all through. Actually writing this review has me wanting to videe it again. Though it's not without flaws and doesn't fully rise to the standardanticipated what could of been SL not the less just boils down to such a enjoyably entertaining sit down movie which kind of disappointingly shares the same song to Outrageous Fortune the following year. The film shows what can be achieved about righting your disapproval and the fruits of liberty when you reclaim your realization. Even Rubinek whose character is such an ass of a director tells Alda after he's tampered with it I'll just cut those scenes out later on. What was really inspiring was when the extras rallied with Alda to right one part.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather laidback but enjoyable movie the type that more mature audiences will enjoy.The story is relatively interesting. Hollywood types decide to make a movie based on an historical book written by Alan Alda's character. Of course the movie company cares nothing about the historical accuracy of the Revolutionary War era script while Alda and the community care a great deal. Meanwhile there are various romantic situations involving Alda and the film's starring actress Michelle Pfeiffer and Alda's girlfriend Lise Hilboldt and the film's lead actor Michael Caine who did not get top billing here although these assignations are handled in a rather urbane manner. Alda and the community get their revenge when the key battle scene of the movie is filmed. It's all very good natured.Alan Alda is very good here just right for this kind of laidback treatment of the story. It made me wish that more Alda's acting career had been in film rather than in MASH. Michael Caine is fine here although the role is clearly a supporting role rather than a starring role. Michelle Pfeiffer is satisfactory quite appealing in some scenes and then not so in other scenes an uneven performance. Bob Hoskins has a supporting role as a decidedly unclassy screenwriter nothing very notable. Lise Hilboldt is very good as Alda's girlfriend. It's a delight to see Lillian Gish in a role as Alda's eccentric mother her next to the last film. Saul Rubinek plays the film's director again nothing special here.Is this a box office smash? No. A rather casual film with a decent script and goo acting. As at least one reviewer indicated it could have been more satirical but I don't think that was the intent. Particularly worthwhile if you enjoy Alan Alda".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've ever wondered how Alan Alda went from being one of the most popular figures in American entertainment after M.A.S.H to being an aging character actor playing small parts in other people's movies Sweet Liberty is the reason. This thing is so appalling I'm surprised it only crippled his career and didn't cause him to be retroactively expelled from the spacetime continuum.This movie tries to be about 8 different things and it sucks hard at all of them. It's about history professor Michael Burgess Alan Alda and his weird relationship with his girlfriend Gretchen Carlsen Lise Hilboldt. He desperately wants them to move in together and just as desperately doesn't want to get married. She doesn't want to get married or live together just keep banging him. It's about Michael's even weirder relationship with his crazy mother Lillian Gish who sleeps on her own sofa and demands to be reunited with an old boyfriend she hasn't seen in decades. It's about Michael's fights with movie director Bo Hodges Saul Rubink who's comes to town to make a movie out of Michael's book on the American revolution. Saul wants to make it into a teenagerpleasing piece of crap that's all about defying authority blowing stuff and people getting naked. Michael wants it to be historically accurate with everyone wearing the right kind of hat.Sweet Liberty is also about Michael's relationship with the movie's lead actress Faith Healy Michelle Pfeiffer. You see Gretchen conveniently breaks up with him right before the movie starts production and Michael falls in love with the character Faith is portraying. Michael appears to be some sort of idiot savant capable of writing a successful book but incapable of recognizing when an actress is acting. He also has to worry about the movie's lead actor Elliot James Michael Caine who's like an overgrown child who only cares about fencing driving recklessly and sleeping with as many women as possible. Helping Michael navigate the minefield of the movie's production screenwriter Stanley Gould Bob Hoskins who wrote the script based on Michael's book even though Stanley acts more like a Catskills comedian or a vaudevillian stage comic than a writer.The film also wastes time on Elliot's adulterous affair with a local woman and a feud between the stuntmen working on the movie and the local American Revolution reenactors who've been hired on as extras.Now if any of the things I've just described seem even vaguely interesting I apologize for misleading you. Sweet Liberty isn't funny it isn't clever it isn't engaging or enjoyable on any level. I t is sad and pathetic to watch Hollywood legend Lillian Gish lamely attempt to ham her way through a wacky old lady role that couldn't have been more poorly written if it had been done by a 5 year old orphan. Lise Hilboldt moronically grins her way through every scene no matter the context like she was heavily medicated for the entire production. Alda's direction is incompetent and his script is a jangled mess.Sweet Liberty is proof positive that there had to have been a lot of extremely talented people working on M.A.S.H. because despite his star status it's clear that Alda couldn't have had much to do with the show's success.".

In combination with the lighting the film's sound effects which alternate with silence are appropriately spooky. And Keith Emerson's soundtrack with all that organ music contributes to the Gothic tone. One of the best parts of the entire film is the rockopera opus from the chorus at the film's end with that great beat and lyrics that are indecipherable.The nightmarish atmosphere while maybe not quite as stunning as in Suspiria is more than adequate to induce suspense anticipation and a sense of danger. From out of the darkness and stillness comes death in all its horrific cruelty. As a horror film Inferno is fairly pure in that the plot is more or less selfcontained. There are only brief references to the real world outside the confines of the story.The film's plot is indeed thin and functions really as an excuse for the actors to move from one atmospheric set to the next. The script does not require great acting skills mercifully since great acting is nowhere to be found.Of the various Argento films I have seen Inferno is perhaps my least favorite. It does not have the conviction of Argento's other works. It seems more like a halfhearted sequel an afterthought to Suspiria. Like most sequels I find it less satisfying than the original the soundtrack notwithstanding. Still for Argento fans Inferno is a mustsee if for no other reason than for purposes of comparison.".

The architect and alchemist E. Varelli who tells that had designed and built three buildings for three mothersin Rome New York and Freiburg wrote an impressive story in London. These threes wicked mothers called Mater Suspiriorum the oldest one Mater Lachrymarum the most beautiful and Mater Tenebrarum the youngest and cruelest intended to rule the world with sorrow tears and darkness. In accordance with the book there are three keys each one of them hidden in one building. Rose realizes that she lives in one of the buildings and decides to look for the second hidden key in the cellar. From this moment on weird things happen to her and she decides to write a letter to her brother Mark Elliot Leigh McCloskey a student of musicology in Rome and asks him to visit her in New York. Mark never meets his sister and finds who the three mothers are indeed. This is the beginning of Inferno one of my favorite Dario Argento's movies with an intriguing and frightening story and great atmosphere. There are many flaws in the screenplay the characters are not well developed so their motives are not clear and there are lacks of explanations for many events so the viewer does not understand why the evil mothers attack the characters of the story but anyway it is a cult Gothic movie. With some improvements in the screenplay this movie would be a masterpiece classic. I have already seen this scary movie four times in a VHS I have recorded a couple of years ago from cable TV and unfortunately it has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Manso do Inferno The Mansion of the HellNote On June 23rd 2009 I saw this movie for the fifth time in an imported DVD.On June 4th 2015 I saw this movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had my doubts whether this was a bad movie or not. But after some time of thought I realized it was not that much different from 'Suspiria'. Except 'Inferno' is more abstract making it more bizarre than 'Suspiria'. They both have nightmare like atmosphere but whereas 'Suspiria' is thunderous and leaves you feel like you've had a roller coaster ride 'Inferno' leaves you in a trance like state. Making for two ways of having nightmare. Both are artistic but 'Inferno' got even more artistic. Argento even used classical music in 'Inferno'. The violence combined with the classical music which by the way is Verdi's 'Nabucco' was disturbingly beautiful. It was uncomfortable to watch but the music made it irresistible. Speaking of music Keith Emerson made the music which I find quite interesting. Emerson's music gave the movie a whole new level of awesome if you ask me. Especially with the song Mater Tenebrarum. In the floor where the music starts and a cat is eating a mouse whilst our main character is looking around it just got really interesting to watch. For some reason I find it hard to explain. It was simply astonishing.Anyway why is 'Inferno' so underrated? Is it because it is more abstract? Some people argue that the script is pure crap and it makes less sense than 'Suspiria'. But that's the point. Dreams are abstractions of the mind dreams don't always make sense and you can't explain them. Dreams are absurd like this movie is. Or maybe people expected more a movie in the same vein as 'Suspiria'? They're both the same overall but with small differences. I guess those small differences are a big deal. 'Inferno' is also an overlooked gem and underrated compared to 'Suspiria'. I like 'Inferno' a bit more than 'Suspiria' since Mater Tenebrarum is the cruelest of all the mothers also because it is more absurd than 'Suspiria'. Tenebrarum's influence and power felt quite overwhelming even a bit hard to see through at first. But after repeated viewing it starts to make a little more sense with the unexplained events. But the strength of the movie is also its weakness which is its abstraction. Many people will probably dismiss it because it is abstract which is kinda sad. But anyway it won't stop me from liking it more than 'Suspiria'. Although I gotta say 'Suspiria' is a whole lot scarier to watch than 'Inferno'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inferno1980 was the second film in the yet to be completed 3 Mothers Trilogy.  The first film Suspiria1977 was about Mater Suspirium. Inferno1980 deals with the evil mysteries of Mater Tenebrarum.  The third film is to be about the character of Mater Lacrimarum.  At one point after this film Argento was planning to complete the trilogy with Jennifer Connelly as Mater Lacrimarum.The director decided to shift gears by using the music of Keith Emerson for the film's soundtrack.  Its a change of pace after the hard rock pounding effects of Goblin.  The music in Inferno1980 is more of the traditional gothic sound.  The music in this film is wonderful to listen to.  Its the most overlooked soundtrack in an Argento picture.The cameo of Mater Lacrimarum is an essential part of this movie.  Her appearence is to set things up for the story of the third film.  The scene with Mater Lacrimarum is so unreal that it has the aura and feeling of a dream.  Ania Pieroni is bewitching and impressionable as the beautiful and mysterious music student.  Mater Lacrimarum is very much unexplained to the point that she is something out of a dream or fantasy.Inferno1980 deals with occult themes such as alchemy and magic.  Goes into the supernatural and the mysteries of the occult with better detail than in Suspiria.  What this film says about alchemy and the supernatural is that they are elements of nature that are difficult to explain.  Its in this form that Inferno is in the tradition of the great gothic works from the gothic era.  The subject of alchemy was another thing that interested Dario Argento.Unlike the previous film which had a story Inferno takes a different route by having no story.  Inferno instead relies on the use of images and sound. Not liked by many because the film leaves many things unesplained and is too dreamism looking.  Inferno1980 is an inaccessible film to a mainstream audience as were the films of Lisa  the Devil1974 and The Beyond1981. I absolutely love this movie because its the closest thing there is to a recorded dream.Inferno1980 is an important Italian horror picture because it was the last picture that Mario Bava worked on before his death.  He ended in the same manner that he began when co directing I Vampiri in 1955.  Mario Bava was involved in the special and visuals effects for the underwater and mirror sequences.  He helped make these scenes a pleasure to view.  A fitting end to a filmmaker that influenced a generation of directors around the world.The murder scenes are done with much creativity and panache.  The murder of Sara is filled with good use of Verdi and memorable visuals.  The death of Rose Elliot including a guillotine like window is cleaver.  The murder of the Countess Von Adler is both sadistic and vicious.  The murder sequence involving Kazanian is also sadistic as well as skillfully done.The weakest part of the film is the male protagonist played by Leigh McCloskey.  The character of Mark Elliot is both bland and uninteresting. He is the main protagonist by default because the people who were protagonist material had been killed off.  This shows that the strongest protagonist in a Dario Argento film is the female protagonist. This is one thing that hurts the film very much.Kazanian is excellently played by Sascha Pitoeff who had earlier co starred in another complex and confusing flick known as L'Annee Derniere A MarienbadLast Year at Marienbad1961.  This is the most difficult film that Dario has partaken as a director.  He poured every ounce of creative and imaginative ideas that he came up with and it drained him out of an big amount of creative energy.  Its one of the main reasons that he hasn't done the third film in The Three Mothers Trilogy.  As in Suspiria1977 the ending here is one of the auteur's weakest.The main inspiration besides the De Quincey essay is the 1960s horror film Horror Hotel1961.  In both films there is a female protagonist who disappears during the middle act.  The two films includes a brother who searches for the truth about what happened to the sister.  The best line in the film is from Kazanian when he says There are mysterious parts in that book but the only true mystery is that our very lives are governed by dead people.  The dream of Mark Elliot is the film's surreal moment and the image of the total esclipse as Kazanian is being murdered is mesmerizing and spellbounding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two years after he shot his masterpiece Suspiria horror director Dario Argento made Inferno a sequel of sorts. Unlike it's predecessor however it meet lots of bad reviews and it didn't get a proper release. Which is a shame really considering how it's one of Argento's finest works containing two of his most beautiful screen moments Rose's descent into the flooded ballroom and the scene at the lecture hall with Mark. While it may not be as good as it's predecessor it's still more than a worthy follow up specially when compared to Mother of Tears the godawful second sequel to Suspiria. Again with have a gorgeous color palette and brilliant set design there is a haunting atmosphere of dread throughout a great soundtrack Keith Emerson replaces the Goblins in this one and does a pretty good work some very creepy moments and of course the brilliant death scenes Argento's trademark. The film also excels in creating a dreamlike feel that surpasses anything remotely surreal that we've seen in Suspiria. Inferno is probably the closest thing to a recorded nightmare I've ever seen. It's also much different than the other genre flicks of it's time. In fact it's feel much closer to the work of Alain Resnais or Luis Bunuel than to the films of say George A. Romero or even his Italian contemporaries such as Fulci or Bava Jr. Of course the film is not without it's flaws. The biggest flaw of the film is the protagonist. Argento shows us three candidates for the role of the protagonist only to kill each and everyone of them in brutal and meanspirited ways they were clever twists I admit. At the end we are left with the one guy we'd never expect to be the 'the final boy'. That is Leigh McCloskey as Mark. The thing with this character is it's badly written and badly acted. Maybe it was Argento's intention to have the main character look high from the beginning to end possibly to enhance the film's stateofdream but it simply doesn't work. Also there are some surprisingly cheesy and unintentionally funny lines that are almost impossible to seat through. Still the film has more than enough redeeming qualities and it is one of the greatest masterpieces of the macabre  a definite acid trip to Hell. Even if it's not for everyone it should be seen by anyone interested in horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two years after he shot his masterpiece Suspiria horror director Dario Argento made Inferno a sequel of sorts. Unlike it's predecessor however it meet lots of bad reviews and it didn't get a proper release. Which is a shame really considering how it's one of Argento's finest works containing two of his most beautiful screen moments Rose's descent into the flooded ballroom and the scene at the lecture hall with Mark. While it may not be as good as it's predecessor it's still more than a worthy follow up specially when compared to Mother of Tears the godawful second sequel to Suspiria. Again with have a gorgeous color palette and brilliant set design there is a haunting atmosphere of dread throughout a great soundtrack Keith Emerson replaces the Goblins in this one and does a pretty good work some very creepy moments and of course the brilliant death scenes Argento's trademark. The film also excels in creating a dreamlike feel that surpasses anything remotely surreal that we've seen in Suspiria. Inferno is probably the closest thing to a recorded nightmare I've ever seen. It's also much different than the other genre flicks of it's time. In fact it's feel much closer to the work of Alain Resnais or Luis Bunuel than to the films of say George A. Romero or even his Italian contemporaries such as Fulci or Bava Jr. Of course the film is not without it's flaws. The biggest flaw of the film is the protagonist. Argento shows us three candidates for the role of the protagonist only to kill each and everyone of them in brutal and meanspirited ways they were clever twists I admit. At the end we are left with the one guy we'd never expect to be the 'the final boy'. That is Leigh McCloskey as Mark. The thing with this character is it's badly written and badly acted.

	schema:reviewBody "One thing that has always bugged me enormously about Mr. Argentos films are his blatant disregard for decent scripts and good actors preferring to focus solely on visual and auditory extravaganza. Considering the latter aspect I can not help but to applaud the man for being somewhat of a master when it comes to creating a sinister atmosphere. Few can match him here. I think my favourite films penned by him have to be Suspiria Phenomena and Trauma. Of course as all his films are ultimately marred by bad script and acting the aforementioned films are sadly no exception. But what these films have going for them unlike his lesser films especially Suspiria are a twisted and dark atmosphere that tends to overshadow the fact that the lines delivered often seem to be spoken by robots. I really enjoyed Suspiria and in my opinion it is probably one of the most atmospheric horrorflicks out there in addition the murders are delightfully inventive here. So what to say then about Inferno the follow up to Suspiria? One thing is certain I refuse to join the choir of appraisal for the sole reason that compared to the brilliance of Suspiria this is really nothing special at all. Sure he creates some striking visuals yet again and I absolutely love the many times mentioned underwaterscene. But all in all this is quite an forgettable film with forgettable murders shitty acting and with an ultimately forgettable atmosphere. One thing that I fail to grasp though is the fact that many seem to view this film as confusing which in my opinion it is not. Quite easy to understand if you ask me. I think this film would have been much better if Argento dropped all the dialogue and created a lot more tension and more sinister visuals ala the underwater scene. As it stand now though it is a boring experience. Plain and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the second movie in Argento's Three Mother's trilogy it's hard to watch Inferno without comparing it to Suspiria. And that's not really a fair comparison. Inferno has its moments of brilliance. The opening scenes as Rose Irene Miracle lowers herself into the flooded room are what horror movies are all about. It's easily one of my favorite moments from an Argento film second only to the opening murder in Suspiria. The atmosphere tension and horror are overflowing. The first time I saw the movie this scene had me literally squirming in my seat.But Inferno also features what I feel are some of the worst moments to be found in an Argento film. Take the ending as an example. It's a real let down. The entire movie builds to the discovery of the second of the Three Mothers and it's over before it really gets started. Our hero Leigh McCloskey meets her she transforms into Death he runs away and the building burns  end of movie. This evil creature whom we have waited to see the entire movie does nothing once we finally see her.The look of Inferno is awesome. Inferno is like Suspiria on steroids. It's real eyecandy for the Argento fan. The use of colors set direction and lighting are about the best I've seen.Keith Emerson's score is adequate. While it lacks some of the punch of a Goblin score it suits the mood of the film nicely. Most of the acting is also adequate with Daria Nicolodi's small role being my favorite. It's too bad she wasn't in more of the movie. While McCloskey and Miracle do nothing special neither is a liability.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Dario Argento strikes gold with his film Inferno released in 1980. His trademarks superb set design and hypnotic lighting are prominent here. The story and screenplay were also Argento's work with the latter really bringing this piece to life.Inferno opens with a young poet RoseIrene Miracle reading a passage from a book called 'The Three Mothers' written by an architect named Virelli. The passage describes three sisters who rule different cities around the world using sorrow tears and darkness. It also explains that Virelli has built the houses these sisters dwell in and where to find the 'keys' to unlock their mystery. This launches her and her brother MarkLeigh McCloskey on a quest to solve this mystery.Without divulging too much more the story is fairly straightforward from there. The way in which it is told and paced however is captivating. It jumps between the characters of Rose Mark and Mark's friend SaraEleonora Giorgi explaining just enough about each characters motivations to drive the story forward but leaving their back story a mystery. Some people may see this as a downfall but I think it was the right choice as it leaves more screen time to develop the core elements of the story. Irene Miracle gives a solid performance and the supporting cast are all solid as well. However Leigh McCloskey and Eleonora Giorgi definitely leave something to be desired.Argento's films are best known for their visual style and Inferno is no exception. This movie is candy for the eyes. Almost every scene has saturated colors mainly blues and reds cascading along set pieces and faces. These colored lights emanate from an unknown source that's always off screen adding to the feeling of mystery. The set pieces are great An oddly lit oddly painted apartment building where much of the movie takes place projects the sense that there is something wrong there. A library in the first act of the movie is one of the most gorgeous set pieces I have ever seen. The entrance to this library through a set of red velvet curtains is sure to cement the moment in your mind.The scares and kills in this movie are well done and fairly creative. Although this is more of a mystery the horror elements are executed masterfully with a good balance between tension and jump scares.Keith Emerson of the band 'Emerson Lake and Palmer' was responsible for the entire score and soundtrack of this film. It is one of the best ever composed.In short Inferno is one of the best films I have seen in my life. Other than some strange choices in editing and a pair of less than desirable performances there is nothing wrong with this movie. A must see for horror and mystery fans alike.Verdict 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely a Dario Argento film here. No question about it. The film's plot concerns a young girl having read a book about three mothers who live in France Germany and her hotel in New York investigating the place she lives in for a key. The girl contacts her brother going to school in Rome  anyone buy Leigh McCloskey as a student of musicology?  asking for help. The three mothers are...well if you know you are a step ahead of me.This Argento film is very problematic. On the one hand its genius cannot be denied when it comes to visual artistry and suspense building. Argento paints a scene like no other film maker I know with the exception perhaps of Mario Bavawho worked on this film...his last. The vibrant colors used throughout the film are surreal and some of the scenes are lessons in scene building. The underwater sequence is an awesome scene yet its has virtually no place in the film's plot. Another scene involves a crippled man falling in water and slowly being devoured by rats. His cries reach a diner cook working late who runs outside to stick a knife in the poor man's throat. His character or an explanation never come. How about the key? Never mentioned again. Visual brilliance cannot make this a good film though it really works hard at it. I found myself not really understanding what was going on yet loving the scenery. As with most of Argento's work we get plenty of bloody deaths particularly young girls and crippled older men. Inferno is not a bad film nor is it a great film. It has many qualities found in Suspiria but that film made a great deal more sense and had some actors that had a bit more talent than those involved with this. McCloskey's stage presence is akin to driftwood. He is a very poor lead. Alida Valli is back as a permed hotel manager. She gives a good performance though her part has almost no real significance in the film. I guess my gripe is that how can a director with so much obvious talent like Argento just cross the line too much between reality and imagination. If your audience doesn't have SOME guidance then how are they going to know what you are trying to achieve. Some reviewers say you need to watch this film many times to get its point. Balderdash! I could watch it ten more times and still would not be able to make the aforementioned connections in the plot. I could easily sit through the film again though because of Argento's style of using film as a canvas. If Inferno had a better constructed plot something along the lines of Suspiria this very well could be a minor masterpiece. It is definitely worth a look however though it pales in comparison to Suspiria in every way.".

	schema:headline " Contains Spoilers Argento's understated masterpiece of supernatural horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Inferno is Argento's most understated and most visually stunning film to date. It has often been unfairly compared to Suspiria which I admit is the better film of both. People often state that it pales in comparison to Suspiria but yet what were people expecting with Inferno? A remake of Suspiria? Well if that is so they would have been shocked when they saw Inferno. Inferno and Suspiria share many qualities but Inferno is in no way a remake.This film is more atmospheric than Suspiria. The lighting can at times be overwhelming reds and blues feature particularly. This creates an almost nightmarish vision of New York and Rome where the film is set. Or as it appears to be. This film in a sense is one big nightmare. It becomes illogical and incoherent. Some of the characters actions become irrational for example when Kazanian is in the lake shouting and been devoured by rats a hot dog vendor runs over and and stabs Kazanian in the neck a few times. Maybe the man did this because Mater Tenebraum made him do it? We don't no because Inferno has many plot holes which leave some events seem irrational. But this adds the strange otherworldly quality of the film. We seem to just sit back and believe these things are happening because we no we are dealing with the supernatural.The special effects in Inferno are also excellent. The scene at the end where the nurse disappears but her reflection can be still seen in the mirror is fantastic. But even more impressive is when she turns into death. I won't tell you how she does it because I will spoil it for you. These effects where created by Mario Bava an icon of Italian horror cinema. He makes the illusion look astonishingly real. He will be sadly missed especially by Argento.The performances are good. McCloskey's Mark is a character that is very irritating because he spends the film behind everyone else. He is played by Leigh as very 'wooden' and uninteresting. However the actresses who play Rose and Sara contribute great performances. They are very believable interesting and are the characters you wish Argento did not kill off. They are extremely beautiful and have the personalities that can really get the audience involved. They have the qualities that the main protagonist needs. Sacha Pitoff is also excellent especially in the scene involving his death. He is able to perfectly capture Kazanian's dark and mysterious character. Daria Nicolodi deserves a mention as she was also great but not as good as in other Argento classics. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as Varelli is brilliant and Veronica Lazar as his nurse is at times annoying and seemingly stupid but she is great in the ending although her laugh seems fake and is laughable. The rest of the cast put in good performances but nothing really outstanding.The highlight of the film is the scene in the flooded ballroom in the basement. Truly one of Argento's best scenes. Beautiful atmospheric and scary. But yet it seems hard to believe that Rose would venture down into a flooded room for her keys. Let me just say that it nearly gave me a heart attack...Keith Emerson's music is masterful. I loved it so much I even bought the soundtrack. It has received a lot of criticism people say that it does not fit the film at all and some say it is not as good as Suspiria. Again the film is been compared to Suspiria. It is a tense piece of divine art a truly haunting soundtrack. The theme is wonderfully hypnotic and then becomes a more powerful riveting piece. Mater Tenebraum is the best thing on the soundtrack. Unquestionably masterful.Also look out for Ania Pieroni in the scene in the music room as Mater Lacrimarum with the white cat. You can also spot her passing in a taxi as Mark leaves the apartment after Carlo and Sara's deaths. Overall Inferno is an Argento masterpiece a mustsee piece of cinema. 1010It has become my favorite Argento!".

After a few years i saw almost all of his films and I think I can say You are one of my favourite directors Mr. Argento.

It has all of the genuine touches that Dario Argento gives in his movies. Very gory and very alive very stylish and dark very suspenseful and very strange... Just see the movie and you will understand. If Suspiria scared you to death Inferno will kill you of fright.".

	schema:headline " Argento Turns Horror Into Alchemized Gold";
	schema:reviewBody "With its night world of illfamed alchemists evil witches and doomed artists Inferno is alchemical gold and a superior followup to its predecessor 1977's Suspiria.Rose Elliot Irene Miracle is a poet living in an eccentric New York brownstone. Reading a tome called The Three Mothers by an alchemist named Varelli she learns that her home is one of the three houses that Varelli built to contain The Three Mothers of Whsipers Tears and Darkness diabolical sorceresses who rule the world with Sorrow Tears and Darkness. Mater Suspiriorum The eldest rules in Freiburg Germany Mater Lachrymarum The most beautiful dominates Rome while Mater Tenebrarum The youngest and cruelestresides in Rose's house. Alarmed by a discovery in the building's cellar Rose writes to her brother Mark Leigh McCloskey a music student in Rome. When Mark travels to new York concerned for his sister's safety after an interrupted phone call he finds finds that she has vanished.The brief outline above in no way conveys the cumulative effect of its nonlinear brand of scareshow Argento took as his inspiration Alain Resnais' 1961 film Last Year at Marienbad as well as Thomas De Quincey's piece Levanna and Our Ladies of Sorrow. Even more nonsensical in terms of plot logic than Suspiria Inferno succeeds because it does not make an attempt to make sense. Like the mysterious world of alchemy creeping at the edges of the plot Inferno implies that its onslaught of mythic horrors are an inexplicable unknowable phenomenon outside of human comprehension. After all if you reveal a magic trick it ceases to be magic right? inferno is full of doomed Seekers of The Truth who stumble upon the fringes of a horrible mystery that they will never unravel and will never understand the reasons behind their violent ends.There are times watching this movie that I feel the kind of aesthetic freeassociation disconnect I feel when I have read a short story by Julio Cortazar or listened to a System of A Down song. Like a piece of medieval poetry the film decants its imagery like dense and repetitive stanzas water fire taloned hands shattering glass cats moon bloodied palms and fingertips etc. spoilers belowbewareThere are two scenes in particular that stand out Sara Mark's girlfriend takes refuge with an acquaintance Carlo after having read Rose's letter and gone to the local library in search of the book. She puts on a recording of Verdi's Wa Pensiaro and looks up at the full moon. While she makes a phone call to Mark Argento quickcuts a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images a killer's blackgloved hand cutting paper doll heads off with a pair of scissorsa lizard eating a motha woman we never know who she is thrashing in deathagony at the end of a ropeback to the blackgloved killer's scissorswielding hand.The second sequence is Mark's total seduction yes I would definitely use that word even though the seduction is chaste and mental in music class by a beautiful cattoting teenage girl. The girl who we infer to be Mater Lachrymarum distracts Mark from reading Rose's plea for help. This setpiece in which very little happens is amazing Argento cuts back and forth between Mark and The Girl Ana Pieroni as Verdi's Va Pensiaro booms from the room's speakers. The girl's plush lips mouth something at Mark as he fights some inner fatigue then the window blows open as some unseen force glides above the students' heads.There's no doubt that people who want their horrors presented with the cookiecutter predictability of most Western products will probably have little truck with Argento's quiet elegant fears. That said it's hard to envision any horror buff not liking the terrific startling payoff to a minor villain's demise attacked by rats as he's trying to drown cats in Central Park. What makes the scene is the combination of Argento's editing and Keith Emerson's soundtrack.Mention should be made of Keith Emerson's of Emerson Lake and Palmer famescore. Whereas Suspiria's Goblin soundtrack was an allout aural assault Emerson provides a lot of dark key tinkling with horns and the occasional choral blast. As Argento has turned down the sound the movie's look while using the same color palette as 'Suspiria isn't as brash and hypersaturated.A couple of sidenotes Inferno was the last movie that Italian horror maestro Mario Bava worked on albeit in a special effects capacity. His contributions included Mater Tenebrarum's sunken lair and the Mater's transformation near the climax. Feodor Chiaplin who plays Varelli played Cher's grandfather in 'Moonstruck and one of the monks in Name of The Rose. In a film as artificial and stylized as this it is really hard to truly discuss the performances. Irene Miracle of Midnight Express fame is a beautiful ethereal innocent. Leigh McCloskey has been criticized for giving a wan acting job but I thought he was perfectly cast as a man who never comprehends the forces arrayed against him. Daria Nicolodi as Mark's doomed ally brought a degree of warmth and likability to her role as the ailing Countess a quality that's pretty much missing from most of Argento's movies. Sacha Pitoeff as the cat hating bookseller Kazanian was a memorable creep.If you have not been exposed to Argento's works you might be cheered to know that Inferno stands on its own you certainly don't have to have seen Suspiria to enjoy the second chapter of what is undoubtedly a trilogy that will never be finished. Suspiria came out in 1977 and Inferno 1980. A projected third film scripted with Nicoldi to have originally featured a teenage Jennifer Connelly who starred in Argento's Phenomena has pretty much languished in development. Argento has with a few exceptions stayed firmly in the Gialli genre.Given the chances of him making that film Argento fans and neophytes will undoubtedly adopt Mater Lachrymarum for their muse.".

Where his other films may lack 'substance' I find that they have substance just in a different form they made up for it with nightmarish insanity and heartstopping violence. This has none of that. The sets are Gothic and beautiful that's it. I hate to sound like a morbid sadist but what redeems Argento's films the most are his aweinspiring death sequences. This has someone getting stabbed and not in a very interesting way either. The score as well is a lard disappointment. It just doesn't creep me out at all. Why he didn't enroll those zany Goblin musicians is beyond me. Maybe he wanted to expand his horizons. I can sort of understand why he did this movie perhaps to expand his vision of nightmarish horror? but it just lacks any real tension of any kind. An awful movie. I'm sorry to say it.".

What was all the fuss about and why on earth was it banned?! There's a awkward scene of a REAL cat eating a REAL mouse which is completely unnecessary and if filmed deliberately for the movie is totally wrong and unethical.The film itself is abominable. And what about that soundtrack  Keith Emerson and Dario Argneto are not good bedfellows what were they thinking? In fact i feel the soundtrack almost completely ruins a potentially good film....It's absurd and totally out of contex to whats happening on screen. I actually found myself laughing in parts at the incongruity of what i was seeing and hearing. I suppose you never watch a Dario Argento film for its acting i know a lot also gets lost in the dubbing but i felt the acting was exceptionally bad and the cats were probably the best actors in the movie! The colour of the movie was nice and staging and sets are typical Dario Argento. Where was all the spectacular death scenes i've read so much about? I don't believe i watched a truncated versionAnchor Bay region 1. It reminded me of the first time i saw Lucio Fulci The House by the Cemetery equally overrated and very tame. I'm sorry it's just not a favourite and i cant see why this is considered a classic of it's genre? The one thing i do like is the poster..an absolute classic filmwise a major disappointment!!".

But as Roy Rowland's Rogue Cop demonstrates there were still changes to be rung on those themes jazzed up with fresh casting and pithy writing.Here the cop gone sour isn't a homicidal brute like Edmond O'Brien in the same year's Shield For Murder both movies were adapted from books by William McGivern as was Fritz Lang's The Big Heat.  He's dapper laidback Robert Taylor known by his brothers' on the force to be on the take but given a wide berth despite it it's the thin blue line's equivalent of omert. When his younger brother Steve Forrest also a policeman identifies a connected hitman Taylor receives a summons from his paymaster crime boss George Raft. Either Forrest recants his testimony in return for a 15grand payoff or he'll be killed the accused knows too much and might sing if convicted.  Upon delivering the ultimatum Taylor gets rebuffed by Forrest he then tries to blackmail his brother's fiance Janet Leigh a nightclub singer into trying to change his mind.  Taylor doesn't really want Forrest to go bad he just doesn't want him dead.But Raft plays tougher than Taylor imagines.  Lulling Taylor into thinking he still has time Raft has Forrest shot in the back.  And so the worm turns Using both Leigh and Raft's discarded moll Anne Francis as his allies Taylor swears vengeance....Crisply photographed by John Seitz Rogue Cop burrows snugly into its rotten urban core  a city of dreadful night.  With its large and aptly chosen cast it nonetheless rests squarely on the shoulders of its central character Taylor who comes through with the performance of his career.  At age 42 he passes muster as a burntout cop who's sold out for easy money  in this urban jungle corruption is just another perk passed up only by fools  but still has the wits and the will to spring a few surprises when cornered.  There's plenty of brutal even sadistic action but Rogue Cop is less an action picture than a character study that Taylor somewhat surprisingly manages to pull off.  With its siblings The Big Heat and Shield For Murder Rogue Cop makes up a grim tryptich of bigtown America in the mid20th century.".

The problem is that while Taylor isn't above lying or cheating his brother Steve Forrest is a decent guy and won't play along with the crooks. So Taylor is stuckshould he obey his masters who have bought and paid for him or should he remain loyal to his brother? This makes for a great dilemma and also allows Taylor to play one of his grittier and more rugged roles something I really appreciated after all the pretty boy roles of the 1930s and early 40s. I particularly liked watching Taylor in an allout brawl with Alan Hale Jr. as Taylor ending up beating him with a brutal punch to the throat! Now THAT'S what you expect in Noir! Overall this film is well made and interesting. About the only negative is one brief scene with Janet Leigh when Taylor kisses herit just doesn't ring true.

But it's the same guy and a film like Rogue Cop brings out the maturity and depth Taylor had as an artist as well as a person.Taylor is a long time big city cop on the take to gangland boss George Raft. He's risen pretty high in the department and could go farther. He's a pretty cynical dude in his chosen field he's seen a lot of the worst that people can be.But he's got a kid brother played by Steve Forrest who's a straight arrow. He doesn't know about his brother and he gets himself killed because he crosses Raft in the performance of his duty. Forrest's death gives Taylor a mission he'll take Raft down no matter what it costs.There are two prominent female roles Janet Leigh as Forrest's girl friend who later develops an interest in Taylor and Anne Francis as Raft's moll who turns against him. Both women hold their own in what is a male dominated film. Francis borrows quite a bit from Gloria Grahame and her performance in The Big Heat. Also both Rogue Cop and The Big Heat have blackmail of a syndicate boss as the underpinning of the story.Raft of course is in his element as a gangland boss. In the rest of the cast there's a very nice performance by Robert Ellenstein as Taylor's honest partner. The final shootout with Raft and company with the two of them is one of the best and most realistic ever staged in a film.For Robert Taylor fans Rogue Cop is an absolute must and people who don't think much of Taylor as player will be jolted at how well he does in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Taylor was a wonderful choice for this film about a crooked cop who likes the high life and has little respect for his honest colleagues. What would eventually stop Chris Kelvaney Taylor would be the death of his brother Eddie played by Steve Forrest. He was an honest cop and crosses the mob by identifying a killer they are tied to by blackmail. This is the part of a lifetime for Taylor as he walks with the dirt and corruption of the mob boss George Raft. Raft is icy his black eyes never showing any emotion until he dumps his girl Anne Francis of Honey West fame and sends her to the gutter giving her to his friends. Janet Leigh does a nice job as Eddie's reluctant girl not knowing if she loves him and when she is confronted by Chris about her shady past with the mob falls apart. Taylor is trying to make her help him save Eddie telling her he will spill the beans about her back ground. She refuses and he roughs her up ending the confrontation by kissing her and after she somewhat submits to the embrace he tells her she is no better than he. Robert Ellenstein is Kelvaney's partner and is sick of the take but in the end helps Chris get the killers. This film is a favorite of the NYPD along with another Taylor film Johnny Eager. Taylor's performance as Johnny Eager was superb but I think this mature role with Taylor fighting snarling and just in general being disgusted with everything out shines even that much ignored Oscar caliber performance of 1942. Great noir for all those crime film fans. 2008 By the way if you watch closely the scene in the brothers house the photo on the mantle is really Taylor's baby picture with his mother holding him and his father kneeling next to her. I have watched this film dozens of times and never noticed it till today.".

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Taylor was a wonderful choice for this film about a crooked cop who likes the high life and has little respect for his honest colleagues. What would eventually stop Chris Kelvaney Taylor would be the death of his brother Eddie played by Steve Forrest. He was an honest cop and crosses the mob by identifying a killer they are tied to by blackmail. This is the part of a lifetime for Taylor as he walks with the dirt and corruption of the mob boss George Raft. Raft is icy his black eyes never showing any emotion until he dumps his girl Anne Francis of Honey West fame and sends her to the gutter giving her to his friends. Janet Leigh does a nice job as Eddie's reluctant girl not knowing if she loves him and when she is confronted by Chris about her shady past with the mob falls apart. Taylor is trying to make her help him save Eddie telling her he will spill the beans about her back ground.

Raft needs Taylor to have a word with Taylor's kid brother rookie cop Steve Forrest. Forrest is the only witness against a murderer Peter Brocco that the Mob wants released. The Mob is willing to cough up 10 large for Forrest to have some memory issues.Taylor has a talk with his brother but Forrest is not interested. Taylor tells Forrest that the Mob is not inclined to take no for an answer. Taylor also has a word with Forrest's girl nightclub singer Janet Leigh. Taylor wants Leigh to suggest to Forrest that the 10 grand would let them get married and such. Forrest still refuses to play ball. Taylor has another meeting with Raft and Raft's Mob boss Robert F. Simon. Taylor asks why this particular man Peter Brocco is so important. He gets no answer to the question instead Raft tells Taylor that Forrest had best agree to the deal or else drastic measures will be taken. Taylor loses his cool which ends with Raft and himself exchanging punches with Raft taking a thumping. As does Raft's bodyguard Alan Hale Jr Taylor warns Raft and Simon that he will be most upset if anything happens to his brother.In the middle of all this is the alcoholic girlfriend of Raft Anne Francis. After Taylor pounds on Raft he takes it out on Francis after she cracks about the beating. The film now goes to a straight up vengeance picture as the Mob does indeed kill Forrest. Taylor goes off the rails as he goes after Brocco to find out what he has on Raft and company. Turns out Brocco had witnessed Raft and Simon do a murder years ago and has been blackmailing them since. Bodies are needless to say going to pile up along the way here. For a MGM film this is a real change of pace with plenty of violence etc. Robert Taylor is excellent as the bent cop as is Raft as the mobster. The screenplay is by Sydney Boehm from the novel of William P. McGivern. McGivern also wrote the novels for ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW THE BIG HEAT HELL ON FRISCO BAY and SHIELD FOR MURDER. All these novels were turned into films. ROGUE COP cinematographer John F Seitz was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Seitz was a favourite of Alan Ladd and worked with Ladd over 20 times. The 7 time Oscar nominated Seitz was a sure hand in the Noir genre with SUNSET BLVD THE LOST WEEKEND THIS GUN FOR HIRE CALCUTTA SAIGON THE BIG CLOCK CHICAGO DEADLINE APPOINTMENT WITH DANGER and DOUBLE INDEMNITY as examples of his work.".

The idea that an enforcement officer in this case a detective that loved the kind of life he could not afford working for the other side was a change of pace for the way audiences accepted them which was always a gamble on the part of the big studios.The film works because of the right elements came together to make this story credible and the appearance of Robert Taylor who excels as Chris Kelvaney. The actor was always a great presence on the screen as he proves in here. In spite of playing the bad guy the viewer does not feel repulsed by what he is trying to do. One keeps hoping for some goodness in the man and that is what happens after he sees how expendable he was. George Raft finally had a role that fitted his public image. He had been in a series of flops after his tough guy career at Warner Bros. Janet Leigh plays the sweet Karen Stephanson who never really got over of what she felt about Chris only to hook up with his brother.

First thought was in regard to the opening my the titles are very sparse and with no soundtrack music it really added to a gritty feel.

So I'm wondering what this womens role is in the film when she slips away after getting her fix than the dealer gets knifed by a rival dealer. WOW! This is one seedy town! Then the killer drives away but not before the good cop brother stops him because he's overparked by 15 minutes oh brother!. Cut to the next scene and a detective is walking into the police station and I could have sworn he was the same guy as the killer of course I'm watching this on a 20 TV so it's probably an easy mistake. Well I wont go on anymore about personal observations other than to say this is a great 12 of a movie and Taylor is looking really rogueish and bad even saying if you cross me again I'll break both your legs thats pretty tough talk! But in the second half we get the polished MGM treatment and there is some pretty lame action and a lot of dialog and Taylor turning a new leaf to be a good cop after all. Two things I noticed that had to be spoofed in the TV show Police Squad with Leslie Neilson the stooly at the newspaper store and the final gunfight where they are shooting in between trash cans and no one is getting hit! Remember Police Squad? I was kinda grinning watch this movie thinking about it. Two TV personalities I noticed The Skipper Alan Hale Jr as a heavy and The guy who was the Sheriff in Bonanza musta chose him based on his flatfoot character here. Anyway 610 because its a crime thriller which are my favorites next to good war flicks and Taylor talks the good talk he just doesn't walk the walk. Damn you'se lousy rogue cop you'se!".

First thought was in regard to the opening my the titles are very sparse and with no soundtrack music it really added to a gritty feel. Then we get to see one hell of a gritty city with a women who looked 50 but was probably in her 30's buying a narcotic from a dealer in the penny arcade boy I'm lucky enough to have seen one of must be the arcades with penny films in it at Grand Central Station NYC in the 1970's pretty cool gone by times.

Mayer had been forced out of MGM in favor of the more current Dore Schary who promised harder hitting films on subjects more topical than Andy Hardy.I guess it's easier to shift personnel than it is to change tradition because this crime drama has neither the look nor the feel of the real thing. In short the movie's an antiseptic treatment of a seamy subject and all Robert Taylor's tedious tough talk or George Raft's gangster reputation can't muddy up the sheen. Note Taylor's impeccable suits the glamor girls in highclass outfits the uncluttered studio sets and especially the highkey lighting that robs the visuals of any hint of ambiguity. Unfortunately director Roy Rowland brings next to nothing to the project filming in the most pedestrian style possible. This is a film that cries out for at least something of a noir approach to bring out the menace and moral conflict implicit in the screenplay. Note too how many punches are pulled from the final ambulance scene to the redeemed bad girls to the fistfight with muscular Vince Edwards as a matter of fact the movie could have used more of Edwards' convincing style. Note in particular how the killing of the two innocents is done off camera depriving the drama of the kind of visual impact it so clearly needs. Simply nibbling around the edges of evil with an unsmiling exmatine idol is not enough.Too bad a studio like RKO or Warner Bros. of the 40's didn't get hold of the property first. They could have done it up right. MGM may have been great for lavish productions like costume drama and musicals but crime drama simply did not fit their style. And not even Dore Schary could change that.".

George Raft also is quite effective as a real scumbag mobster who says what he means to the point with little in the way of small talk. Janet Leigh doesn't have to stretch too much..it's her looks this film is aiming for..that and to poke away at Chris' heart. She's the one who he can speak to as the world caves in around him..when both the police and the mob turn their cold shoulders to him. Sure it's of his own making but that's what makes the role so juicy for Taylor..it's not black  white at all but all sorts of shades of grey. The film is ultimately about redemption setting things straight and accepting the life you've lived with all the problems that capsize because of it.

It pushes the idea that there was little to no crime back then. Well if film noirs are any indication there was not only crime but corruption and all manner of sleaze.

Like many entries in the genre this depicts gangsters corrupt cops and blonde women. While it lacks the sheer grittiness of Kiss of Death or In a Lonely Place  probably because MGM was the studio that turned out the likes of The Wizard of Oz so a crime picture was a bit of a challenge for them  it still packs a punch. I found the most effective scene to be where Janet Leigh's character takes Robert Taylor's character to task for using the case to advance his career. You don't usually expect the elegant Leigh to be that forceful but it shows her versatility as an actress.It's not a masterpiece but worth seeing.

Big city police corruption and the Kefauver TV hearings on organized crime were hotbutton headlinemaking issues in the early 1950s and they were inspiration to writer William P. McGivern who turned all the hoopla into a topical romanclef trilogy THE BIG HEAT ROGUE COP and SHIELD FOR MURDER. This one's the weakest of the three thanks to the MGM gloss given to an ageing star's vehicle and what could have been hardhitting and gritty became something of a velvet glove with no iron fist beneath unfortunately. It was distracting to notice how pristine the inner city streets were and even the lowliest character had a spacious and wellappointed abode.

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Taylor stars as a crooked cop who's caught between a rock and a hard place when racketeer George Raft tells him his idealistic kid brother rookie Steve Forrest must recant his testimony in a murder investigation... Big city police corruption and the Kefauver TV hearings on organized crime were hotbutton headlinemaking issues in the early 1950s and they were inspiration to writer William P. McGivern who turned all the hoopla into a topical romanclef trilogy THE BIG HEAT ROGUE COP and SHIELD FOR MURDER. This one's the weakest of the three thanks to the MGM gloss given to an ageing star's vehicle and what could have been hardhitting and gritty became something of a velvet glove with no iron fist beneath unfortunately. It was distracting to notice how pristine the inner city streets were and even the lowliest character had a spacious and wellappointed abode. It was nice seeing Vince Edwards in an early role but the standout is Anne Francis as Raft's tipsy moll a sister under the mink to Gloria Grahame in THE BIG HEAT.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another of those films from the 1960's that have apparently disappeared into the black hole that ought to have been reserved for some of the bigbudget trash being made nowadays. It harks back to an era when halfway intelligent scripting and depth of characterization were deemed more important than braincurdling eye candy and mindless special effects. And although not exactly what I would call a classic it is nonetheless worthy of remembrance at least among those of us elderly enough to remember it. Some of what follows may possibly be a bit of a spoiler if there are any copies of this movie left to spoil so be ye warned before reading further.The film is based on an 1811 novella by Heinrich von Kleist which in turn was based on the exploits of an actual fifteenthcentury German horse trader named Hans Kohlhase. The story in a nutshell runs more or less as follows. On his way to market to sell his horses Kohlhaas is intercepted by the minions of a nobleman named Tronka. He is informed that he is trespassing on Tronka's land must pay a toll in order to continue and winds up being forced to leave two of his horses behind as a surety. Upon returning to reclaim the horses he finds that they have been maltreated and starved. Outraged he seeks justice through official channels but is stonewalled at every turn by the prevailing oldboy network. At length his indignation erupts into violence. Brushing off advice to just let it go he takes up arms gathers a band of similarly disenfranchised people and starts an insurrection. In the end of course his insurrection is crushed he is captured and condemned to die by one of the cruelest forms of execution ever devised to be broken on the wheel.Although fairly faithful to its original sources the film does have a tendency to portray the character as a revolutionary and at times even as a bit of a patriot and folk hero rather than as the mere vengeful victim of injustice and local rabblerouser that the real Kohlhase probably was. Nonetheless the essential point of the story is not lost.David Warner gives a typically intense performance as Kohlhaas. Whatever the character's motives may have been the final scene of the film is unforgettable. Just before his execution Kohlhaas learns that his case has finally been settled in his favor. His horses are returned to him in good condition he says his goodbyes to them and sets them free. As he is hoisted aloft upon the wheel broken and dying he sees them galloping away across the plains and smiles contentedly.The story of Michael Kohlhaas has certainly had some impact on later films. E. L. Doctorow was sufficiently inspired by it to adapt much of its thematic material to his novel as well as the 1981 film Ragtime recasting the character of Kohlhaas as a black ragtime musician named Coalhouse Walker who reacts similarly to an unredressed injury by a racist white policeman. And one can only wonder whether Mel Gibson was in any way influenced by it in his popular retelling of the story of William Wallace. Presumably Mel would know.".

It was nominated at Cannes and lead actor David Warner also got a German Film Award nomination for his portrayal of the title character. However the by far most known actor or actress in this film is Anna Karina who plays the female with the most screen time not really a lead though as her screen time is still limited and ends quickly due to the tragic story on some occasions in here. You will also find Anita Pallenberg in here that worked with Schlndorff on other occasions too and even a Bond villain is in this one or the actor who portrays him even if not the most known for sure. And Rolling Stones member Keith Richards has a tiny performance too which surprised me a bit. However Schlndorff is known for working with actors from all kinds of countries and making films in all kinds of languages so the multicultural aspect here is not that convincing.This is the story of Michael Kohlhaas a simple man with as we find out an enormous willpower and sense for justice as he starts bringing hell upon an official who cheated him out of two healthy horses. I remember we read this Kleist novel at school and since then I remember liking it. The story just is that good and there is a lot of depth in here that will inevitably make you think. I definitely prefer the first half of this film over the second but both are pretty good which is thanks to Schlndorff's vision but also Warner's range. The rest of the cast are all fairly good too. The film makes powerful statements about the legal system centuries ago and it is a great subject for discussion up until to which point Kohlhaas was in the right and an innocent man. I also really like the ending here in which justice is restored and the scene with the two horses running into freedom symbolizing justice maybe symbolizing both judgments equally even is truly powerful. This story has been turned into a movie on other occasions too the most known being the one starring Mads Mikkelsen from not too long ago and that one is as good as this one here even if the approaches are pretty different. All in all I very much recommend this color film from half a century ago maybe more already depending on when you read the review. It's definitely not a film for everyone but if you manage to warm up to it you will have a great time. Having read the novel is not essential here to like or even love the film. I'm not too big on all of Schlndorff's early works but this one here is certainly a success. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't look back baby says a man who knows his Gideon Bible You know what happened to Lot's wife. But her fate is mild compared to the torments of two peopleand a third they draw into their webwho can never stop looking back to something that happened when they were children. What connects this melodrama with noir films like the perfectly named OUT OF THE PAST THE KILLERS in which the hero explains that he is doomed because I did something wrong once and many others is the theme that one mistake one reckless moment can seal your fate forever.The three children are Sam Masterson a streetwise kid from the wrong side of the tracks Walter O'Neil a timid obedient boy whose father is ambitious for him and Martha Ivers the orphaned heiress to a steel mill who lives miserably with her aunt Judith Anderson in Mrs. Danvers mode. On the fateful night all three are in the house when Martha driven over the edge her aunt both insults her dead father a mill hand and beats her kitten! whacks her aunt with her own cane and sends her tumbling to her death at the foot of a grand staircase. Walter's father sees his chance and holding the threat of exposure over Martha's head takes control of her fortune and later forces her to marry Walter. When eighteen years later Sam who ran away night of the killing on a circus train blows back into town Martha and Walter fear he has returned to blackmail them with his knowledge Walter also fears rightly that Martha and Sam still carry a torch for each other. The highlycharged triangle becomes a quadrangle with the addition of Toni Marachek a young woman just out of jail whom Sam picks up and befriends.THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS is a conventional studio product lacking the expressive camerawork or atmospheric settings that noir usually offers. Bombastic music deafens each emotional climax women go to sleep with their glossy masks of makeup intact obvious backprojection and poorly staged action sequences make the film look like a staged play. None of this really diminishes the movie however since its power comes from a smart script especially from the complexity of characters and relationships. There is a strong affinity between Sam and Martha both tough and poised and hard to read while Toni and Walter are more vulnerable and obvious driven by the simple motivation of love. But by the end it's clear that Martha and Walter have become twins warped by their shared guilt they both took part in prosecuting an innocent man who was hanged for the murder while Sam and Toni share a fundamental decency and the capacity to look ahead to a fresh start.Nice girl Toni is there to provide eye candy and a potential happy ending for Sam but she gets a lot of screen time too much in fact for her onenote character. Fans of Lizabeth Scott won't agree but unless you find her particularly alluring her scenes get a little tedious. Van Heflin is easygoing as Sam the selfconfident gambler who thinks he's seen it all until he encounters Martha and Walter's toxic marriage. Heflin though rather homely brings a likable raffishness to the part and his casual opportunism keeps you guessing about what he'll do next.Kirk Douglas was never cast as such a weakling again this was his debut film but the mismatch works brilliantly. His intensity and powerful presence make his abject character fiercely compelling instead of merely pathetic. A less imposing actor would come off as just a milquetoast Douglas's manliness adds an interesting touch of perversity to his plight. His weakness is inside. Douglas captures perfectly Walter's insecurity and helpless jealousy his cowardly use of his power through Martha's influence he has become District Attorney his lame attempts to project confidence his dependence on alcohol to salve his humiliation. He's not dumb he knows that Martha would never have married him without the threat of exposure but he clings to his feeble hold on her because he loves her desperately. You can't help feeling sorry for him especially when Martha accuses him and his father of coming after her money like leeches and he cries out All I wanted was you! Then there's Martha the mysterious center of the film. Barbara Stanwyck has an amazing ability to draw the audience to her side and at the same time make one's blood run cold. She's in her prime here as a glamorous businesswoman with steely satisfaction she shows off the improvements she made to the factory all by myself who conveys total control yet feels trapped in a life she loathes. Her hardness is at once glorious and chilling she controls her husband like a cruel hypnotist. When she breaks down in tears and tells Sam that she has been the victim all along powerless and frightened like Sam you're moved but not quite sure you believe her. Even at the end the ambiguity is unresolved how much is Martha the victim how much the villain? Walter says it's no one's fault it's just the way things are it's what people will do to get the things they want. The scenes between Martha and Walter are the highlight of the film saturated with a poisonous mixture of love and hate tinged with sadomasochism Even pain at your hands Walter sighs when she puts iodine on his cut hand. This pact with desire fear greed and guilt is the spectacle of ruinthe Sodom and Gomorrahthat prompts Sam to warn Toni Don't look back baby don't ever look back.".

When eighteen years later Sam who ran away night of the killing on a circus train blows back into town Martha and Walter fear he has returned to blackmail them with his knowledge Walter also fears rightly that Martha and Sam still carry a torch for each other. The highlycharged triangle becomes a quadrangle with the addition of Toni Marachek a young woman just out of jail whom Sam picks up and befriends.THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS is a conventional studio product lacking the expressive camerawork or atmospheric settings that noir usually offers. Bombastic music deafens each emotional climax women go to sleep with their glossy masks of makeup intact obvious backprojection and poorly staged action sequences make the film look like a staged play. None of this really diminishes the movie however since its power comes from a smart script especially from the complexity of characters and relationships. There is a strong affinity between Sam and Martha both tough and poised and hard to read while Toni and Walter are more vulnerable and obvious driven by the simple motivation of love. But by the end it's clear that Martha and Walter have become twins warped by their shared guilt they both took part in prosecuting an innocent man who was hanged for the murder while Sam and Toni share a fundamental decency and the capacity to look ahead to a fresh start.Nice girl Toni is there to provide eye candy and a potential happy ending for Sam but she gets a lot of screen time too much in fact for her onenote character. Fans of Lizabeth Scott won't agree but unless you find her particularly alluring her scenes get a little tedious. Van Heflin is easygoing as Sam the selfconfident gambler who thinks he's seen it all until he encounters Martha and Walter's toxic marriage. Heflin though rather homely brings a likable raffishness to the part and his casual opportunism keeps you guessing about what he'll do next.Kirk Douglas was never cast as such a weakling again this was his debut film but the mismatch works brilliantly. His intensity and powerful presence make his abject character fiercely compelling instead of merely pathetic. A less imposing actor would come off as just a milquetoast Douglas's manliness adds an interesting touch of perversity to his plight. His weakness is inside. Douglas captures perfectly Walter's insecurity and helpless jealousy his cowardly use of his power through Martha's influence he has become District Attorney his lame attempts to project confidence his dependence on alcohol to salve his humiliation. He's not dumb he knows that Martha would never have married him without the threat of exposure but he clings to his feeble hold on her because he loves her desperately. You can't help feeling sorry for him especially when Martha accuses him and his father of coming after her money like leeches and he cries out All I wanted was you! Then there's Martha the mysterious center of the film. Barbara Stanwyck has an amazing ability to draw the audience to her side and at the same time make one's blood run cold. She's in her prime here as a glamorous businesswoman with steely satisfaction she shows off the improvements she made to the factory all by myself who conveys total control yet feels trapped in a life she loathes. Her hardness is at once glorious and chilling she controls her husband like a cruel hypnotist. When she breaks down in tears and tells Sam that she has been the victim all along powerless and frightened like Sam you're moved but not quite sure you believe her. Even at the end the ambiguity is unresolved how much is Martha the victim how much the villain? Walter says it's no one's fault it's just the way things are it's what people will do to get the things they want. The scenes between Martha and Walter are the highlight of the film saturated with a poisonous mixture of love and hate tinged with sadomasochism Even pain at your hands Walter sighs when she puts iodine on his cut hand. This pact with desire fear greed and guilt is the spectacle of ruinthe Sodom and Gomorrahthat prompts Sam to warn Toni Don't look back baby don't ever look back.";

There we meet as teenagers three of the story's principals Unruly Martha making yet another attempt to run away from her wealthy rigid aunt Judith Anderson her streeturchin buddy Sammy and prissy schoolteacher's son Walter.

He meets up with the fourth main character Lizabeth Scott who not unlike himself has been knocked about she's a jailbird.  When the police lock her up for violating parole he pays a visit to his old friend Walter Kirk Douglas in his debut now the district attorney to secure her release.

He takes heavyhanded measures to defend himself blackmailing Scott into framing Heflin.  But hasn't reckoned with the resourcefulness of his adversary  or with the wilfulness of his wife.But the story is really plotted along romantic coordinates whose intersections are punctuated by Miklos Rozsa's throbbing score.  Douglas loves Stanwyck who really loves Heflin while Scott loves Heflin who loves her back but still has unfinished business with Stanwyck no wonder Douglas drinks  nobody loves him.  And in the rondelay of turnabouts and betrayals or seeming betrayals The Strange Love of Martha Ivers slips perilously close to soap opera.  Its stately pace and prosperous look give it a dated ponderous feel quite unlike the rough sleekness of film noir though there's an unmistakable echo of Double Indemnity  Stanwyck's performance as Martha Ivers reworks  hers as Phyllis Dietrichson right down to the concluding lovedeath tableau.  But while occasionally cumbersome The Strange Love of Martha Ivers stands on its own as an overwrought obsessive drama with a very topical acknowledgment of the insulation that money and power can buy and of the moral and social corruption that inflexibly comes as part of the package.

The film has a good resolution as crime doesn't pay or so this is the clear message that comes across. Sam at the end is seen driving away from the town with Toni. Barbara Stanwyck makes a creation of Martha Ivers. This was a role tailormade for her. She has a great time playing this woman who doesn't know what she wants whether to stay with the weakling Walter or to try to get back to Sam. Van Heflin as Sam is splendid.

	schema:reviewBody "Martha Ivers a young girl under the guardianship of her grandmother played by Judith Anderson tries often to run away but is brought back every time. Grandma is one powerful autocratic and twisted old woman. One night after Grandma kills the girl's cat she kills her. Her tutor's son sees the deed and now has blackmail power. Young Martha also thinks someone else has seen the deed young Sam Masterson who she has a yen for. He actually skedaddled before witnessing anything.Flash forward several years. Now everyone is grown up. Barbara Stanwyck is Martha and she's married the tutor's son played by Kirk Douglas in his film debut. He's also the District Attorney. And the main action of the film begins as grown up Sam Masterson who is played by Van Heflin comes back to his home town. He's treated rather strangely and it takes him a while to figure out why.Life has a funny way of working out and Stanwyck has essentially turned into Anderson. Heflin is no real hero here either he's quite willing to engage in some blackmail. But he's redeemed somewhat by the love of another girl from the wrong side of the tracks Lizabeth Scott. The film is memorable for two reasons the power packed performance of Barbara Stanwyck and the debut of Kirk Douglas. This is a choice Barbara Stanwyck role a powerful ruthless woman who'll do anything to keep and protect what's hers. It's odd that Kirk Douglas makes his debut as a weakling but even stranger that the dynamism that is his screen trademark is so well hidden in this portrayal. This part isn't exactly Spartacus. But Kirk is one capable player.Heflin and Scott do well in their respective parts but even though she's only on the screen for the first 15 minutes the one you won't forget is Judith Anderson. Seeing Stanwyck with her machinations later on you wonder what must have made Anderson such a twisted human being.The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers is a well plotted melodrama that does credit to all involved.".

She hates her aunt Mrs. Ivers Judith Anderson and while in her room with her tutor's son Walter O'Neil and Sam later the power runs out and she asks Sam to bring her cat back to the room. When Sam is trying to catch the cat in the dark her aunt comes to the staircase and Sam hides himself. Mrs. Ivers hits the cat with a stick Martha pushes her in the staircase and Mrs. Ivers dies. Martha lies to Mr. O'Neil and tells that a man had killed her aunt and Walter confirms the lie. Eighteen years later Sam Van Heflin is driving in the road nearby Iverstown but he does not pay attention in a curve and hits his car in a post. He brings his car to a body shop in the industrial town and while waiting for the repair he meets the gorgeous Antonia Marachek Lizabeth Scott in front of the house where he lived. When Antonia loses her bus to her hometown she accepts the invitation of Sam for a drink and later she goes to his hotel. On the next morning Antonia is arrested for violation of probation and Sam decides to pay a visit to Walter O'Neil Kirk Douglas now a successful district attorney and married with the wealthy Martha Ivers Barbara Stanwyck to ask him to release Antonia. When Walter sees Sam he believes Sam wants to blackmail Martha and him and his misunderstanding leads the former friends to tragic revelations about the fatal night and discloses dirty secrets about the couple Martha and Walter.The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is an amazing underrated filmnoir. The flawless story is excellent disclosed in an adequate pace and developing perfectly the despicable characters. The black  white cinematography is magnificent and the fatal character of Barbara Stanwyck is one of the most dangerous and manipulative villains I have ever seen in a filmnoir. Kirk Douglas is great in his debut but Van Heflin and Lizabeth Scott steals the movie with their performances and chemistry. My vote is ten.Title Brazil O Tempo No Apaga The Time Does not Erase".

	schema:reviewBody "With all of the schemes intrigue sexual undertones and murder this is a very rare and so incredibly original postwartime movie.Many have cited this as the inspiration for the much later 'NeoNoir' alongside another Stanwyck classic 'Double Indemnity'.Unlike the latter feature this film is not filled with cold and brooding images.The film starts off dramatically with a strong cameo by Judith 'Mrs. Danvers' Anderson. The teenaged actors that portray Stanwyck's Heflin's and Douglas's characters as youths deliver very moving performances.They capture the tension of murderess Martha's wicked deed. The teenaged actors pull off the difficult task of linking their characters with the mature characters a great start to this bold film.Personally Barbara Stanwyck is the best of the 'Golden Hollywood' queens and displays why with this subtle yet sly performance. Unlike many of the other criminals she portrayed Barbara is coldblooded rather than hysterically evil and occasionally reveals the blood that boils behind her gray eyes.Her lethal attraction to Heflin is passionate at the same time as chilling. It is a true triumph that the colourful relationship between the two sizzles on the screen without the use of lush colourful cinematography! The black and white colour highlights the gloom of the piece.Van Heflin swaggers through the film giving a satisfactory performance as the wronged kid 'from the wrong side of the tracks'. Many have praised Lizabeth Scott for her sultry performance as the equally dubious Toni Marachek. This is true. She is a worthy foe for Stanwyck and in some scenes does steal the attention away from her costars.Now many have criticised Kirk Douglas's performance as overacted and unconvincing. I have to disagree. Perhaps for many audiences it is too much of a shock to see the usually rugged manly Douglas playing an unstable Daddy's boy manipulated by his wife and cowardly towards the end. It is a difficult role but Douglas retains the wimpish quality of Walter from start to finish also depending on the actions and control of his unbalanced wife.Towering performances a gloomy soundtrack and dark cinematography make this feature dazzle as one of the best 'film noir' genre produced in the 1940s.Lizabeth Scott in particular gives a commanding performance which generates interest glamour and suspicion. These are the stem of the themes to this great film.Brilliant as it was 59 years ago!".

The viewer is pulled in so many directions and because of the moral complexity I found myself pulling for the corrupt characters despite their flaws. Stanwyck was amazing. This was my first noir with Van Heflin and I thought he was just spot on with his performance. A very young Kirk Douglas chews up the scenery with an over the top performance that none the less works perfectly for his character. Lizabeth Scott as Heflin's secondary love interest was also excellent. I am amazed that this film in the noir genre has not gotten more attention. It's really a work of art and stands up as relevant and moving 65 years after it's release. Awesome movie!".

This strange soap operafilm noir rates with the best of his workhe pulls off a complicated and rich drama with a sense of ease that belies the disparate elements involved including making the opening scenes in the 1920s mesh with the main plot in the 1940s. It works beautifully with great writing and acting and a rich miseenscene. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Martha Ivers presents a peculiar plot tightly constructed with cross purposes throwing you and reinterpretations of events needed on the fly. We have powerful woman played by already legendary Barbara Stanwyck in the kind of role that she was best at and about a weak man with a heart her husband Kirk Douglas the really sympathetic side of the actor in his first movie role. These two seem to be the stable core of the movie. But far more involving and impressive is the main character in the role of his life Van Heflin as Sam Masterson. His likable ease with a hidden disturbing past and an inquiring open mind about the future define the best of the film noir archetypes. An ordinary man with depth someone we can relate to or want to be friends with. In the movie he becomes friends with the fourth leading role played by a noir fixture Lizabeth Scott and though she is the stiffest of the four she fills out the group with great balance. She is after all the reality that our main man prefers whatever the temptations of high life in the small city of Iverstown.What else is there? A great script great acting great visuals well paced and intelligently edited with economy and continuity. Does it have great social meaning? Is there a disturbing or revelatory core here? No maybe not. But then again just being thoroughly drawn in moved and made to consider this kind of situation from Masterson's point of view is a thrill of great cinematic fiction.".

This is listed as a crime movie a film noir but at times is much more of a melodrama than anything else. It's a little too talky for my tastes yet I still enjoyed it because the acting is topshelf the dialog is fun and you get involved with the characters. The film could have used more action. With the 'soap' angle it reminded me a bit of another melodramatic noir Mildred Pierce except the latter is a better film.This was Douglas' first major role and he handled it well. It's no surprise he went on to be big star. I never thought Scott was all that beautiful but she looked very good here the best I've seen her.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie isn't long so much as it is slow. But it's not flatfooted slow because the viewer is pulled along by the unfolding of events and characters. The movie pays off especially at the end so stick with it.Perhaps modern movies are too fast. It's nice to watch a slow movie for a change after so many hyperpaced movies. Like many old noir movies there is lots of atmosphere a sense of place and time that is more interesting today as that era fades from memory. The slow pace gives you time to savor it and to observe the interactions. Gradually we get a sense of the true character of the leads as they are tested by circumstance. The results are not entirely predictable right up to the end. The plot is fairly intricate and integral with the characters something we don't see enough of these days. While I wouldn't say there are any holes in the plot there are one or two premises that seem a bit off the biggest that the DA would be allowed to try a case he was a witness to. But perhaps rules were looser back then.Speaking of the DA this is Kirk Douglas' first film role and he knocks it out of the park. Every performance is impeccable including the secondary actors Lizabeth Scott and Darryl Hickman. One of the characteristics of noir films is moral ambiguity. Here it is difficult to figure out who the good guys and bad guys are at least until the end. Their true characters unfold slowly.This is a director's movie much of the credit should go to director Lewis Milestone for making everything just right. This is also a film connoisseur's movie an undiscovered gem for someone who has seen everything. Why it is so unknown is a puzzle. Perhaps it was the timing just after the end of WWII and being an especially dark noir unlike say The Maltese Falcon which was leavened by a surprising amount of wry humor. But I think the biggest reason is that it simply isn't a movie most people will want to watch several times partly because it is too dark and also because it is so dependent on the ending. The classic noir films can be savored many times over the years.Nevertheless I highly recommend film lovers see The Strange Love of Marth Ivers at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is just a few hues short of an unsung masterpiece in my view. It begins as a rainy Gothic tale set in a big mansion in the 20's about a young girl living with an overbearing rich aunt who does not approve of the boy she loves then shifts into modern noir with the participants grown up some of them dead.The story has three main characters experiencing cyclical lives and amazingly effective aligning between where these people dream they are and traces of the karmas they are roped by.One is the woman she used to be so spirited and passionate as a girl but has grown up to be as scheming as calculating as the despised aunt. She has married for convenience has multiplied her aunt's financial empire her husband is a DA being groomed for governor all these things including town and husband she controls with a haughty air. She still yearns not to be an Ivers to be a Smith after her father who was a worker a man very much like the boy she loved and disappeared that fateful night twenty years ago.The other is the DA husband the bookish child married to the young heiress of a fortune and owing everything he is to her. He's grown to be a man of standing a man of the people except he cannot talk to them he's so crippled by anxiety he has to start the day with a bottle of scotch.The third is that boy who was run off that night the starcrossed true love the soulmate. He returns to Iverstown after twenty years is stuck there by an accident of fate because he looked back at a sign to see if the roads didn't really play a trick on him the gods of the crossroads. While there he ignites dormant passions deeply buried secrets from a dark past.There is a shared lie between them except only two of the three are in on it. The lie is a false narrative that was invented to hide murder an innocent framed for it and sent to the chair karmas in motion is that because of that lie both participants have grown to be trapped in a world as dreamed by their guardians having inherited the sin. They covertly despise each other and the dream. The one who was not part of it gets to walk away in the end having lost a father for going away in the first place.So if you are looking for the ordinary tropes of noir this may seem a little slight there is a cunning femme fatale but the story is thick in coincidental detail. It is not as visually inventive as Welles or even Siodmak.But this is the thing coincidence. It's revealed plainly in the midst of deceit and doublecrossing the woman's whole life is like a dream.The strange love of Martha Ivers is that she loved a boy who leaped from a window one rainy night and never came back. The beauty of it and extremely intricate design is that each of the three participants has to cling to an image of that night and each chooses to dream a life from that image dictated by what conscience was set in motion each dream slightly different since perspectives that night differed. All three are characters in the same story naturally since the story was between them that night the most clever stroke is that we have no way to know who is the dreamer recalling the others in the long restless journey into night that is the soul's atonement for sin.Is Martha dreaming up being abandoned by love once more payment for having settled for the aunt's money and convenient marriage? Is the man visiting again the town in a way that reassures he left nothing behind that is worth sleepless nights of doubt?Subsequent filmmakers who built a life from noir  Rivette Ruiz Lynch  would give us more explicit hallucination to inhabit more subtle dreamers of internal story but as far as primary texts go this is second to none.".

The film exudes star power  featuring the legendary Barbara Stanwyck the chronically underappreciated Lizabeth Scott veteran Van Heflin and a very young Kirk Douglas. And the talent is generally well used. Douglas' role  that of an alcoholic coward  is a little bit of a stretch for him and he sometimes overdoes it. And the script force's Van Heflin into a few scenes which are inconsistent with his generally good interpretation of the protagonist.

Attracted to his kindness Toni attaches herself to Sam readily and begins to develop romantic expectations. The chemistry between Scott and Heflin is very good and their budding romance is entirely believable despite its pithy evolution.Sam wanders back into his home town after more than a decade's absence and looks up two of his childhood friends from the other side of the tracks  Martha Stanwyck a nearmiss childhood sweetheart who has inherited about half of the town including its only major industry and Walter O'Neil Douglas her weakwilled social climbing coward of a husband who has become the town's D.A. The last night this trio was together in their teenage years Martha's aunt was murdered by Martha herself and Martha and Walter now fear Sam's reason for returning.Martha Ivers is one of the betterplayed psychos of 20th century film. Her selfloathing and conniving selfinterest are only matched by her more or less complete inconsistency. Martha and her husband Walter are two very unhappy rich people whose lives have been set adrift by history and circumstance. Ironically Toni and Sam recognized by society as borderline criminals though drifters are mostly wellanchored grounded and centered. This is only one of many ironies that this film could have explored more powerfully had it been written as well as it was conceived.Jack Patrick's writing essentially tries to do too much within the film's short running time. He does not sacrifice characterization or plot and the director and editor do a very nice job of creating a fluid pace for the film but the shifting sands of a couple of the lead characters' personalities can be a little jarring at times.Despite this minor problem the film is a solidly entertaining and well made noir melodrama with a great cast and an excellent premise. More than many other noir entries this is a film which is capable of inducing thoughtful consideration since it is not just a story of manipulation tragedy and murder.".

	schema:headline " You were looking for trouble but it was a good kind of trouble.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start with a bit of trivia  as I write this Kirk Douglas and Lizabeth Scott are both still alive and into their Nineties. I'd say that was pretty good staying power.This one surprised me like a lot of public domain films often do. Barbara Stanwyck heads the cast of what turns out to be a colorful group of dysfunctional characters. It's only when the picture's over and you begin to analyze some of the plot elements that the story turns out to be somewhat contrived but it's pretty riveting during it's run time. The early scene when the young Martha Ivers Janis Wilson conks her aunt Judith Anderson on the head with a cane looked rather unrealistic. It looked like she held back for fear of actually hurting Miss Anderson and the bump looked like one a pro wrestler would throw.The other thing that bothered me was that whole business about convicting and executing an innocent man of the Aunt's murder. Why? If the original story of a huge intruder in the mansion in the dark of night was sufficient for the authorities why manufacture this result? Unless it was for the express purpose of demonstrating what a couple of sordid louts Martha Stanwyck and her husband Kirk Douglas were. In that case it worked.Van Heflin was pretty good here.

	onyx:emotionText "Let me start with a bit of trivia  as I write this Kirk Douglas and Lizabeth Scott are both still alive and into their Nineties. I'd say that was pretty good staying power.This one surprised me like a lot of public domain films often do. Barbara Stanwyck heads the cast of what turns out to be a colorful group of dysfunctional characters. It's only when the picture's over and you begin to analyze some of the plot elements that the story turns out to be somewhat contrived but it's pretty riveting during it's run time. The early scene when the young Martha Ivers Janis Wilson conks her aunt Judith Anderson on the head with a cane looked rather unrealistic. It looked like she held back for fear of actually hurting Miss Anderson and the bump looked like one a pro wrestler would throw.The other thing that bothered me was that whole business about convicting and executing an innocent man of the Aunt's murder. Why? If the original story of a huge intruder in the mansion in the dark of night was sufficient for the authorities why manufacture this result? Unless it was for the express purpose of demonstrating what a couple of sordid louts Martha Stanwyck and her husband Kirk Douglas were. In that case it worked.Van Heflin was pretty good here.

Her dye is already cast by the time the old boyhood friend shows up again. You only get to actual love with Sam and Toni or especially Sam for Toni. He's a sensitive and caring fellow. Martha needed his influence for that reason. Maybe he could have helped her be human had he been able to stay around early on.I had trouble focusing on the unfoldings at the beginning due to recognition of the aunt Judith Anderson. Why that's Mrs. Danvers from Rebecca. Same creepy type of woman.Possible spoiler paragraph It is interesting to watch this again with what you learn from the first viewing. About Sam that is and what he doesn't know. You watch it the first time with everyone thinking that Sam is back to cash in on what he knows about the aunt's demise. You know better than that that the return is accidental and the revisit spontaneous. But you have no reason not to think he saw what happened on the stairs. Then he seems pretty indifferent to the event as he reacquaints. You think well he doesn't care. But then we learn that he left the house before it happened. Now watch it again with that in mind.Everyone notices Kirk Douglas. He's so attractive you wish for him to be a more virile character. Didn't have to wait very long for that to come about. There were a couple more weak guy roles and then he took off with mastery. And a case could be made for it requiring ability to play a weak person as well as a stronger one.Van Heflin  Something very attractive about him. He was almost always a guy with inner stability aiding the balance of those around him usually women. To me that inner quality WAS his attractiveness. He's the one that could always walk into a mess and immediately start sorting it out. Lizabeth Scott had a certain strong allure that seemed could have gone best with a stronger character. I don't have much patience with the pathetic drama she dishes out here. Those weepy tragic type dames showed up a lot in the streetwise pictures of the era and I always found them irritating. Usually they have some guy like Heflin trying to bolster them up because some bully type is grinding them down. If you ask me that type is asking to be ground. Good grief give it a rest sister I say to the screen. Oh well nowadays we can fast forward.Barbara Stanwyck is at the height of her beauty here or maybe one of her more glamorous roles. She seemed slated to be an evil woman or remembered most for those roles. In contrast I recall her in an early picture called The Mad Miss Manton in which she is an airhead bounding around all over the place. That was really enjoyable but it was a type that she would naturally move away from to go on to other things. But she was really fun to watch in that.If you don't mind walking on the dark side a bit this is an interesting one to watch.".

UTheatre has performed in art festivals around the world  New York London Moscow as well as numerous in cities in Asia Europe and the two American continents.This movie is first and foremost about UTheatre. One approach could be to dramatize the history of this arts group. Instead the Hong Kong movie makers chose to fit it into a gangsters' yarn for reasons that are painfully obvious. The gangster story is banal and too drawn out. But I do give credit to the movie makers for devoting more than half of the movie to UTheatre in the middle section when the protagonist a kingpin's son is in exile in Taiwan and becomes a new student in UTheatre. As well both founders Liu Rouyu and Huang Chihchun are in the movie playing themselves together with other members of the group giving the movie authenticity.While I am not particularly impressed with the script the acting is fine. Jaycee Chan looking as like his father Jackie Chan as I've ever seen him in a movie handles his character's spiritual transformation reasonably well. Lovely Angelica Lee among the best Chinese actresses today is not even challenged in her role. The Hong Kong gangster movie veterans have all delivered  Tony Leung Kafai Roy Cheung Yiuyeung Josie Ho Kenneth Tsang Kong.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Drummer";
	schema:reviewBody "Anything with drums and I am there. The beats of drums in any music always appeal to me no prizes for guessing I'm a drum and bass fan because I suppose it's fairly easy to express your mood to beats and this expression can be done through anything that gives you that satisfying clang and more so when you need to vent frustrations out in a relatively safe manner by hitting out at something inanimate without personal injury of course.And I like it too as it doesn't come across in a threatening manner to those who want to pick up the instrument. I mean there are no complicated chords complex notes intimidating keys or confusing hand eye leg coordination that calls for dexterity. What it has essentially is a pulled canvas a set of drumsticks and calls for strength intensity and endurance as you express the beats of any rhythm within you.The Drummer is the latest movie to premiere from Hong Kong written and directed by Kenneth Bi starring Jaycee Chan Tony The Lover Leung and Li Sinjie. Jaycee has been particularly busy this latter half of the year with 3 releases including this one from action in Invisible Target to arthouse drama in Where The Sun Rises and now a movie about Zen Drummers. Somehow I find that he possesses this charming quality that comes across as easy going a little naive but yet having no lack of serious acting chops when the time calls for it. With the few films of his that I've seen save for the forgettable debut efforts like the Twins Effect I'm quite impressed and would definitely be in the queue for more in future to see how he would mature into the different roles that come along his way.In The Drummer Jaycee plays Sid in the titular role and somewhat a departure from his earlier characters at least initially. A pompous prick who drums for his rock band he gets into the pants of a mistress of a triad boss Kenneth Tsang and without saying gets himself into deep trouble. In trying to shield his son Dad Tony Leung in yet another typical hot headed gangland leader role we're familiar with from the Election movies sends him packing to a rural part of Taiwan to weather the expected storm of triad displeasure and in this exile Sid comes across the training grounds of the Zen Drummers.It's a basic story about the coming of age of an impatient youth as he tries hard to gain acceptance to drum for the Drummers who are of course in no need for any impetuous hothead. And you know the drill from here where there's a clash of cultures and philosophies pertaining to drumming and in teaching him the ways of their own we get plenty of wax on wax off moments as virtues like patience discipline hard work perseverance younameitthemovie'sgotit get imparted and appreciated by the newbie transforming before your eyes from selfish individual to a valuable team player.For the most parts the movie develops at a rather predictable manner with near clichd sub plots but the appeal of the characters made it quite enjoyable to sit through despite its run time of almost 2 hours split between dramatic moments and those embodying Zen like teachings and quiet contemplative pieces. I thought that the movie like the virtue it's imparting requires patience in order to savor the goods of a delightful performance as typical stories of such nature you'd come to expect  the big fight the finale dance that rewarding end performance. However to my slight disappointment The Drummer didn't deliver w hen it really should. Instead the editing interrupted and intruded on proceedings and what could have been worth a ticket to witness felt like spare change.The romance bit also fell short and somehow was junked from developing further as the narrative decide to switch gears and focus on father and son instead. Hence Lin Sinjie's role as Hong Dou became a little sidetracked midway. Which was a pity given that the potential for some good old fashioned romance didn't make the grade. But what I found really jarring was the decision to reintroduce triad moments in the last act. Again typical in wanting to provide closure but done not too subtly that it sticks out like a sore thumb.All in all it's still a gorgeous looking film with good acting from the leads and not to mention the professional performances by UTheatre the real Zen Drummers who come alive when they're behind their set of drums. Make sure you watch this in a theatre with a booming sound system. If you haven't had enough of the mesmerizing hypnotic beats then head on down to the official website and ensure you got your speakers turned on. And check out the production blog too while you're at it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Anything with drums and I am there. The beats of drums in any music always appeal to me no prizes for guessing I'm a drum and bass fan because I suppose it's fairly easy to express your mood to beats and this expression can be done through anything that gives you that satisfying clang and more so when you need to vent frustrations out in a relatively safe manner by hitting out at something inanimate without personal injury of course.And I like it too as it doesn't come across in a threatening manner to those who want to pick up the instrument. I mean there are no complicated chords complex notes intimidating keys or confusing hand eye leg coordination that calls for dexterity. What it has essentially is a pulled canvas a set of drumsticks and calls for strength intensity and endurance as you express the beats of any rhythm within you.The Drummer is the latest movie to premiere from Hong Kong written and directed by Kenneth Bi starring Jaycee Chan Tony The Lover Leung and Li Sinjie.

I thoroughly enjoyed it.The story presents the bipolar life of a gangster's son. Raised on violence but with a strong inner goodness he is torn between two incompatible worlds. His father is a ruthless criminal who in his spare time hunts wild boar as if they'd insulted his mama. His sister mother figure is a levelheaded sensitive person who in her spare time rescues dogs  kittens from the streets. Eventually our hero hooks up with a bunch of diaperwearing drumbeating freaks on a mountaintop and that's when things start to happen. I told you this movie is unique.Some parts are delightfully predictablealmost borderline sappybut there are some clever plot twists as well. Really though this movie shouldn't be watched for its plot. It's about the spiritual journey we all face in life whether or not we hook up with drumbeating freaks. The drums represent a primitive connection with oneself. The drums represent discipline  a return to sanity when we're bogged down with too much mind. As the opening narration indicates the first sound we ever hear is that of a drumbeat the rhythm of our mother's heart and this forges deep connection with our spirit. There are some very interesting thoughts presented on the subject and while I was initially skeptical about how smacking a tomtom could relate to a person's soul I was gradually mystified and eventually convinced that there's something worth pondering.If you're starting to doze off don't worry. A few brutal murders dismembered body parts  pig carcasses ought to wake you up again. This contrasts sharply against the serene mountaintop and calm disposition not to mention vegetarian meals of the zen drummers where the kid finds temporary refuge. One reviewer said that the contrast makes the film schizophrenic and it certainly does but in a deliberate way. It did strike me as a bit disjoint though. I was expecting a film with slower pacing to allow us to digest it but this flick comes at you pretty fast. As a result sometimes it feels like we're getting two halves of two different movies rather than an integrated whole. To me this film could've easily been an hour longer but I supposed 113 mins is pretty long for most audiences already.The music is very nice with a soundtrack performed by the great young cellist Trey Lee. And of course there's the fantastic performance of the U Theatre drummers who play themselves in the film.Overall I'd say this film is like a blend of The Karate Kid  Scarface with a dash of The Bird People of China. Similar films are the Korean buddhistgangster flick Bittersweet Life Takeshi Kitano's Japanese masterpiece Fireworks and an obscure but very enjoyable Vietnamese flick called Buffalo Boy. All worth checking out.".

	schema:headline " A Journey on LSD";
	schema:reviewBody "Much talk was in German media on the release of Die Reise ins Glck better known to international audiences as Journey into Bliss. Unluckiely this did not show in terms of admissions which is a really sad thing as directorwriterproduceretc. Wenzel Storch invested pretty much everything he had into this production. He is probably ruined for life which would mean that this will be his last movie ever.In the nineties Wenzel Storch was THE most celebrated star of German underground cinema who had then just released Sommer der Liebe which became the highest grossing movie shot on Super 8 ever well at least in Germany. Then it got rather quiet around him. From time to time there were news popping up that he was working on something new but years went by without anything released. Wenzel and his friends went out of money again and again the rumor even was they called it quits and canceled the whole project until they somehow completed it in spring '04 after 12 ! years in the making. I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere here in Bochum at the German Psychotronic Film Festival in June 2004.To make it short Die Reise ins Glck is a film you either love or hate with very few shades possible between those extremes. I consider it one of the most beautiful things I've ever witnessed and have seen it four times by now but I know that there are people who would walk out of it or even yell vicious curses against the screen I'm not joking here!.This is due to Wenzel Storch's quiet unusual style of moviemaking. If you are familiar with his other films then you'll know that most of his material feels like it was written on LSD in fact it was. Repeat I'm not joking!. From his three movies this one is by far the most accessible for a mainstream audience. If your favourite is one of the current box office top 5 you should however handle this piece of information with care...The story Captain Gustav traveled the seven seas for years but now he his crew consisting of some frogs an owl a rabbit a bear and several other animals and of course his living snailship want to retire. They stop at a beautiful island  only to find out that it is inhibited by Knuffi an old enemy of the captain. In Gustav's absence Knuffi went for a career as an evil King and now does what all really evil kings do he kidnaps the captain's children. Gustav has to go on a final mission to free his kids and stop the mad dictator.Okay you probably see where this is going Reise is basically a fairytale on psychedelic drugs with an anarchic and very antifascist attitude that clearly reveals the director's punk background. But after all the story is not that important. This is a movie that is neither character nor plot driven it is the atmosphere which keeps one totally stunned.Everything in this movie was hand made from the strategically placed cute stopmotion sequences to the superb art direction. Open up your eyes wide! In a righteous world the sets costumes and props would make this movie a certain nominee for an academy award. Storch delivers a bizarre postmodern mix of a dreamlike fairground and glittering Christmas elements much too reflexive to be kitsch  every set has it's very own colour scheme and predominant material. It is incredibly beautiful to look at from Gustav's snailship to Knuffi's golden palace and you will find something new every time you watch it.This fits with the brilliant dialog something you'll never quiet get if you are not a native speaker. Just like Storch found much of the material for the sets in torn down factories or on disposal sites big parts of the dialog consist of oldfashioned teenager slang from the seventies and eighties which is somehow still in our collective mind just waiting for Storch to pull it out and make use of it.Although the movie's overall tone is very sweet and uplifting Storch does not spare out the dark side of fairy tales. There are some pretty hefty splatter scenes and makeup effects which made me shake my head on the bigotry of the German film censorship board who have cut almost every horror movie known to mankind but gave this one a not under 12  rating meaning every 6 year old with a parent can watch it. And this is definitely not the only border the film crosses. Wenzel Storch who by the way turned out to be an extremely nice sympathetic guy when I talked to him gives you smoking kids gallons of vomit and sperm kids being peed onto horny grandmas a literal brain wash and other quite somatic moments so be warned if you don't dig stuff like this. But if you are willing to confront yourself with something really unique go for it! No matter if you love or hate it it is an experience like nothing else. Die Reise ins Glck is a trip beyond the rational a bizarre postmodern mishmash of Alice in Wonderland and the comic book classic Little Nemo a phantasmagoria which seems to come directly from another world  sweet surreal and completely psychedelic.".

	onyx:emotionText "Much talk was in German media on the release of Die Reise ins Glck better known to international audiences as Journey into Bliss. Unluckiely this did not show in terms of admissions which is a really sad thing as directorwriterproduceretc. Wenzel Storch invested pretty much everything he had into this production. He is probably ruined for life which would mean that this will be his last movie ever.In the nineties Wenzel Storch was THE most celebrated star of German underground cinema who had then just released Sommer der Liebe which became the highest grossing movie shot on Super 8 ever well at least in Germany. Then it got rather quiet around him. From time to time there were news popping up that he was working on something new but years went by without anything released. Wenzel and his friends went out of money again and again the rumor even was they called it quits and canceled the whole project until they somehow completed it in spring '04 after 12 ! years in the making. I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere here in Bochum at the German Psychotronic Film Festival in June 2004.To make it short Die Reise ins Glck is a film you either love or hate with very few shades possible between those extremes. I consider it one of the most beautiful things I've ever witnessed and have seen it four times by now but I know that there are people who would walk out of it or even yell vicious curses against the screen I'm not joking here!.This is due to Wenzel Storch's quiet unusual style of moviemaking. If you are familiar with his other films then you'll know that most of his material feels like it was written on LSD in fact it was. Repeat I'm not joking!. From his three movies this one is by far the most accessible for a mainstream audience. If your favourite is one of the current box office top 5 you should however handle this piece of information with care...The story Captain Gustav traveled the seven seas for years but now he his crew consisting of some frogs an owl a rabbit a bear and several other animals and of course his living snailship want to retire. They stop at a beautiful island  only to find out that it is inhibited by Knuffi an old enemy of the captain. In Gustav's absence Knuffi went for a career as an evil King and now does what all really evil kings do he kidnaps the captain's children. Gustav has to go on a final mission to free his kids and stop the mad dictator.Okay you probably see where this is going Reise is basically a fairytale on psychedelic drugs with an anarchic and very antifascist attitude that clearly reveals the director's punk background. But after all the story is not that important. This is a movie that is neither character nor plot driven it is the atmosphere which keeps one totally stunned.Everything in this movie was hand made from the strategically placed cute stopmotion sequences to the superb art direction. Open up your eyes wide! In a righteous world the sets costumes and props would make this movie a certain nominee for an academy award. Storch delivers a bizarre postmodern mix of a dreamlike fairground and glittering Christmas elements much too reflexive to be kitsch  every set has it's very own colour scheme and predominant material. It is incredibly beautiful to look at from Gustav's snailship to Knuffi's golden palace and you will find something new every time you watch it.This fits with the brilliant dialog something you'll never quiet get if you are not a native speaker. Just like Storch found much of the material for the sets in torn down factories or on disposal sites big parts of the dialog consist of oldfashioned teenager slang from the seventies and eighties which is somehow still in our collective mind just waiting for Storch to pull it out and make use of it.Although the movie's overall tone is very sweet and uplifting Storch does not spare out the dark side of fairy tales. There are some pretty hefty splatter scenes and makeup effects which made me shake my head on the bigotry of the German film censorship board who have cut almost every horror movie known to mankind but gave this one a not under 12  rating meaning every 6 year old with a parent can watch it. And this is definitely not the only border the film crosses. Wenzel Storch who by the way turned out to be an extremely nice sympathetic guy when I talked to him gives you smoking kids gallons of vomit and sperm kids being peed onto horny grandmas a literal brain wash and other quite somatic moments so be warned if you don't dig stuff like this. But if you are willing to confront yourself with something really unique go for it! No matter if you love or hate it it is an experience like nothing else. Die Reise ins Glck is a trip beyond the rational a bizarre postmodern mishmash of Alice in Wonderland and the comic book classic Little Nemo a phantasmagoria which seems to come directly from another world  sweet surreal and completely psychedelic.";

They get on the snake ship that is powered by astonishing analog machinery. Several years and daughters later they meet Knuffi again... The constructions and buildings are very cute excellent work and the camera work is also good the actors and the soundtrack are o.K. The story it is a far out fairy tale you can compare it with Shrek. A narrator guides through the story and I would have preferred less guidance and more insaneness. The insaneness comes through in details the story rests in straightness. Two aspects that troubled me It is my opinion that there is too much of ministers pissing in it. You know about them from the trailer I don't think I'm spoiling here. It's getting boring after a while. The creation acts are male humor too and the first is very good. And then there are some political parties badges that will substitute the Knuffi Reich's insignia. It is a very short scene but it is a disaster. All fantasy slips away in this scene all humor is lost and the worst of all the ministers demystify the Reich's Insignia. All other decoration details aren't explained in detail they are open for the viewers fantasy and that is how they should be handled. And no other scene intervenes with the real world  only this one has politics and it fails. Dramatically.".

A female employee of his company the largest bread bakery in Jerusalem is killed in a terrorist attack under circumstances which bring an embarrassing public relations nightmare to the company. The deceased woman was a recent immigrant from Romania the actors who play her relatives speak Romanian but the country is never actually named only identified as a former communist country in Eastern Europe and the owner of the bakery sends the HR Manager to escort the body to her homeland. Tagging along on the journey is the same muckraking photojournalist known to the audience as The Weasel who brought the bad PR upon the bakery in the first place.This movie could have taken any of a number of different tracks without any change in the plot line in which the HRM encounters several bureaucratic or emotional obstacles upon arriving in Romania and meeting with local officials the Israeli consul and the teenage son and exhusband of the deceased all the while hoping to make this a short trip to get home in time to chaperone a school trip for his own neglected teenage daughter and clashing with The Weasel.Had this been an American movie I have could easily pictured it done as a roadbuddy comedy a rather slippery slope down which this movie could have descended to a bonehead movie a la A WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.At the other end of the spectrum I did in fact see this movie as part of the Film Movement foreign film subscription series shown at a public library. I'm rather new to that series and this movie was the third I'd seen. The first two were totally depressing ILLEGAL which showed the suffering of a Russian woman illegally in Belgium and undergoing deportation and separation from her teenage son and THE COLOR OF THE MOUNTAIN showing the takeover of a small Colombian village by narcoterrorists and its impact on the children their families and their school. This movie had the potential of going down that gloomy path as well.Instead this was the first one in the series where I actually felt good at the end. The poignancy and pathos of the HRM dealing with the deceased's relatives is well offset by the adventurous challenges he faces getting the deceased to her final resting place and by the comedic sparring between him and the journalist.This movie was very nicely balanced. For my own personal tastes I might have liked it a little better if there had been a touch more comedy one or two more laugh out loud moments but if the production crew were wary of the slippery slope to A WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S I have no quarrel with that call. It's not quite a perfect movie for me but nearly so.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought that this is a very good movie and it can make a good candidate for the foreign language Academy Awards. The storyline is based on a novel titled 'A woman in Jerusalem' by one of the better known Israeli authors A.B. Yehoshua. I have not read the book but I am told that the story in the novel takes place in Siberia whereas the film or most of it takes place in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. The English title is misleading the full title in Hebrew means 'The mission of the Human Resources Manager'. A Romanian worker of a very large industrial bakery in Jerusalem is killed in a terrorist attack and is taken to the morgue a journalist finds out that a salary slip found on her is from the bakery and writes an article blaming her workplace of lacking humanity. Driven by this bad publicity the bakery sends its HR manager with the mission to do the right thing and take care of the proper burial of Iulia Petrache in her home country. However things are not that simple. For a burial papers need to be signed by the next of kin and a quest starts for the next of kin the first one being her husband. However it turns out that her husband is actually her exhusband and her son is still a minor and the only eligible next of kin is her mother who lives very far high up in the mountains. So the HR manager decides to get there and do the right thing bury her in her childhood village although he had the opportunity to take a shortcut and bury here en route. The intricate story line actually develops into a story of human relationships between total strangers. The journalist travels with the HR manager and along the way they pick up Iulia's rebel son and travel to their distant destination in the company of weird people. There is humor and drama in these relationships and the initial mutual animosity and contempt develop into a weird friendship. There are many twists and turns in the story and they all add to a movie that keeps the audience in constant suspense about what happens next. The characters even the minor ones are well played and although some of the situations are practically impossible overall the story line gets the viewer involved not only in the tragedy of Iulia's death but also in the tragedies of each of the other characters the HR manager and his shattered family life the orphan teenager and his bad relationship with his father the bakery's night shift manager and finally the encounter with Iulia's mother who says that Iulia was unhappy in the village. This movie is very close to being a masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing and the camera goes into small details such as a herd of geese crossing the road on the Romanian countryside. The only happy people in the movie seem the be the Israeli consular representative and her husband and they provide some comic relief for the otherwise tragic situations. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how much of what the movie omits is in the novel but as the movie stands we have several people each of whose lives has taken a turning not always for the worse but usually and the details of that past turning are vague. The full Hebrew title would translate as THE MISSION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER and his mission takes him to the boondocks of Eastern Europe to meet the bereaved relatives of a murdered employee. It's a big contrast between familiar surroundings and exotic ones and the contrast may be lost to viewers for whom the place where the action starts Israel is exotic anyway. Another thing lost is the word translated as MANAGER in the title. The word in the Hebrew title doesn't really mean manager it means the appointee responsible. The protagonist Mark Ivanir carries the movie well in this role has less authority than he would like and the plot takes him on a shaggydog road trip from one misfortune to another becoming somewhat more lighthearted and philosophical along the way and showing many moments of altruism. There are some improbabilities and a few minor and unfortunate clichs such as the fellow who like so many characters beset by a crisis in a movie had been trying to give up smoking. But the movie has momentum the minor characters are colorful the music is enjoyable the sad and comic sides are well balanced and I for one was left with a hankering to read the book. In English by the way the book is called A WOMAN IN JERUSALEM.".

I also felt the movie was very disconnected in terms of flowing from one locale to another. It went from one country to another with my having to figure out what country they were in. There were some tender moments but I found the movie a huge let down from beginning to end. The only positive I felt was seeing a bit more about the various cultures in the film. But where movie production was concerned it was clear that the producer was not American because the quality was not on the level that Americans expect.

It reads 'The Mission of the Human Resources Manager' and actually the word used is 'shlihut' which has a wider significance  it means not only mission but also the acts of performing an important duty or of being a messenger for important news. The news in this case are about a death but the film touches only marginally the reasons and the absurdity of that death and deals more about how the people who remained in life cope with the disappearance and how this impacts their lives  including the one of the messenger.Based on a novel of AB Yehoshua the film tells the story of the aftermath of a terror attack one of these crazy suicidal acts that took place during the second intifada about a decade ago. One of the victims of the attack is identified quite lately as a Romanian woman working a manual job in a bakery in the town. A beautiful woman whose face we know only from a photo and later from a short film made on a phone whose body nobody came to claim or identify because she was one of the thousand of foreign workers who come to Israel and perform hard and low paid works nobody else wants to do in order to support their families back home. The duty to take the coffin with the body home to Romania and try to compensate the family there falls on the manager of the human resources the absurdity of the terminology is so well exposed by this film a man who has problems of his own  solidly acted by Mark Ivanir an actor I did not notice until now  he works more for the TV and games industry in the US here he gets an opportunity to make a serious role in an Israeli film and does it fine. What results is a trip in unknown territory for the Jerusalemite clerk and the journalist accompanying him Guri Alfi better known here as a standup comedian a clash not only of two different cultures and but also of different approaches to life and death.The film is not bad but it's a missed opportunity. Made in 2010 a year when both the Romanian and Israeli films industry were riding high on waves of success it could have brought together some of the best in the two schools of cinematography  the Israeli dramatic school of political cinema which after decades of avoiding the tough questions raised by the IsraeliPalestinian conflict succeeded in a few film that take a sharp and uncompromising look at the issues and the Romanian minimalist realism which looks back to the Communist era and the transition that followed and also to the contemporary chaotic situation in Romania not only with anger but also with humor and especially with human understanding. Amazingly director Eran Riklis' style and place in the Israeli cinema fits rather well the Romanian cinema style. The problem lies in the folklorist approach taken in dealing with the Romanian reality. If the Israeli team would have taken a local director as consultant they could have maybe avoided some of the stereotypes of the script. I should say that the Romanian actors do their best to fill in the holes of the story on this respect but this is not always enough. Even so it's a pleasure to see great actors like Irina Petrescu a Romanian legend or Gila Almagor who can be considered as her Israeli counterpart on the same cast although they never meet on screen. And more than all this is the last and final role in the career of Rozina Cambos. Despite its flaws Riklis' film has enough good parts to make for an interesting viewing.".

These are relatable characters  quirky funny human unsure of where to step next. The cinematography perfectly captures the gritty beauty of these landscapes  from Jerusalem to somewhere deep in Eastern Europe. There's a similar feel to the road trip in Little Miss Sunshine unlikely families pulled together in the pursuit of a goal no one knows is really a wise undertaking in the first place. I review it a 9 instead of 10 because there's a slowness to the pace of the film at the beginning that belies what follows but it's a film I will want to see again and share with friends.".

These are relatable characters  quirky funny human unsure of where to step next. The cinematography perfectly captures the gritty beauty of these landscapes  from Jerusalem to somewhere deep in Eastern Europe. There's a similar feel to the road trip in Little Miss Sunshine unlikely families pulled together in the pursuit of a goal no one knows is really a wise undertaking in the first place. I review it a 9 instead of 10 because there's a slowness to the pace of the film at the beginning that belies what follows but it's a film I will want to see again and share with friends.";

Annemarie Schwarzenbach who was among Erika and Klaus Mann's circle of friends in the 30s is searching for a place of refuge in the Near East to discover her own self. Ella Maillart justifies her restlessness her need for movement and travel with a scientific pretext she would like to explore the mysterious Kafiristan Valley and make a name for herself with publications on the archaic life of the nomads living there. Both women are on the run but political developments and their own biographies catch up with them again and again. Their mutual journey through the outside world which runs from Geneva via the Balkans and Turkey to Persia is compounded by the inner world of emotions with a tender love story.";

I really didn't have a clue and I didn't think that it had something to do with the language. I know German and since my own language Dutch is very close to it I was convinced that it wouldn't be a country or a region that we use a completely different name for. But than again this was only one of the many mysteries about this movie...Die Reise nach Kafiristan tells the story of two women who decide to travel together by car to Afghanistan in 1939 but each is in pursuit of their own project. Annemarie Schwarzenbach is an author who wants to find out more about herself and Ella Maillart is a Swiss ethnologist who has traveled the entire world to meet and study new tribes and people. Both women have a completely different nature and there is only one thing that really bonds them Their eternal restlessness and the urge to leave the world of politics and a possible war behind them. But history keeps catching up and they never really can escape.I'm convinced that many people will not like this movie and if I'm honest neither did I in the beginning. The reason for that is quite simple. This movie isn't some easy entertainment that offers at least one solution to every question that it asks. No the makers of the movie have decided to stay very vague by only giving you a hint of what they are trying to say. Dialogs are left uncompleted and sometimes the women don't even speak at all feelings are never really expressed but are always present and obvious for the viewer who wants to see them... That's of course not something that you will see in every movie and it sure takes some time to get used to.After a while I really started to like this movie. The landscapes look nice but they are only there to emphasize the feelings of desolation and complete isolation. In my opinion you have to try to see the beauty of the touching psychological 'landscapes'. It's in their minds that the women go through deep valleys and over high mountain tops as their feelings sometimes clash but are very parallel at the same time. I know that sounds a bit weird but that's about the best explanation I can give to it. I guess you just have to watch it for yourself to fully understand what I mean.As a conclusion I would like to say that this is a very nice psychological road movie that will be loved most by an audience who is used to watch 'alternative' cinema. Don't try this movie when you are only used to watch Hollywood blockbusters because you just will not like it then. Personally I'm quite used to watch this kind of movies and I must say that this is definitely one of the better in the genre. It's too bad that it sometimes was a bit slow but I still give it a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie's storyline is pat and quaint. Two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves. Unfortunately if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central Asia this is absolutely terrible.The producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it. To begin with and most glaringly incorrect the Nuristanis as they were known in the thirties and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by AbdulRahman Shah of Aghnaistan were not nomads. In fact they have not been nomads since the Aryan invasions of central Asia over three milenia ago.Second the city that is filmed as Tehran is not Tehran which is understandable however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly DIFFERENT than the city of Tehran which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range which predominates all of the cities views.Third Persian despite the fact it is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan is never heard in movie. When there are native speakers who do not speak in German they speak in Arabic. The 'Persian' guards at the border in fact say to each other 'Ma hadha rujal' This is not a man and not 'in mard nist' as it would be in Persian. Also the love song between the Indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in Spanish. While talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the Quran uses the words 'Ferdos' and 'jehaan' and makes some reference to drugs afterwords. These words certainly never appear in the Quran as they are Persian for Paradise indeed Ferdos and Paradise are very distant cognates between our languages and 'World' respectively though Jehaan is admittedly close to 'Jehennan' which is hell in Arabic. When they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also Arabic this despite the fact that there are NO native speakers of Arabic in Iran and Afghanistan and its use is primarily religious with some use in education at that time.When they are stopped in Iran before they reach the Afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any Iranian group. Their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile. In Iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear Turbans unless they are a cleric. The language spoken is clearly Arabic from the initial greeting of 'Ahlan wa Sahlan.' When they do reach Kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the Hindu Kush mountain range. There is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring. The area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name The Indian Killers because of its difficult and limiting ground.In short the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place. It lacks any real draw to it being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to Nuristan however even that is stillborn and no real development is felt leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose. In short this is a really bad movie that I would have rated at one star except for the good footage of Bedouin and the deserts of the Levant even if they are misnamed.".

The exteriors provide a nice backdrop to the inevitable journeys of selfdiscovery of the two protagonists. The fact that the tension between tends to stay below the surface is never fully expressed only adds rather than distracts from the interest.

But the Dubinis clearly wanted to show us a psychological journey more than a physical one so the camera glides over the most pictureperfect hills ruins etc only to swiftly return to our actresses. And this I think is good The film could have become a National Geographic style documentary and that would have left the interesting topic of what moves these two very different characters who are doing something much out of the ordinary in the 1940s.Rather then spell things out for you the directors choose to hint at feelings to leave dialogs uncompleted and to move on at the point where you would expect a conclusion to be reached. There are pros and cons to that There is no preferred interpretation and the actresses can use expressions and body language to suggest much more than could have been put into words and Jeanette Hain is very good at that. But the film seems to move slowly because nothing unexpected can happen this way and in the end it all was a bit too subtle for me.This said there are plenty of very moving scenes. Especially the flirtatious side of Annemarie gets well depicted the dance at the ambassador's house and at the same time it stays constrained and halfhidden as you would expect for a woman in that period of time.The real dramatic moment of the film comes near the end when the women have to part their ways. Even then things are very quiet and stilted. Is this a flaw of the Dubinis' film or did they want to show an era in which you didn't discuss your most intimate feelings with others?I really do not know the answer I think the film could have improved from a little more say what you mean and say it mean''.

	schema:headline " Mostly forgettable road movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Reise nach Kafiristan is a Germanlanguage film from 2001 so this one had its 15th anniversary last year already. It was written and directed by the Dubini Brothers from Switzerland and it is maybe their most known work. This may have to do with the time when the film is set or the real people references but also a main reason could be that some people mistake the Barbara Marx credited as a writer here for the very famous recently deceased American show girl of the same name. Anyway this 100minute film is about two women traveling through Iran for very different reasons personal and professional and they decide to travel together to make things easier for both of them. The film is set during the 1930s and that time and area certainly weren't very suitable for women back then. Then again is it anymore suitable today? The two protagonists and their endeavors existed in real life too which makes the film slightly more interesting not too much though. I honestly think lead actress Hain iswas stunningly beautiful but never a really gifted actress. As for Petry I don't think I have seen her in enough roles to make a definite statement. But in here she is equally forgettable as Hain. This is a major problem because the two characters are supposed to have a love affair but the actresses had very little chemistry with each other. They are also the only known names in terms of the cast. Even gigantic German film buffs like myself will probably not recognize any other namesfaces. This is one reason why the supporting characters  side plot also did not add any spice to the film. Oh yeah and if they really love each other as they want us to believe not really historically proved either then the ending is also not really making sense. Real love trumps personal goals and missions also during a time when homosexuality was frowned upon. The filmmakers' attempt near the very end to add important historical context to the film the radio report felt rushed and for the sake of it. Not very much about this film is working to be honest the only aspect I somewhat enjoyed are the beautiful sceneries and cinematography. Obviously far from enough for over 1.5 hours. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:headline " Obscure and underappreciated";
	schema:reviewBody "Evidently not many people have heard of this movie.   I saw it when I was a kid in the 1950s and was impressed being an aeronautics buff even as a child and still so today.   The story revolves around a new advanced design commercial airliner called Reindeer in service in the UK and an aeronautical engineer portrayed by Stewart who suspects that the aircraft might have a design problem that could result in a structural failure of the vertical tailplane from metal fatigue... an atthetime relatively new field of science in aviation.  After one of the airliners is lost in a crash and the tailplane is not among the wreckage Stewart's character Theodore Honey begins testing of a production tailplane in a large research lab vibrating it to see if after a carefully calculated number of hours of vibration the tailplane will suffer a structural failure.  His theories about the proposed failure of the lab test subject tailplane assembly after a select number of hours of vibration are reinforced by a similar number of flight hours on the first airliner that was lost which confirms his convictions that the crash was indeed the results of a structural failure brought on by metal fatigue.The problem is that Mr Honey is a bit of a recluse and eccentric a widower and single parent and considered a bit of an odd duck by his contemporaries.  However he has credentials and his work is taken seriously enough to allow him to convince his employers to conduct the structural design lab tests even though they do not really take him seriously on his metal fatigue theories and for the most part seem to be simply patronizing him... ...until Honey finds himself traveling via air and the airplane he gets onto happens to be a Reindeer... with enough acquired flight hours on the airframe to be dangerously close to the failure point according to his calculations.   Honey upon realizing that the airplane has the required flight time on the clocks to be in danger embarks upon a quest to do something about it as only an eccentric genius can and the story takes off from there again no pun.The combination of a laidback American actor like James Stewart and a somewhat abrupt British cast tends to accentuate Stewart's Theodore Honey a normally reserved but very absorbed engineer caught up in his work surrounded by a pack of hustle and bustle Brits.  It's quite a contrast. Good support from Glynis Johns as the stewardess aboard the Reindeer and Marlene Dietrich as movie star Monica Teasdale also a passenger aboard the airplane both of whom get caught up in Honey's apprehension and fears of an impending disaster that he is certain is staring them in the face although nobody else really takes any of it seriously... until Honey takes matters into his own hands after the airplane lands without incident and he learns that it's scheduled to remain in service in spite of his rather uncharacteristically loud and spirited pleas to have it grounded.    His solution to keeping the airplane grounded until his lab tests are concluded is certainly an interesting turn of events.Considering the vintage of this film 1951 it has decent FX and remains a bit of a period piece demonstrating how air travel used to be done before mass transport Jumbo Jets and economy class seating.  This film is an aviation enthusiasts sort of movie as well as a story of the little guy who believed in his convictions and the few people around him who believed in him as a person... even though they may have doubts about his work and his theories.Good cast across the board with some standouts like Jack Hawkins who is always fine and Marlene Dietrich who at first seems to be there solely as Star Appeal although after a bit of time passes her presence becomes more and more genuine.   There is some good character development in this film albeit sometimes a bit rushed and the ending is also rather abrupt... but typical of many British films of the period.  All and all it's a film well worth watching for the fine performances and the engrossing story... and as a sidenote for the look back at the way the fledgling airline industry and how it was coming into its own.It also inadvertently provides a sobering point to ponder since this film was produced several years before the British De Haviland Comet jet airliner entered service and disastrously became aviation's first great example of the potential for a catastrophic structural failure caused by a design fault which although corrected quickly still didn't save the airliner from the stigma it suffered when several crashed after they experienced explosive decompression at high altitude from something as simple as having cabin windows too large and the wrong shape.The British airline industry must have collectively flashed back to this film during the mid1950s and the Comet's woes and how prophetic No Highway In The Sky must have seemed at the time.This film also includes some considerable supporting talent almost all of which went uncredited such as Kenneth More and Wilfrid HydeWhite.".

	onyx:emotionText "Evidently not many people have heard of this movie.   I saw it when I was a kid in the 1950s and was impressed being an aeronautics buff even as a child and still so today.   The story revolves around a new advanced design commercial airliner called Reindeer in service in the UK and an aeronautical engineer portrayed by Stewart who suspects that the aircraft might have a design problem that could result in a structural failure of the vertical tailplane from metal fatigue... an atthetime relatively new field of science in aviation.  After one of the airliners is lost in a crash and the tailplane is not among the wreckage Stewart's character Theodore Honey begins testing of a production tailplane in a large research lab vibrating it to see if after a carefully calculated number of hours of vibration the tailplane will suffer a structural failure.  His theories about the proposed failure of the lab test subject tailplane assembly after a select number of hours of vibration are reinforced by a similar number of flight hours on the first airliner that was lost which confirms his convictions that the crash was indeed the results of a structural failure brought on by metal fatigue.The problem is that Mr Honey is a bit of a recluse and eccentric a widower and single parent and considered a bit of an odd duck by his contemporaries.  However he has credentials and his work is taken seriously enough to allow him to convince his employers to conduct the structural design lab tests even though they do not really take him seriously on his metal fatigue theories and for the most part seem to be simply patronizing him... ...until Honey finds himself traveling via air and the airplane he gets onto happens to be a Reindeer... with enough acquired flight hours on the airframe to be dangerously close to the failure point according to his calculations.   Honey upon realizing that the airplane has the required flight time on the clocks to be in danger embarks upon a quest to do something about it as only an eccentric genius can and the story takes off from there again no pun.The combination of a laidback American actor like James Stewart and a somewhat abrupt British cast tends to accentuate Stewart's Theodore Honey a normally reserved but very absorbed engineer caught up in his work surrounded by a pack of hustle and bustle Brits.  It's quite a contrast. Good support from Glynis Johns as the stewardess aboard the Reindeer and Marlene Dietrich as movie star Monica Teasdale also a passenger aboard the airplane both of whom get caught up in Honey's apprehension and fears of an impending disaster that he is certain is staring them in the face although nobody else really takes any of it seriously... until Honey takes matters into his own hands after the airplane lands without incident and he learns that it's scheduled to remain in service in spite of his rather uncharacteristically loud and spirited pleas to have it grounded.    His solution to keeping the airplane grounded until his lab tests are concluded is certainly an interesting turn of events.Considering the vintage of this film 1951 it has decent FX and remains a bit of a period piece demonstrating how air travel used to be done before mass transport Jumbo Jets and economy class seating.  This film is an aviation enthusiasts sort of movie as well as a story of the little guy who believed in his convictions and the few people around him who believed in him as a person... even though they may have doubts about his work and his theories.Good cast across the board with some standouts like Jack Hawkins who is always fine and Marlene Dietrich who at first seems to be there solely as Star Appeal although after a bit of time passes her presence becomes more and more genuine.   There is some good character development in this film albeit sometimes a bit rushed and the ending is also rather abrupt... but typical of many British films of the period.  All and all it's a film well worth watching for the fine performances and the engrossing story... and as a sidenote for the look back at the way the fledgling airline industry and how it was coming into its own.It also inadvertently provides a sobering point to ponder since this film was produced several years before the British De Haviland Comet jet airliner entered service and disastrously became aviation's first great example of the potential for a catastrophic structural failure caused by a design fault which although corrected quickly still didn't save the airliner from the stigma it suffered when several crashed after they experienced explosive decompression at high altitude from something as simple as having cabin windows too large and the wrong shape.The British airline industry must have collectively flashed back to this film during the mid1950s and the Comet's woes and how prophetic No Highway In The Sky must have seemed at the time.This film also includes some considerable supporting talent almost all of which went uncredited such as Kenneth More and Wilfrid HydeWhite.";

In particular he helped in the building of the zeppelin R100 which Vickers designed in a contest between private industry and the government.  A Labor government in office was trying to demonstrate the superiority of government sponsored projects over private industry.  The R100 proved a perfectly adequate zeppelin that did a maiden trip to and from Canada safely.  The government sponsored R101 crashed on its first voyage in France and killed 44 out of 48 men on board including the Secretary of State for Air Lord Thomson who had pushed the project and most of the government's aviation experts.  Shute wrote a very good account of his career as an engineer and of the R101 Tragedy entitled SLIDERULE. I recommend reading it if you ever get a chance.

Also in the book the engineer is a bit of a religious fanatic and this has understandably been purged from the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Very interesting  entertaining English film. Well directed and acted too. The slightly autistic and introverted aeronautical engineer as portrayed by James Stewart while mostly credible makes a late discovery that indicates a recently developed plane's structure will fail from metal fatigue after exactly 1440 hours of flying time and not just approximately 1400 hours mind you!. That was the single flaw in the film that kept it from rocketing to a full 10 for me. A competent A.E. which the character is supposed to be would simply not overlook as common a variable as temperature gradient when projecting structural failure even in the early days of aviation. But on the positive side there was continuous suspense realism and a good pace exercised throughout this film without any sensationalism or the stretching of credulity.

	onyx:emotionText "Very interesting  entertaining English film. Well directed and acted too. The slightly autistic and introverted aeronautical engineer as portrayed by James Stewart while mostly credible makes a late discovery that indicates a recently developed plane's structure will fail from metal fatigue after exactly 1440 hours of flying time and not just approximately 1400 hours mind you!. That was the single flaw in the film that kept it from rocketing to a full 10 for me. A competent A.E. which the character is supposed to be would simply not overlook as common a variable as temperature gradient when projecting structural failure even in the early days of aviation. But on the positive side there was continuous suspense realism and a good pace exercised throughout this film without any sensationalism or the stretching of credulity. The characters were fully believable and the basic story itself is a fascinating one. Score another for the British film makers!";

	schema:headline " A gem";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERTS I finally caught this little gem last night when it showed up on hulu and am delighted I took a chance on it. It treats the trials and tribulations of a metallurgical scientist employed by the British Royal Aircraft Establishment who prognosticates that its latest and greatest achievement a new flagship transAtlantic passenger airliner has a fatal design flaw that has resulted in one catastrophic accident already with more inevitable as time goes by. When faced with what he regards as yet another imminent disaster he turns what has been to that point purely a laboratory investigation into a defacto personal crusade. While the science in this thing is decidedly weak the concept of the fatigue failure mechanism while not unrealistic in and of itself is grossly oversimplified and peppered with references virtually alchemistic in their arcane irrelevance the thing that makes the movie special is the crafting of the characters.While in real life Jimmy Stewart was a lifelong aviation enthusiast who was an accomplished civilian and combat pilot and even a brigadier general in the United States Air Force Reserve here he is cast as just the opposite  a classic laboratorybound research type who by modern standards c. 2010 is apparently afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome. Asperger's is a kind of autistism disorder that often seems to elevate the intellectual potential of certain people in mathematics and other technical fields while impairing their social functioning to a highly visible extent. It has become popular in some parts of the news media to sometimes attribute Asperger's to the even some of the most successful people in the tech industry. The fact that during the events that make up the plot Stewart actually becomes emotionally connected enough to his fellow human beings to risk everything he has to save their lives represents a something of a watershed moment in his character's life.Marlene Dietrich in turn comes across as one of those movie actresses you hear about sometimes who is a star not only on but also off the screen an insightful lady who is very sure of what she knows and what she can do regardless of what others might think and who is as absolutely fearless in her own much more sociable way as Stewart can be in his awkward way in taking charge and asserting herself where she sees the need. One can't help but wish one could meet such a figure in real life someone who manages to achieve great success in their field while exuding tremendous grace in spite of the fact that they evidently do things very much their own way. Interestingly unlike Stewart she actually draws back from the opportunity to make a watershed moment in her own life withdrawing from intervening in his world to abruptly return to her own. It would be fascinating to pick the writers' brains over the reallife inspiration for characters such as these.The more minor characters are equally intriguing for their believability in certain respects. Jack Hawkins is cast as the diametrical opposite to Stewart broadshouldered and granitejawed he could brush someone like Stewart's character aside effortlessly if he so chose yet instead he is the soul of grace and consideration always striving to be connected with and agreeable to other people including most notably Stewart whom he almost instinctively seeks to support from the first moment he meets him. His boss in turn treats the viewer to a very nicely nuanced performance of a bureaucrat trying very hard to do the right thing while keeping all the balls he is responsible for in the air.Moreover contrary to what other reviewers have written here one of the noteworthy things about this movie is that every responsible person in the film takes Stewart's misgivings about a defect in the aircraft seriously it is just that none of them does so with the same sense of conviction and urgency that he does. Especially visible in this regard is the captain of the particular aircraft at the center of the story who in a striking display of professionalism goes entirely against his own gut reaction and instead implements every logical precaution imaginable in response to Stewart's nearhysterical warnings short only of the most effective one canceling the flight altogether. Indeed even though this means that he must take nonpilot Stewart's advice and shut down two of the engines in flight and cause the plane to arrive an hour and a half late he not only does so but does so on his own initiative without clearing it with his superiors on the ground and then he even further delays his trip by postponing his next takeoff until a thorough inspection can be completed. The point is his clarity of thinking and decisionmaking in spite of his emotions is admirable and like everyone else shown in this film in no wise is he characterized as a fool except to the extent wiser heads tend to so paint Stewart ironically. Rather as with the rest of the cast he comes across as the most responsible person imaginable given the slight amount of information available to him i.e. Jimmy Stewart's generally incomprehensible even wildeyed theorizing.And finally perhaps the most believable aspect is the irony of watching Stewart's immediate superiors actually wishing actively for the failure of the test bed aircraft in Stewart's lab so that their organization will save face in light of the extreme nature of his activities even though it means that the aircraft program overall will prove a very big expensive highprofile failure!".

	schema:reviewBody "Way back in the 1960s NBC pioneered the concept of showing movies in prime time on network television with Saturday Night at the Movies. However you got the feeling the Hollywood studios were not enthralled with allowing their best stuff to get overexposed and NBC wasn't going to spend a lot on the movies either. So they were a bit old and usually black and white not that many people had color at the time. Two films kept getting shown over and over The Day the Earth Stood Still and No Highway in the Sky. I remember going over to a friend's house and seeing these movies more than once. I wonder if NBC was trying to tell the public something aliens in Washington and plane crashes. Of the two The Day the Earth Stood Still has become a classic but No Highway has been forgotten except by me.I still remember elements of the movie the odd shaped tail falling off and the advice to sit on the floor of the men's room if the plane is crashing. However I assumed there was more of a whistleblower conflict to it with the plane manufacturer trying to cover up the flaw as in modern reallife scenarios when actually they wanted to figure it out too in the movie.Over the years when a plane crashed with some defect or whatever I usually thought of this movie. By the 1960s when it was on TV it was generally known that there had been reallife incidents similar to those in the movie specifically the British Comet in the 1950s. So I suspect No Highway was influential though sadly not enough.I guess NBC got this cheap because it was a British movie and they were showing it outside its main market in America. It's a movie that was a bit futuristic at the time but dated quickly. It was a purely fictional futuristic plane that no plane could realistically look like inside especially the absurd kitchen a little turbulence and the coffee and plates would be broken on the floor. But in the 1950s or even early 1960s few people had flown and fewer across the Atlantic so who knew? No the director. The movie tapped into the fear of the dangerous new mode of transportation. Who doesn't have some fear of being on a plane that is going to crash? But the science and the aviation technology is rather mixed up a turboprop with dialogue about a piston engine and some strange idea of nuclear fission of aluminum alloy caused by vibration producing the fracture. Huh? It would have been more effective to talk about the then new jet engines causing some mysterious vibration to trigger the fracture. The Theodore Honey character is rather overbaked at least early on. WTF is a boffin? Is the British director trying to ridicule the American scientist? In the end Honey is vindicated so no harm done. The contrast between Honey initially not figuring humans into his equation and later on the plane being intensely concerned shows that the character is integral to the plot. And the excessive faith in precision is shown to be somewhat mistaken in the final outcome a point that bothers me the viewer. It should be noted that Jimmy Stewart as a pilot based in England flew numerous bombing missions over Germany during WWII. So criticism of his portrayal I think is misplaced and it was probably a matter he felt strongly about. Essentially No Highway is an early disaster flick without the disaster somewhat shallow characters some romance a what's going to happen to them thing. I think it would have been stronger if it had been more realistic and The Establishment had been engaged in a cover up. Remake?Despite its obvious flaws and sorely dated aviation technology it is an interesting and important film. Everyone involved in the aviation industry should see it including the folks at Boeing and Airbus and all the airlines especially Asiana. When there is the probability or even just possibility of something going very wrong each individual has the responsibility to speak up regardless of consequences. That is the lasting lesson of No Highway in the Sky and why it is still worth watching today.".

My favorite scenes were of the models and the vibration test chamber at the beginning of the film. The story is pretty compelling to watch as Honey comes face to face with the horrible reality of his theory. Stewart puts a very human touch on what could have been a twodimensional Bmovie stereotype. He is just eccentric in modern lingo nerdy enough to make you laugh but when he stands up for something watch out!Naturally engineering stories don't draw large audiences so the only way I could finally see this movie was to spend 19.95 to buy it online.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is a great example early stress testing methods even though the lead character Mr. Honey played by James Stewart is a stereotypical scatterbrained genius. My favorite scenes were of the models and the vibration test chamber at the beginning of the film. The story is pretty compelling to watch as Honey comes face to face with the horrible reality of his theory. Stewart puts a very human touch on what could have been a twodimensional Bmovie stereotype. He is just eccentric in modern lingo nerdy enough to make you laugh but when he stands up for something watch out!Naturally engineering stories don't draw large audiences so the only way I could finally see this movie was to spend 19.95 to buy it online. The money was well spent. My rating is 8  10.";

The accidents were eventually traced to Metal Fatigue which was a relatively new science back then. I believe I already knew about that tragedy by the time I saw the movie No Highway In the Sky so I didn't think it was funny at all in fact I assumed that Metal Fatigue was the cause of the tails falling off not sure whether the movie mentions that though.Neville Shute by the way has written a number of excellent aviation thrillers but the only other one I remember was called Cone of Silence. It was about an air crash mystery related to navigational aid in use at the time SBA Standard Beam Approach. I think you have to be a bit of an aviation historian to appreciate these stories now.".

This is an absolutely basic thing that you learn in science class already in high school! Despite from this I did not like James Stewart in this role. I like him a lot in his typical persona a nice kind considerate honest and decent man. But not timid and nerdy as in this part. It felt entirely wrong.Also I did not understand what Marlene Dietrich was doing there? She filled no function at all. The scientist could have had all the talks he had with her with the air stewardess instead. Having TWO women as some kind of love interests for him only spread it thin.The basic idea is a little interesting though how far would you go if you knew or thought that you knew that a lot of people were in great danger? And no one wanted to listen to you? At the same time as a lot of other things were at risk if you interfered  and it turned out that you were wrong? I think it is useful for us all to think these moral issues through in a fictional context so to speak because I think that will make us more ready if we ever find ourselves in a situation like that in reality.".

Stewart manages to get across the eccentric scientist fairly well though the character in the novel is considerably more complex. The same could be said of the two female leads though Glynis Johns does have more opportunity than Dietrich to establish her character. This is primarily owing to the fact that the Corder part is far more developed after the Gander incident than that of the actress. Dennis Scott the primary narrator in the novel is here played by Jack Hawkins who certainly makes his subordinate film role quite effective. In fact the simplifying of Scott's place in the plot is actually an improvement on the novel as Shute has difficulties in transferring points of view between characters who are miles apart and are still being filtered through the perceptions of Dennis Scott. The film abandons the first person perspective and thus completely solves that difficulty. A major change is made to the character of Honey's daughter Elspeth. She never has the accident is taken care of by the Scotts and is more mature and less childlike than in the novel. But Janette Scott makes the most of these changes and creates a very convincing and sympathetic character indeed. The characters in the novel who are most diminished are Shirley Scott and Captain Samuelson. Shirley Scott Elizabeth Allan is quite an important figure in the book but here her important relationship with Elspeth and her rapport with her husband seem nearly completely ignored. The Captain played well by an uncredited Niall MacGinnis has for some reason two of his most important functionshis distrust of the Reindeer aircraft and his knowledge of and respect for the the pilot of the crashed plane assigned to another character who is dropped from the plot quite early.It is quite surprising that the expert and effective ensemble acting of so many of the performers is uncredited. This includes the work of Douglas BradleySmith Felix Aylmer Kenneth More and even an appearance of the silent star Bessie Love. It's rather a pity because their work helps create the vivid atmosphere and verisimilitude of this excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "No Highway in the Sky is a very good British cinematic drama directed by Henry Koster and starring my favorite actor James Stewart. Stewart portrays an American named Theodore Honey a brilliant shy timid absentminded aviation scientist at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. Mr. Honey has put a great deal of work into his theory that a certain type of metallic aircraft known as a Reindeer will crack up from metal fatigue after 1440 hours of flying time. En route to Labrador to investigate a Reindeer crash Mr. Honey suddenly realizes that the very plane he's on is a Reindeer and that it is very close to approaching the 1440hour mark! Two women on the plane who sympathize with Mr. Honey and believe in the urgency of his eventual fears are Monica Teasdale Marlene Dietrich a famous movie actress and Marjorie Corder Glynis Johns one of the two stewardesses.Let's discuss a few of the main characters of No Highway in the Sky. James Stewart is simply wonderful as Theodore Honey a very kind  softspoken man who is quite humorous in his few bits of gawky absentmindedness as he works in a house that is overly cluttered with books and papers he even has a strangely urgent way of walking. Marlene Dietrich is great as the very sophisticated  glamorous Monica Teasdale who at first is quite alarmed at this tall fumbling nervous and perhaps mentally unstable scientist she meets on the plane but who eventually sees that he knows what he is talking about even if she doesn't understand his scientific jargon. Glynis Johns is most appealing as the adorable  sweetnatured Marjorie Corder who truly stands by Mr. Honey in his darkest hours and urges him to fight for his theory if he strongly believes in it. I must also highly admire Jack Hawkins as the friendly Mr. Scott head of metallurgy at the Royal Aircraft Establishment who also is on Mr. Honey's side and wants his theory to be proved correct lest Mr. Honey will be declared insane. What is especially touching about Ms. Teasdale Ms. Corder and Mr. Scott is their interest in Mr. Honey's private life and their affection for his twelveyearold daughter Elspeth Janette Scott whom the widowed Mr. Honey obviously adores with all his heart but seemingly has difficulty showing his love to her.With all that said let me just briefly relate a few of my favorite scenes from No Highway in the Sky. Mr. Scott shares some quiet moments with Elspeth as she shows him around her house and tells him about her domestic life with her father. Mr. Honey displays his earnestness perhaps most severely when he tries to explain his theory to Captain Samuelson Niall MacGinnis and is unsuccessful in convincing him that the airplane they are in is in grave danger. Mr. Honey shares a tender moment with Ms. Teasdale at the rear of the plane as they quietly try to cover up their nervousness by discussing each other's careers and Mr. Honey's family. Having moved in with Mr. Honey to help tidy up his house prepare meals and become a surrogate mother to Elspeth Ms. Corder shares some especially heartwarming scenes with a downtrodden Mr. Honey.In closing No Highway in the Sky is in my opinion a very good movie with a wellwritten screenplay despite the fact that the movie is not popular today nor was it a very joyous filming experience nor did it receive the greatest public response upon its initial release in 1951. Among the film's oddities are Ms. Corder's rather abrupt announcement near the end that she shall marry Mr. Honey and the virtual complete absence of a music score but never mind. There is much about this film to admire most notably the suspenseful story and the few main characters I described earlier.".

Honey is supposed to be British and to look like a frog. Stewart is wonderful as an engineer trying to make nonengineering types understand the seriousness of a dangerous situation though.It's also fascinating to see a portrayal of the early years of international air travel before automatic navigation and Satnav. The technical side is very clearly handled but then Shute was an aeronautical engineer as well as a novelist.Glynis Johns and Marlene Dietrich are wonderful in their tangled relationships with Honey.You've probably never heard of this film. Don't let that stop you watching it!".

	onyx:emotionText "I have to point out to start with that I read the book first so I came to the film with a lot of ideas and preconceptions.The choice of Jimmy Stewart to play Theodore Honey was a bit of a shock. Honey is supposed to be British and to look like a frog. Stewart is wonderful as an engineer trying to make nonengineering types understand the seriousness of a dangerous situation though.It's also fascinating to see a portrayal of the early years of international air travel before automatic navigation and Satnav. The technical side is very clearly handled but then Shute was an aeronautical engineer as well as a novelist.Glynis Johns and Marlene Dietrich are wonderful in their tangled relationships with Honey.You've probably never heard of this film. Don't let that stop you watching it!";

	schema:reviewBody "Die Relativittstheorie der Liebe or Pigeons on the Roof is a German 95minute movie from 2011 so this one had its 5th anniversary last year. It is probably the most known as well as most recent work by writer and director Otto Alexander Jahrreiss and the former probably has to do with Olli Dittrich and Katja Riemann being the two core actors here. As for me my perception of this duo could hardly be any more different. i love Dittrich in almost everything he is in while I cannot stand Riemann at all usually and find her very overrated. So it will definitely depend on your liking of these two in order to determine how much you will end up liking this film. Dittrich plays several characters in here and so does Riemann and the one thing that unites them is always love sometimes more sometimes less. It is basically 45 short films packed into one movie and I personally found the connections not too convincing. Another negative aspect was probably that the editing felt really rocky at times and the jumps between the couples were kinda tough to watch on more than just a few occasions. But yeah as somebody who likes Dittrich a lot it was still a rewarding watch and I also felt that Riemann was not as bad in here as she usually is even if she fails in hitting the right notes too at times and becomes too gimmicky but that's a problem she frequently has in her career. Of course your perception and personal preferencesexperiences alone will decide how much you like the individual parts. I personally liked the one with the immigrant who wants a restaurant and the health inspection agency worker the most I guess. Dittrich really shines there for example with his constant asking for tea. One can make a point that sometimes it is costumes over craft acting here and they may be correct but this film still has several enjoyable moments even if I would say it is kinda difficult to take it seriously as anything other than a comedy. Overall the film is not on the very strong level as the DittrichEngelke collaboration Blind Date that also could have been put together as a pretty long movie because of the deficits I mentioned but nonetheless if you like Riemann andor Dittrich as much as I do then it is certainly worth checking out. I give this project a cautious thumbsup. Oh yeah the title could have been better too.".

This is a wonderful family film from the bygone Eisenhowerera of the 1950s.  Even though I've been watching it on TV since I was a kid in the sixties I'd only seen panscan versions and it wasn't until I got it letterboxed on laserdisc that I finally saw what a bigscreen entertainment this movie was meant to be.  It has wonderful scope and a score by Bernard Herrmann that takes you right down into the bowels of the earth.  Listen to it and you'll notice what I mean as the movie progresses the music keeps going into a lower and lower register.  Five organs were used including one meant for a Cathedral. The complete original recordings of the score are available on CD from Varese Sarabande. This movie also has the great James Mason in it so you know it's got to be good.  Sure it's long in the telling and takes a while to get you down that extinct volcano in Iceland but it's fun all the way with great special effects work by L.B. Abbott and matte paintings by Emil Kosa Jr.  The only way to watch this movie is in widescreen and it's long past due that 20th Century Fox puts this out on DVD in a letterboxed anamorphic transfer.  Let's hope that they do it soon.".

I understood almost everything that the Icelandic character in the film said and I can assure you that it was particularly articulate and well pronounced. Why someone said that it was fake I dont know. I am guessing that he did not hear it well because the sound can be pretty bad in these golden oldies. While we are on the subject let me also add that some of the facts concerning Iceland were wrong. The horse carriage used to transport the group to the volcano is out of place. The interior design of the hotel and the maitre dhotels costume was a bit off. But its described like that in Vernes novel as well so its no big deal. And besides every ethnic group is portrayed in a very stereotypical manner Scots Italians everybody. Such nitpicking is therefore dull and unnecessary and people should just enjoy the film for its imagination.".

The unlikely cast of dramatic veteran James Mason singer Pat Boone beautiful Diane Baker sexy Arlene Dahl and Iceland born jock Peter Ronson come together surprisingly well. Veteran screenwriter Charles Brackett who wrote for the screen such classics as Sunset Boulevard Ninotchka The Lost Weekend Niagra and The Bishops Wife adapts the Jules Verne novel. Nominated for three Academy Awards for Art Direction Special Effects and Sound. This movie is probably more fun to people like me who grew up with it from the time when it was made but it's still a good movie and I've seen it many times as an adult. It would be nice to see in it's Technicolor big screen splendor. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.".

Now that I am older I can truly appreciate the fact that the two romantic leads are middle aged something that was rarely done back then and how wonderful to see a mature woman like Dahl being sexy as all getout. I loved it when she and James Mason get together in the end. As for the special effects so what if the dinosaurs are hokey? All dinosaurs were hokey in the fifties. The filming in the caverns was great and who downs't love Gertrude and her owner? It was terrible when Gertrude got eaten. It justified the bad guy's death.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this again in the following circumstances1. I saw it on the Big Screen at Loew's in Jersey City2. Arlene Dahl was at the premovie reception and later participated in a QA session with one of the hosts. If she isn't one of the most charming and gracious Hollywood types I've ever met then she's an even better actress than she's ever been given credit for.This IS a Big Screen Movie it must be seen on the Big Screen to be fully appreciated and enjoyed. Despite the fact that it has what I would call a small set qualityonce they begin the descent there are only 5 actors with regular lines and they are usually in close proximity to one another this is an Epic and deserves Epic viewing. Yes it has its share of Movie MistakesI noted that all the male actors remain clean shaven throughout and receive regular haircuts. In the scene where Pat Boone discovers the forest of mushrooms and they go hogwild eating them Arlene Dahl reminds them that they will soon find the taste of salt beef appealing it occurred to me than an individual could carry rations for at most 1 week and here it is the 256th day of the Expedition.The writers took liberties with Verne's story. In a program note handed out at the theater it was pointed the heroes were changed from Germans to Scots a Swede and an Icelander because 14 years after the end of WWII English speaking audiences would not accept German heroes. Arlene Dahl's character is a new addition what Verne stories I've read have almost no female characters. But in addition to eye appeal she also is the translator for Big Hans. Having first seen this movie as a 10 year old the battle of the sexes went completely over my head though 10 year old boys like to look at pretty ladies toothis time around I appreciated it especially as her character and her portrayal are of a strong willed and assertive womanthey had plenty of those in the 19th Century.Before the screening there were some introductory remarks. The host said the story can be seen as both straight adventure in a physical sense and as a psychological adventurepenetrating deeper into the human psyche with Count Saknussem representing the Dark Side of humankind but not completely evil.

	onyx:emotionText "I recently saw this again in the following circumstances1. I saw it on the Big Screen at Loew's in Jersey City2. Arlene Dahl was at the premovie reception and later participated in a QA session with one of the hosts. If she isn't one of the most charming and gracious Hollywood types I've ever met then she's an even better actress than she's ever been given credit for.This IS a Big Screen Movie it must be seen on the Big Screen to be fully appreciated and enjoyed. Despite the fact that it has what I would call a small set qualityonce they begin the descent there are only 5 actors with regular lines and they are usually in close proximity to one another this is an Epic and deserves Epic viewing. Yes it has its share of Movie MistakesI noted that all the male actors remain clean shaven throughout and receive regular haircuts. In the scene where Pat Boone discovers the forest of mushrooms and they go hogwild eating them Arlene Dahl reminds them that they will soon find the taste of salt beef appealing it occurred to me than an individual could carry rations for at most 1 week and here it is the 256th day of the Expedition.The writers took liberties with Verne's story. In a program note handed out at the theater it was pointed the heroes were changed from Germans to Scots a Swede and an Icelander because 14 years after the end of WWII English speaking audiences would not accept German heroes. Arlene Dahl's character is a new addition what Verne stories I've read have almost no female characters. But in addition to eye appeal she also is the translator for Big Hans. Having first seen this movie as a 10 year old the battle of the sexes went completely over my head though 10 year old boys like to look at pretty ladies toothis time around I appreciated it especially as her character and her portrayal are of a strong willed and assertive womanthey had plenty of those in the 19th Century.Before the screening there were some introductory remarks. The host said the story can be seen as both straight adventure in a physical sense and as a psychological adventurepenetrating deeper into the human psyche with Count Saknussem representing the Dark Side of humankind but not completely evil. He said note how Bernard Herrman's score uses lower registers as they go deeper into the Earth.Some of Arlene Dahl's comments1. Gertrude the Duck had 4 stand ins she had one.2.

While the film's screenplay may have been a true cinematic rendering of the source novel by Jules Verne I could have wished for a film with more subterranean adventure and less prefatory fluff.The film's first 45 minute segment sets up the film's premise but it takes place totally above ground and could have been condensed to 10 or 15 minutes. There's lots of professorial bantering a youthful Pat Boone croons his sweetheart and he and the professor duel against adversaries in an unnecessary subplot.But once the explorers finally get underground the viewer is in for an absorbing cinematic experience despite a bloated script that has the cast chattering incessantly. Cinematography and special effects effectively convey the physical surroundings as a forbidding downward trending labyrinth characteristic of a giant cave.The sets are elaborate and imaginative though the mushroom forest is a tad too magical I kept waiting for Dorothy Toto and the cowardly lion to drop by and say hello from the set of the Emerald City.From start to finish the film has good acting and there's plenty of humor. And the sound effects and grim music are terrific. The organ music in particular lends a strikingly Gothic touch to the nether world look of the sunken city.Despite a too talky script this 1959 film deserves to be watched multiple times by kids of all ages for its timeless adventure and sense of discovery.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this day and age when relations between France and America are not terribly cordial one of the uniting factors in the past has been the popularity of author Jules Verne. If I had to guess I would say he was the most popular French author in the USA and has been that for some many decades now.His books set firmly in the 19th century offered a wonderful vision of things to come that our own deep seated curiosity will lead us to find. Someone out there correct me if I'm wrong but the very international Mr. Verne never had a French hero in any of us books. Science to him was not the property of one nation or man but something that should benefit us all.His characters for Journey to the Center of the Earth are from Scotland Sweden and Iceland. And the story begins in Scotland with Geology Professor James Mason getting a piece of unusual lava rock from student Pat Boone thereby setting in motion a chain of events that will take them to Iceland and a passage deep into the earth's bowels.James Mason heads a fine cast and does very well by the part of Professor Oliver Lindenbrook geology professor and explorer. The film opens at the University of Edinburgh. I am told that even today Edinburgh has kept it's historic traditions and look. The film does capture it in it's opening sequences. Arlene Dahl Swedish plays the widow of a Swedish professor who was a rival to James Mason and sought to beat him to the opening passage in Iceland. He's murdered and she has inherited all the equipment her husband has bought that James Mason needs and she blackmails him into taking her along. Of course that works out just fine for both of them.Also along is geology student Pat Boone. Now maybe someone who was a Scot should have played Alec McCowen but Boone was in his heyday as a teenage idol a clean cut Elvis. That sure brought in the teenybopper trade. Boone is a pleasant singer and he sings a Robert Burns poem set to Jimmy Van Heusen's music.Thayer David is the descendant of a Count Arne Saknussem who originally found the passage and David wants to keep it for himself. He's our villain and he follows our intrepid explorers into the earth. Peter Ronson is our native Icelander and since he speaks no English Arlene Dahl comes in handy as a translator. The most ridiculous part of the film is Ronson's insistence on bringing his pet goose along. I mean really what did he think would happen if they ran short of food?Verne's vision of a hollow Earth with an inner sea is not exactly accepted today. But that doesn't stop from making this a most entertaining piece of cinema.".

Like a lot of fantasy adventure films of the 1950s and 1960s ie.

Those of us who grew up in the 1950s think of this film fondly as a perfect Saturday matine entertainment. I can still remember sucking on my giant cherry lollipop flipping popcorn boxes against the screen and enjoying that very ominous Bernard Herrmann musical score.

Arlene Dahl is sexy in her tight bodice and Peter Ronson also performs well considering he had zero acting experience. James Mason's Professor Lindenbrook ties it all together nicely  it was probably his most physical role ever.

	schema:headline " A fun and engaging film true to the playful spirit of Jules Verne";
	schema:reviewBody "I suppose the best way to appreciate a widescreen Cinemascope film is to have seen it on a large movie theater screen in the first place.  I remember that day well back in Brewster NY late 1959.  My best friend David Vail and I were 7 years old apiece and thrilled at the prospect of being allowed to see the movie unsupervised a very rare privilege and the cavernous dark movie theatre only heightened the sense of mysterium tremens. We felt as if we were fellow travellers accompanying the Lindenbrook expedition on its mission to the center of the earth. Dimly aware that the film had scary elements we vowed not to eat any of our limited budget sweets until a truly scary moment appeared.  It took a while but it came. Many years later Spielberg and Lucas would pay homage to that moment in their throwback serial film Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark but in the intervening years I have had recurring dreams about being chased by a boulder down a narrow passageway.A Journey to the Center of the Earth is a movie I see over and over again. Chiefly because the story is compelling and true to the quasi whimsical and scientifically speculative writings of Jules Verne.  What I find appealing about Verne is that he is free from the cynical and existential bindings that have fettered other illustrious but more contemporary science fiction writers.  Verne goes about his business unshackled by theorems proofs and devastating world wars.  The industrial revolution is barely a generation old and science is making great leaps.  Anything is possible a trip to the moon a long voyage undersea a journey to the innermost recesses of our planet. While you watch the film it is easy to suspend your belief because you are forced to place yourself in the context of the Great Explorations. The story simply draws you in for the same reason the tale of Sir Ernest Shackleton draws you in or the accounts of the last days of Pompei or a superb story like Edgar Allen Poe's The Gold Bug draws you in.Levin's treatment of the tale is excellent.  This is one of those rare examples where the film is better than the book.  The dour trio of three male expedition members in the book is replaced by a balanced quartet adding a greater range of human interaction a little sexual tension without it condescending or demeaning ot the female character and a side plot the nefarious and righteous Count Saknussem. The preamble is longer and the conceit of using a plumb line as the key element McGuffin if you will is a stroke of narrative genius.  The movie loses no momentum by investing time in character development and the the reasons for setting up the expedition.  James Mason is perfect as the obsessed scientist.  Pat Boone does a fairly good job as the leading man and male ingenue.  Arlene Dahl is sophisticated and her Scandinavian background gives her role credibility.  Hans in probably the only movie role he ever played is more than adequate as the practical strong man.  then there's Gertrude played well by... a duck.The story is well paced nuanced and served well by a stunning score by one of the true masters of mood Bernard Herrmann.  At times airy and light the music also comments brilliantly on the action via horn arrangements and sultry chilling cellos that give a a deep sense of foreboding.On a deeply personal level I have in a strange way often compared this movie to the restlessness of the human spirit. Not merely the desire to physically travel explore and report back from unknown regions but in the spiritual sense to unravel the mystery of the self. As a 7 year old I would ponder the great inponderables life death God the meaning of existence and somehow this movie cheesy special effects and all has given me haunting sign posts that the only true travel is the voyage within.  So in a symbolic way A Journey to the Center of the Earth is the moviegoer's experience of the vast uncharted regions of our deeper self. I know most readers will dismiss these adumbrations of the personal cave within but I leave you with a few lines from a song that was popular in 1959...I know beyond a doubt my heart will lead me there soon we'll meet I know we'll meet beyond the shore we'll kiss just like before and happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again will I go sailing no more sailing.A Journey to the Center of the Earth has adventure whimsy and moments of awe with unexpected twists.

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose the best way to appreciate a widescreen Cinemascope film is to have seen it on a large movie theater screen in the first place.  I remember that day well back in Brewster NY late 1959.  My best friend David Vail and I were 7 years old apiece and thrilled at the prospect of being allowed to see the movie unsupervised a very rare privilege and the cavernous dark movie theatre only heightened the sense of mysterium tremens. We felt as if we were fellow travellers accompanying the Lindenbrook expedition on its mission to the center of the earth. Dimly aware that the film had scary elements we vowed not to eat any of our limited budget sweets until a truly scary moment appeared.  It took a while but it came. Many years later Spielberg and Lucas would pay homage to that moment in their throwback serial film Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark but in the intervening years I have had recurring dreams about being chased by a boulder down a narrow passageway.A Journey to the Center of the Earth is a movie I see over and over again. Chiefly because the story is compelling and true to the quasi whimsical and scientifically speculative writings of Jules Verne.  What I find appealing about Verne is that he is free from the cynical and existential bindings that have fettered other illustrious but more contemporary science fiction writers.  Verne goes about his business unshackled by theorems proofs and devastating world wars.  The industrial revolution is barely a generation old and science is making great leaps.  Anything is possible a trip to the moon a long voyage undersea a journey to the innermost recesses of our planet. While you watch the film it is easy to suspend your belief because you are forced to place yourself in the context of the Great Explorations. The story simply draws you in for the same reason the tale of Sir Ernest Shackleton draws you in or the accounts of the last days of Pompei or a superb story like Edgar Allen Poe's The Gold Bug draws you in.Levin's treatment of the tale is excellent.  This is one of those rare examples where the film is better than the book.  The dour trio of three male expedition members in the book is replaced by a balanced quartet adding a greater range of human interaction a little sexual tension without it condescending or demeaning ot the female character and a side plot the nefarious and righteous Count Saknussem. The preamble is longer and the conceit of using a plumb line as the key element McGuffin if you will is a stroke of narrative genius.  The movie loses no momentum by investing time in character development and the the reasons for setting up the expedition.  James Mason is perfect as the obsessed scientist.  Pat Boone does a fairly good job as the leading man and male ingenue.  Arlene Dahl is sophisticated and her Scandinavian background gives her role credibility.  Hans in probably the only movie role he ever played is more than adequate as the practical strong man.  then there's Gertrude played well by... a duck.The story is well paced nuanced and served well by a stunning score by one of the true masters of mood Bernard Herrmann.  At times airy and light the music also comments brilliantly on the action via horn arrangements and sultry chilling cellos that give a a deep sense of foreboding.On a deeply personal level I have in a strange way often compared this movie to the restlessness of the human spirit. Not merely the desire to physically travel explore and report back from unknown regions but in the spiritual sense to unravel the mystery of the self. As a 7 year old I would ponder the great inponderables life death God the meaning of existence and somehow this movie cheesy special effects and all has given me haunting sign posts that the only true travel is the voyage within.  So in a symbolic way A Journey to the Center of the Earth is the moviegoer's experience of the vast uncharted regions of our deeper self. I know most readers will dismiss these adumbrations of the personal cave within but I leave you with a few lines from a song that was popular in 1959...I know beyond a doubt my heart will lead me there soon we'll meet I know we'll meet beyond the shore we'll kiss just like before and happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again will I go sailing no more sailing.A Journey to the Center of the Earth has adventure whimsy and moments of awe with unexpected twists.  The characters are at the mercy of the caprices of the nether regions.  At times you feel as if the characters are journeying through unpopulated Dantesque landscapes other times through the richness of primordial and unspoiled prehistoric settings.  The voyagers start off darkly in the early teluric going and then by degrees the subterranean world glistens in a unexpected reversal of all that we are led to believe exists below our feet.  The variety of visual delights is breathtaking.This is my favourite film of all time.  I have seen it 4050 times and always find a detail or two at each screening that is imaginative and inspiring.  See it if you can in wide screen.  You will appreciate it more.";

The moments of humor and the personal interactions and typical personality clashes between the characters of James Mason and Arlene Dahl just added to the reality of conflict between strong men and strong women of that period BTW I was really happy for the way this film ended. The visual affects of the scenes are breathtaking the spectacular view atop the mountain their descent into what looked like an abyss their amazing escapes from several dangerous situations the underground ocean and those lipsmacking lizards. The inclusion of the duck was an added relief and contrast to that which they were experiencing. When they were trapped by all that water and rather frantic there was Gertrude the duck having a fine time in the water. The acting to this amateur connoisseur of classic movies was perfect. Something else that surprised but pleased me was that religious faith was allowed to be expressed in that they started their journey with prayer and prayer was interspersed throughout their adventures. Though this isn't a religious film it depicts the lives of these people in a complete and natural way.

A citizen of Ohio Captain Symmes wanted the federal government to organize an expedition to go into the Pacific then head for the south pole. And once there Captain Symmes believed they would find a huge hole  and once you entered it you would find that the interior of the entire earth was hollow from pole to pole. The inside would be quite temperate even tropical. Possibly it could be settled by Americans.In the late days of the second administration of President Andrew Jackson Symmes got his wish. The U.S. Exploration Expedition was commissioned to do an in depth survey of the whole Pacific and go as far south as possible. But Symmes was not chosen to lead it  it was lead by Captain Charles Wilkes a temperamental career naval officer. In the end Wilkes was at sea for four years 1838  1842 it began officially in the Van Buren administration and ended in the Tyler administration. It's outstanding accomplishment was Wilkes discovery of the continent of Antarctica. Wilkes had some problems he was given a court martial for some error in judgment but he survived to commit a diplomatic disaster in 1861 called the Trent Affair and ending up a rear admiral before being retired by Lincoln during the Civil War.Symmes did not see any of this. His daughter Anne married a young army hero and political wouldbe named William Henry Harrison. In 1840 Symmes' soninlaw was elected President of the United States. He only served a month March 4  April 4 1841 before becoming the first President to die in office.Nobody has ever found proof that Symmes theoretical hollow earth theory was remotely possible. We certainly have never found any connecting temperate world between the two poles. But the theory was discussed seriously in American and Europe. And one of those who latched unto it was Jules Verne who uses it in his novel JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.The novel and the film are not the same. First of all the name of the professor is not Lindenbrook a Scottsman but Liedenbrock a German. Some editions give his name as Professor Von Hardwigg. Secondly except for Arne Saknassum no member of his family is in the novel. There is no pet duck named Gertrude. There is no romantic pair of ladies to pair off with James Mason and Pat Boone. All those were added to the script by other writers than Verne.Still despite it's false premise with the Hollow Earth and all of these changes it is a fun film. Mason and Arlene Dahl make an interesting paring Diane Baker and Pat Boone a reasonably good junior couple. Thayer David a familiar and welcome performer in his day finally had a decent lead role in this film. So I do recommend watching the movie for all it's flaws.".

Although it's very small and didn't look too important it was very well needed to hold the water back.As I said the cast was very good even the duck found itself a very useful role in this film even though I did think the relationship between the duck and the man was quite strange perhaps even a bit disturbing. Nevertheless thumbs up for this movie.";

When they do the find their lives do in fact change drastically though in quite unexpected ways. The characters are threedimensional and complex and it is apparent that they just like real people have issues in their lives  sometimes very serious ones  that have gone unresolved for many years. The dialogue is realistic but relaxed and includes a lot of repetition of lines Joe Willie and Al are all starting to lose their faculties somewhat and occasionally need repetition from each other. This makes the pacing deceptively slow when you think back on the film after watching it though you find that a whole lot happened in those 97 minutes.Going in Style has no caricatures except perhaps Joes attorney and though the problems of old age are presented in a matteroffact way the film is never preachy. It should also be noted that it is gratifying to see a movie in which younger members of a family Pete and Kathy show such genuine respect and kindness to their elders.All the leads are terrific but Burns is perfection itself as Joe.This film is very highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A masterful comedy that's also a touching portrait of old age";
	schema:reviewBody "I've found it's almost impossible to predict what my opinion will be on a film that I haven't seen in many years. I recently rented both The Out of Towners 1970 and Going in Style. I hadn't seen either since at least the early 1980s when I was still a teen. Before watching this time I would have predicted that they were both about equally goodthat's what I remember from my earlier assessments. However I ended up being slightly disappointed with The Out of Towners while I was blown out of the water by how excellent Going in Style is.This is a film that's best to watch knowing as little as possible about the plot beforehand. For those who must know something of the story however it concerns three elderly men who are living together in Astoria Queens part of New York CityJoe George Burns Al Art Carney and Willie Lee Strasberg. They're on Social Security which doesn't provide a lot of moneythat's why they're living together. They spend most of their days in a park near their apartment feeding pigeons watching children play and so on. Joe comes up with a very unusual idea to supplement their income and put some excitement in their lives. The first half of the film involves planning and carrying out the idea. The second half deals with the aftermath and is kind of an extended character study.The most remarkable characteristic of Going in Style is that writer and director Martin Brest with cowriter Edward Cannon managed to make a film that has elements of both almost absurdist comedy and deeply moving realist drama coexisting at the same time. Going in Style is a poignant portrait of old age occasionally deeply sad and even pessimistic but also very funny and the three principal characters possess an almost Zenlike satiety calmness and wisdom.It's interesting to note that Brest later went on to direct films as diverse as Beverly Hills Cop 1984 and Meet Joe Black 1998. Going in Style has elements of bothBeverly Hills Cop's wacky crimecomedy and involved plot structure and Meet Joe Black's emotionally impactful minimalism and socialphilosophical subtexts. Another way to describe the film might be in terms of another director Woody Allen. Imagine Allen making Take the Money and Run 1969 or Bananas 1971 but in a mood much closer to Alice 1990 or even September 1987.The performances are excellent but Burns especially stands out. Joe is a very different character for him much more serious and gruffhe's almost a bit of a heavy. If Burns had been just a bit younger Going in Style shows that he could have easily had a career makeoverturnaround via Quentin Tarantino similar to John Travolta. Carney and Strasberg both easily paint complex characters as well and the chemistry of any two or more of them together is simply magical.Brest showing early inclinations towards minimalism peppers the film with many extremely effective pregnant pauses. These enable the cast to subtly stretch their mastery of comic timing and give more depth to the tragic or seriously emotional scenes. In both its comic and tragic modes Going in Style tends to be a relatively quiet filmthe toneatmosphere reflects that Zenlike disposition that Brest and his cast create for the characters. We could easily see most of the film's action growing out of the pregnant pauses. Brest emphasizes this by loading early scenes with such pauses such as when our protagonist trio are sitting on the park bench and hatching their plan.The above might sound a bit ridiculous or overly abstract to some but keep in mind that it's all part of Brest's touching portrait of old age an incredible feat for a 27year old writerdirector by the way. Joe Al and Willie live day by day because they figure that each might literally be their last day. They're not in a hurry to do anything. They prefer to soak up the fullness of each instant. They're mostly content with their lives and have accepted their mortal fates. Their scheme is relatively easy to pull off because with the slight exception of Willie who interestingly has some issues from the past he is still trying to deal with and is thus a bit less comfortable with the present they look at it as just another thing they can experience before they check out of the world with the consequences of the scheme no matter what they are all having their advantages.Brest works in a bit of sly social commentary more conspicuously into the script as well. One example is the radio announcer who notes that the Gray Panthers are capitalizing on the events as a means to underscore the U.S.'s neglect of old folks. This is doubly clever because not only is the claim literally true there are subtexts about opportunism media influence and so on. The above example is actually a very small detail in the film but this is a film that has a wealth of such small details.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Burns was truly one of the most amazing entertainers of all time. For almost forty years he was part of the comedy team of Burns and Allen and then after Gracie passed away he was forgotten for many years however he made one of the most amazing comebacks in Hollywood history when he played Al Lewis in The Sunshine Boys. Can you imagine this amazing achievement? George was 79 years old when this film was made and had never really acted in the traditional sense of playing an imaginary role and yet he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor!!!The Book Of Lists mentioned this as one of the most amazing accomplishments ever at an advanced age!!Then George played another great role in the Oh God series. This man defied belief! Going In Style was in a sense his first dramatic role and he pulled it off with equal brilliance! Yes this was not a happy film to watch. In fact I was 11 when my dad took me to see it and he commented that it was basically a very depressing story about three old men waiting to die. George has two fine costars in Art Carney and Lee Strasburg who was one of the most legendary acting coaches of all time. Strasburg's role is small and he dies early on and leaves the show to Art and George. They pull it off wonderfully! It is a joy watching these two old pros at work. I wrote to Art Carney several years ago and asked him what it was like working with George Burns and he told me that George was a joy to work with and a real pro and one of the nicest people he ever worked with! They must have had a ball doing this film and it certainly shows! Even though George masterminded a bank robbery and it showed him holding a gunit all seemed so innocent and nice. Martin Brest directed this film he has had a wildly uneven career but this was one of his outstanding early efforts he later went on to direct the blockbuster Beverly Hills Cop and also directed the recent bomb of all time Gigli. However Going In Style is a fine film even though its not a happy viewing experience. I think that the saddest scene in the film is where George is looking thru some old photos of himself as a young man and breaks down crying and wets himself. It is a very hard scene to watch indeed.".

This film is a delight in a very New York and very lowkey fashion with hardly any grand scenes or setups but with great writing sharp dialog and the three leads giving their very best. Although the film was marketed as a comedy it's above all a heartfelt drama and a truly moving portrayal of old age. One of the highlights when the three seniors are on a little trip to Manhattan and Art Carney starts dancing to the rhythms some Caribbean Street musicians. It's such a marvel to see 80year old George Burns clapping and smiling and genuinely having fun at this improvised street scene. It's a shame this film is practically forgotten. A heartfelt funny and ultimately a very moving picture. Don't miss this one.Camera Obscura  910".

It would have been so easy to make a caper film or a malebonding buddy picture but Brest does it the hard way so that we care about the characters and not the story. He fills each role with actors who look real not pretty like Charles Hallahan as Pete. He looks like someone who's worked all his life not a person sent down by central casting.And he is unafraid to let silence play a roll. How many directors would find 'suitable' music to waft in and out of the soundtrack as the three amigos occupy their bench? Here they sit in blessed silence until we wonder who will speak next since Willie does not seem to want to open his mouth. When they get to Vegas it would be so easy to do quick cuts of their winning streak with appropriate music blasting but Brest stretches the scene so that we are not sure if they will keep their gains.Any sentiment comes hard earned like watching Joe stumbling around the apartment after the death of Willie finding his own album of photographs and reflecting only to have nature spoil the mood.".

Three men who've partially lost their identities in no longer being able to carry on their vocations.  As more and more of us will be moving into the retired or seniors group this movie shows us both the problems of retirement and one very entertaining and interesting solution.  All three characters are at an age which is too often ignored in motion pictures. Though basically this movie isn't exactly moral it's a very good insight into the lives of its characters.  Art Carney is an accomplished actor and George Burns was an accomplished entertainer.  I'm not sure how many people know that Lee Strasberg was one of if not the great teacher of dramatic acting during his lifetime.  In Going In Style Strasberg as the not always up to speed character Willie is nevertheless often a bit of a surprise.  All three men portraying the various ways we age give a beautiful performance each in his own way.  As a minor collector I consider the motion picture the major art form of the past century. That's not to say that all the movies made during the last century are works or art but quite often many were.  It remains to be seen whether that tradition will be carried on into the new century before us.  Whatever I am very grateful for the gift of this movie and highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Love Going In Style with George and Art...";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a saying 'those who can do those who can't teach'I'll come back to this in a minute.Going In Style's a film in a style I love it's a terrific 'caper' film but this time instead of the usual types of crooks i.e. the excons just outta the joint who wanna make one big score or the group of misfits who are brought together by a central character but each member has their own hidden agendas it's 3 men  3 old men who find sitting on a park bench quietly  'enough activity' for one day.When I grew up I was never a fan of George Burns  it seemed the media made him out to be a monument to longevity and Mr. Burns being no fool  gave them what they wanted and he got the cheques! the sweet slightly lecherous geriatric grandpatype  in a tux with a stogie in mouth.Mr. Carney had done the Honeymooners and though I never enjoyed the series I always found Art a very interesting actor who wasn't given too many chances to show what he could do. The previous film he excelled in  Harry and Tonto  was made 5 years prior then again Hollywood doesn't give ANY actors  esp. those over 40 and especially women many leading roles so I know it wasn't Mr. Carney's not wanting to work.The 3 actors are 3 men who all have very different takes on what it means to be 'older' in New York City.Joe George Burns is bitter at his lot in life. Al Art Carney is the 'middle'  he tries to be jovial but there's an underlying pathos. The last and to me  least of the trio is played by Lee Strasberg as Willie  he's really almost a catatonic shell  so burnt out  either for real or just doesn't give a rat's behind he's mentally off in the ther  former feeding the pigeons until it's his turn.Now Mr. Strasberg founded the Actor's Studio in New York City and many illustrious actors were associated with it  and the 'Method' style acting including Marlon Brando and ah! the supremely underappreciated Marilyn Monroe.Mr. Strasberg's appearances in film or on stage are very limited  and though some may say this was because he was 'busy training actors' my personal feeling  of his talent are very limited.Back to the opening quote that's a direct jab at Mr. Strasberg. Though I truly enjoy this film I think the one thing which weighs it down is Strasberg and I thank the editor's for making his non performance as least irritating as possible in 'Method' acting  the 'Cliff notes' version the actor has to have 'motivation'  understanding for everything about their character. I know I'm saying this very simplistically I don't want to bore those not interested. What many critics of this style of acting used to say was they 'Method' actors were 'mumblers' they spent so much time getting 'into character' that most of the time was just 'froufrou'. True there wereare some very brilliant performances but byandlarge I think that if one were to weigh 'great' against 'poor' Method performances the scale would be tipped heavily in the 'poor' direction.If one is  like me  someone who watches a film from differing 'aspects' i.e. focusing on one performance during one viewing etc. then when I'm seeingfocusing on Strasberg's performance he literally comes off as a shuffling mentally vapid old shell.Now that I've told you what I think is the dross I turn to the other 23rd's Burns and Carney.Burns does a delightful 180's on the 'old lecherous geriatric' he'd been playing for the better part of the decade on various network specials. Here' he's foulmouthed and I love his disposition. He's giving us the 'other side'  sadly what's more the reality for many older people who are for betterorworse  forgotten by loved ones or outlived loved ones. He's not 'happy' to be in his 'golden years'! He's not hanging out as he is on those treacly network specials with Loni Anderson ugh and Brooke Shields. He's angry and boy does he have a right to be.He's left with 49mo social security 163.29 in 2016! That's inexcusable that someone who's worked their whole lives and is only here for a short while longer is left in such a sorry state.In the middle is Mr. Carney' s Al who  though not as outwardly angry by what's their 'lot' in life as Joe he's a bit more complacent but I see in his effort to humour Joe a sadness. He still sings songs from 'back when' he's trying to hold on  in a optimistic way.The writing by Mr. Brest who was a 'kid'  only 28  when he wrote and directed this ! is wise beyond those 28 years in the writing  the character's 'voices' are so well shaped and the direction is also good.If you want to see a good film which shows just what all those people we ALL see sitting on those benches would secretly love to do themselves watch Going In Style.You'll have laughs and as with any competent 'caper' flick plenty of thrills.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's a saying 'those who can do those who can't teach'I'll come back to this in a minute.Going In Style's a film in a style I love it's a terrific 'caper' film but this time instead of the usual types of crooks i.e. the excons just outta the joint who wanna make one big score or the group of misfits who are brought together by a central character but each member has their own hidden agendas it's 3 men  3 old men who find sitting on a park bench quietly  'enough activity' for one day.When I grew up I was never a fan of George Burns  it seemed the media made him out to be a monument to longevity and Mr. Burns being no fool  gave them what they wanted and he got the cheques! the sweet slightly lecherous geriatric grandpatype  in a tux with a stogie in mouth.Mr. Carney had done the Honeymooners and though I never enjoyed the series I always found Art a very interesting actor who wasn't given too many chances to show what he could do. The previous film he excelled in  Harry and Tonto  was made 5 years prior then again Hollywood doesn't give ANY actors  esp. those over 40 and especially women many leading roles so I know it wasn't Mr. Carney's not wanting to work.The 3 actors are 3 men who all have very different takes on what it means to be 'older' in New York City.Joe George Burns is bitter at his lot in life. Al Art Carney is the 'middle'  he tries to be jovial but there's an underlying pathos. The last and to me  least of the trio is played by Lee Strasberg as Willie  he's really almost a catatonic shell  so burnt out  either for real or just doesn't give a rat's behind he's mentally off in the ther  former feeding the pigeons until it's his turn.Now Mr. Strasberg founded the Actor's Studio in New York City and many illustrious actors were associated with it  and the 'Method' style acting including Marlon Brando and ah! the supremely underappreciated Marilyn Monroe.Mr. Strasberg's appearances in film or on stage are very limited  and though some may say this was because he was 'busy training actors' my personal feeling  of his talent are very limited.Back to the opening quote that's a direct jab at Mr. Strasberg. Though I truly enjoy this film I think the one thing which weighs it down is Strasberg and I thank the editor's for making his non performance as least irritating as possible in 'Method' acting  the 'Cliff notes' version the actor has to have 'motivation'  understanding for everything about their character. I know I'm saying this very simplistically I don't want to bore those not interested.

To their astonishment they nearly clean the place out. When Al dies after the trip Joe decides to give himself up...Burns had not acted in years when in 1975 producer Ray Stark cast him as one of Neil Simon's 'The Sunshine Boys'  Walter Matthau being the other . Burns' quiet dignified performance contrasted greatly with the more flamboyant Matthau's and he won an Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor'. Other movie roles came his way such as the title role in Larry Gelbart's wonderful 'Oh God!'. 'Going In Style' featured him along with two other Hollywood greats and all worked together superbly. From the hilarious opening scene in the park where an obnoxious little boy fixes Joe with a look of dumb insolence and he says the boy's head 'looks like a china p pot' you cannot help but love the guy. The excitement the men feel as they prepare for the robbery is infectious at last they have something interesting to do with what is left of their lives. You root for them every step of the way.This was the first film from Martin Brest who later made Eddie Murphy's 'Beverly Hills Cop' and the disastrous 'Gigli'. It is a shame he did not do more like this.'Style' is by turns funny and sad. A better movie on the subject of old age I have yet to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "An old adage says There's a little bit of larceny in all of us. Judging from most of the 27 reviews posted before this one it must be true. Like most others I pull for the three oldtimers in this film to be able to get away with their heist. Going in Style is billed as a comedy crime and drama. Most of the comments are on the comedy so no more needs to be said about that. Only a few people weighed in on the serious side of this film  and it has a serious side clearly. This differs greatly from the genre of crime capers. A bank or any other stick up is not a laughing matter. They pulled an armed robbery. The fact that no one in the bank initially took them seriously seemed an effort to play down the dark side of the film. But when Joe fires a shot from his gun that smashes a clock it puts fear into the bank staff and clients. Earlier in the film Joe says A stickup guy I used to know a long time ago told me that the most important thing is to put fear into everybody right away. Then Willie asks at one point What if we get shot? Already this heist for the excitement of it was on the edge of violence. People who have experienced or had family or friends experience violence  in any and many forms don't soon forget the fear and sense of helplessness. So Joe Al and Willie are having an adrenalin rush with a little excitement at the expense of several dozen people likely fearing for their lives. These three senior citizens probably go back together a long time  maybe to childhood or a neighborhood. So they are friends and they live together. Willie was a taxi driver most of his life and he lost a son by the son's 21st birthday. Al was a bartender and apparently had some other jobs. I don't think the film ever gives a hint of what Joe had done for a living. They all know Al's nephew Pete and his wife Kathy and that couple seems to know Al's friends quite well. We know nothing else about their marriages spouses or families. The implication is that they didn't have families except for Willie in the past or if they did there are no surviving spouses or children. So two of the three never had responsibility for others. Now the three of them live off their social security which they pool for their apartment food and living expenses. But they're not poor or destitute. Joe says it would be nice to have more money so they could travel or go somewhere exotic. But he really wants to pull a stickup because he is bored with life. And with what the film shows of their daily routine one can surely understand the boredom. And that's part of the sad aspect of this film.Why did they just go every day to a boardwalk or park and do nothing else? They had no hobbies and did nothing at all to have fun or enjoyment. Al showed a little spunk for life which probably came from his visits with Pete and his family including a couple of grandkids. These guys didn't even play checkers dominoes or cards. They didn't read. They had no other hobbies no other place where they hung out with other people. They didn't volunteer any place and had no other interests. And that's why they were bored. Compare these three guys citybred and living all their lives mostly without family with John Gustafson Jack Lemmon and Max Goldman Walter Matthau in Grumpy Old Men of 1993. Even as friendly enemies in retirement and old age they had friends some family and interests with things to do. As others noted the acting by all of the cast in this film is good. George Burns Art Carney and Lee Strasberg are really oldtimers. But the mostly darksided comedy of Going in Style is diminished by the sad state of the three oldtimers. That makes this film more of a tragedy than anything else. In spite of Joe's wink to Pete at the end as Joe is led back into his prison cell it's never right to pull an armed robbery. Nor does an end justify any means. Unfortunately this film seems to send the opposite message.".

Here he's joined by George Burns and Lee Strasberg as retirees trying to make ends meet as their lives hit the doldrums sitting on park benches and watching the rest of their years pass by. One thing I had to check was the ages of the three actors in the picture Carney is actually the youngster of this group at sixty one when the film was made. Strasberg was seventy eight and Burns was eighty one with another two decades to go! Once all the shenanigans with the bank job are out of the way the story turns poignant for Joe Harris Burns as he has to endure the passing of his two long time buddies. Burns as expected is wonderful in the role though I wish director Martin Brest had made him a gentler curmudgeon in that scene with the bratty looking kid in the park. He cursed the kid out twice and that didn't seem in keeping with his character. But then again he concocted the robbery scheme and threw caution to the wind at the gaming tables. For the sake of the story I'll go along with the seventy grand haul in Las Vegas but it does make you wonder if they could have pulled it off for real.Apart from the story I did a major double take when the camera panned that cemetery that was filmed for the movie. Holy cow  it was huge! So much so that I had to look it up. Assuming it was in or close to the Astoria Queens neighborhood the three elderly gents lived in a search came up with the Calvary Cemetery in Astoria. It's one of the oldest cemeteries in the country and one of the largest in terms of interments with get this  over three million burials! It's always very cool when a movie leads me to an interesting bit of trivia like that. So now you know too.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story is about the retirees. First there's Willie played by the legendary acting coachactor Lee Strasberg. Second there's Al played by Honeymooners Icon Art Carney. Thirdly there's Joe played by George Burns. Joe the leader the glue that holds the three together who allshare an apartment in Queens New York. Being retired and the rising cost of living and basically relying on social security checks the three men seem to get along together. The three forgotten souls spend most of their remaining time sitting on a park bench watching the world go by with nothing to look forward to. We really no nothing about their past lives except for upsetting comments made by Willie about his handling of his Son and his regrettable actions toward the boy. We want to learn more but a composed Joe handles Willie sorrows. I always admired George Burns work on the Screen and television. George always showed a composure and coolness to his role with outstanding results. Never demonstrative or raised his voice. Just an even keel on any situation. He never showed a drop of anxiety ever. Perfectly cast to play the Lord in those Gd movies and why not. Back to our story... Joe decides to rob a bank just to break up the mundane lifestyle the three men of leisure have. Perfectly planned the three seniors travel to their first bank job by way of a cab Too old to drive or expire licenses. Oh yes did I mention their armed? Anyway the three enter the bank donned in Halloween masks as they announce a stickup. They accidentally fire their weapon to the ceiling and their message was received as everyone hit the floor for safety. The three elders collected what they could in cash and headed out of the bank toward the Subway for home. Deep down Joe felt it was a matter of time that the police would catch them. The Next morning Joe and Al find Willie dead in his bed of natural causes. During Willies funeral you meet Al's extended family. Nephew Pete Charles Hallahan and his wife Kathy Pamela Payton Wright with their adorable daughter Colleen who's Uncle Al's pride and joy. On a whim Al and Joe fly out to Las Vegas and try to gamble some of the hot money away. The scene at the craps table is my favorite. As Al takes a beginner's guide to craps under the calm direction of Joe. Do they squander it all at the table? Do the Police catch up to them? Believe it or not there more twist and turns to this comedic yet poignant story. George Burns and Art Carney work well together throughout this movie. The kind of movie you'll watch again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three elderly roommates on Social Security decide to rob a bank in Going in Style a 1979 film directed by Martin Brest. It stars three great masters George Burns Art Carney and Lee Strasberg who is probably more famous as an acting teacher.These three spend their final years sitting in the park watching children play the birds and occasionally talking. Joe Burns comes up with the idea and the other two go along. Wearing Grouch Marx disguises they walk into the bank with guns and tell everyone to hit the floor. The bank manager thinks they're joking until Joe shoots the clock.The big problem the guys have is what are they going to do with all the money? They don't really need it for anything.The performances in this film are marvelous particularly from Burns who has the largest role. He can make you laugh and break your heart. In one scene when Al's Art Carney nephew and his family take Al to their place for a few days Joe sits alone and looks at his old photos. A very touching scene.All of these men demonstrate the emptiness of old age when one feels he is no longer useful when most friends and family are gone when you're not sick but not well either. Life becomes a series of endless days. On the other hand they take each day as it comes and something like a bank robbery doesn't intimidate them too much. They've seen it all there aren't too many surprises left.There actually is quite an age difference among these three men. Burns was 83 at the time of the film's release Carney was actually 22 years younger and Strasberg was four years younger than Burns. Strasberg is obviously the most frail. He died three years after this film was released.Sweet film showing again that old age isn't for sissies.".

The plot has a couple of minor holes the only one worth mentioning is that there's really no indication at all as to how the police figured out who to pursue but the foundation of this film is the absolutely remarkable performance by George Burns who proved that he was not only a comedian and a beloved personality but a true actor. His performance is deeply emotional and entirely convincing. It really is a masterful performance in every way. He had won an Oscar for the not so good The Sunshine Boys so the Academy voters had likely figured that he had already been honored but surely he should have been handed another Oscar for Going in Style. This film is a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elizabeth Taylor plays Barbara Sawyer wife to Henry Fonda who shows up late in the film for 30 years who has not aged well to say the least. She goes to Europe and receives plastic surgery in an attempt to save her marriage. Will her restored youth appeal to her husband or will she have to start life over and be strong enough to do so? This is the premise of Ash Wednesday a syrupy soap opera in the ugly duckling to beautiful swan tradition. Maybe you're a fan of Liz Taylor and sought this movie out or maybe you just managed to catch it on late night cable and there was nothing else on. Either way you probably realized that this movie wasn't exactly high caliber. But in humble defense I will praise an excellent musical score beautiful on location scenery and elegant Edith Head designed fashions. The premise of the movie is a good one and it could have made for a very interesting film had the screenwriter or director had any amount of talent. But the dialogue and direction are both flat. Certain scenes seem pointless and unfulfilled. However the main point of the movie is to show loving close ups and profiles of 41 year old Taylor looking beautiful again. And yes with a lot more makeup and just the right camera angle we the audience are transplanted back to those fabulous 50's movies when Taylor didn't have to act or even speak to transfix your gaze upon her and hold it rapt. Rating for Ash Wednesday for any viewer. out of 4 For Liz Taylor fans. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Ash Wednesday from l973 marked Elizabeth Taylor's last glamour movie. After winning her Oscar for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe Taylor was urged by new husband Richard Burton to take on more quirky roles that downplayed and thus damaged her phenomenal movie career as a legendary beauty. When she accepted the role of Barbara an aging middleaged socialite who goes to Switzerland to have a body lift Burton was enraged that she would take such a dumb role. We have to laugh. Burton by now was notorious for picking roles that resulted in box office bombs like Exorcist II Bluebeard Under Milkwood Staircase etc. Ash Wednesday was filmed at the luxurious resort village of Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy. Here we see a stunning Elizabeth Taylorat lastclothed in knockout fashions from the hands of Edith Head. Beautiful gowns robes of velvet furs galore hairstyles from Alexandre of Paris rapturous photography by Ennio Guarnieri and best of all a oneofakind white ermine costume to wear at the movie's mardi gras. Taylor's costar was nearly as beautiful as she Helmut Berger. Burton was convinced the two were having a real affair. Everyone laughed because it was known that the gorgeous Berger was the lover of Italian movie director Luchino Visconti. Taylor looks phenomenal throughout with numerous loving closeups that show why the world had fallen in love with her. We have a beautiful musical score by Maurice Jarre but the biggest casting error is a glum grim Henry Fonda who portrays her dullasdishwater husband. That male beauty Rod Taylor of the '70s would have been ideal. Producer Dominick Dunne wrote in his memoirs that there was more drama behind the scenes of this movie than in front it. Taylor and Burton had operatic confrontations over who was sleeping with who. He tried to physically prevent her from appearing on the set. The actress was often late sometimes never showed up for work overdosed several timesyet none of this shows up on screen. Ash Wednesday is a movie to be treasured by Taylor fansand we are in the millionsor anyone else who wants to see a fabulous beauty making her swan song to oldstyle glamour. She would never appear so uncannily beautiful again.".

To me it is much more akin in spirit to Shirley Valentine. Woman estranged from her husband in foreign country amidst beautiful scenery a change of life etc. For once a woman having a costar old enough to be her father actually works with the script! Taylor's acting here is more subtle than it had been in the previous decade and it works. I could not relate to a woman who goes to such lengths for her husbands affection but she is playing a woman of a bygone era and almost twenty years older than she was at the time the woman playing her daughter could easily have played her sister in another film. This is a very slowly paced film but by golly you can't help but root for Taylor to find some solace just like Shirley V. All of this leads up to an inevitable confrontation with her husband and the movie keeps you guessing to the end what will happen between them. Was it worth it? I won't tell. Knowing what we now know about the kind of father and husband Henry Fonda was in real life can't help but taint the viewing of him in this role. But hey they could've gotten Bing Crosby. All in all I saw this movie on video about nine years ago and as you can see it has stayed with me. So check it out it beats the heck out of anything on Lifetime.".

The scenery around Cortina is absolutely exquisite and Elizabeth Taylor's costumes and hair styling are superb. This film is entertaining as it exposes the dangers of thinking that surgery will right problems that no knife can successfully cut away. This film is pure escapism. Enjoy it for what it is. It is an interesting look at lifestyles of the rich in the early 1970s in Europe. Elizabeth Taylor has some great lines.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Burton hated this movie calling is a fing bloody lousy nothing film I must strongly disagree. Ash Wednesday paints a haunting picture of a plastic surgery hospital with patients walking around like zombies with bandages over their heads in a last desperate bid to be young again. As Keith Baxter's character puts it we all simply refuse to accept reality. One moment during the film is in which a group of patients are playing cards reminds me of the 'waxworks' scene from Sunset Boulevard. Realistic or not this whole section of the movie is eerie and effective. Even after Elizabeth Taylor has left the hospital there is this continuing sense of unease as if she has just sold her soul to the devil helped in part by Maurice Jarre's music score. The movie's theme of fading beauty is made all the more poignant since its Elizabeth Taylor of all people doing the role.The first act of Ash Wednesday features graphic scenes of plastic surgery. Watching the film I didn't know if they were real or just really convincing special effects. Nope it turns out it is real footage with skin being cut open and plenty of exposed flesh in close up detail. I do wonder who is actually under the knife in this footage but it is an effectively put together sequence in which I believed Elizabeth Taylor's character was the one undertaking plastic surgery. The opening credits of the film feature a series of cut and paste photographs of Elizabeth Taylor and Henry Fonda in an effort to make it appear they have been a married couple as they age over the years. Fonda being much older than Taylor in real life these series of photos feature the two at the same age periods so a photo of Fonda in the 30's will be cut and paste with a picture of Taylor from the 50's. It's not entirely convincing but is neat to look at.What I appreciate most about Ash Wednesday is just honest the storytelling is. Taylor's husband played by Henry Fonda simply doesn't love her anymore there is no sexual attraction between the two them and they don't satisfy each other's needs anymore yet he doesn't come off as a jerk getting these points across. Untimely the two learn to accept this but not without having an understanding of each other and move on with their lives.Ash Wednesday has yet to ever see the light of day on DVD remaining VHS only.".

One moment during the film is in which a group of patients are playing cards reminds me of the 'waxworks' scene from Sunset Boulevard. Realistic or not this whole section of the movie is eerie and effective. Even after Elizabeth Taylor has left the hospital there is this continuing sense of unease as if she has just sold her soul to the devil helped in part by Maurice Jarre's music score. The movie's theme of fading beauty is made all the more poignant since its Elizabeth Taylor of all people doing the role.The first act of Ash Wednesday features graphic scenes of plastic surgery. Watching the film I didn't know if they were real or just really convincing special effects. Nope it turns out it is real footage with skin being cut open and plenty of exposed flesh in close up detail. I do wonder who is actually under the knife in this footage but it is an effectively put together sequence in which I believed Elizabeth Taylor's character was the one undertaking plastic surgery. The opening credits of the film feature a series of cut and paste photographs of Elizabeth Taylor and Henry Fonda in an effort to make it appear they have been a married couple as they age over the years. Fonda being much older than Taylor in real life these series of photos feature the two at the same age periods so a photo of Fonda in the 30's will be cut and paste with a picture of Taylor from the 50's. It's not entirely convincing but is neat to look at.What I appreciate most about Ash Wednesday is just honest the storytelling is. Taylor's husband played by Henry Fonda simply doesn't love her anymore there is no sexual attraction between the two them and they don't satisfy each other's needs anymore yet he doesn't come off as a jerk getting these points across. Untimely the two learn to accept this but not without having an understanding of each other and move on with their lives.Ash Wednesday has yet to ever see the light of day on DVD remaining VHS only.";

The leads kind of go through the motions in their roles though some of the supporting players really carry this film.Robert Taylor was never comfortable in those 'iron jockstrap' movies as he called them. But he was the most dutiful employee MGM had and like Errol Flynn with westerns Taylor just went with the flow. Funny thing is Taylor much preferred doing westerns as he reached his forties.Was there ever a more beautiful Guinevere than Ava Gardner? I sincerely doubt it. If she never spoke a line in the film you know this is a woman for whom you toss convention out for. Ava was in the middle of her tempestuous marriage to Frank Sinatra at the time so I'm sure she was preoccupied.And next to Richard Burton on stage and Richard Harris on the screen Mel Ferrer looks positively colorless. Not the guy to command the loyalty the legendary king was supposed to do.But I did like the performances of Felix Aylmer as Merlin Anne Crawford as Morgan Le Fay and Stanley Baker as Mordred. Felix Aylmer was never bad in anything he ever did always a figure of wisdom and dignity in any role. Morgan Le Fay is quite the schemer here and Anne Crawford brings her to life. Sadly Ms. Crawford died only two years later of leukemia at age 36. American audiences probably only know her for this film but she's fantastic.But the best performance in the film has to be Stanley Baker. He was a rugged tough man in every film he did good guy or bad guy. His Mordred has depth and passion and he's unrelenting in his plans to topple Arthur and the Round Table.If they gave Oscars out for performances by animals than Robert Taylor's horse Varick would have won it that year. Except for Roy Rogers's Trigger I don't think we've ever had a smarter movie horse. He's obedient and well trained and knight's horse certainly had to be back in the day. And he saves Taylor's bacon on one occasion.It's a good film not the best from either of the stars but I think you'll like it overall.".

It stars Robert Taylor Ava Gardner Mel Ferrer Stanley Baker Anne Crawford and Felix Aylmer. Music is scored by Mikls Rzsa and cinematography by Stephen Dade and Freddie Young.An interesting spin on the Arthurian legend for MGM who film it in Cinemascope first time for the studio and dress it up grandly as the actors have a good old time in the days of yore. Here the romantic angle comes via Lancelot Taylor and Guinevere Gardner having lusty lustations for one and other that cause a tremble in the stability of Camelot. With Guinevere to marry King Arthur and both she and the heroic Lancelot loyal to the King and his ideals for Camelot it's not a real problem until the dastardly Modred Baker and the scheming Morgan le Fay Crawford start to throw spanners into the works that result in murder suspicion and war.It's all very fanciful stuff full of derringdo machismo but the action is well staged by Thorpe cracking finale between good and evil the outer location photography at Tintagel in Cornwall is most pleasing Rzsa's score sweeps in and out of the well dressed sets and the cast do their director proud by not overdoing the material to hand. Yes it inevitably hasn't aged particularly well and modern film fans may balk at the many passages of detailed chatter in the well developed script but this comes from a grand old time in cinema. When production value meant hard graft in front of and behind the camera . Honour and integrity is not only big within the story itself it's also themes that apply to the film makers as well.

	schema:reviewBody "In his novel The Lyre of Orpheus the Canadian writer Robertson Davies made the point that although the Arthurian legend had played an immensely influential role in the history of English literature there had never been a particularly distinguished dramatic treatment of the story either in the theatre or in the cinema. Davies discounts Purcell's opera on the grounds that its plot differs radically from what we have come to think of as the Arthurian story. And yet the story seems to offer great dramatic possibilities both in its adventure elements and in the ArthurGuinevereLancelot love triangle. Knights of the Round Table was the second in an unofficial trilogy of films on a mediaeval theme made byproducer Pandro S. Berman and director Richard Thorpe all of which starred Robert Taylor. The others in the trilogy both based on the novels of Sir Walter Scott were Ivanhoeand The Adventures of Quentin Durward. It is based upon Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur although it makes some changes. The Quest for the Holy Grail plays a less important role in the film than in the book  Elaine is Lancelot's wife rather than his lover and their son Galahad who plays a key role in the book only appears as a baby. Apart from Lancelot and the villain Mordred here referred to as Modred the most prominent of the knights is Sir Percival in this version Elaine's brother. The film is ostensibly set in the Britain of the 5th or 6th century after the end of the Roman occupation but as is usual in films on this theme the recent King Arthur being an exception the costumes armour and buildings are all based upon those of the High Middle Ages that is to say of Malory's day rather than of Arthur's. Arthur's kingdom is always referred to as England even though the historic Arthur assuming that he was a real person would never have used this term. The Celts would always have referred to Britain the name England Land of the Angles being used only by their AngloSaxon enemies. The story begins with Britain in turmoil divided among various warring overlords. Arthur the illegitimate son of the former ruler Uther Pendragon is able to unite the kingdom and with the help of Lancelot andthe wizard Merlin to defeat his main challengers his halfsister Morgan Le Fay and her son Modred. Anne Crawford who plays Morgan was only eight years older than Stanley Baker who plays her son. Presumably the explanation is that Morgan's enchantments have been able to preserve her youthful looks and things could have been worse. The original choice for Modred was George Sanders fourteen years older than Crawford. After his victory Arthur pardons Morgan and Modred against Lancelot's advice but they continue to plot against him and see the growing attraction between Lancelot and Arthur's wife Guinevere as their chance to make trouble. One of the problems with Arthurian films and plays is that the love triangle is so central to the plot that it requires three highquality performances if it is to succeed. Taylor here makes an attractively dashing Lancelot although the film misses one of the key themes of Malory's work. In Malory Lancelot an otherwise ideal knight is morally compromised by his adulterous affair with Guinevere but in this version their love is not physically consummated possibly in order to keep the censors happy and the result is that he seems a much less morally ambiguous figure. The film tries to contrast the flawed Lancelot with the idealised Percival but Lancelot's flaws seemed to me very minor ones. Arthur is another complex character difficult to realise on screen because he is on the one hand a powerful heroic monarch and on the other someone compromised by his status as a cuckold. In mediaeval literature cuckolds were generally seen as weak pitiable or ridiculous like Alison's husband in Chaucer's Miller's Tale. Probably the best screen Arthur I have seen was Sean Connery in First Knight but that film subtlyaltered the traditional tale by making Arthur much older than Guinevere or Lancelot. Here Arthur comes across as a forgettable nonentity when he should be at the film's centre and this is due partly to the wooden acting of Mel Ferrer and partly to the sanitising of the LancelotGuinevere relationship which also removes much of the interest from Arthur's character. As for Ava Gardner she certainly makes a lovely Guinevere but she was capable of much better acting than this. As for example in The Barefoot Contessa the following year. Baker is not bad as Modred but I think that Sanders who had been so effective as Brian de BoisGuilbert in Ivanhoe would have been better. The film is visually attractive with much emphasis on pageantry and spectacle but I did not enjoy it as much as Ivanhoe. I have never seen Quentin Durward. It is certainly better than the dull and turgid King Arthur but the problems with characterisation made me aware just why it can be so difficult to make an effective Arthurian drama and to understand what Robertson Davies may have meant by his dictum. 610".

	schema:headline " Mildly dated but still enjoyable on a certain level.";
	schema:reviewBody "The scope of this production is classic Hollywood. Large numbers of real life stuntmen and stunt horses crowd the screen for a medieval epic retelling the Arthurian legend. Cinemascope is used to capture large vistas and cleanly handcrafted sets that fill the screen in Technicolor. When Arthur's and Modred's armies clash it's real human beings riding horses bearing lances swinging prop swords and shooting prop arrows from real bows. Very impressive.The dated aspect comes from the thesping of both leads and supporting cast. It's pretty stilted and serious but really ought not have been this way for acting in other films of the time gangster and war films wasn't so stiff. One gets the sense that the director wanted a legendary feel for the picture and so had the actors convey emotion in a very framed manner to express the regal quality of the story and time.It may have also have been due to Robert Taylor's acting ability which was fairly inflexible. His stone demeanor gives him solid ground to stand on in his performances but also holds back a greater character range that in my opinion was never fully realized in the epics he was placed in.The action is hit and miss. The large action sequences are a pleasure to look at. The smaller oneonone fights seem staged and visually blah from a cinematic standpoint but this was the style of the time. When Lancelot charges with Arthur and his knights there's a real sense of drama ditto with the other large action sequences.Historically we're given the classic image of 14th century knights in full plate armor set upon chargers donned in cloth barding. Again visually it's a pleasure to see but falls wide of the contemporary theory that Arthur was a Roman General Artorious who would have dressed in chain mail and not the advanced form of armor shown in this film as well as in Boorman's Excalibur.It's an interesting window at another time when film was moderately less refined and perhaps undeservedly awed in spite of itself and as such given such a pedestal sheen that only reinforces the detachment of the work from the audience. But even so it works. It's dated mildly kampy but offers a view into the classic image of the Arthurian tales that pervaded much of contemporary 20th Century impressions of Arthurian times for years after.It'd been thirty some odd years since I'd last seen this film and I'm glad I was able to see it again.

	onyx:emotionText "The scope of this production is classic Hollywood. Large numbers of real life stuntmen and stunt horses crowd the screen for a medieval epic retelling the Arthurian legend. Cinemascope is used to capture large vistas and cleanly handcrafted sets that fill the screen in Technicolor. When Arthur's and Modred's armies clash it's real human beings riding horses bearing lances swinging prop swords and shooting prop arrows from real bows. Very impressive.The dated aspect comes from the thesping of both leads and supporting cast. It's pretty stilted and serious but really ought not have been this way for acting in other films of the time gangster and war films wasn't so stiff. One gets the sense that the director wanted a legendary feel for the picture and so had the actors convey emotion in a very framed manner to express the regal quality of the story and time.It may have also have been due to Robert Taylor's acting ability which was fairly inflexible. His stone demeanor gives him solid ground to stand on in his performances but also holds back a greater character range that in my opinion was never fully realized in the epics he was placed in.The action is hit and miss. The large action sequences are a pleasure to look at. The smaller oneonone fights seem staged and visually blah from a cinematic standpoint but this was the style of the time. When Lancelot charges with Arthur and his knights there's a real sense of drama ditto with the other large action sequences.Historically we're given the classic image of 14th century knights in full plate armor set upon chargers donned in cloth barding. Again visually it's a pleasure to see but falls wide of the contemporary theory that Arthur was a Roman General Artorious who would have dressed in chain mail and not the advanced form of armor shown in this film as well as in Boorman's Excalibur.It's an interesting window at another time when film was moderately less refined and perhaps undeservedly awed in spite of itself and as such given such a pedestal sheen that only reinforces the detachment of the work from the audience. But even so it works. It's dated mildly kampy but offers a view into the classic image of the Arthurian tales that pervaded much of contemporary 20th Century impressions of Arthurian times for years after.It'd been thirty some odd years since I'd last seen this film and I'm glad I was able to see it again. But if you're a younger viewer or are just more into contemporary swordepic offerings then this film may disappoint some. Take it for what it is.An impressive production but dated and because of this it's not really for everyone. Give it a shot and see if you like it.";

Lancelot's horse Berick is too smart even for a legend and somehow he saves the day at the end which is not very believable.The cast is alright. Robert Taylor Sir Lancelot renders an acceptable performance as the loyal knight pretty much as he had done recently in Ivanhoe 1952.

The operatic hero is always a tenor. Ava Gardner has little to do and only a little more to say in her whispery sexy voice.But the movie is about Robert Taylor as Lancelot the chivalrous knight and babe magnet. Taylor had an interesting career making his mark as Camille's lover with his empyrian good looks. In the 30s he was so handsome that questions arose about his masculinity. And after all he was born Spangler Arlington Borough. He put the queries and eyebrows to rest by appearing shirtless and hairy chested in a prominent movie magazine.Then  as it must to all men  age came to Robert Taylor. His voice remained the same continuing to operate within its narrow envelope but his looks coarsened. Yet MGM kept him soldiering on in roles like this. He never disappointed because he never changed and he never got in the way of the scenery. As for the chemistry between Taylor and Gardner both occupational surnames it can best be described as two people. Actually the movie is about Robert Taylor but just barely. Running a close second is location shooting photography and wardrobe. You have never seen more color on the screen. The horses themselves are gaudily robed. And there is an abundance of action ranging from duels to the death to pillow fights.I don't know how closely it sticks to Arthurian legend. I gather there were several versions of all the legends. I once tried reading Thomas Mallory's Le Morte D'Arthur but it was awfully dull and inexpressive like reading the log of a ship at sea.Good luck and God speed.".

Well my feelings about Robert Taylor should have prevailed.I find it difficult to believe that the producers and director of this film were not unaware of the quality of film that they were creating as they created it.  It's as if all the actors' queues were edited into the film. Perhaps I'm used to more modern techniques in choreography of sword play. The battle scenes were just one big melee of chaos.Mel Ferrer Stanley Baker and Ava Gardner are all great actors.  It must of torn their hearts out to do this abomination.  Fortunately for Ms. Gardner she was in Italy filming Barefoot Contessa when this catastrophe was released.One wonders Does the director actually review the filming before it is edited?  How could Thorpe let something like this get by?  He was a veteran director of over 160 previous films.  Perhaps he never adjusted to modern filming technology.  It seems like this film was shot in the days of silent films and then colorized and sound added.  There has to be some explanation.".

Well my feelings about Robert Taylor should have prevailed.I find it difficult to believe that the producers and director of this film were not unaware of the quality of film that they were creating as they created it.  It's as if all the actors' queues were edited into the film. Perhaps I'm used to more modern techniques in choreography of sword play. The battle scenes were just one big melee of chaos.Mel Ferrer Stanley Baker and Ava Gardner are all great actors.  It must of torn their hearts out to do this abomination.  Fortunately for Ms. Gardner she was in Italy filming Barefoot Contessa when this catastrophe was released.One wonders Does the director actually review the filming before it is edited?  How could Thorpe let something like this get by?  He was a veteran director of over 160 previous films.  Perhaps he never adjusted to modern filming technology.  It seems like this film was shot in the days of silent films and then colorized and sound added.  There has to be some explanation.";

This story covers the origin and evolution of that dynasty and an explanation of it's motivation. The story centers around the elder brother Nathan played by George Arliss and his four brothers. I have to admit that I never saw the George Arliss magic until I saw this picture. He really was a major talent although he was quite old when he did this. We see the family breaking out of Jew Street in Frankfurt and establishing banks throughout Europe while struggling to overcome antisemitic attitudes and actual pogroms. There are some personal vignettes involving Loretta Young as Nathan's daughter and her goy suitor played by Robert Young that tend to humanize the family but really don't amount to much. The real story is the family drive to help stabilize a war ravaged Europe and through it command the respect of a deeply antisemitic aristocratic European society. The picture paints a rather pastel version of what was probably a grueling battle for acceptance but it managed to convey a feeling of warmth and respect for the underdog. There are some very nice touches. The family members all touch the mezuzah each time the enter or leave the house. Everybody kisses Mama and George Arliss shows what appears to be a real tenderness whenever he interacts with Loretta Young. The brothers never appear to be avaricious but rather an integrated force of will determined to succeed yet determined to play by the rules. All in all an enjoyable and informative docudrama.

Five brothers united as THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD.In this lavish film Mr. George Arliss gives yet another splendid history lesson and this time the old fellow gets to play two roles Mayer Amschel Rothschild the founder of the dynasty and eldest son Nathan Rothschild who established the London branch of the family. As always Arliss is fascinating to watch his every twitch conveying significance  meaning. It is a shame he is almost forgotten today as he was a marvelous actor.But he does not act alone here. Indeed his costars are quite accomplished. As in so many of his films his reallife wife Florence Arliss plays his Nathan's spouse and is charming as usual. The somewhat obtrusive romantic subplot is handled by the two Youngs Loretta  Robert who look lovely  handsome respectively. Helen Westley is exceptional as Mayer's wife Gudula the matriarch of the family. Also on hand are Reginald Owen Alan Mowbray Ivan Simpson Ethel Griffies  wonderful old Sir C. Aubrey Smith as the Duke of Wellington  it is a particular treat to watch his scenes with Arliss.A rather subdued  urbane Boris Karloff is the villain of the film playing a Prussian nobleman who delights in being antiSemitic. Pains are taken to show the evils inflected upon Continental Jewry during the age of repression  pogroms and it is important to remember that this film was produced in 1934 as Evil was once again raising its head in Central Europe. The ideas of men in the 19th Century such as Karloff portrays here would lead inexorably to the gas chambers  furnaces of Nazi Germany in the 20th. Forget Frankenstein's Monster. This was Karloff's most horrific role.In the last 4 minutes the movie turns from black  white to beautiful early Technicolor a delight to the eyes.There are a couple of glaring historical inaccuracies in the movie that must be pointed out. Nathan was not the elder of Mayer's sons  in fact he was the 3rd born. And it was not he but his grandson another Nathan who was raised to the peerage to become Baron Rothschild in 1885 49 years after the death of his grandfather. Trifling yet significant.".

It's presentation of the problem is simplistic but given the time that this film was produced it was amazing that any attempt was made to attack antiSemitism at all. In 1934 Adolph Hitler was Chancellor of Germany one year already. Strong antiSemitic strains were felt all over Europe and the U.S.  in fact in most of the world. It took some courage to make any jab at it and producer Darryl Zanuck a nonJewish Hollywood film studio head  a rarity had plenty of that. He would repeat this in fourteen years producing GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT.George Arliss first plays the head of the famous banking family Mayer Amschel Rothschild. A stereotypical Jewish money lender he dies of a stroke after confronting the bullying greedy tax men.

The five branch bank soon is one of the great financial institutions of the world. Nathan has managed to support the British Government and it's allies in the wars against Napoleon. But after Napoleon is sent to Elba the British and their allies led by the German Count Ledranz are freezing the Rothschilds out of a major bond issue. Nathan realizes that this is due to the antiSemitic Ledranz and uses his position at the stock exchange to bear down on the bond issue threatening to ruin the men who are pushing the issue. Hastily calling a meeting Lord Baring Arthur Byron prevails on the aristocrats to let Rothschild in for a share of the bond issue. Ledranz does it with illfeeling warning Nathan that this is not the end of the matter.Shortly afterward there are pogroms all over central Europe. As Ledranz Boris Karloff in a splendidly evil performance without puts itThe House of Rothschild  The House with the Red Shield I'll make it RED! There is little Nathan can do about this. But shortly afterward Napoleon escapes from Elba throwing the alliance especially Ledranz off balance. They need Nathan to stabilize the stock exchange or the Little Corsican will win an easy victory against them. And although they don't know this Napoleon has already reached out to Nathan with a counterproposition help him and Jewish Emancipation is assured.That Nathan throws his support to the alliance is no real surprise. He feels that if he supports Napoleon the image of the Jews suffers with the bulk of the Gentiles  they traffic in human lives and blood. But he does save the stock exchange and he ends having proved that the Jews can be as good citizens as their Gentile counterparts.How true is the story? Well I recommend Frederic Morton's classic book THE ROTHSCHILDS to get the accurate story. Mayer Rothschild was the financial agent of the Prince of HesseCassel. The money made from the renting of Hessian troops was shepherded by Mayer into a vast fortune and he got a commission. It staked out and trained his five sons who did make their private bank the biggest in the world.The French Revolution had announced that the Jews were equals of the Gentiles the bill ending French legal discrimination against the Jews was presented by Maximillian Robespierre!. Napoleon reestablished it and in 1807 called the first meeting of the Jewish Sanhedrin since 70 A.D. Whether he did this for publicity or he meant it is still debated. The spread of the reform by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic armies achieved was hurt by the reaction in Europe after Napoleon's final defeat in 1815.Ledranz is a splendid villain and a German one for all that. But he appears to be based on Prince Claus Von Metternich the Chancellor of the Austrian Empire. In fact although he probably had some social antiSemitism Von Metternich was quite friendly to the Rothschilds and he figured out a way of allowing them to be ennobled in Austria and in the German states. The film does seem a little simplistic. There is no reference to the blood libel as such or to the blame Christianity placed on the Jews for the death of Jesus. And to make a case that economic muscle alone would change people's minds was silly and short sighted. It could equally awaken jealousy and hatred for a successful people. But that it was advanced at all in 1934 and that the film was an attempt to confront a hideous growing problem was deserving of praise. Ironically it was too little too late. Goebbels would produce an antiSemitic film called THE ROTHSCHILDS during World War II and his pet director Veidt Hartmann would direct THE ETERNAL JEW where Jews were compared to rats and scenes from HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD appear to have been cut in. Hartmann would also direct JUD SUSS regarding another Jewish financier of an earlier period who was hung for crimes  of course Hartmann insisted he Jud Suss Oppenheimer was guilty of those crimes. So for all the good intentions of Zanuck and Arliss and the others history had a dreadful commentary awaiting in the wings.".

	onyx:emotionText "HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD concentrates on antiSemitism and the struggle of the Jews to get equality and recognition from their Gentile neighbors. It's presentation of the problem is simplistic but given the time that this film was produced it was amazing that any attempt was made to attack antiSemitism at all. In 1934 Adolph Hitler was Chancellor of Germany one year already. Strong antiSemitic strains were felt all over Europe and the U.S.  in fact in most of the world. It took some courage to make any jab at it and producer Darryl Zanuck a nonJewish Hollywood film studio head  a rarity had plenty of that. He would repeat this in fourteen years producing GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT.George Arliss first plays the head of the famous banking family Mayer Amschel Rothschild. A stereotypical Jewish money lender he dies of a stroke after confronting the bullying greedy tax men. Before he dies he tells his five sons two things 1 The gentiles have prevented the Jews from competing in the regular professions leaving them in the role of money lenders.

Arliss a veteran of the British theater was one of the first to recognize the importance of film in preserving the actor's art. He did even more silent films than sound which took advantage of his magnificent speaking voice and perfect English diction. His acting today is considered hammy by many but for me I like the idea of being able to understand every enunciated word.In The House Of Rothschild Arliss plays the dual role of patriarch Meyer Rothschild and later Nathan one of the five sons whom he dispatched to various European capitals to establish the family banking business. This was in the 1780s90s. By 1814 the House is well established throughout Europe and even when countries are at war The House Of Rothschild acts as a unit. Though the Paris branch has to be a bit discreet with Napoleon Bonaparte making war on all the rest of the places the brothers have set up shop.The money lender is never a popular figure. It's the reason why when Jews were forbidden to own land and frozen out of certain businesses and trades they were allowed to be bankers. That way it was a double whammy in unpopularity for them.The House Of Rothschild even with Napoleon making entreaties to the Jewish people backs the Allied cause to the hilt. It wins the gratitude of someone no less than the Duke of Wellington played by Sir C. Aubrey Smith. But Prussian banker Ledranz played by Boris Karloff makes no secret of his antiSemitism. Quite a daring piece for 1934 as Hitler was starting his war on the Jews and few were speaking out.Florence Arliss the real life wife of George Arliss plays his wife Hannah in his Nathan persona. But Helen Westley is mother Rothschild and she gives a lively performance. It is she whom you will remember best from this film after George Arliss.Robert Young and Loretta Young play a Wellington aide and a Rothschild daughter who fall in love and are the secondary romantic plot in this film. But it's Arliss's portrayal of the shrewd and intrepid Nathan Rothschild and the story of the fortune that is the heart of the film. And it is a big heart in every sense of the word.".

It was the old stock market saying that information is the most valuable commodity that rescued the Rothschild's vast money holdings. That commodity in the end not only saved the Rothschild fortune and more then doubled it but also saved those investors who were wise enough to follow Nathans lead in not abandoning the allies financially at their most critical time of need when everything looked as if it were lost.The film mostly concentrates on how the Rothschilds namely Nathan and his brothers despite the antiJewish prejudices that they faced in early 19th Century Europe prevailed in the end to overcome the slings and arrows as well as the antiSemitic riots incited by the likes of Prussian Count Ledrantz Boris Karloff to become the richest and most powerful bankers in the world.Besides the historical facts in the movie there's also a fictitious subplot involving Nathan's daughter Julie Loretta Young having a love affair with the handsome and dashing British calvary officer Captain Frizroy Robert Youngthat her father had a hard time accepting Since Fitzroy wasn't Jewish or a Rothschild. But in the end everything was ironed out by the script writers to make the affair between the two lovebirds a joyous and successful one.Nathan who was earlier sandbagged by Count Ledrantz and his fellow bankers when a loan that he expected his bank to float involving the restoration of France after Napoleon's exile on the Island of Elba was rejected. This came about because of what Ledrantz smugly called a technicallity! The unforgivable technicallity being that Nathan was Jewish! This sleazy and despicable act on the part of Ledrantz  Co. had an outrage and indignant Nathan get back at Ledrantz and his gang of banker cutthroats. Nathan thus using financial guerrillalike tactics undercut the bonds that they were to float and sell to the British public representing the French loan. In the end this forced Ledrantz  Co. to come to the Rothschild Bank hat in hand begging for Nathan to become a partner. Even if Nathans partnership cost these rascals and unscrupulous financial manipulators as much as 50 million British pounds for them to do it.Smarting from the beating his and his cohorts took at the hands of the witty and clever Nathan sore loser Ledrantz started to foment antiJewish riots all over his native Prussia which included the Rothschild family home The Red Shield in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt. This was Ledrantz way to get back at Nathan but that quickly came to an end with the startling news of Napoleon escaping from his exile in Elba and regaining power in France. This meant that they Ledrantz  Co would need the Rothschild money again to finally stop Napoleons determined attempt to conquer all of Europe. Like the bankers did before in needing the Rothschild's banks money to defeat Napoleon after his massive June 211812 eastern invasion that lead to his disastrous withdrawal from Czarist Russia back in the winter 18121813. With news hard to come by back then it was Nathan's ingenious and secret way of using carrier pigeons from the battlefield that gave him the edge in knowing that the Duke of Wellingtons C. Aubrey Smith forces checked and repulsed Napoleon's big offensive at the battle of Waterloo! That happened as rumors were abound on the floor of the London Stock Exchang that just the opposite happened. This timely information had Nathan and his brothers buy up all the British Government Securities that were being sold off and bid down by panicked stock brokers and investors. In the end Nathan not only saved the London Exchange from total collapse but made himself and the Rothschild Bank or banks the financial powerhouse that it became and is after some 200 years later even now.George Ariss plays both the elder Mayer and his son Nathan Rothschild in the movie with both Robert and Loretta no relations Young as the starstruck lovers Fitzroy and Julie in small but very important supporting roles in the film.".

With news hard to come by back then it was Nathan's ingenious and secret way of using carrier pigeons from the battlefield that gave him the edge in knowing that the Duke of Wellingtons C. Aubrey Smith forces checked and repulsed Napoleon's big offensive at the battle of Waterloo! That happened as rumors were abound on the floor of the London Stock Exchang that just the opposite happened. This timely information had Nathan and his brothers buy up all the British Government Securities that were being sold off and bid down by panicked stock brokers and investors. In the end Nathan not only saved the London Exchange from total collapse but made himself and the Rothschild Bank or banks the financial powerhouse that it became and is after some 200 years later even now.George Ariss plays both the elder Mayer and his son Nathan Rothschild in the movie with both Robert and Loretta no relations Young as the starstruck lovers Fitzroy and Julie in small but very important supporting roles in the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This would never have made it past the producers the Breen Office or the German representatives in Hollywood a year or two later. It opens with what appears to be an outlandish parody of Jewish life in 1780s Prussia. The father Arliss is a money lender or pawn broker or something overacting to beat the band. He and his family run around their humble household when they see the tax collector coming. Arliss wrings his hands and in a quivering voice orders the rest to hide the silverware and the roast and to break out the second set of books. The sneering tax collector is amenable to a bribe and when he leaves the family cackled over how they outwitted him and saved money on the deal. It sets the stereotype in cement  greedy moneymongering clannish cheaters.It develops that there were reasons enough for the family's worry. The Jews of Frankfort all live in Jew Street and are taxed at a far higher rate than the mayor himself. The government is corrupt and openly antiSemitic. But all that has little impact on the unwittingly comic scene of the poor Rothschild's noisily dashing about and trying to hoodwink the tax collector. The old man dies at the end advising his sons to go out into the world and establish a vast banking empire because money is the only power we have. The four or five sons follow his orders and we skip to the Napoleonic period an focus on Nathan Rothschild Arliss again. The family is fabulously rich and it becomes even more so by betting against Napoleon in both wars. Despite the antiSemitic feelings among the Allied leaders Nathan bets everything he has and manages to save all of Europe from extinction.They've done what they could with the story but banking is essentially a boring business I guess. I certainly have no interest in it and there were some arguments about points being up or down that left me in the dust. There is a subtheme done with quiet subtlety. Nathan's daughter Loretta Young wants to marry a Captain of the Guards Robert Young a Gentile. And Nathan is faced with the same problem as Tevyev in Fiddler on the Roof the best line of which came from a young Russian who asks one of Tevyev's daughters Do you feel about me the way that they feel about you? When Benny develops a warm feeling for a shiksa in The Benny Goodman Story Goodman's mother phrases the issue in terms of social class Bagels and caviar don't mix. The underlying questions have to do with the group loyalty of minority groups who have been victimized and the social borders they themselves create but that's another story.There has always been intolerance here and in Europe. Minorities are often discriminated against. But my understanding is that the Jews of Germany and elsewhere like the Rothschilds were doing a pretty good job of being assimilated  poets doctors bankers scientists  until the changing times brought disaster. By contrast the Jews of Eastern Europe held niche occupations in smaller cities and towns. My immigrant German grandfather lived in one of those villages and I once asked him about the Jews when he was growing up. Of course there were Jews. They were money lenders. Why were the Jews the money lenders? They ver dzha only pipple in dzha village you could trust. He was entirely serious.Didn't the Rothschilds make fine wine too? I'd like to learn more about that. Wine is more interesting than banking.".

	schema:headline " The Rothschilds Like A Typical Day in Germany 12";
	schema:reviewBody "By 1934 Hitler had been in power for one year in Germany and had already transformed the nation. How appropriate that this movie came out that year. With its theme of antiSemitism in Germany and other nations from 1780 through the Napoleonic Wars we have quite a good film here.As they did in Disraeli 5 years before George and Florence Arliss again appeared as a married couplethis time as the Rothschilds.As the money lenders and banking financiers there was so much antiSemitism already in Prussia. Let's remember that Germany did not become a unified nation until the FrancoPrussian War of 1871. The film deals with the 5 sons and their banking interests amidst political turmoil which further gave rise to antiSemitism. The dilemma of the family was whether to support Napoleon who gave Jews basic rights in occupied countries but never in France itself or to go with the allies against Napoleonic tyranny but again this would mean oppression for the Jewish people. The family was able to gain rights for Jews as a condition for supporting the antiNapoleon forces.This is a very interesting film way ahead of its time. Loretta Young costars as the daughter of the eldest Rothschild son. She loves a British Gentile played by a very young Robert Young. When he sees antiSemitism around him Arliss is vehemently opposed to the union.The film was nominated for best picture of 1934 but lost out to It Happened One Night. I guess that Hollywood wasn't ready yet to honor pictures of discrimination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Exceptional movie starring George Arliss as the head of the Rothschilds a Jewish family of bankers who deal with antiSemitism in 19th century Europe. Fascinating from a historical perspective as well as entertaining. It certainly stands out for the time period. I think the word Jew was used more in this movie than in all other Golden Age Hollywood movies I've seen combined. George Arliss is terrific. Loretta Young plays his daughter. She looks very pretty and while this is hardly one of her top performances she holds her own against veteran actors well. Boris Karloff is the villain and does a fine job. The rest of the cast includes Robert Young C. Aubrey Smith William Mowbray Reginald Owen and Arthur Byron among others. The script is smart and the story is enjoyable on its own as well as when viewed as a commentary on the goingson in Germany at the time. Final scene is shot in early Technicolor. One of the most exciting movies about banking ever made. Okay it's about more than that but the point still stands.".

Helen Westley plays the matriarch and Florence Arliss Nathan's wife. Two Youngs Loretta and Robert play the romantic leads.The screenplay is excellent as is the acting and direction all around. I am surprised Arliss did not receive a nomination. The final scenes in three strip Technicolor last a mere 315 minutes.Interesting to note that Arliss portrayed three historical characters that all interwove their destinies Disraeli would secure a loan for the Suez Canal through the Rothschild family the Duke of Wellington was an advocate and supporter of Nathan and his family.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's a very ironic thing that the most overtly positive and obvious portrayal of Jews comes from Twentieth Century Foxthe only major American studio that was NOT controlled by an ethnic Jewish man at the time! So as folks like Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner chose to deemphasize their Jewish roots and make films which almost never even mentioned Judaism Daryl Zanuck dove head first into the topic and brought us this very unusual biopic.The story is about the Rothschild family and only concerns a snippet in the history of the familyfrom the 18th century through the fall of Napoleon. When it begins the family patriarch George Arliss instructs his sons to divide up the banking business among five major European capitals. Then following his death the story jumps decades later and the new head of the banking family is ALSO played by Arlissalbeit without the wig and makeup he donned at the beginning of the film. The theme is how honorable the family was and how they stood behind freedom and right...and that mistreatment of them and other Jews is just morally repugnant. Interestingly the biggest antiSemite of this portion of the film is a German guy Boris Karloff...and was perhaps the studio's way to address the rising tide of Naziism at the time.Regardless of its intent the film is a well acted and interesting costume drama. How close this all actually is to the real life Rothschilds I have no idea but it was entertaining. Plus I'd watch Arliss in just about anything!".

Told against the background of Napoleon's rise to power it's a lavishly produced historical yarn that is short of producing a powerful effect when it tells the tale of the Rothschild's struggle to become a banking empire.TCM showed a print which did not include the Technicolor ending a reasonable looking print otherwise. The good cast includes ALAN MOBRAY C. AUBREY SMITH REGINALD OWEN and others from Hollywood's British colony.It tells the story of how the Rothschild established their banking empire at a time when the European bankers wanted nothing to do with Jews and their enterprising ways. BORIS KARLOFF is anything but subtle as a Prussian Count who admits that Arliss is not even being considered when bids are made because of a technicalitythat technicality being because he is a Jew.Since this was made at a time when the world was indeed experiencing the sort of prejudices in Germany that would eventually lead to The Holocaust this was a brave film for Hollywood to tackle. Sadly the result is a film lacking in dramatic intensity.There is nothing powerful in the presentation and not even the performance of the much revered George Arliss can overcome the script weaknesses and direction that prevent it from being little more than average in effect.".
