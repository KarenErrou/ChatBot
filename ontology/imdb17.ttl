	schema:reviewBody "Asian dramas  even the ones involving fantasy fighting  have a certain lushness and a complex texture that I believe only Asian directors can truly capture. So having Rob Marshall a very American director step in is a risk and for twothirds of the picture he mutes the frenetic editing and lurid visuals used in CHICAGO slows the pace of the narration and achieves the goal in making his vision look as authentic as possible.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA has a lot of Charles Dickens in its storyline. The tale of Chiyo the little girl who is sold by her mother to a geisha house her trials and tribulations her knowledge and yearning of true love and success as a geisha is almost identical to the Dickensian universe. It even evolves in a similar manner and its more effective moments are the ones involving Chiyo as a girl Suzuka Ohgo becoming friends and later enemies with Pumpkin not understanding why she is in this strange house why she has been separated from her sister whom she frantically tries to seek out or why the geisha Hatsumomo Gong Li is so mean to her. One touching scene which becomes the focus of Chiyo's drive is when she encounters this prince of a man the Chairman Ken Watanabe. The smile he coaxes out her sad face is the most luminous moment in the entire film and this event makes Chiyo want to become a better person and reunite with the Chairman. They do meet later on but the movie mutes their romance after she becomes the geisha Sayori Zhang Ziyi and in trying to keep him distant in a casual way  they don't share as much as a stilted conversation  somewhat works against the believability of their mutual but restrained love.What does work is the subtext within the relationships between the two other women and Sayori intended or not. Hatsumomo explodes in rage against Sayori after being successfully put down the night of her debut that has hints a little of repressed lesbianism. Notice the way Hatsumomo lashes out like a snake it also seems as if she would be ready to kiss her at any second. Also noteworthy is the relationship that Sayori develops with her mentor Mameha Michelle Yeoh. I loved it because I've seen Ziyi and Yeoh play rivals in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON and it was great to see them interact in a completely different way one that indicates Mameha was the replacement for the sister Sayori lost one who also lost a chance at love and happiness and who only knows the life of a geisha.Where the film falters somewhat is in trying to tie in all of the story lines once the last half hour arrives. The invasion of World War II while intending to show how times change and traditions morph somehow didn't work on film as it must have on paper. I also felt that Pumpkin's late introduction as a very Americanfriendly whore with double intentions could have been handled better and seemed to belong in another movie with comic overtones. Granted that her character had becomes as the mistress of the geisha house had predicted Hatsumomo's puppet via her actions but I felt it slowed the story down a little. Another character who did an aboutface was Nobu's Koji Yakusho. There was littletono indication he had any interest in Sayori and more than once he rebuffed her or looked bored by her. His sudden declaration of love comes too abrupt and I didn't quite buy it. But it's the problem with staying too close to the source material sometimes you have to tweak it a little while maintaining its essence.As usual there is some fantastic subtle acting from the three leading ladies all film veterans in their native China and Malaysia as well as in Ken Watanabe and Koji Yakusho. Yes it's thirty minutes too long. Yes the love story is marginal at best. And yes it would have benefited better had it been done in its native tongue with subtitles but that would have been at the expense of it having limited availability. However it is a sumptuous gorgeous film about the triumph of the spirit of this one girl against the odds around her. And it even has a happy ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking over previous comments here it is clear that this is a very polarizing movie experience one that seems to put Syriana to shame in that realm. Director Rob Marshall has taken a best selling novel and turned out a feature film that it appears some people love and some absolutely hate. Count me in the first category but allow me to indulge the critics too.First this isn't a typical Hollywood film. Despite popular western misconceptions about Geishas there's no sex almost no violence and beyond that there's nearly two and a half hours of women's problems that many men may find hard to relate to. This is not Desperate Housewives or even All my Children. This is about deceit treachery and rivalries as much as it is about a little girl who gets sold into bondage by her impoverished Japanese family. Its also about a lifelong search for love in a society in which people apparently can't just step up and make frank declarations of devotion to one another. This movie is in a word complicated and that is going to turn some American movie goers off.But not all Asian film fans are raving about this movie either some thinking it is a very superficial look at Japnese customs and others incensed that a movie that's about an important Japanese tradition should star three Chinese actresses. I cannot comment on either topic since I know little or nothing about Japanese tradition and I don't know why Ziyi Zhang Michelle Yoeh and Gong Li were cast. They have been seen before by American audiences but are hardly film stars in this country so it wasn't as if they were going to draw in tons of fans on their names alone.The only thing I can think of is all three are fine actresses and they more than proved that in this film. If Gong Li does not get a best supporting actress nomination there's no justice. And Zhang should probably get a crack at best actress for her work as well.All three just light up the screen.But I can understand in this age of political correctness how some would be offended by the casting and how others might complain about the handling of the Japanese subject matter.All I can say is movie makers face trade offs and one is either targeting your film to a mass audience and in America that means a generally poorly educated audience or narrow casting your film to people very well acquainted with the topic who will swoop down on any flaw. But that when dealing with a topic like Japanese geisha culture is a pretty small audience in America too small to generate the kind of box office a film like this needs to pull in to pay for itself. From a purely Anglo American unschooled in Japanese culture standpoint I think Marshall made good decisions. I hope he has not slighted Japanese culture too much but I think he has made a suspenseful captivating enchanting film that does something a lot of films haven't in recent years.He gave us a complex central character we can pull for throughout the film and for that I thank him.Memoirs of a Geisha ranks among my five best films of the year thus far and deserves a best picture nomination.".

Every shot ever scene every tiny detail was just beautiful. I literally did not look away from the screen the entire time. The acting wasn't spectacular. I think they could have found somebody better to play Sayuri. The children were all wonderful. The standout actress by far was Gong Li as Hatsumomo. The villain had the best opportunities to show her skills as a thespian. The plot stuck very closely to the book. They eliminated the scenes that they needed to in the interest of time but they didn't try to take any shortcuts or speed up the plot. I really felt like the story was played out beginning to end without sacrificing any of the meat. You'll read a lot of reviews in the coming weeks praising the gorgeous photography.

This is one of the most visually stunning and entrancing films I have ever seen with a wonderful storyline which had me clutching the edge of my seat in sheer frustration! I absolutely loved the love story that was central to the film although I was a bit worried by the age gap. lol. It made me really want a snow cone though. I thought Zhang Ziyi was fantastic in the part of Sayuri and she made the character very endearing and real. I am a big fan of Ken Watanabe and it was good to see him in a part like this the relationship was very believable and I thought they were both great. In fact all the actors in this film did their characters justice and helped to make the film as beautiful and Oscarworthy as it is.

This is one of the most visually stunning and entrancing films I have ever seen with a wonderful storyline which had me clutching the edge of my seat in sheer frustration! I absolutely loved the love story that was central to the film although I was a bit worried by the age gap. lol. It made me really want a snow cone though. I thought Zhang Ziyi was fantastic in the part of Sayuri and she made the character very endearing and real. I am a big fan of Ken Watanabe and it was good to see him in a part like this the relationship was very believable and I thought they were both great. In fact all the actors in this film did their characters justice and helped to make the film as beautiful and Oscarworthy as it is. I just loved the story and all the sets that provided a wonderful backdrop for such an emotional powerful tale. I recommend this to everyone! It's THAT good!";

	schema:reviewBody "Just as The last samurai is Hollywood's imagination of what the world of samurai and bushido is like Memoirs of a geisha is Hollywood's imagination of the world of geisha. Both are way off the mark.I have not read the book but can only hope that it does not descend to the brainless depiction of geisha as glorified prostitutes who can also entertain with dancing and singing but nothing more. For better insight watch My Geisha 1962 staring two of the best stars we've ever had Shirley MacCaine and Yves Montand. A true geisha is trained to be an allround companion fitting for the most sophisticated environment able to hold an intelligent conversation as easily on international finance and as on the Major League and any subject inbetween.Turning to the movie enough have been said elsewhere about the art direction It's not a movie it's a fashion show quipped Philadelphia Weekly. I'll concentrate on the acting but not before straightening out another muddled thinking that comes up in almost every discussion of this movie  the language barrier.Some contend that because the actresses portray Japanese inadequate English such as ZHANG Ziyi's is acceptable. In that line of reasoning you can't find thinking that is more muddled. In Doctor Zhivago everybody is supposed to be speaking Russian. In the Hollywood movie English is the proxy for Russian and there's nothing wrong with it. But it's NOT about Russians speaking English. It's about Russians speaking fluent Russian only that it's presented to the movie audience in English. There is absolutely no excuse for the English we hear in Dr. Zhivago to be less than perfectly fluent.It's exactly the same situation with Memoirs. Zhang speaking in broken English means that her character Sayuri speaks in broken Japanese which is totally inconceivable. What is even worse is that of the three lead actresses while the English of ZHANG Ziyi and GONG Li is severely limited Michelle Yeoh's English is her mother tongue or at least one of her mother tongues. This results in an inconsistency that is almost painful to behold or to hear to be exact. One would almost wish that Yeoh would lower her level of English to match with the other two's so that the inconsistency wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb every time she has a dialogue with them.Another way of looking at this is that Zhang and Gong perform with a handicap which can be interpreted as a compliment. Consider the last scene when Sayuri delivers her longawaited expression of love to The Chairman something to the effect that ever since meeting him on the bridge she has been focusing her life on moving towards him. I'm sure someone told Zhang what the English words she spoke means but there is absolutely no conviction in her annunciation of the words which came out almost like a jumble of meaningless sounds. I don't blame her for that because it takes time to fully immerse in a new language. Her good acting facial expression etc actually salvages the situation a little bit.As to the rest of the cast despite the high praises Gong receives she has not really been challenged in this movie being given a somewhat stereotyped role. Her recent role in Eros offers considerably more. Michelle Yeoh beautiful as she is looks too modern and western to be a geisha. But these three are not the only or even the most interesting women to watch. The owner of the geisha house is marvellously well played. It's very easy to succumb to turning this role into a comical lifeless caricature. The actress playing this role did a superb job in making this a character of flesh and blood someone that you can understand albeit despise a little. Playing Pumpkin is Youki Kudoh who had proved that she could act way back in Snow Falling on Cedars 1999. Best of all however is Suzuka Ohgo who plays Chiyo that is young Saruyi.As to the men it's interesting to see the two key player swapping roles. Typical gentleman Koji Yakusho Shall we dansu Lost paradise The eel Warm water under a red bridge now plays the uncouth Nobu while macho Ken Watanabe The last samurai is the gentle Chairman. All goes to show how versatile these two actors are.All told Memoirs is an entertaining movie but a little too long. The early portion on the childhood of Saruyi when she was called Chiyo can but cut down but then Suzuka Ohgo is so good! The main section is melodramatic and okay if you like that sort of thing. The last part offers some nice and mild surprises but it's certainly sweet to see the fulfilment of the little girl's initial infatuation which became her entire purpose of life. No harm in romanticising a little  it's Hollywood after all. But the language problem really takes a lot away. If I had a choice I would rather see it in Japanese with subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into the film I had worries with all the slamming critics have given even though I didn't read all of them in details. However I'm happy to say it turns out to be one of more satisfying movie experiences of the year.First I echo the sentiment that the film is simply technically perfect. The retromood it created had me immensed in the world of geisha from beginning to the end. It's very 1930 Shanghai like. The music score isn't as haunting as the one in CTHD but it is still masterfully composed and fits in the background very well. It's worth seeing for the big screen experience alone. The story also never dragged as each of the three parts flowed nicely. I normally don't like voiceover but here it really held the movie together and helped to move the story along.As for the accents the problem has definitely been exaggerated. I was expecting a lot of unpleasant broken English to be spoken but they all sounded fine to good not just from the most fluent Michelle Yeoh but Ken Watanabe Youki Kudoh who plays Pumpkin and other supporting casts. Gong Li had a few awkward lines at the beginning and Ziyi had more and is the one who had to try the hardest but both pulled off admirably and didn't hurt their performances in the process.Talking about performances I think almost all of them did well. It's much more of an ensemble piece and I was especially impressed by the young Sayuri and Ken Watanabe.The main problem I have is with character development. It is a Cinderella story at heart but the good and evil are too clearcut and lack dimension. I also want to see more ups and downs for the competition between Ziyi and Gong Li. Gong did all she could but the script didn't allow her to be a worthy opponent. Except for some verbal backandforth between the two and a few dirty tricks from Gong there was no reason to believe why she was the most famous geisha in Japan before Ziyi arrived.In addition the Mother character is overthetop and didn't fit the emotional aspect the film quite well although she did provide some comical moments. The big dance scene had excellent buildup but the execution of the dance felt flat. It lasted only about 30 seconds while doubling that and making it more mesmerizing would have made the whole middle act more effective.These flaws didn't overshadow the fact that what was put on screen worked for me. Will I be willing to watch it again with friends? In a heartbeat. Will I recommend it to others? Definitely. With that in mind I give the film an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a Japanese geisha? The answer is yes with stunning beauty  and regrettable flaws.Truth be told this movie was not as bad as its trailer led me to expect it to be. It had a story to tell although it crumbles in the endimages to show and material to present. There were ample displays of exquisite beauty  the trailing tails of silk kimonos the subtle allure of hand gestures and the captivating scene of kabuki dance theater ... On the other hand the American director was not able to pull the Japanese out of Chinese actresses. This movie was so crowded by famous Chinese idols that I found myself inadvertently searching for Joan Chen among the cast. To be fair all three main actors Gong Li in particular show strong performances that made me sympathetic to Rob Marshall's choices. However they remain utterly Chinese throughout this movie. The look and accent are not the only problems. They lacked the kind of extreme femininity and excessive felicity of the delicately mechanical gesture and movements of traditional Japanese ladies you see in custom dramas of Japanese production. Michelle Yeoh seems to be the only one trying a little bit of those but it did not quite work for some reason.So let me readdress the question Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a geisha? The answer I guess really depends on what you are looking for. If you would like a little bit of delight from an aesthetically pleasing picture with a dubious authenticity and realism this movie delivers it. I would not say Rob Marshall failed completely. Memoirs of a Geisha is not the first nor the last movie that subjects another culture to the crude lens of American exoticism. It definitely is not the worst one.".

THAT'S authenticity. I guess critics wouldn't know that writing reviews without seeing the film or walking out long before it's over some such as Jeff Wells do.Anyway it's a fantastic film and more than deserving of multiple Academy award nominations  which it may not get thanks to the fact that so many people decided they wanted to use the film as the sacrificial lamb for a halfbaked debate about international politics rather consider that panAsian casting for major roles is NOTHING new it's true of House of Flying Daggers The Joy Luck Club and even Crouching Tiger and that this film's production might represent international cooperation at its best.Look out for Gong Li and Youki Kudoh in RICHLY developed supporting roles. The supporting males while obviously not as well developed since they spend less time in the geisha quarters still give incredible performances. Ken Watanabe was excellent but I particularly enjoyed the performance of the actor playing Nobu. Oprah is right about the sets and costumes they amongst other things make you want to savor every moment of the film. Some people have argued that the brilliant colors make it seem like some sort of Orientalist fantasy. Truth is that this would only be the case if we saw a departure from a more sedate West to a flamboyant East instead the film opens in a rather sedate part of Japan and then takes us to the more colorful geisha district which introduces this fascinating paradox of great suffering in a milieu of tremendous beauty. We know from Chicago that it's simply Rob Marshall's aesthetic to make everything the height of beauty even if it's a slum. God forbid ENTERTAINMENT CIRCLES should be presented as visually spectacular! The film is by turns funny moving and yes thrilling. Gasps in the audience for the film's third act gave way to sniffles. Ziyi Zhang really managed any language difficulties well her face has this ripple effect when she's emoting. It's stunning to behold. If I were voting for the Oscars I'd definitely give her a nomination at the very least. And homegirl can dance too! Her performance and the film itself are not boring at all audience members laughed when she was trying to be funny and sighed when she was suffering. IMO too much happens in the film for it to get boring there's a strong balance between the rivalries the details about geisha entertainment and the romance. In the final scene it all comes full circle. I won't tell you how. See for yourself.My 1 film of the year. Brokeback Mountain Chronicles of Narnia Howl's Moving Castle King Kong and Grizzly Man aren't far behind.".

Minekosan talked with Golden for hours telling him her life story answering her every question on one condition that she remain anonymous. But Arthur Golden did not keep her concealed. No at the end of his book he credited her as his 'inspiration'. But did he stop there? No. He told the public that Minekosan sold her virginity for a record price which she did not. Mizuage which Golden portrays as a ceremonial deflowering of the young geisha was actually a right of passage where a young geisha's hair was cut. From then on she would wear a wig while performing and it symbolized maturity. Mizuage was never sexual for geisha. The only time mizuage was a sexual term was when it referred to Oiran or Tayuu Japanese courtesans. Perhaps this is a cause of some confusion. But what saddens me is that Golden a Harvard grad had the potential to write an accurate book about geisha. But I suppose he was willing to trade honesty for cash and publicity like most of us these days. And because of him many geisha today must explain to foreigners that their services do not include sex. I really hope to shed led on the dishonesty of Memoirs both film and book.".

It turns out that my opinion of the film that seemed to raise so much controversy over casting and language fell in line with neither the vehemently negative nor the positive accolades of the critics who hail it as one of the best films of the year. Instead I left the theater feeling ambivalent not quite sure to sing its praises or to decry it completely.One thing is for sure the film is gorgeous. There are scenes where the colour seems to bleed off the screen and some just look like portraits. That being said the film seems to have forgotten subtlety as a facet of art. Memoirs of a Geisha feels like a distinctly American period film a fabrication marked by artificiality. Instead of using the actors as a vehicle for conveyance our eyes are instead drawn to the set design the framing the cinematography at least for me.Everyone is probably sick of all the discussions about the casting of Zhang Ziyi Michelle Yeoh and Li Gong but I'm going to raise it again. As a ChineseAmerican it was strange for me to see three actors who don't look Japanese play the part of the geisha. Additionally the fact that the film is in English also proved problematic because although Michelle Yeoh's English is quite polished Li Gong and Zhang Ziyi's English is definitely not. Much of the time I was struggling to understand what they were saying a gripe that I've seen mentioned by many others. The inconsistency of the dialogue e.g. different accents from different characters sporadic Japanese words during English conversation between charactersdetracted from the film for me because I had to keep asking myself Why is this not in Japanese? In the end the film feels like a cup of instant ramen. It's satisfying and tasty when the hunger pangs strike but an hour later you're left wondering why you didn't just go for something a little more substantial than freezedried noodles in a broth made from water and MSG. Memoirs of a Geisha is an entertaining film but I don't think I could sit through it again.".

So runs much of Japanese art perfected to painstaking rules yet requiring a degree of learning simply to appreciate soulpiercing when understood. In Memoirs of a Geisha we must be forgiven for expecting a glimpse some aid to understanding some hint of passion for the difficulttofathom and obscure world of Japan of geisha representatives of artistic excellence and recipients of passionate devotion and maybe some reference to what was a less glamorous side to their institution and one personified in the Western stereotype.The filmmakers went to considerable lengths  top Asian actors a decorated director and cinematographer music by the multiaccoladed John Williams and the film follows on from the hugely successful novel. So does it stand up?Firstly it is visually stunning not only with rural and urban scenery rarely seen in the West but with impressive use of colour and lighting. In one scene as Sayuri makes her debut in a leading part at the theatre we are treated to a fabulous dramatic entrance suggesting classical posture and makeup. It is the bright lights and fast cameras that director Rob Marshall used to such effect in Chicago. We follow a young girl from the time she is sold by her parents through her apprenticeship and graduation as a geisha and then through the onset of war and its aftermath. It has the exotic appeal of say the King and I or other successful movies that use an unknown culture to bring spice to a simple love story. It will delight many audiences. But as anything more serious it plummets as fast as a wingless bird.Although there are moments of tension such as the theatre performance the sumo wrestling match or the jealous rage of a competitor geisha much of the pacing especially in the first third is lacklustre like someone telling a story at a continuous speed much of the background is told in voiceover. Opportunities for dramatic excitement are easily missed with such a format. Telling the story takes much time there is little left for character development so it is hard to identify with the pain and triumphs of even our heroine. A very modest brush with Japanese culture shows this movie lacks authenticity in its most crucial aspects. You cannot cast a film star in a part that requires a lifetime study or the equivalent of a university degree without considerable technical finesse. It would be like asking Richard Gere to dance a couple of scenes from Nureyev. But it gets worse. Everyday details are sloppy and unreflective of Japanese culture. Most obvious perhaps the makeup employed by the film's 'geisha' is instantly recognisable as quite ordinary not the sort that takes hours to apply.In A Beautiful Mind director Ron Howard took a mysterious subject mathematics and made it exciting to nonmathematicians. Other directors have dealt similarly with obscure arts or strange worlds and let us glimpse hitherto unknown regions often adding a love story for good measure. Producer Steven Spielberg however in the film's production notes confesses to a different objective I was very moved by the love story by the rivalry . . . and by the test of friendship. Japanese culture is mentioned only in passing. The aim was not to introduce us to something new but something that's relevant to people in every county.They gave up before they started. Instead of highly developed Japanese traditions we get lowest common denominators and even the 'love story' fails to pass muster as the context a society in those days of arranged marriages is imperfectly explained. It could be in America  just change the country add a mix of oriental costumes and languages plus homage to a wellknown book and lots of highly paid talent that sadly lacks artistic integrity and you have a winning Hollywood formula.It is one thing to 'include' lurid details such auctioning a maidenhead  it is another thing altogether to miss the main point.But has the movie really missed such an opportunity? It might be worth examining even to see if this film is actually an insult to Japanese culture.Ancient Japanese entertainers would perform for the nobility and some females even became concubines to the emperor. The first female geisha were simply dancers or musicians. They soon became popular enough to be able to steal clients from courtesans. They flourished as artists and entertainers and soon became fashion leaders  a bit like western 'supermodels.' In today's Japan geishas are accorded considerable respect for their accomplishments and what they represent. Being in the presence of a geisha is a remarkable experience  as if royalty had suddenly walked into the room one feels thrown against the wall with a sense of awe. A man simply seeking a beautiful courtesan or a mere hostess could find one at a fraction of the price.Memoirs of a Geisha is a tantalising taste of something it's not. It neither informs nor satisfies but entertains sumptuously if simplistically. It will please many less discerning audiences as well as critics or award voters who review a movie by means of DVD  it has a lush play of colour that will transfer to the small screen together with a low attentionspan requirement that allows you to make the coffee. But it is about as far from the memoirs of any geisha as the instant coffee will be from the beautiful ritual of the Japanese tea ceremony. The film like a Japanese haiku doesn't seem to have much to it unlike a Japanese haiku though it really doesn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trouble with the book Memoirs of a Geisha is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.The movie isn't about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American men's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isn't about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes but then why make it into an American fantasy?There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hangups no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri's secret patron and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and reeking of oldman stink get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?Let's try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuri's geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman wasn't her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.Yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrong.Some contrasts between Japan and MOAGJapanese style  Refined elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.Japanese shaved ice  Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice  The Chairman buys Chiyo the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo this treat during cherryblossomviewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha  sluts.Japanese wind chime  Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime  a door bell! If a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance.Japan  Emphasis on human relationships group oriented. MOAG  I want a life that's mine American individualism.Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a notveryauspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire  Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the outofcontrol fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.Enough. The movie stinks.".

Some romantic love story.Yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrong.Some contrasts between Japan and MOAGJapanese style  Refined elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.Japanese shaved ice  Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice  The Chairman buys Chiyo the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo this treat during cherryblossomviewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha  sluts.Japanese wind chime  Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime  a door bell! If a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance.Japan  Emphasis on human relationships group oriented. MOAG  I want a life that's mine American individualism.Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a notveryauspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire  Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the outofcontrol fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.Enough. The movie stinks.";

This immensely satisfying book got a tepid adaptation by Robin Swicord and Doug Wright and it begs for a better screen play than what was chosen to be shown on the screen. Director Bob Marshall's next venture after his successful and popular Chicago seemed at least on paper like the right candidate to be in command of the film version of the book but what he has created seems to have become an oriental soap opera at best.The story is narrated in the first person by Sayuri who has been sold by their impoverished father. The novel is a chronicle of how Sayuri learns to become a geisha and her rivalry with the queen of them all Hatsumomo. Also it is about the relationship between Suyuri and the Chairman. Hatsumomo's competition is the beautiful Mameha who takes Suyuri under her wing and shows her the ropes. The Chairman and Nobu are the men in and out of this story who change Suyuri's life for the best.The casting of Ziyi Zhang as Suyuri doesn't pay off. Ms. Zhang is a beautiful creature to look at but in this film her acting appears to be empty in sharp contrast with her appearance in 2046. Gong Li another beautiful woman appears in all her fury to challenge her position as the queen that she has always been when Sayuri comes on her own. She is a caricature of the character that she is trying to portray no doubt guided by the director in a performance that seems campy in its flavor. Michelle Yeoh Ken Watanabe and Koji Yakusho do what they can in a film where the center of attraction are Ms. Zhang and Ms. Li.The basic flaw of the film is the dialogue that feels so foreign it might have been written in another language. The different accents of the cast doesn't help matters because they speak in a sort of British English that is a distraction. The wonderful costumes are by Colleen Atwood who dresses the women in silks and makes them look fantastic. The cinematography of Dion Beebe is an asset too. The haunting musical score is by John Williams a man who knows how to enhance a film with the right sounds.Memoirs of a Geisha under the direction of Rob Marshall is a spectacle directed to fans of the book who will surely flock to see the film but alas they will not find the essence of Mr. Golden's novel in the finished product.".

I'm glad to say all my doubts have been cast away. Rob Marshall has created a wonderful film.They created a beautiful 1930's Japan. The sets and costumes were stunning. Michelle Yeoh Gong Li and Ziyi Zhang all gave startling performances Especially Ziyi Zhang and Gong Li. They were wonderful It was amazing.One of the most powerful scenes I thought was when Sayuri and Hatsumomo start the fire in the Okiya. At first we see Hatsumomo's reaction  fear. But then she starts throwing the oil lanterns to the floor to feed the flames and we see her face  you can feel that her world is ending. Pumpkin is no longer the heir to the Okiya Mother has given her room to Sayuri. She is a destroyed women. Gong Li gives a phenomenal performance.What I especially liked was how they showed the part after World War II  how the Geisha became more and more like the women they despised the common prostitute. I think Pumpkin best showed this. She was once a quiet timid girl but after the Americans came she became a rowdy sakedrinking soldierpleasing geisha. How the American soldiers polluted this important part of Japanese Culture.When Pumpkin finally betrayed Sayuri and the man she had brought was revealed the audience actually gasped. An audible gasp! Powerful.My only qualms about the movie were as many have said the English. It actually turned out better than I expected but there were still some lines especially by Ziyi Zhang that I couldn't understand.I don't think you should go into the movie expecting to be completely accurate. From the production notes I think they're available on the Official Website we know that wasn't even their major goal. They wanted it to be a fable growing larger than life in Sayuri's mind as an old women. I think it worked and the result was beautiful.".

	schema:headline " Rob Marshall enforces American ignorance with Asian Clich";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Very disappointing. This movie COULD of been so much more. But Rob Marchell decided he was going to be a closed minded American and not choose an authentic route to this movie. A lot about this movie was just appallingly Asian Clich! Allot of the details Rob verbally admitted to not pay attention too and boy does it SHOW! So many things bugged me about this movie. I'll start with the biggest issue hair makeup and dress. Wrong wrong and wrong. In fact because he did it wrong it made the actresses look very unattractive! I thought ZZ looked like an alien. Her debut hair was a tight ugly square knot on the top of her head making her look awkward. The scene were they put rice around her pillow so she doesn't ruin her hair was ridiculous because her hair was pulled back in a tight bun so laying on the side of your head wouldn't ruin the hair at all! Authentic geisha hair is very full and pulled out on the side so yes laying on your hair would flatten it down! So that was just stupid. They had two scenes where they were wearing all RED robes now that was just VERY Asian clich RED is a traditional Chinese color that is prominent in Chinese culture and I know that rob marshall only put in those ALL red outfits because Americans would associate that with 'asian' since we are exposed to Chinese culture more then Japanese. I thought that was just tacky. I could go on and on. When I look at pictures of REAL geisha's they are soo beautiful and pristine and wonderful and the nuances and detail in there dress and hair is what makes them so very appealing and Rob Marchall just TRASHED all of this! He is so very ignorant.Now on to the 'dance' scene. Wow! First thought out of my head after that scene was 'Worst dancing EVER'. OK Now I would of been fairly OK with spicing up the traditional Japanese dance a little because it is allot more nuanced and slow then what we are accustomed too. So I was expecting a COOL dance scene like in 'HERO'. UH no.... She was flailing around in these ugly CLOWN shoes acting like she was having a seizure on stage!!! That had to be the WORST choreographing I have EVER seen! Next issue language OK the fact that they couldn't speak English was a big no no. The acting was wooden and forced and the dialog awkward. It was annoying. If they spoke in fluent correct English then the movie would of been A lot better. Casting Chinese actresses is also a big no no. How culturally insensitive can you be?and now story. Wow! Rob marshall effectively dumbed down the plot to middle school level. All the nuances in the book were ignored and looked over to fill in with clich cat fight the crass and the obvious. Yeah Rob Marshall was the WRONG director. Which really upsets me. This is my Favorite book and I have been looking forward to this movie for 6 YEARS! And not only that but because he bombed on this movie I doubt that we will see another movie in the genre for a LONG time. Which is too bad Hollywood really needed some new material. Sorry 210".

I am disappointed not only by the poor characters and holey plot but by the portray of mothers in general. Every mother outside of the main characters circle seems to be pretentious and annoying. Scratch that all the mothers in the film are annoying along with our lead who is also sallow and whiny. Eliza complains that mothers are not regarded as people well if that's the message the writer set out to shatter during the film all she succeeded in doing was enhancing it. The film does have some positive moments which are quite amusing. But these are drowned in Eliza's petty cry of 'It's so hard being a mummy!'. Eliza's sheer pathetic nature ruins any chance of a creditable message shining through. If the main character had been portrayed realistically it may have been partly salvaged. But Eliza comes off as having at the maturity of a school girl facing 'challenges' which have been blown out of proportion. What challenges does this women face? A time schedule a flight of stairs walking a dog and losing her car. Oh dear poor darling she's had a hard day. Her reaction of trying to run away towards the end of the film is ridiculous. 'My child has the flimsy plastic plates and hastily obtained gifts she asked for she doesn't need me!' Her husband gives her a poor review if she had previously been a professional author she surely had received worse than that. I also found it remarkable that with her 'busy' schedule she managed to get takeaway coffee invite a strange man into her home and dance with him and go to a sale. Eliza demands throughout to be an individual not to be seen as just a 'mother'. This is perfectly justifiable but Eliza seems to merely be motivated by selfishness. The cold hard truth that the film hastily puts across is that she cannot be both. The moral I wanted to tell Eliza was that sometimes life is difficult and that when you have children they must come first like it or not. I also wanted to inform her how lucky she is. Her children are healthy her husband doesn't use her as a football she has a home and an income.All in all Eliza needs to grow up. The film doesn't not show the plight of mothers just the petty cries of welloff white women who have no idea what hardship truly is. I say she is rich because she can afford to feed her children and clothe them buy things for herself and have a car. Some mothers believe it or not don't have that. I wonder how Eliza would cope handling their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not terribly hard to sell water to people in the desert. It's also not very hard to make a movie reflecting on hard lives of mothers and gain respect of mother who watch it. The trick is to make such movie and sell it to people who aren't mothers. This movie failed on that line. Failed miserably.Motherhood is a long it seems movie about a mother that has to do it all. She tries to be a great mother she tries to run errands she tries to revive a dying career she tries to take care of her elderly neighbor and most of all she tries to find peace of mind and justice in the world seemingly unsuited for mothers like her. If it doesn't sound original to you at this point it's probably because it's not. And it doesn't get any better.The problem I personally had with the movie is that I can't seem to categorize it. It's not a comedy it's not a drama it's not a love story and it's definitely not a family movie. The only thing that comes to my mind is that it's perhaps a movie made for mothers who probably won't find to watch it but if they do it will make them feel better for a day or two.As far as the personality goes there really isn't any. Thurman's acting is surprisingly flat and annoying she takes on more than she can chew just to bitch about it in her Carrie Bradshawlike narrative bits she submits on her blog. She constantly asks the world why can't a mother be still a person why must she undergo a partial lobotomy and dedicate her entire life to make another happen. Well I don't know. And if you think you'll watch the movie and find out don't bother no question is answered. There is no motto no meaningful ending other than 'Gee I really overreacted at that store today. I'm going to get up in the morning and be a better mother to my children'. I believe the answer could be don't be mad but...Nobody forced you to have a kid. Or two for that matter.Motherhood is extremely disappointing as a movie especially if you weren't born with an uterus instead of trying to diminish the fact that some mothers are indeed a little psycho it creates even a bigger gap between the men and the women between the fathers and the mothers.".

The entire movie is a confusing and annoying piece of trash. I'm sure such situations do exist probably even worse but trying to globalize this as being the usual motherhood is disgusting and discouraging to any future mother to be. I refuse to believe that the characteristics of a modern day mother is being hysterical bitching screaming always deadtired and frustrated not to mention the father being a retarded being showing absolutely no interest in raising a child or helping around the house. Instead he is collecting old books based on the idiotic hope of accidentally gaining a fortune someday which bummer actually happens in the end. Money clearly wasn't the main problem in this family it was the lack of communication and team work which remains unsolved even after the credits roll.Avoid if you're willing to waste your time waste it on a bad movie that can be perceived as entertaining which is clearly not the case here.".

	schema:headline " A Whiny Movie Of Little Substance";
	schema:reviewBody "If you make the mistake of reading this movie's own description you go into it thinking that you're going to find a lighthearted funny account of a mother trying to pull off the ultimate birthday party. The early parts of the movie seem to reinforce this especially the encounter with the snooty neighbour and daughter who go on and on about the fabulous birthday party they had pulled off. So you think this is going to turn into a competition to make a better birthday party. But from that point on any sense of fun in this movie just absolutely disappears and never reappears. This becomes a sombre movie that really focuses more on Eliza's disillusionment with her life her husband the sacrifices she had to make etc. etc. Boo hoo. You had to sacrifice something for the sake of your children and things didn't turn out exactly the way you had hoped and dreamed they would. Well Eliza welcome to real life. Sometimes we sacrifice and change direction for the sake of our kids. It's called parenthood  or in Eliza's case Motherhood.OK. I didn't like the overall whiny tone of the movie or of Eliza's character. Setting that distaste aside I have two fundamental problems with this a it wasn't funny or even just humorous and b it wasn't really interesting. There was nothing that made this story seem like a movie should be made out of it. Eliza's car got towed. Wow. Her friend got mad at her because she broke a confidence. Gee. She lost her parking spot. Tell me it ain't so! Gripping stuff. The only thing I felt compelled to watch closely was when Eliza brought the messenger in for a drink of water. You're thinking that something is going to happen between the two of them. I liked the way that turned out. Beyond that the movie's really devoid of substance.It benefits from having basically likable leads. Uma Thurman and Anthony Edwards are fine. Not a lot of chemistry between them and the one extended kissing scene between them in the whole movie seemed quite forced and artificial. But they're likable enough. They make it watchable they don't make it good though. 310".

Sometimes we sacrifice and change direction for the sake of our kids. It's called parenthood  or in Eliza's case Motherhood.OK. I didn't like the overall whiny tone of the movie or of Eliza's character. Setting that distaste aside I have two fundamental problems with this a it wasn't funny or even just humorous and b it wasn't really interesting. There was nothing that made this story seem like a movie should be made out of it. Eliza's car got towed. Wow. Her friend got mad at her because she broke a confidence. Gee. She lost her parking spot. Tell me it ain't so! Gripping stuff. The only thing I felt compelled to watch closely was when Eliza brought the messenger in for a drink of water. You're thinking that something is going to happen between the two of them. I liked the way that turned out. Beyond that the movie's really devoid of substance.It benefits from having basically likable leads. Uma Thurman and Anthony Edwards are fine. Not a lot of chemistry between them and the one extended kissing scene between them in the whole movie seemed quite forced and artificial. But they're likable enough. They make it watchable they don't make it good though. 310";

The first few minutes of the film in which we see Uma shambling around a shabby apartment seemed kind of creepy like a PSA for depression. The film is very uneven and can't be called a comedy and really didn't seem like a drama or love story. If anything it shows the average New Yorker as quite annoying and unlikable. Uma's character whines about not having time to do anything even though she does not have a job and creates extra work for herself like giving her elderly neighbor orange juice. She writes meaningless Blogs Carrie Bradshaw style in the little slices of free time she has. She runs around like a crazy person trying to prepare for her daughter's birthday obsessing bizarrely over the fact that the day is the last day my daughter will be 5. WTF was that all about? Also why does she wait until the last minute to prepare for the party? She seems to want to be a victim to be able to complain incessantly about the hardships of being a mother. Like other posters said having children is a choice usually. Nobody forced her to have two kids and a dog she doesn't clean up after!I am sick of so many unoriginal movies about parenthood. Why doesn't Hollywood do something original fat chance and actually portray a couple that cannot have kids? The fact that this movie flopped so badly is a good indication that people are sick of this type of movie. I will give this movie a little bit of credit for having the couple not be rich and I liked the Pylon song Uma and the delivery guy danced to.".

Much of her frustration is also to do with the fact that she has just realized how fast her daughter is growing up and is trying to hold on to her childhood.I did find the characterization of the Eliza's husband halfbaked. At first he appears to be this slacker jerk who doesn't do anything while the poor wife is working hard to make ends meet then in the second half the writer tries to make him this kind loving husband who cares about his wife and attempts to redeem him by the end twist with the envelope. So what would have happened had he not received it? Would he have remained the frustrated jerk? It just felt forced as if the writer wanted to quickly round things up.Uma Thurman does a decent job. She is supported well by the rest of the cast especially Minnie Driver.'Motherhood' does tend to be farfetched at times. An example is the scene where Eliza tries to drive away.

But there wasn't enough drama to call this a drama either. It seems to me that the directorwriters did not actually know what they were making and someone in marketing decided to call it humour.Now to the spoilers For the first hour or so the movie showed Uma Thurman running errands and blogging and encountering various sorts of people. Running errands may be part of motherhood but it certainly is only a small part of it. Then for the last half an hour the movie focused on light drama as the blogging mother finally finds a way to describe what motherhood means to her while the father is having fun with the kids and spending time with them. Unfortunately none of what she ends up describing was ever shown on screen  she never showed that side of motherhood to the viewers and thus her description feels empty and tagged on. A lie in short.I must further add that I'm a father of a twoyearold and my wife is naturally a mother. Neither of us saw anything in this movie relating to our life. Except that we are always busy but we didn't really need to be told that. ".

I don't wish that on anybody but I feel if someone with great talent maybe John Singleton worked on the project it'd be a worth seeing film with a great message and great performances.I don't see why we should have sympathy for Uma Thurman when her character is clearly just having a bad day or a bad week. She lives in a sizable apartment in West Village New York has another for that matter a good consistent blog and a nice family. She's doing way better than I am yet she wants sympathy because she's been running around for one day trying to organize a birthday party for her kid.Yes Uma Thurman plays Eliza a mother who is trying to give her daughter the best sixth birthday party ever. Her absent minded husband Avery Edwards is a classic book collector who means well but sort of clueless. So she is left to try and construct this party by herself with numerous things going wrong.I'm in no way saying motherhood is an easy thing. It's probably grueling some days but enlightening on others. Eliza is simply having a bad day. When mother's have young kids they want to give them the world on their birthdays. They want them to be happy. Planning a party for a six year old is harder than planning one for a thirteen year old. When you're six you get what's best. When you're thirteen you want this that this that and don't forget that.I have minor sympathy for this slump Eliza is in but she lives in West Village of all places.

Again not to sound like I'm jealous but if you have enough money to afford West Village you obviously have enough money to work something out for your daughter's party.Despite comments online I went into Motherhood with my head held high. I thought it might surpass some of the extreme hate it's getting on some sites. Then when I saw character development is weak the realism among Eliza's friends is slim and Uma Thurman's appearance in almost every shot of this movie when she isn't playing that great of a character I lost interest fast.Starring Uma Thurman and Anthony Edwards.

This is the story of a difficult day in the life of a stay at home mom who is desperately trying to regain some piece of her identity apart from motherhood. To answer the question raised in one of the other reviews Is this motherhood  Yes it can be like that relentless thankless and exhausting. Personally I found it refreshing that it was much more realistic than those spotless homes of movie families where nothing is out of place and the husband shares equally in everything family related so that everyone seems to live a perfect existence. I'm sure there are families out there where everyone cooperates and things run smoothly. There are just as many out there that have their serious flaws and unbalanced work loads and people who live right on the border of losing it when the things that go wrong seem to mount up and conspire against you to prevent you from getting even the simple things accomplished. Maybe the reason some people have a problem with this movie is that it shows more reality than fantasy. Whatever the case I say judge for yourself and see the flaws in humanity as they are. We don't always make the right decisions sometimes we let each other down and sometimes we can forgive each other and make things right again.".

That is to say a young woman who lives in an upscale part of town in this case Greenwich Village has a hoard of New Agey mom friends who obsess over the insandouts of successful childrearing and herself hosts a blog dedicated to  what else?  how to survive the rigors of young motherhood without sacrificing one's identity as a woman as a wife and as an individual. It's a battle that Eliza seems to be losing at the moment but at least she's giving it the old college try.Written and directed by Katherine Dieckmann this seriocomic tale takes place on the day before Eliza's oldest child is to turn six. Filled with mixed emotions at the event and saddled with a husband Anthony Edwards who seems more focused on his own needs than those of his wife Eliza struggles with arranging a birthday party dodging parking tickets coping with a studioshoot on her street looking out for her elderly neighbor and raising a toddler  all while trying to carve out a little time for herself to write and to do all the things adults those without children at least normally do in the course of their days.Dieckmann's screenplay is filled with both poignancy and humor as it deftly explores the life of this harried mother. Uma Thurman in a tourdeforce performance captures both the manic energy and utter exhaustion of the nonstop merrygoround that her character finds herself riding on and she is fully supported by Edwards as her husband Minnie Driver as her closest girlfriend and Arjun Fupta Nurse Jackie as a sexy delivery boy who for a brief moment at least allows Eliza to let her hair down a bit and to see the heart of the vibrant sexy carefree woman that still beats beneath all the motherly obsessions and concerns.Although it's ultimately a bit too slight in the drama department for it to rise much above the level of a bemusing curiosity Motherhood still has some valid insights to make about its subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bride now becomes the Mom and that somehow didn't translate quite well for local audiences given the limited release which so far hasn't gained much traction if going by the looks of the session I attended. Hopefully this should still find a niche market amongst the mothers here for the issues raised that would strike a chord which is about just what Motherhood means unless of course like Uma Thurman's Eliza the real moms out there are too bogged down by their tasks to find time to take in a movie.Written and directed by Katherine Dieckmann and set in Manhattan New York there might be a few topics and incidents raised that are location specific but these offer a kind of slice of life peek into urban living in the big apple and the challenges faced with raising kids in the city. For instance I cannot fathom how parking could be that much of an issue and hassle despite experiencing parking woes here as well in a different capacity. And being a film in NY it has its rudimentary quirks pointing back at film that we rarely take into consideration such as the inconveniences posed by film crews to the residents when doing location shoots or hilarious put the mamarazzis who naturally point and shoot with their cameras when a celebrity mom pass their way look out for Jodie Foster's cameo!But those aside Motherhood unfolds over a single day following Eliza as she packs in a hectic schedule from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to bed. It's the same for all moms I suppose with the natural maternal instincts kicking in and their family obligations and responsibility go into overdrive to take care of and provide. Through a single day the story examines what Motherhood essentially means and the multifacets involved that just demands excellent multitasking skills with each assignment for the day requiring extreme focus from grocery shopping to picking up the kids and worse for Eliza having to organize a birthday party for her 6 year old Clara Daisy Tahan.Which is surprising that she still finds the time to blog but that serves as therapy and a plot device to tell all that she still can't get the writer out of her and through an advertised contest has taken upon herself to submit a piece on Motherhood in order to secure a regular writing column that pays well. After all their household requires additional income to augment that of her husband's Anthony Edwards who seem to disappear and not lend a hand around the house  the opening montage would make some feel quite guilty  and one wonders just how much patience mothers actually have in tolerating nonassistance or when they will actually cry out for help should they snap.One often forget that parenting is a full time job full of repetitive and often menial tasks that calls for plenty of endurance skill and Love a key essential ingredient without which everything else would seem quite impossible. Besides exalting the virtues of Motherhood the film also reminds that it doesn't mean one has to give up one's dreams to take care of the family though sacrifices are called for from time to time in parenting. Uma Thurman plays the frenzied Eliza perfectly looking quite geeky with her spectacles and her messy hairdo and with that level of edginess that threatens to explode at any unsuspecting victim who unwittingly crosses her path.But what took the cake is the hypocrisy that Eliza sometimes lapses into which makes her all the more human and believable and I wonder just how many of us are guilty as charged where we tend to take care of our own by expecting values out of others yet be able to turn around and violate the same without much thought. Live and let live goes the mantra.While not perfect and with scenes that curiously stick out such as the extended episode with the delivery guy Arjun Gupta that seemed to want to suggest something of a subplot that needed to head a certain direction then backed out this film still has pretty much what it takes to talk about its main theme but perhaps something more fun will be to learn about or trade stories and experiences with real moms. And save on the ticket cost unless you're a fan of Uma Thurman of course.".

Many willdo not like this movie maybe because it hurts to admit that the lead couple in fact mirrors in a Picassoish way a lot of us parents these days. Despite the title Motherhood is not trying to be a universal portrait but rather a particularized snapshot that might show broad themes. The characters are essentially caring liberal broadminded people trying to squeeze all of their ideals into what is necessarily an extremely limiting and oftentimes frustrating enterprise for most human beings  parenthood. If you live in a big popular cosmopolitan city  for the sake of the culture diversity and tightknit neighborliness  then parking will be a problem. If you submit to your child's wish to have a theme birthday  then you might be harried with providing that in said city particularly if you have sneaking suspicion that it's overkill anyway . If you want to be writers pursuing a life of the mind  well that may not neatly coincide with making the kids' breakfast every morning and consistently attending their school functions. The movie simply presents this conundrum  a picture of the humanityloving folks among us who turn out to act quite frazzled and nasty when mugged by Reality  all without judging. Yes the characters have bitten off more than they can chew but haven't so many of us done the same at least sometimes in some areas of life? It may be dispiriting to watch but it's real.The message of the movie seems to be that parenthood particular motherhood demands sacrifices that some of us make less easily than others  but that everyone is indeed trying their best. I found Anthony Edwards' husband character quite relatable  a wee bit unaware but absolutely loving and supportive in the ways he does understand. This couple again like many others seem almost too similar to one another thus lacking the balance necessary to make those ideal families flow so swimmingly. The living room dancescene with the stranger almost broke my heart. How many parents have pined over the loss of what they thought was their individuality  but then also felt guilty and selfish for even thinking that? I could go on...Suffice it to say that Motherhood's rambling unrealism a kind of Impressionism calls up some uncomfortable realities of our postfeminist life it gets under the skin and cuts a bit close to the bone  apparently too close for some folks' comfort.".

Being a father of two kids of similar ages to those shown in this movie I got pretty quickly involved into the action on the screen. While it didn't strike me as a comedy it does contain some very typical situations you can laugh about when looking at them as a stranger. What did strike me is cinematography which seemed odd at first because I didn't expect anything of the kind. Almost every shot feels sort of cramped and closed. It was literally painful to watch at certain moments. It made me experience this claustrophobic feeling when you can't stop doing what you're doing when you can't find a way out of this routine you feel your life has become. And I think this is brilliant. Regarding Ms Thurman acting I can only say that it fits perfectly with the pace and feel of the film. The ending seemed a bit soapy. And still this is a movie worth watching.".

There's a particular scene in a bakery where three women discuss different blogs and Uma learns that other consider hers to be feminist. I'm giving away any more about this surprisingly different film. Not much movies concentrate on a married middleaged woman's problems. Uma's rant in the street is a glorified example.

	schema:headline " A mother in the verge of a nervous breakdown.";
	schema:reviewBody "A sad fact is that few  or none  movies have shown the reality of being a contemporary mother. Maybe the lack of interest about this kind of stories subsists because mothers are an excluded demographic group and their chores are still unrewarded in social and economical terms. The indie film Motherhood from the director Katherine Dieckmann has the merit of being the only recent movie that has shown the perils of motherhood in a sincere and interesting way.Motherhood describes one day in the life of Eliza Welsh  a geeky bohemian and messy mommy who lives in the verge of a nervous breakdown  but it's not a regular one it's a pretty chaotic 24 hour marathon in which several significant events converge being the most important of them the celebration of her lovely daughter's sixth birthday. Eliza should beat many urban obstacles in order to bring into line her different roles woman wife mother and writer. At some points Eliza seems conceived by her creator as a contemporary version of Mrs. Dalloway with a post9.11 mommy turn and it appealed me.Uma Thurman in the main role looks exactly like a Greenwich Village's jumbled mother and the way in which she assumes the unstoppable urgencies of her character is wonderful. In the supporting roles Anthony Edwards is excellent portraying the extremely unfocused husband Minnie Driver looks smart and sparkling in the role of the best friend and Daisy Tahan portrays the part of Clara Eliza's daughter with a surprising and overwhelming naturalism.I like the fact that Kaherine Dieckmann approaches the topic of motherhood in a candid way that rings true and feels personal. I guess that the main problem of Motherhood is the tone sometimes it's uneven but in general terms I think that the story has many truthful moments and the script delivers some wise and funny lines. The climatic moment of the movie is the terrific scene wherein Eliza explains her husband that she feels that those concrete and specific chores that mothers do  like cleaning doing the dishes etc.  blow away passion and the most wonderful thing of this little and entertaining movie resides in the message of the cited scene it's not about a woman regretting motherhood actually it's about a person who desperately wants to recuperate passion.".

I bring up Uma's luminescence because it saves this film from being another dreary almost funny shallow take on Motherhood. Her performance is spot on and smoking while hanging out the car window blasting the radio in the car while driving insanely moving a vehicle without properly strapping the child in this is all stuff that mothers succumb too on a daily basis. I do have a differing opinion on the messenger scenes SPOILER ALERT The messenger storyline was not unfinished there was nothing else for a woman who won't cheat  for some wives that is cheating in a sense  it's hurtful and hopeful in soul crushing contradiction to have an attractive member of the opposite sense look at us with something other than hausfrau utility. Uma came clean in the car for this reason and in this coming clean scene in the car with Anthony Edwards Uma gives the best monologue of the movie. I give this movie a 710. A 1010 for Uma's performance as well as Anthony Edwards performance who is perfect as the nearly there husband and a 310 for sprinkles of reality on a cupcake of anecdotes. My final thoughts Very watchable and likable. Not a mustsee unless you're a Thurman fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Chandan Arora hits gold with his debut film Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon an unusual selfreflexive look at Bollywood's reality versus its public image and the dreams it fosters.The story concerns an innocent girl named Chukti Antara Mali who lives in the farming village hinterlands of India and who loves the work of Bollywood star Madhuri Dixit. Most of the village turns out during their free time to watch the latest films on a makeshift screen in a makeshift theater. Chukti has a talent for mimicking Dixit a fact she exploits by putting on public performances of her owndancing on a small stage to Dixit songs playing on a boombox. Chukti dreams of moving to Mumbai and becoming a film heroine. Of course her parents are traditional so they won't hear anything of it. When they realize she's serious enough to consider running away they plan to marry her off as soon as possible.Enter Rajeshwar Singh Rajpal Yadav. He's the only person in the village who sincerely believes in Chukti and he's also in love with her although she seems oblivious to itshe only cares about becoming a star. He suggests that if he can talk his father into arranging a marriage between them which they'll keep secretly platonic he'll take her to Mumbai as his wife. There they can pursue Chukti's dream.The bulk of the film is about Chukti trying to make it in Bollywood. The dramatic hinge is the clash of her dreams with the realities of the film business and big city life.This is a unique film in that it forgoes many of the staples of the Bollywood genre. Yes there are songs there is a romance of sorts and there is even a kind of love triangle but these are all very unusually incorporated. The songs are exclusively present for realistic dramatic purposes. Songs only appear when characters are engaging in stage performances celebrations with music film performances and so on. Arora always has the music at a level of removewe're watching people watching or engaging in performances. The romance aspect is almost exclusively implicit. There is something of a resolution to it in the end but the resolution is extremely subtleit basically amounts to a character putting on a piece of jewelry and the action easily enables multiple interpretations. The love triangle takes place between the party who secretly loves Chutki and a party who is only trying to manipulate her dreams to take advantage of her. It is resolved in an incredibly powerful dramatic moment that in a lesser film would be followed up with a clichd vengeance subplot. Here it's not brought up againthis says much more than the stereotype would.Incredible dramatic power is apt for much of the film even though there are extended comedic segments as well. Most of Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon is constructed more like a tragedy with brief comic relief. All of the plot developments are very realistic. And as such the theme of the film is often a necessary medicine disillusioning from unrealistic dreams. Some might think it is a flaw that most characters are slightly caricatured in the film. However it is not as if there aren't people in the real world like this. There is no shortage of the relatively nave coming from the heartland to Los Angeles New York City and presumably Mumbai hoping to make it big in a stroke yet having very little knowledge of how the arts and entertainment industries work. For another example it's certainly not the case only in fiction that some parents are bilked out of money via funding requests from their offspring for nonexistent projects and studies. That the film is so unique should be expected once one realizes that it was produced by Ram Gopal Varma. Varma is well known for advocating breaks from various Bollywood traditions that have become clichd. He's made films completely void of musical numbers. He's made films without romance elements. He's made films with vastly different pacing and plot structures than the typical Bollywood film. There's nothing wrong with the traditional Bollywood formula except that variety is necessary. Varma is doing much to set the Indian film industry on the right road in that regard.So it's fitting that Varma is behind this wellacted welldirected wellphotographed etc. film that looks at Bollywood with a critical eye. It is just as intriguing for its insights into the real world of filmmaking as it is for its plot about Chukti and Raja. Varma and Arora show us that often a director is more someone who merely tries to keep a lid on burgeoning chaos partially emerging from underlings who'll make stupid decisions in an attempt to please and partially from grunts who don't know what the heck they're doing. They show us the complicated world of agents who mean well but who have to be shysters a bit because it's in the job description. They show us how catty and competitive other entertainers can be. They show us the realities of working one's way up. They show us the difference between image such as the idea that Bollywood or even Hollywood is some kind of glamorous unified entity and the scattered somewhat grungy realityChukti and Raja have to live in a rathole next door to someone who has been involved with over 50 films and some participants don't even live in the same country. They show us how important it is to learn to take rejection. They show us a transparent look at studio guards and security. They show us that manipulativeexploitative fraud isn't limited to the entertainment industry. And so on.Whether you just want a unique humorous powerful and moving film about charming characters or an inside look at the film industry or a bit of both Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon fits the bill.".

A good actress can show her talent even by the way she walks out of her apartment to the sidewalk. Her walk has the feel of disappointment. This sets apart an actress from other Performers. Ram Gopal Varma has an astute eye for talent and Antara Mali didn't disappoint him in Company and Road and now in MMDBCH she is just too good. This is one of the sweetest movies to come out of RMG Banner. There is an innate beauty about this film and the brilliant direction by Chandan Aurora that brings up the best of Mali and Yadav. Rajpal Yadav was seen in many Masala Movies in an attempt to fill the slack from Johny Lever who has become a bane and a bore but Raja is a role custom fitted for Yadav who in his inimitable accent and style captures the essence of a relation where one half always seem to care more for the other half with a selfless devotion and belief in the talent. The sojourn in the village till they reach Mumbai is plainly hilarious. The Govind Namdeo as the Agent the way he treats Raja as an useful idiot! is superbly casted so are parents of Chutkithe phone dialog between Chutki and her father is a real tearjerker and Raja. There are some heartfelt and authentic rural scenes. The ending is an anticlimax rather selfish and abrupt almost like no dessert was served but the main course was so delicious and sweet I didn't miss the dessert.".

Chutki ends up marrying Raja so they can go off to Bombay and Chutki can realize her dreams.But her copying Madhuri ends up getting her jobs as part of the dance troupe as an item girl. She wants to be a leading lady but she is like a babe in the woods  the vulnerable outsider  both Bombay and the biz are completely unknown to her and her husband. In fact one is expecting dire things to happen at any moment  the slightly shady looking neighbor who turns out to be pretty benign the hoodlum who turns out to be a cowardly fellow the cabbie who merely price gouges the agent who seems so ominously shady yet turns out to be a real agent and helpful at that.. These personalities in the world around her underline the fact that nothing should be taken at face value.The movie also had some very funny moments  Choli ke peeche kya hai wil never seem the same to me! And the part where Rajpal Yadav goes to plead on her behalf and ends up being offered the acting role instead ironic yet funny.I liked Antara's looks  she was a strange blend of attractive and ordinary and she acted very well as the village belle who was so self assured in her village environment and so vulnerable and unsure in the big city. Rajpal Yadav was very good as the self effacing husband. I particularly liked the fact that the Madhuri moments were brief and Antara managed to make them her own. Music was unobtrusive and worked well in the film. I also liked the fact that not much was made of the Chutki Raja romance and the fact that the marriage was in name only!".

	schema:reviewBody "Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon turns a critical eye to Bollywood and does this in a good way. There are several layers to comment this movie on since most of the above commenters already talked about the plot and the message of the movie I'll talk a bit more about the filmtechnique.The main thing I noticed is how the movie plays with 'reality' and ' virtuality' in quite a postmodernist fashion whenever in reallife ' fake' or 'unreal' emotions are in play there's a typical Bollywoodsong when Chutki sings about her dream to become the next Madhuri in the beginning for example and when supporting role Rumi also sings about is dreams to become famous through use of this technique the viewer realizes that part of why Chutki wants to be famous is not only because she has a real and unique talent which she obviously has but also because she has a certain narcissistic bent which becomes apparent through the rest of the movie for example in how she treats her best friend and husband Raja. The rest of the song and dance we see is carefully integrated in the movie so that there is no ' break' from the movie something some bollywoodmovies suffer from. Another technique used is at the moment when Raja and Chutki go to see her debutfilm and in a nearempty theater witness how the movie excites derision and contempt in the few drunks who bothered to buy the ticket for Chutki's first movie at the moment when reality really sinks in into Chutki's selfcentered worldview and when Raja for the first time really shows how he feels after all the bad treatment he got the filmpicture suddenly goes grainier and the colors become a bit staler as if we were sitting at a drivein back in the 70's or something. Those ' most real' moments are shot in an ' unreal' moment. We can interpret this as meaning that this is the moment where both characters display the filmlike heroism so much talked about but on the other hand it also signifies the disconnect there is between Bollywood and everyday reality any moment like this in a clichBollywood flick wouldn't be important.There's more little gadgets like these which make the movie a really wellthought out expose and critique of all types of Bollywoodclichs not only the plot is a comment on Bollywood but also the techniques used the way the characters are built up  and more. In that sense it is a very good movie and very good acting by lead actors Antara Mali and Rajpal Yadav.At the same time this impressive intellectual tourdeforce does make it more difficult to really identify very deeply with the characters and to really feel all of the emotions  and that is one of Bollywood's strong points these movies are usually guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes and smiles to your face. While there are some emotionally tense moments there the obvious flaws in the main characters e.g. Chutki's narcissism and Raja's overall shyness necessary to drive the plot these necessary flaws do also irritate sometimes and at certain points seem to be unbelievable. Again these character flaws are necessary they don't compromise Antara and Rajpal's good acting and they drive he plot but their obviousness from the beginning on does make the characters reactions a bit more predictable and less identifiable with. The most interesting character is Raja's who seems to overcome his naivet quite quickly and from halfway in the movie onwards is constantly seen asking the right type of questions in every situation and most interestingly in some sentences even seems to be harking back on his knowledge as a farmer e.g. when he talks about getting to know the filmindustry from the stem and the root to make sense of bigcity Bombay.So all in all this is a good movie which may speak a bit more to the mind then it does to the heart. It is good to see that Bollywood is able to play with their clichs and standards. Don't get me wrong I love the standard Bollywood movie exactly for their 'unrealistic' topoi like song and dance and the us of color. But this movie reminds us all that their are more ways to a make a good movie and that India is picking up on all of them. Go see it enjoy it and think about it.".

Day in Day out much to her parents dismay she puts on show after show entertaining the happy and fanatical people of her village who can't seem to get enough of her turn as the famed Dixit. Don't miss the scene in which inspired by the scenes of Devdas she puts on a great show consisting of the Madhuri numbers from the film. One day her parents grow tired of her showoffs and plan to marry her off. When Chutki Mali learns of this she runs to her best friend's played by Rajpal Yadav house and tells him the bad news. Raja as he is fondly called believes so much in his bestfriend Chutki that he refuses to allow her parents to make such a big mistake. So he plots with her to put on a marriage show for their family and villagers and that way they will be able to travel to Mumbai in the hopes of making it big. The scheme works and they get to go to Mumbai. Only once they get their they realise that everything is not as easy as it seems on television. Disappointment after disappointment follows them every were and the dignity of Chutki is compromised so many times as she begins to learn the ways of the city as a villager visiting there for the first time. Chutki can get annoying at times she isn't the least bit patient. She just wants to become a 'HEROINE' by all means that she loses out on many opportunities in the process. By the time she realises that she has to start from somewhere all those free opportunities are long gone and now she has to pay her way to get to the top. Humiliated by the flop of her first major film release she retreats to the village to find solace. Her famed destiny follows not too far behind in this mostly ignored but otherwise superb film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Chandan Arora and Ram Gopal Verma team up and deliver a funny endearing touching subtle and sincere little gem ironically titled 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon!'. The film shows the many shades of the Hindi film industry both through a fantasylike perspective the way Chutki sees it and a realistic perspective the way Chutki and Raj experience it but most of it is done in a subtle way and the humour really balances the tension in the film.The triangle love story between Chutki Raj and the film industry is also wonderfully downplayed. There is no typical 'I Love You' scene or a scene where Raj acts out his jealousy. Raj clearly loves Chutki and his principle priority is her happiness. Chutki's first love is the movies but she eventually grows to love Raj after realizing the sacrifices he has made to make her dream come true.Makrand Deshpande deserves credit for coming up with the story idea. The multidimensional screenplay is very strong. Director Arora has a strength for telling stories about the common people. He has further demonstrated this in the charming 'Main Meri Patni Aur Woh'. Very few directors can tell such stories with conviction.The songs are quite wellpresented. They're not used in typical Bollywood fashion. They add to the fantasy element of the film. The cinematography is good too and lighting works brilliantly. The editing crew has done a fine job and the film flows fluidly.Antara Mali delivers a mindblowing nuanced performance. She completely owns Chutki and does a fine job of mimicking Madhuri Dixit. The 'Madhuri' sequences are suitably brief and Mali gives Chutki a unique personality. Rajpal Yadav is terrific. He conveys Raj's unconditional love for Chutki with ease and an endearing subtlety. Govind Namdeo shows a flair for comedy as the hilarious agent. The supporting cast is pretty solid.'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon!' is another gem produced by the Ram Gopal Verma factory. It has charm. It's got humour. It's fantastical and real and above all it has heart.".

The multidimensional screenplay is very strong. Director Arora has a strength for telling stories about the common people. He has further demonstrated this in the charming 'Main Meri Patni Aur Woh'. Very few directors can tell such stories with conviction.The songs are quite wellpresented. They're not used in typical Bollywood fashion. They add to the fantasy element of the film. The cinematography is good too and lighting works brilliantly. The editing crew has done a fine job and the film flows fluidly.Antara Mali delivers a mindblowing nuanced performance. She completely owns Chutki and does a fine job of mimicking Madhuri Dixit. The 'Madhuri' sequences are suitably brief and Mali gives Chutki a unique personality. Rajpal Yadav is terrific. He conveys Raj's unconditional love for Chutki with ease and an endearing subtlety. Govind Namdeo shows a flair for comedy as the hilarious agent. The supporting cast is pretty solid.'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon!' is another gem produced by the Ram Gopal Verma factory. It has charm. It's got humour. It's fantastical and real and above all it has heart.";

Savalas attempting no sort of accent or strong characterization slides through the film on his unique brand of charm.  He was at or near his height of fame at he time.  He's given a scene to explain why in this version of the story Villa is bald yet in a clip that takes place prior to the shaving he is bald then too!  He is only effective at all because so many of the rest of the cast are bad.  Roman god come to life Walker costars as a gunrunner who works alongside Savalas.  Sadly he is covered up by a jaunty captain's hat and a double breasted coat much of the time so his treasure of a chest is under wraps.  Still his innate charm and handsome face add a lot to this very slight movie.  He manages to inject some humor and slyness into his part.  Francis has very little to do in her role and disappears without a trace at some point! but is attractive.  Conners with his skeletal features and corpselike lips plays a mad driven Army officer who's bent on cleanliness and order at the expense of efficiency.  He has a notable scene in which a mess hall is virtually trashed in order to excise one fly. The film is impossible to take seriously and it doubtful that it was intended as such.  It's a sort of parodic satiric take on the genre. Unfortunately it doesn't have the wit or the money to make much of an impression.  The sets look like they wouldn't pass muster on Bonanza and the dubbing in fact all of the sound is horrible.  The music in this film is almost it's worst aspect.  There is a highly aggravating theme played by the Mexicans as they enter the U.S. and it is ceaseless in its torture of the viewers' ears.  To top it off there's a hellacious closing credit song sung by Savalas ! and written by John Cacavas who did music for Kojak and a horde of TV movies.  The film is not very good but watchable once if little is expected of it.".

By the time Villa feigns being dead I realized for sure that this one was intended to be an over the top flick with Savalas going over the top more than once. Without even knowing anything about the historical Pancho Villa I'm sure this film had nothing remotely to do with him.It's always neat though to see legendary TV Western personalities make a comeback in this case both 'Rifleman's' Connors and Cheyenne Bodie himself Clint Walker. Walker portrays Villa's American sidekick though it's never made clear why he sides with the Mexicans. A full decade following the end of the 'Cheyenne' series he looks as good as ever but it's a mystery why he's in that seafaring get up though it makes as much sense in it's way as the rest of the film. Even Anne Francis makes an appearance as Scotty's Walker exwife giving further star power to this revolutionary tale.Others on this board have mentioned that train crash scene with some enthusiasm so I'm not sure if the print I viewed was edited in some way. It appeared to me that once the locomotives made contact with each other the action froze and then we see the aftermath. Why not just show the whole wreck take place unless it was to save those great antiques for real.Best line of the film  He don't need a doctor he needs a change of underwear as a doctor removes a lizard from Pancho's shirt while he appears to be dying from some sort of convulsion.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I was avoiding this film for a while seeing as how I've heard that it was total crap but since I had gotten a gift card for FYE I picked up the box set Rawhide Season 1 and had a little credit left on the card so when I saw this DVD marked down to 2.99 well thats a price that I can stomach experimenting with little known films.Pancho Villa Dir by Eugenio Martin stars Telly Savalas as Pancho Villa Clint Walker as Scotty in the standard role of the gringo American gunrunner Chuck Connors as clean freak nut case Col. Wilcox Anne Francis who played Altaria in Forbidden Planet as Flo and it also has Dan Van Husen and a few of the regular list of SW bit part players.The version I picked up was released by Geneon its runtime is 92 minutes it has no chapter stops and no special features. When your expecting total crap your expectations are lower than whale sht so I was actually pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be very watchable. Its supposed to be either humorous or a lighthearted farce rather than a slapstick comedy but with the casting problems and limits of the script it comes out as neither. I guess we all got to remember that this was made post Trinity is Still My Name and the time for serious SW's and Zapatas Westerns had passed.Three things though really stand out and they are the quality of the transfer which was widescreen and excellent secondly the beautiful cinematography of Alejandro Ulloa which is one of the things that really impressed me when I first saw his work on Corbucci's Companero's his other work some of you will recognize from The Mercenary Sonny  Jed Cry Onion Providence and other great SWs and third is the almost star billing for the TRAINS! This film is a trainlovers delight this is one Zapata Western that really emphasizes the trains there is some great railroad action footage including a beginning act that has a locomotive chase that for me anyway really compensates for the rest of the film who's biggest problem is the miscasting of Savalas as Villa. Savalas sucks basically is about the best you can say about his performance as Villa he effects no accent whatsoever but he is still his charming wiseguy persona and he does have some good scenes like when he's pretending to be a corpse where he doesn't have to talk which was not much of a stretch for him so you can suspend disbelief.Walker is his hulking self. I think the only memorable time I saw these two together was in The Dirty Dozen. In this film Walker runs around dressed like a sea captain with insignia cap and blue brass buttoned watchcoat a strange choice. Chuck Connors plays a misophobic US army Col. Wilcox but rather than be a strong villain he comes off as more of a nut job. Flo Anne Francis has some scenes with her wayward husband Scotty Walker which were supposed to be funny but don't quite work mostly because Walker doesn't have much range as an actor.The town sets and the border custom stationarmy post look fine you will recognize La Calahorra station Colmenar Viejo  Guadix.This film is unique from other Zapatas in that it covers Villas attack on Columbus New Mexico in 1917 long after his glory days were past and that it emphasized his use of railroads with his Army of The North. It does have a spectacular set piece real head on collision with two steam locomotives similar to DYS but without the dynamite its cool to see real trainwrecks. Nowadays it would all be computer generated effects The score is mostly mariachi music and fits the film well but it does have Telly sing the ending credit tune which is a hoot on par with LVC's turn in Captian Apache.Any way this worth getting for 10 or lower.".

Wilcox Anne Francis who played Altaria in Forbidden Planet as Flo and it also has Dan Van Husen and a few of the regular list of SW bit part players.The version I picked up was released by Geneon its runtime is 92 minutes it has no chapter stops and no special features.

Unfortunately this isn't one of them. There is essentially no plot here. It seems that the movie's sole function was to cash in on the rising popularity for Telly Savalas at the time. Naturally with very little to work with he simply chews up the scenery. I'll be the first to admit that Telly was one of the coolest and charismatic actors ever to make his presence on the screen. I'll even go as far as to call him an icon of the seventies. Still there is really no excuse for this garbage. The actors seem to know what they got themselves wrapped into as evidenced by their ridiculous performances. The scene with Chuck Connors and the fly buzzing around him has got to go down as cinema's most appallingly bad and incompetent sequence. One simply has to see it to believe it! If you treated the whole movie as one long bad joke then you might feel a little better at the end of the film. You may even come away with a grin. Just don't expect much from this movie. On the plus side I truly enjoyed the last sequence with Savalas on the caboose of the train fading out of the screen with the soundtrack in the background of Telly belting out the theme song. Truly astonishing! For me it negated the pain and suffering I had endured through the length of the movie. For others it may not be enough.".

The spaghetti and revisionist strands had pushed the format to its extremes meaning that not much new territory was pursued. Pancho Villa was neither spaghetti nor a revisionist it was a Spanish western which decided that the best foot forward was to play things for laughs. It traded largely on its star actor Telly Savalas who was a massive TV star at the time as a result of Kojack.The result is a silly and often tedious biopic about the Mexican revolutionary of the title and is specifically about his miniinvasion of the U.S.A. in 1916. I don't know the real story but it's quite obvious that this is a loose retelling at best. There is a lot of very stupid humour here including ludicrous separate scenes involving a fly and a lizard. The humour really isn't very good so these scenes just come across as misguided. To ramp up the campy nature further the army officer who is Pancho Villa's adversary is played by Chuck Connors in a quite deranged fashion. Despite a promising opening half things get bogged down when the Mexicans enter America and things do drag quite a bit thereafter. It is a somewhat strange movie so is possibly worth watching for that reason if you are inclined enough. It ends with Savalas crooning a song over the end credits.".

Villa is not really a historical figure who I'm overly familiar with so I won't say much about the historical details of the film. As a movie this isn't great although it has a smattering here and there of both action and humour. Chuck Connors' performance as Colonel Wilcox commander of the U.S. Army base near Columbus struck me as a bit over the top and Clint Walker as Villa's Gringo sidekick Scotty didn't really do very much for me. The movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality. For a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half I have to say that this movie dragged in places particularly in the last 20 minutes or so. Villa's raid into the United States was an interesting if in the overall scheme of things not especially important historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this. 410".

Now in 1972 Savalas offers us a very special Pancho Villa. I thought I will see a stupid western spaghetti usually they are very bad but no I had the surprise to see a good decent film. It's not Sergio Leone's genius but it's pretty welldone. With Sergio Leone has in common only the fact that it was filmed in Spain as well as the dollars series. Of course the best ingredient is Telly Savalas without him the movie would be hard to watch. The other actors are OK but only at the functional level nothing out of the ordinary nothing brilliant. I am referring especially to Clint Walker and Chuck Connors. Anne Francis is much better in the role of Flo. Does anyone know that Savalas was besides a brilliant and unique actor a very good singer with a warm voice and a few hits under his belt? He plays a song at the end of this movie too. Telly Savalas did another role in the same year 1972 Capt. Kazan in Horror Express directed by the same Gene Martin real name Eugenio Martn. Eugenio Martn who directed before some other Westerns Bad Man's River1971 with Lee Van Cleef Requiem for a Gringo1968 The Ugly Ones1966. 7 stars for the charm of Savalas and the accurate direction of Martin.".

	schema:headline " Farcical Western starring Telly Savalas Clint Walker Anne Francis  Chuck Connors";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1972 and directed by Eugenio Martn Pancho Villa is a Western farce starring Telly Savalas as the eponymous Mexican revolutionary general who decides to invade America with his raid on Columbus New Mexico a town three miles from the border on March 9 1916. Clint Walker plays his righthand man Scotty with Anne Francis as the latter's wife in a troubled marriage. Chuck Connors plays the US Army officer assigned to repelling the raid. In real life Pancho was commander of the northern division of the Constitutional Army and governor of the northern state of Chihuahua Mexico. He was in line for leadership of Mexico and thus had the sympathy of the US Feds who ultimately forsook Villa in favor of his rival Carranza who defeated Villa in two major Mexican battles in 1915. Embittered Pancho took his wrath out on America with his raid on Columbus which was a slap in the face to the USA resulting in the death of 8 American soldiers and 10 civilians. Woodrow Wilson retaliated by sending General Pershing and a punitive expedition into Mexico to apprehend Villa. They went pretty deep south of the border capturing and killing several of Villa's lieutenants but failed to capture the famous revolutionary himself. The Perishing expedition ended due to Mexican protests and the US entering into WWI. Villa died seven years later when assassins ambushed his car in Parral Chihuahua.The movie focuses on the Battle of Columbus and is an odd mixture of serious dramaviolence and utterly goofy comedy like the ridiculous killthefly sequence which I guess was to make fun of Connor's moremilitarythanthou character. Due to the farcical elements it's hard to take the radical violence seriously. Is it funny to see Mexican citizens shockingly shot on the spot at Villa's whim? Is it funny to see American soldiers  civilians slain during the raid on Columbus? For me this absurdly incongruous tone ruins the movie. Despite my cavils Pancho Villa is somewhat entertaining as a whatweretheythinking early 70's curiosity not to mention Savalas  Walker are amusing as the protagonists and Connors as the often silly antagonist. As for Anne she was still stunning. For anyone who's interested Savalas sings the credits' song. Obviously this movie shouldn't be taken too seriously but it IS somewhat amusing highlighted by a great train collision at the climax not to mention the movie DOES inspire you to research the reallife events. A joint EnglishSpanishAmerican production the film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Spain. GRADE Borderline CC 4.510 Stars".

First up is an elongated black and white version of the scene that you can find on the net for free Paris looking like a doe trapped in the headlights and all. The elongated part of said scene is endless minutes of Rick stroking his manhood. i did NOT need to see that and Paris leaving ped off because her breasts looked vieny in nightvision. The second scene isn't a sex scene at all just Paris and Rick arguing. The third scene is Rick and Paris going at it again this time in color and Paris seems to enjoy herself quite a bit more. Which leads us into the last scene which is handsdown the best one no mean feat here It revolves around Ms. Hilton giving what looks to be a pretty damn good BJ. Rick narrates between the 4 scenes only to prove he's a cocky lil' punk. Also on the DVD is scenes from 4 additional titles from the company. The second disk of this 2DVD set is just a collection of various trailers. Unless you just HAVE to see everything Paris Hilton this is only good enough for a rent and that's stretching it.My Grade D".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm surprised that none of the earlier reviewers commented on the element of sadness in this video. We see a girl craving for a little tenderness and getting precious little of it from a guy who was obviously thinking about just one thing the hundreds of thousands of dollars that he has undoubtedly already made off this video.The video consists of the following parts  Paris holding the camera and filming her own gorgeous chest and face. Is she relishing in her beauty? Or is she feeling uncertain? What audience does she have in mind? Just Rick? Just herself? Pure speculation Is she under any kind of influence? As some point she squeezes her upper arms together pushing her breasts together. Does she feel her breasts are too small? My opinion your breasts are just perfect as they are! I don't think I've ever seen more beautiful breasts.An infrared scene. The TV is on at the start and at the end. Some kind of comedy or gangster movie with strong language. Rick stroking his considerablelength manhood. Paris is behind the camera. She's laughing. Either she thinks the scene is ridiculous or she feels nervous or she's laughing at Rick for being so proud of his manhood.Now she turns the camera onto herself as she lies down on her back. Her breasts look veiny but I think that's sexy because it means they're real and not made of silicon! It's not like the veins are sticking out or anything.Penetration. Rick admonishes Paris to remove her hand so the camera can capture the penetration. Rick cares a great deal about the quality of the film! Paris fondles her clitoris during the intercourse. I'm completely in the unknown about this kind of thing but can I infer from this that she is less excited about Rick than she could be? During the act she looks sweetly into the camera a number of times. Is she trying to please Rick this way?  The third part is a repeat of the first.A short shot of Paris holding the camera filming herself while in a plane.Paris filming herself stepping out of a car filming her gorgeous bikiniclad chest.Now perhaps the most interesting scene from a psychological point of view the bathroom scene where Rick clad in a bathrobe films Paris wearing lingerie panties and bra. Rick is being quite brazen calling Paris a beautiful beast asking her to take off her panties. Paris is not happy with being treated as merely an object of lust. She tells Rick she wants to hear him say he loves her. I don't think he loves her at all. I think that if anything he loathes her. However she's so desperate for tenderness that she will go far in trying to please him. This is quite a touching scene as Rick coldly humiliates Paris dollar signs in his eyes you can see the hurt in her eyes.At some point he says Let me see the pussy. I'm your best friend. He's giggling throughout realizing just how low he's sinking giggling away his shame. He's ruthlessly manipulating her loneliness. I sincerely hope this guy was not her best friend at that point.Then there's a scene where they're having intercourse. She's saying Oww repeatedly. Is this because she is not sufficiently excited? Is she going along just to please Rick? She says I love you repeatedly but he doesn't reply.In the final scene she performs a fellatio on him trying at least to get something back from him.My heart goes out to Paris Hilton. I wish her courage and strength. I advise her to try and get out of the spotlights for a while and do something that could get her in touch with normal people.".

The people don't touch at all besides their genital parts. I suppose this must have been a terribly boring and consequently unsatisfying experience for the woman. This movie is a guide of how to BORE A WOMAN COMPLETELY. This guy is COMPLETELY CLUELESS of how to have sex and it makes me laugh that such a guy actually got to make out with her. All the time he's trying to act like a macho and is concentrated only on himself. He doesn't even listen when the woman tells him that it hurts her. What a catastrophe! This is terrible. You should NEVER behave this way. Just watch her trying to get close to him grab his hand or kiss him. She is trying to do that while the guy just ignores it and continues the senseless pumping. I just can't watch it. Sex should be fun FOR BOTH. Sex should be based on a connection. Sex should be sensual. Just imagine the difference between pumping with nothing else and having a sensual act involving all senses  touching each other smelling being close to each other while having sex so that people touch each other with different parts of their bodies. Just imagine it. She would know how to do it but the guy doesn't listen to her. This only made me realize that if such a horribleinbed guy can be that cocky and selfconfident winning all the women then this gives me the confidence to be even more cocky  because now after watching this movie I know my true value..Watch it and learn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably more famous and hyped than the Pamela AndersonTommy Lee stolen honeymoon sex tape here it is the notorious Paris Hilton sextape.When you have no talent at anything and you're a bored rich young famous girl and you're desperate for attention and fame what do you do? You make a porn video. At least that's what Paris Hilton and her then boyfriend Rick Salomon did.Although not as 'hot' shocking and much talked about when it first hit the web 1 Night in Paris still remains an unique and amazing piece of work. Not in terms of quality of course but more because of the fact that it's the 'private' tape of a well known public figure Paris Hilton. It makes you wonder what everyone involved was thinking. I mean after all these persons have parents and expectingly still a sense of dignity. But fact is that this movie has done no bad for Paris' career. She's more in the news than ever before and even got some acting jobs and a signing career after this. Would she still have gotten all these jobs if the tape never existed? I don't think anyone can answer that but it most definitely at least helped her 'career' and definitely satisfied her lust for mediaattention...for the moment at least. Makes you wonder what she will come up next when her acting and signing career dryup.As for the movie itself it's sort of funny to see how Paris has more eye for the camera than for her bedpartner. Poor Rick Salmon. Paris has more the hots for the camera than for him but that is no surprise really. If you want to watch this movie pure for its adult elements you're definitely better of watching other adult amateurmovies. The movie and the sex in it really isn't of very high quality. No real passion or spectacular love making here.It's hard to rate a thing like this since it isn't really a movie or documentary somehow this movie is credited as one over here. or whatever else. It also isn't of very high quality in terms of both camerawork and lighting and stuff as well as the adult elements. It however is a well known and hyped piece of work since it features a well known person in it. I therefor rate this a 'safe' 6. This movie will probably go down in history and will be remembered and talked about for years to come.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Probably more famous and hyped than the Pamela AndersonTommy Lee stolen honeymoon sex tape here it is the notorious Paris Hilton sextape.When you have no talent at anything and you're a bored rich young famous girl and you're desperate for attention and fame what do you do? You make a porn video. At least that's what Paris Hilton and her then boyfriend Rick Salomon did.Although not as 'hot' shocking and much talked about when it first hit the web 1 Night in Paris still remains an unique and amazing piece of work. Not in terms of quality of course but more because of the fact that it's the 'private' tape of a well known public figure Paris Hilton. It makes you wonder what everyone involved was thinking. I mean after all these persons have parents and expectingly still a sense of dignity. But fact is that this movie has done no bad for Paris' career. She's more in the news than ever before and even got some acting jobs and a signing career after this. Would she still have gotten all these jobs if the tape never existed? I don't think anyone can answer that but it most definitely at least helped her 'career' and definitely satisfied her lust for mediaattention...for the moment at least. Makes you wonder what she will come up next when her acting and signing career dryup.As for the movie itself it's sort of funny to see how Paris has more eye for the camera than for her bedpartner.

But she might as well have been 9 instead of 19.Her lover Rick and Paris or Paree as he calls her act throughout like two kids playing Doctor in a sandbox. They coyly enact the universal ritual in which the horny male pursues the shy female. You like that  don't you? asks Rick. Ewwww no! squeals Paree.Behind the role enactment neither is particularly shy or modest. The film opens with Paree filming a close up of her own respectable breasts. Someone had said her breasts had veins and she wanted it on record that they were veinless. Showing Paree rolling around nekkid on the hotel bed Rick asks Do I have the hottest bitch in town or what? The male keeps growling playfully about sex. The female responds by talking about love as if she knew what it meant. In the end sex and love diffuse into one another and everything else melts together in a fluid resolution of any oppositions expressed earlier.I'd never seen Paris Hilton before and had only heard of her through brief references on TV news and photos in news magazines. I missed out therefore on the bonus points that come from the titillation of seeing a celebrity exposed. If you haven't seen the soap operas in which she's appeared or any of the movies she's made she's just another stranger in a skin flick.And how IS the skin flick? Not too bad as cinema verite. It's like watching Andy Warhol's Blue Movie in which two kids joke around and have sex on screen. Unfortunately this one has about a third of its footage filmed through what seems to be some kind of the military night scope that turns everything a different shade of green. It's hard to make out what's going on. In addition when a participant looks up at the camera his or her tapidums gleam like electric arcs. The phrase that comes to mind is a deer caught in the headlights except that these two are anything but frozen in tonic immobility.The  uh  the most important part of the film is shot clearly thank heavens. Women may be able to fake it but men can't. On the whole it's worth watching even aside from the raw sex. I just love to see the young folks enjoy themselves frisking around capering winking at the camera.".

Awardwinning director Ondi Timoner DIG! documented his tumultuous life for more than a decade to create a riveting cautionary tale of what to expect as the virtual world inevitably takes control of our lives. Josh Harris often called the Warhol of the Web through the infamous dot.com boom of the 1990's founded Pseudo.com the first Internet television network and created his vision of the future an underground bunker in NYC where 100 people lived together on camera for 30 days over the millennium. He proved how in the notsodistant future of life online we will willingly trade our privacy for the connection and recognition we all deeply desire. Through his experiments including a sixmonth stint living under 24hour live surveillance online ...";

	schema:headline " A Fascinating Film about a Peculiar Internet Pioneer";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was shown at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin TX after winning the grand jury prize at Sundance. It was well received in Austin as well. It is a fascinating look at the early days of the Internet through the biography of one its pioneers Josh Harris. The film is welldone in a technical sense and fascinating ride but I'm not sure if it ever figures out if it's a history of an industry a study of the social impact of Internet or a biopic about the peculiar mad scientist John Harris. It tries to be all of these things and thus perhaps undermines its own ability to completely succeed at any of them.The film is informative in filling in some of the early history and Harris's key role with the mostly forgotten 1990s pioneering ventures of Jupiter Communications and Pseudo.com. But Harris seems to move away from his role as a computer nerd and begins to evolve into a dysfunctional performance artist who seems to want to demonstrate that the Internet will break down all remnants of human privacy. The film maker seems to want emphasize his visionary qualities in which he is predictive of today's MySpace and Facebook culture. However this reviewer doesn't find his bunker experiment or his living in public online to be particularly insightful or predictive. The whole concept was moreorless foreshadowed in Jim Carrey's Truman Show in the 1990s. Nor is it particularly predictive. Harris was creating venues in which people were forced to live in public in front of cameras with predictably unhealthy and destructive results. Today we choose voluntarily how much of our lives to allow the public  and really only our chosen friends  to view online. The difference between everyone's lives being on display and allowing our friends to see limited glimpses of our lives is vast. Harris seems like a tragic and selfdestructive figure who is constantly rewriting his own experiences in his own mind. He is estranged from his family and unable to establish and maintain intimate relationships. In the end he seems to have stranded himself on his own Gilligan's Island with which he is obsessed. He is either a clown another one of his characters or simply a reclusive madman. The film provides an intriguing picture of an internet pioneer who went off the deep end but I'm not sure if it achieves its goal of truly using Josh's experiences to critique the virtual world that he played a key early role in helping construct. The virtual world for all its flaws is not the world of total public voyeurism that Josh imagined it would become.".

Instead he seems to have specialised in freak shows that might have accurately predicted some unwelcome aspects of the future and whose funding has depended on the the false confidence they might prove lucrative. The fact that Harris has himself retreated from the world of the web is telling as is the fact that the chief executive of myspace claims never to have heard of him. Far from being the visionary as his friends attest Harris comes over simply as the boy with too many toys. The documentary is lively however and oddly entertaining even though one quickly comes to dislike and distrust the filmmaker a certified Harris groupie and participants alike.".

Reeltoreel tapes cassette tapes and its boom boxes and filmstrips Kodachrome the Polaroid camera and the traditional video projector were also popular then.Realizing the Internet's major effect on computers Josh began to take advantage in the Big Apple founding Jupiter Communications and later on a hipsterfriendly Internet TV company called Pseudo which was welladored with New York's hip crowd. However his overt display of his alterego Luvvy eventually caused the company's downfall after 1015 years of its run.Not giving up easily with that debacle Josh found an abandoned tenement loft in New York and launched his most radical project ever called The Quiet Bunker. As the partyers enter in the first minutes inside the compound they are almost like cattle...milling around the beds the firearm range the bar area and are searching the bunk beds to find the perfect bed for them.As more partyers enter there is a type of noise level resembling the 4th of July. More people are in the firearm range shooting guns and some residents are starting to become scared of the bangs. But some others start to be impervious to the gunfire and are using antifear techniques like freelove and friendship with all of the mates inside this unusual hangout.As the millennium approaches the fake cops and security guards start to become a bit more belligerent violent and sadistic. The music grows louder and the bar starts to serve more alcohol than cocktails.Meanwhile half the participants are scared of those video surveillance cameras and those who got out of the interrogation room are afraid of their emotions and afraid that they could be sent to that dreaded room again.More gunfire explodes as the whole bunker scene turns into the most climatic scene of anarchy. People start to pillage the place with brute force tear down papers and make messes on the floor with juices and beer there is even more explicit sex and even more screaming explodes into wildfire. Then finally the NYPD comes in and tells them that the partyis over!!! The partyers were escorted from the compound 68 hours after the millennium struck citing several things a very dangerous cult getting out of hand forced confinement without giving the partyers additional food and water and Josh allowing the partyers to resort to criminal mischief and a litany of disorderly lewd and dangerous acts which included mob action and of course the firing of guns and not having a general permit to hold such a party.Then Josh Harris found three other partyers hiding from the police after the partyers were ordered vacated. He then gives the heaveho signal to themhe simply wants to emotionally suffer the bunker's end in private!With his bunker project flatlined Josh had decided to hold the After the vacating of the bunker party with 2530 of his bunker party participants on a boat on a New York river. He went to one of his love interests Tanya Corrin who appeared as the host of Cherry Bomb and proposed a strong relationship. As she said yes Josh Harris started his new project that came out of the defunct Quiet experiment.He and Tanya decided to retrofit their condo with 50 to 60 surveillance cameras paying homage to the movie concept from Enemy of the State. Josh's and Tanya's project of having their entire relationship on cameras was extremely shocking. I see their private talks bathroom conversations sex in the bedroom and even domestic violence!! Then as the crash of April 2000 wipes out over half of Josh's financial assets they separate from reality causing Tanya to say that this romantic relationship is over.As Tanya leaves the cameraridden house Josh is left alone in the apartment to suffer for a long time not only the loss of Tanya but also the pain of nearly being homeless. Finally he had enough and he himself leaves the house for good leaving the cameras behind.After temporarily owning an apple farm away from NY Josh goes back to Manhattan to contact MySpace company for his pitch...he was telling that company about his strong techsavvy accomplishments in the 1980s decade of the computer world to try to make his own Internet company...Josh's. Regrettably MySpace said no citing Josh's strange behavior that was revealed when PseudoTV was on the air. Josh ended up even more worthless.With the Luvvy ego completely destroyed in his life and Josh on the ropes to severe penury he resorted to a Marcus Garvey tactic moving into exile.His exile was under raps for awhile until Josh Harris was spotted in another countryAfrica. Josh said his newly ascetic behavior cleansed him from all of the toxic cravings that ruined his business his love interest and his sanity and he declares that he had seen the effects of the exponential growth of the Internet in the form of social networks like Facebook Linkedin and MySpace where any person joining such networks regrettably have to give up privacy in return for trying to create their own fame.".

	schema:headline " A little intriguing but mostly depressing and way too dark";
	schema:reviewBody "You can find a documentary about nearly everything. That certainly doesn't mean a documentary is necessary regardless of how interesting the person place or thing might seem to be. We Live In Public is a documentary about Josh Harris seemingly a pioneer in the field of internet. According to the film it would have us believe that Josh Harris foresaw things on the internet that all came to fruition things such as streaming video and internet television. The problem with the film is that Josh Harris is someone who stumbled a lot on his road to creation on the internet and the film is more depressing and disturbing then anything. His cutting edge visionary reality show was to have over 100 people move into a small building where they would be watched on the internet every second of every day. Eventually his project is shut down as being a millennial cult so he turns to turning his own life into a reality show in his apartment with his girlfriend and their relationship crumbles into shards. Its almost difficult to watch this 'mad genius' who has these brilliant ideas continually sink his fortunes into projects that go belly up.Director Ondi Timoner certainly has a lot of experience in film making. I have not seen any of her other work but I have no doubt that she looks for something captivating and interesting and the film is put together in a very interesting manner. In some ways you won't even feel like you're watching a documentary because there is a lot of captivating information. Where the film stumbles is that this could have made in a half hour biography and many of the projects he takes on just go down in flames and it isn't exactly fun to watch at times. If you like documentaries but you're tired of the same old thing then you might really enjoy We Live In Public because it is certainly a stretch from other films in the same genre. But the tone of the film is just far too dark and depressing and leaves you feeling unfulfilled. 6.510".

In some ways you won't even feel like you're watching a documentary because there is a lot of captivating information. Where the film stumbles is that this could have made in a half hour biography and many of the projects he takes on just go down in flames and it isn't exactly fun to watch at times. If you like documentaries but you're tired of the same old thing then you might really enjoy We Live In Public because it is certainly a stretch from other films in the same genre. But the tone of the film is just far too dark and depressing and leaves you feeling unfulfilled. 6.510";

However the premise of the film is that Josh Harris is a genius because he was able to develop internet social networking years before anyone else and I find this to be a kind of false assumption. Granted he might have had the original idea but what good was the notion of a 'real time social networking system' if the internet had not evolved enough to support this activity. The bandwidth simply was not there! Many ideas are marvelous in the abstract but if these concepts cannot be brought to fruition what good are they? A true genius not only develops the concept but must make it work in the real world. Timing has to account for something and I think that this was Mr. Harris's Achilles Heel. WE LIVE IN PUBLIC is a great look at an era in the development of the Computer Age and certainly documents Josh Harris's many accomplishments. but the film fails to make the case that this man is as much a pioneer as he would have us believe. The reason that he is not in the same league as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs is that they successfully accomplished 'real things' whereas Mr. Harris came up with a major idea which was not really supportable at the time.".

Any man who sees this movie will go into his own mind and search for his own holy friendships if these two words actually exist as plural. Looking back on his 50 years of friendship between the characters Momon and Serge Momon actually finds out whether his philosophic ideal of a holy male friendship actually exists or if it doesn't.

Then all at once it blossomed before our eyes and took its rightful place in the Marchal pantheon. This was due in no small measure to Gerard Lanvin who I have yet to see give a bad performance. Lanvin is almost unique among 'macho' actors in that he can convey sadness and toughness at one and the same time. Here he plays a real person one still very much alive and he does so superbly. Recently acting joke Vincent Cassell was called upon to portray a real character  also a gangster  and was light years short of Lanvin's performance here which is incandescent. If I single out Lanvin it is because he is the only member of the cast who stands an outside chance of being known in the UK  he also does comedy see Camping  but Marchal has cast his film well and the entire cast acquit themselves well. See it as soon as you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only possible answer to the question raised in this user comment's subject line is simple and straightforward namely nowhere near as badass as grandpa Edmon 'Momon' Vidal in Les Lyonnais! Or any of his fellow gang buddies for that matter! Les Lyonnais is inspired by the true story and memoirs of Momon Vidal the poor son of gypsy parents who built himself up to the leader of a feared gang that committed numerous of violent armed robberies in the Lyon region during the sixties and early seventies. However all the crimes and trials of that era are narrated and illustrated through flashbacks as the film primarily takes place in 2010 and opens at the baptism party of Momon's grandson. For the past 25 years he has lived a luxurious and relatively honest life but now his oldest and dearest friend Serge is in trouble. Serge is apprehended by the police but prison is full of henchmen of the crime boss that he doublecrossed. Since friendship is the most important value to Momon he organizes a plan to help Serge even though he very well realizes this will bring him right back to his old criminal habits. Given the nature of the plot protagonist characters and a handful of significant sequences like for example the baptism Les Lyonnais is inevitably reminiscent to The Godfather and  like many other reviews so unmistakably state clear  not as good. Yeah well so what? Hardly any movie is as good as The Godfather but that doesn't stand in the way of Les Lyonnais being an extremely intense and absorbing thriller with many brutal sequences tight atmosphere and stellar performances. The main trumps of the film apart from the charismatic ensemble cast are the realistic brotherhood portrayals and the swift transitions between the gang's activities in the '60s and present day. During the flashbacks being a criminal and kick starting violent gang wars is glorified quite blatantly but the script also clearly criticizes the contemporary French juridical system. Momon and Serge initially just were two harmless young troublemakers but they rolled into the criminal life after they were sentenced to six months in prison for stealing a handful of cherries which aptly also is the title of Edmond Vidal's memories. The flashbacks are the most entertaining parts of the film since they seem to come straight out those primarily Italian  French eurocrimePoliziotteschi movies from the seventies which happens to be my favorite cult cinema sub genre. You know exhilarating chases in crummy old cars characters with gigantic mustaches harsh driveby shootings and relentless executions in the middle of crowded streets! The scenes set in the present day are much more sophisticated and dramatic but they are still fastpaced and loaded with suspense. Grard Lanvin gives away a downright phenomenal performance as Vidal and he's brilliantly backed up by Tchky Karyo and Daniel Duval.".

	schema:reviewBody "In less than two months Untouchable became the second most successful French film by number of spectators such an event by itself that people went then to see it not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it that's the virtual circle of success. My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with The Tree of Life a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally my greatest positive surprise came with Untouchable because it was the opposite expectation I was sure I would dislike it figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well when a young black guy from French suburbs darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots befriends a rich quadriplegic I immediately think of 'good feelings' 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film but any film. After all why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people from different ages and backgrounds liked it. So I saw it  and loved it.The story of Untouchable is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background Omar Sy as Driss only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a livein carer job. For some strange reason Paul the rich man played by a wonderful Franois Cluzet gives him the job with a onemonth trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script the film starts with all the job applicants every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then Driss casually enters without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door he's got enough problems to deal with unemployment an experience in jail being a pariah for society and undesirable even in his own family especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul because after his paragliding accident he can't feel his body from neck to toes and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either. And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship the two leads rapidly get fond of each other a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is which provides some priceless comedic moments but Untouchable goes immediately to the core an eyeopening message about the life endured by a handicapped person making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction the film explores the real needs of people in life respect and understanding acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors it would have been predictable but in Untouchable the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul well I won't spoil it for you but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment and that's the secret of the film it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances in Untouchable it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of I quote 'helper monkey'? Seriously this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos nor the opposite which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media whether they come from pot an earmassage or even paragliding. Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life but Paul doesn't care Omar is a man full of life big tall and strong and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title Untouchable referred to the lowest caste in India echoing the two men's conditions both outcasts physically and socially but I guess their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strongminded and together they become even stronger until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in Untouchable nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday his learning of the aristocratic world the art of abstract painting and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy with Cluzet as a perfect straightman not deprived from a sense of humor. Untouchable is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue. And yes it's one of the best French films ever and certainly one of the best of 2011.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't overstating the universality of the acclaim people of various races classes colors  countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations and I was floored. Intouchables directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions social class difference health and as nave as it may sound the universality of humanity. The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe played by Cluzet a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss played by Sy is in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic lighthearted and funny helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. Again it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man etc. The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life  love. It's approach is simple pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of best movie of the year. I cannot say more the film must be experienced. My friends tried they failed so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. PS  I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way The Departed did for Infernal Affairs.".

Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie The help to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51 got a dramatic paraglider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his lifeaid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title the second breath in French Le second souffl. The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning a former convict is capable progressively to change his views and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an openmindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09072013  I've just seen that under Crazy credits is mentioned that 5 of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.".

The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning a former convict is capable progressively to change his views and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an openmindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09072013  I've just seen that under Crazy credits is mentioned that 5 of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.";

Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flashforward it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man the other one is a young black poor unemployed coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears actually most of the film is the emotion you can feel through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy with very touching moments this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well paintings classical music and funk music. What is art? What is its use?".

To contrast him we have Franois Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits.

	schema:headline " A toast to the spirit of Living .. A must watch film for all";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic Phillipe and his black attendant Driss. At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived loud excessively melodramatic Gujarish which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's hands not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to remarry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest sweet touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache  Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. Franois Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. Intouchables celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe.

	onyx:emotionText "This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic Phillipe and his black attendant Driss. At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived loud excessively melodramatic Gujarish which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's hands not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to remarry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest sweet touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache  Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. Franois Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. Intouchables celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe. P.S  This year a great tragedy happened in my life for which I was mentally down. But this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend. I really want to thanks the director duo for making this film";

I loved Nakache  Toledano previous movies for me they represent what French cinema does the best these kinds of comedies that always put you on the verge of tears while laughing at jokes that feel so real. With Intouchables they put that characteristic even further the movie is FULL of jokes and it also treat one of the most serious subject. Franois Cluzet is at the top of his art the best French actor of his generation for sure. Omar Sy delivers a spot on performance I particularly enjoyed his melancholic look you can just see the emotions in his eyes. Their onscreen friendship is probably one of the best I have seen and we can summarize it with these words from the movie These guys they have no pity a friend of Philippetalking about Driss to which Philippe answers You know sometimes he hands me the phone because he forgot. Driss forget that Philippe can't move his legs his arms can't feel anything that is under is neck and this is priceless for Philippe. In a world where everybody looks at him like an handicapped Driss' behavior is more that a fresh air it's a reason to live for to think that maybe there are others people like him that can see further that his wheelchair. The music is also spot on just enough to make you feel the emotion without being too much. I really hope it's going to win lots of Csars. It's really going to be a tie this year for the best actor performance between Omar Sy Franois Cluzet and Jean Dujardin The Artist. I predict an American remake in a few years you know Hollywood...".

	schema:headline " Raw not politically correct but as passionate as they come";
	schema:reviewBody "The entire premise of the accidentally positioned relationship of the sailor with the rich and spoiled woman is entirely contrived and like a very well oiled opera it spins in surprising circles taking us to places we did not anticipate when we first meet the characters.Where it could have fallen into a parody or in its simplest form a Marxist diatribe the director raises the form into metaphor and both shocks and surprises us along the way. I can imagine that when this film first came out in 1974 the public must have gasped at several things there are several moments in the film when the sailor just explodes in a rageful outpouring of physical abuse to the lovely lady. In short he beats her about the face and wrestles with her until she is quite roughed up. The repeated slapping is still hard to watch even if you think in your mind that these are well trained actors. The overt machismo that the sailor humiliates the lady with is both laughable and grotesque by our standards. Sure the film is making fun of Italian men and especially at the expense of the socalled coarser Southern Italian men and even more the Sicilian men....but it is so overdone that it too rises to metaphor. He struts about like a liberated tyrant caveman looking for every opportunity to enjoy sweet revenge over his hapless companion. What does he achieve? He certainly does break her down and destroys every vestige of her snobby boorish disrespectful artificial outer self and when pealed away what emerges is her long suppressed tender and humbled self. Listen some people usually men go and seek some lunatic guru up in the mountains to help them attain this type of simplicity and humility so the idea in itself is not far fetched. The difference is that this lady did not choose her fate on the island did not go seeking humility it was the only way to survive and in a way here lies an important aspect of Wertmuller's film. Is she asking us what control do we have when forces much greater than us poverty in particular as exemplified by the sailor and his laments push us to limits of endurance? What type of people do we become? Wertmuller is also asking us the rich have so many more choices including cultivating their own sense of place and humility in the world and that they do not cannot be attributed to the same stresses that tear apart the poor. I'm simplifying but this seems to be one of the underlying themes.Other themes the sailor takes advantage of a situation that presents itself in his life for the first time. Sure he's been working hard all his life and he's still the lackey cleaning up the crap of the rich. And he's totally unappreciated by his family. Now he can work just as hard but call ALL of the shots including sexual domination and physical appreciation. He certainly did not set out to win over the lovely lady but after seeing how dependent she was and how unaware of her own self sufficiency he saw an opportunity to dominate and over a woman! The temptation was too great to let alone. She is everything he has fantasized about without admitting it and he taunts her with the very same thoughts.And then let's look at passion and love. Where the chemical attraction ends and by the last third of the film there is plenty of that there appears to be true and passionate love. At this point I started to feel completely caught up in their torrid affair and the tenderness the sailor finally gives to her just melts your heart. Underneath all that caveman behavior is a very soft hearted and loving man who never had an outlet for his feelings. Sure he acts like a child demanding love only on his terms but that's not the point. They are both childish in their own ways. What the film leaves in your mind...how is it that such diametrically opposed and different people can scratch and crawl their way into passionate and REAL love? And while the film leaves you believing in the truth of their passions it evaporates at the end leaving me at least very upset at the outcome. Of course Wurtmuller could have opted for the happy ending and then what? In a sense it would have become just too ridiculous becoming a lampoon of what was uncovered between them. In life these types of illicit affairs are very often ephemeral and while short lived very hot. And then they disappear into thin air. Do we seek the romantic ending we wished the film to have taken or do we accept the bitterness of the sailor cursing much more than the rich lady his fate yet again returning as bitter as ever he returning to be a smelly lout of a husband dragging behind his wife as she barely endures his presence.Giannini gives a towering performance which although teeters on comic self parody he inhabits his role and lets his inner self evolve as the moment changes. Never over acting even when in a full rage showing gentleness and hot passion in perfect balance he is awesome as the rough edged sailor going nowhere in life. Mariangela Melato is simply gorgeous and sexy and has the time of her life with this role. The two of them took risks as actors but the sparks all seemed so real. You just don't see movies made like this today because we live in politically correct times. Films like this and Linsday Anderson's IF would either shock us or else would have been ignored as too artsy. I loved this film and the way it moved my heart.".

	schema:headline " Keeps reinventing itself highly recommended";
	schema:reviewBody "A film that's exceedingly difficult to pin down. It would be easy to dismiss it but it's just as easy to be startled and amazed by it. The story's simple enough a shaggy darkskinned man played by Giancarlo Gianni works under the thumb of the bourgoisie on a hired yacht. He despises them and they despise him. One of these rich people is particularly annoying a blonde woman Mariangelo Melato who spends her days incessantly bitching spouting capitalist slogans and putting down the servant class. These two characters not surprisingly end up together on a dinghy whose motor has broken. She never shuts up he stares at her murderously. They eventually land on a deserted island where he refuses to help her whatsoever. She eventually has to submit to whatever abuses he chooses to dish out. Yes that does include physical and eventually a nearrape which will certainly disgust and upset a lot of the film's audience. The film can actually be sort of perverse. I'm sure many have marvelled that with some of the film's crueller scenes the film was directed by a woman. It is actually in its way nearly as perverse at some times as The Night Porter directed in the very same year in Italy also by a woman. That film's merits are more dubious than Swept Away's however. The film is unexpectedly hilarious at least for the first fortyfive minutes or so. When the abuse starts the film begins to shift to a social issues picture. Class issues are important as well as racial issues which kind of amount to the same thing. I didn't mind seeing the woman verbally abused  she spent the first fortyfive minutes doing the same to the guy. The smackings she receives were hard for even me to take however. The politics are nevertheless exceedingly interesting. The film has some very good material on the social constructions of class. After this section of the film the story shifts to erotica and it is very erotic at times. In this section the film is a direct descendent of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris as was The Night Porter incidentally. After that the film shifts once again to romantic melodrama as the two are rescued. The man makes the decision to signal a yacht that he sees in the distance simply because he wants to test the deep love that the woman swears by. These shifts in narrative can be clearly felt like upshifting in a manual transmission vehicle but it works rather well. I was always right with the film with its emotions although it took me a good twenty minutes to get into the film. I ended up rather loving it despite its flaws. Now I actually want to see the Madonna version to see how bad that hack Guy Ritchie screwed it up. At one point in the film the man tells the woman that she looks like the Madonna. Pretty funny no? 910.".

The elements of composition music and lighting are used in such a beautiful way that the audience is convinced throughout the couple's stay on the island that love is possible despite the divisive odds against them and so their fall is that much more saddening at the end of the film.

Interesting romantic powerful hardtowatch political funny sad etc.  This movie has it all.  You can analyze this movie to death but it will do it a disservice.  Quite simply it's about a bizarre romance that happens when two people who are total opposites thus hating each other are stranded on a remote island and must learn how to live together.  By today's standards this is a very unP.C. movie  Male domination over a woman.  However it IS just a movie not real lifedon't let that put you off and there are some scenes that are hard to take but given the context of the characters you might think to yourselfis this deserved?  I think some parts are and othersnot at all.  You might like this film if you liked Pedro Almodovar's Atame! Tie Me Up Tie Me Down!. This is a film you'll end up discussing with others after you've seen it. Also I don't recommend viewing this around children or very impressionable teenagers.".

But it seemed to this viewer that the luscious sexineverypore Mariangela Melato was playing a super woman who always wins no matter what. She adapts. To whatever. And wins. She won her first world by totally dominating her rich husband and all his servants. It worked. It was never her plan. It just worked. And so she tries to dominate Gianinni when they are stranded. It doesn't work. His survival skills are necessary and his personality is not to be dominated at least not in the regular way. And so she surrenders to him. Not by plan. But still she surrenders completely and totally to him.  And his passion for the conquered goddess becomes so consuming that he is now the conquered the consumed.  She's not in control but she's in fact totally in control. Super woman has won.  Super woman understands that this paradise they have fallen into works only if they stay in this Eden.  The smitten fool realizes this too but must bite the forbidden apple to satisfy his fool's desire to see the truth in front of his eyes. Once out of Paradise super woman armed with new tools learned in her stay in Paradise begins a new conquest of her husband's world. She's super woman and she will win again not by intent but because she is who she is. The fool goes back to his fat wife and his foolish life and his foolish passions.  He lost. She won. She always wins all the time.Thank you Lena for this incredible film and this unfogettable film viewing experience.  You should know Lena that the lovely date I took to this film in NYC's Paris Cinema so long ago well she shook at the climax of the rape scene.  I think she actually had an orgasm right there.Let the film professionals dwell in the horrors of wars andConcentration Camps in Seven Beauties. Let them find their insights and meanings of the world in that. That's their world. This is Lena's masterpeice for the people. People living lives. Thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh damn all those pretentious artistic Italian film projects of twentyfive years ago! They possess a certain freedom of dialogue which was altogether lacking in American film then and still is undeniably lacking in even the bestwritten States projects.  Here is a very interesting little film from female director Lina Wertmueller...a film of clashing passions yes but also a very beautiful film with an ironic foothold on its material on one end and a dervishly melancholic view on the other.Simply put this film is about the hunger developed between two Italians of differing social castes. One is a bearded Communist with a serenly blue pair of eyes Giancarlo Giannini and the other is a spoiled slender blonde made rich through methods of capitalism Mariangelo Melato.  Of course at first they can't stand each other but as time goes by the Communist lies hold of the woman both figuratively and physically and practically forces himself upon her.The film reminded me of Jonathan Demme's equally overlooked Something Wild in the two vastly different tones of its sections which seamlessly fit together at the end.  The first half of the movie portrays life aboard a yacht as the capitalist woman and her husband sun bathe on deck while those who prescribe to socialist practices do the manual labor underneath.  This part of the film is as bright and witty as any I've seen not lacking the slightest inhibition at using such words as proletariat and commenting on the various evils of capitalism that would scare off many an American producer when faced with a similar project.However the dynamics of the story are soon set in place as man and woman are placed out at sea amidst the sparkling incandescence of the water as captured by Giulio Battiferri Guiseppe Fornari and Stefano Ricciotte's gorgeous cinematography.  Eventually they find themselves on a deserted island where the man turns the woman's capitalism against her by making her wash his underpants for food.  Later the man pushes the woman past her economic facade into a primal state of sexual ecstasy interspersed with the man's vicious slappings equating himself as the master over the woman. Such a film leads to its inevitable conclusion and one finds oneself exhausted at the allegorical nature of the situation.Although I don't look at Swept Away with any sort of agreement on its sympathetic view of the Communist proletariat I find its symbolic interpretations fascinating.  Indeed the movie gives capitalism the slinky seductive form of Woman and equates the marketplace as whorishness of the worst kind.  On the other hand the film portrays Communism as some sort of untamed beast irresistable in its muscular masculinity.  As the film ends one is reminded that two different perspectives can hardly live together but at one time they were able to coexist.  Of course those sympathetic to the Communist cause have less to worry about now then they did in 1975 when Swept Away was released but nevertheless it remains a mesmerizing find essaying the ideals of such a state of mind.".

Wertmueller's Swept away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August is so much better than that.During the early 1970s Lina Wertmueller went through what was arguably the most creative period in her career. She was writing and directing films like Love and Anarchy Seven Beauties and Swept away by a Mysterious in the Blue Sea of August. And what is so great about this latter film with such a long title? For one Swept Away is actually about something Marxism class struggle love on a deserted island and people rediscovering themselves and these themes are all dealt with in a novel and highly intelligent way. Swept Away has great actors like Giancarlo Giannini as the sexist and communist Italian sailor Gennarino Carunchio and Mariangela Melato as the snobbish Italian aristocrat Rafaella Lanzetti who are transformed into lovers by the crucible of class warfare while on a deserted island. The great thing about these two characters Gennarino and Rafaella is that they are not solely good or solely evil. They possess many bad and good traits and we discover over the course of the film that although they do horrible things to each other Gennarino is by far the worst we end up sympathizing with them on a human level in spite of ourselves.For these three reasons alone  the plot the actors and the character development  this film already has a home run. But in addition Swept Away is also a wonderfully musical film which breathes life into the gorgeous cinematography of the deserted island in particular and imbues each visual with meaning. A brilliant film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Don't try and analyze Lina Wertmller's 1975 Swept Away too deeply. You'll go nuts. Treat it as a strange little story a fable if you will. The story itself is straightforward. A gaggle of wealthy Italians have chartered a yacht for island hopping around the Mediterranean. One of them Rafaela is a boorish arrogant bitch always picking on the crew one Sicilian in particular. Her politics are right wing and that of the crew Communist. She is also beautiful and as you would expect there is much conflict. One fine day during an illadvised trip to search for sea caves she and the sailor find themselves lost and adrift after their dingy breaks down away from the yacht.

Now the tables turn and the sailor who knows how to survive has the upper hand over Rafaela who doesn't. He's physically and emotionally abusive crushing all Rafaela's selfrespect and forces her to be his loveslave and allround gofer. And guess what? She loves it.  I've said enough about the plot and certainly don't want to delve into what all this is supposed to mean.  What I will say is that the acting is superb and the direction and photography top notch. I recommend this movie but warn you not to be too analytical about it.".

The story itself is straightforward. A gaggle of wealthy Italians have chartered a yacht for island hopping around the Mediterranean. One of them Rafaela is a boorish arrogant bitch always picking on the crew one Sicilian in particular. Her politics are right wing and that of the crew Communist. She is also beautiful and as you would expect there is much conflict. One fine day during an illadvised trip to search for sea caves she and the sailor find themselves lost and adrift after their dingy breaks down away from the yacht. Finding a small but forested island they land but have to fend for themselves as its completely deserted. Now the tables turn and the sailor who knows how to survive has the upper hand over Rafaela who doesn't.

I saw a commercial for the new Madonna film and even before the commercial was done I knew it was a shoddy remake of that classic 1974 Italian film I loved so much. The original film really reminded me of Lord of the Flies But sexier! in the aspect that on the Island all the rules changed and they were in their own environment.

The huge eyes of the man as he listens to the bigoted arrogant arguments of the beautiful woman are amazing as you can see the tension and anger building. Turns out he is a devoted communist not a follower of the totalitarian government in Russia...so often confused with true communism but a devoted communist. One of those.We are about to go crazy with the stupid mindless arguing by these rich people on this gorgeous yacht when finally we are rescued by the imperious bikinigirl demanding that she be taken to the others to fish at 7 p.m. Of course we all know that they won't get there as the motor kicks out and they wander around in the middle of a gorgeous sea. No one seems to ever have to go to the bathroom unfortunately. Just as well. No they don't get thirsty either.But the acting especially the fury between them which resolves itself into hot flaming sex that she has to beg for is glorious!!!! It is definitely NOT what you would expect.Spoiler8 When finally united with his wife he asks tenderly about the kids. So you know he can't return to that magic island where all the love was white hot. That's not real. But when he takes the 100000 lire and buys a beautiful ring for the woman you know that he is showing todo el mundo that he is indeed a man buying her this 'divorcement' ring....already knowing she'll reject his invitation to return to the island.Great movie. Im glad I bought it and I WISH there was one of those discussions on it to give us some insight into the Italian government of the 70s. I was confused by the discussion of the Pope fascism and communism. Had I known the political climate of Italy at the time I might have understood this part better.".

Yes there's some teen comedic elements to this movie but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack great fight scenes acting was good story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books video games in your teens20's30's and don't have a young kid you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly geared at a older teenyoung adult audience and is rated R what did you expect. In closing one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but KickAss did exactly that I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns KickAss is a welcome addition to the realm of the comicbook movie.I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal but KickAss completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film or even a Tarantino script in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and KickAss was the end result.The story focuses on Dave Lizewski your average teenage nerd whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero KickAss despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.It is not long before other vigilantes surface some desperate for the fame and attention others out for revenge and when KickAss becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved. There has been some controversy over the graphic violence depicted in these scenes especially as the trailer is intended to appeal to a fairly young audience and that comes as no surprise when a preteen girl decapitates villains on screen and uses the c word. Controversy aside I cannot deny that this was very entertaining.Chloe Moretz easily steals the show as Hit Girl  the incredibly volatile young superhero with a penchant for explicit language which will surely propel her into the realms of stardom. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as her doting father and Christopher MintzPlasse is ever watchable as Red Mist. However it is Aaron Johnson who shows the most promise as KickAss with his convincing turn from a bumbling student to a brave and reckless crime fighter marking him as a talent to watch out for.An essential part of the film is its eclectic soundtrack with choice tracks taken from excellent films such as 28 Days Later and For a few dollars more. Usually I would be concerned at such a prospect but the KickAss soundtrack adapts the tracks brilliantly making them feel like its own alongside great songs from The Prodigy and Sparks to name a few. The choice of music fits perfectly with the highoctane action sequences and even adds emotional depth to key scenes  not bad for a superhero comedy movie! KickAss is that rarest of films a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. My only criticism would be that some sequences near the end were slightly farfetched but in a film where suspension of belief is required maybe I'm being a little harsh.

	onyx:emotionText "It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but KickAss did exactly that I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns KickAss is a welcome addition to the realm of the comicbook movie.I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal but KickAss completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film or even a Tarantino script in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and KickAss was the end result.The story focuses on Dave Lizewski your average teenage nerd whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero KickAss despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.It is not long before other vigilantes surface some desperate for the fame and attention others out for revenge and when KickAss becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved.

	schema:reviewBody "In a movie industry cluttered with owngrown hype gimmicks and lack of idea Kick Ass bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being is Kick Assdoesn't want to be good or above average Kick Ass wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in Wanted but Kick Ass is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but Kick Ass ain't giving that up either. It's script is razorsharp dumping the pretension of the burden of heroism crippling even the better superhero films showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do the more they try the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we're with Dave 100 of the way it doesn't just have to functional.The real visual joy of Kick Ass is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things instead of Michael Bayesquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music again utterly relatable right down to it's outstanding score like Get Carter for superheroes I could say more but there's surprises in store.In a movie this stunning acting is usually secondary as any James Cameron film shows. Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows Role Models by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original ubergeek after Michael Cera set the standard anyone who's seen Zombieland knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie. He shakes it redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.Watching Kick Ass is ultimately like being on a thrillride it doesn't just want to dazzle you it's wants to draw you in ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's it breaks the mold shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie it's a standard one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.And ultimately you'll be leaving the screen thinking Wow let's do that again no matter how many agains come before it.".

	schema:headline " KICKASS kicked my ass";
	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely the best movie of 2010 so far hands down. Not only is it insanely funny throughout it has a great story and inyourface action that will pun intended kick your ass. It's the story of a high school comic book nerd who decides he's going to take up being a costumed hero because no one else will. Early on he discovers that society could care less about the evils that be and he takes it upon himself to do something about it. But of course none of the super heroes in the movie actually have powers because it's about real people kicking real ass. Early on you'll find the protagonist Dave is a pushover and even as his costumed alterego KickAss he can't succeed in anything he does. He comes off as an extremely unlikable character but as the story unfolds and he gets mixed up with other costumed heroes who really do kick ass he slowly becomes the perfect antihero and a character which will most likely be a new icon in popular culture. The script for the film is remarkably well written and it managed to combine hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic stylized violence. Never have I seen a movie that combined the two so well. One moment you'll be crying from laughter and the next you'll be squinching at a little girl slaughtering grown men with the slightest of ease. The directing was topnotch and this is the first film i've seen from Matthew Vaughn. If KickAss doesn't put him on the map as one of the most sought after directors in Hollywood then I don't know what will.The acting was superb from the entire cast especially from veteran Nicolas Cage. He played his part perfectly and I couldn't see any one else as Big Daddy. As impressed as I was with Cage's performance I was blown away with how well Chloe Moretz HitGirl played her part. She definitely stole the show.I honestly couldn't recommend this movie more and it has become one of my new personal favorites. KickAss is a film about finding your identity and daring to do something no one else will. Yet it's also an intricate tale of revenge which is masterfully crafted to be one of the most entertaining pieces of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. 10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night my combined love of films and comic books finally paid dividends as I was invited along with every other comic manager in the Boston area to attend a press screening of Marv films' KickAss based on Mark Millar  John Romita Jr's Marvel Comics series of the same name which opens in theaters April 16th. A bold move on the part of Marv considering they were risking a month of WERST MOVIE EVERRR! badmouthing across the entire state. I assure you that will not be a problem.So first off should you see this? Definitely. As I told everyone when Watchmen was out if you are a fan of comic books just go see the movie  if only to add yourself to the communal experience to join the debate. Everyone's going to be talking about it anyway don't get left behind. And in this case I think it will be more universally enjoyed than Watchmen. Not that it is a better film just a lot more entertaining  it tries for far less succeeds at what it attempts and therefore hasn't left itself open to as much scrutiny. Bottom line this is just a fun romp with clever bits and reassuringly satisfying plot points that had a bunch of jaded comic geeks roaring with laughter and delight rooting for the good guys culminating with applause at the end. Granted we were seeing it for free and had nothing invested besides a night we could have otherwise been sitting at home playing Arkham Asylum. But even if discussion later turned to thisorthat subtle difference from the comic I don't think many were picking apart plot holes or questionable directorial decisions.Overall the impression I was left with was that it was a kind of hybrid descendant of SpiderMan and Kill Bill. It has its mundane realworldkiddealswithreallifesituations side as PeterParkerish nobody Dave Lizewski Aaron Johnson dreams of something more than his boring humdrum teen life. Eventually like most kids his age he decides to make an impact on the world by... well y'know donning a supersuit and heading out to thwart evildoers. Just as we're getting used to the idea that of course this won't work and that he'll get his ass kicked every time he starts learning how to improve his chances and also that he's not alone in his quest.Which then brings us to the film's outrageous overthetop side best exemplified by everyone's newest favorite comic book character HitGirl. Her operatic homicidal spaghettiwestern character is delivered with so much infectious glee that you could feel the entire theater perk up whenever she appeared. The fact that she is played by Chloe Moretz an actress no older than the Planetary comic series only adds to the overall delightfully ludicrous nature of her character. I'm sure there will be the inevitable stink raised by parental or religious groups not so much at the welldeserved R rating but at this particular character a preteen Beatrix Kiddo and GoGo Yubari rolled into one.To wrap up I think the pacing is exemplary there really weren't any dead spots for the audience to shift in their seats. Matthew Vaughn's direction neither dazzles nor bores there is much that is derivative of previous films but he knows how to build up and pay off an action scene and there were moments I was sure how a scene was being set up to end only to be pleasantly surprised at the result. I think my favorite aspect of the film was the use of music from the use of John Murphy's building epic Sunshine and 28 Days Later themes to a hilarious that's just wrong use of the Banana Splits theme. It's possible that with a month to street date we may have seen some temp music but I hope not everything fit perfectly  even Elvis Presley's America The Beautiful! The casting works from the relatively unknown Johnson whose screen presence in this film is definitely enhanced by how much he looks like Tobey Maguire once he puts the ski mask on to the quirky haunted Nicolas Cage who for once forgoes his normal Presleychanneling in favor of some Pure West to the mostlyBritish supporting players made up of bits of cast from Vaughn's previous producing  directing gigs. And for the most part the teens actually look like teens not like the 25yearolds that usually portray teens in film and TV. Christopher MintzPlasse a.k.a. McLovin' especially stands out in a role that sneakily grows into one of the most important and poignant of the film.I had a blast I think you will too. I know they've got a month to tinker around with the film but I for one hope they don't change a frame. I think casual what's playing tonight audiences will enjoy an irreverent violent funny action flick and comic fans will get an extra treat picking out all the comic book references in the background. I really can't imagine anyone anywhere watching Avatar had as much fun as we all had last night. I for one will be back this time with money and peanut MMs in hand.".

The acting was flawless in my opinion with Aaron DaveKickass Chloe Hitgirl and Christopher ChrisRed Mist giving their best and shining throughout the entire movie. The storyline even though it may not be the most original one is amazingly well developed. The movie goes by at a perfect rhythm combining comedy with action just perfectly. The music was amazingly well picked and combined 100 with every scene. and so on and so forth...When I left the theater I was so excited so happy and so energetic it looked like I just had a shot of adrenaline! And I couldn't stop talking about the movie. It's been a really long time since I felt this way about a movie.Now I know this movie is going to feed a lot of haters. It's normal. A lot of people walk into the theater with their mind already set like This movie is for nerds. It's going to suck so much. if you have that kind of mentality just save yourself the time and don't watch it. Why bother if throughout the whole movie you're just going to be looking for flaws or rolling your eyes at every joke.I loved this movie. I don't care about anything other people say. Kick ass is my favorite movie of all time. I have no doubt about that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've first heard about KickAss and been waiting to see it since November 2009. After I began to read the comics and they were very good! I'm just very happy I got the chance to finally see the movie yesterday at 1030 pm. I have never done a review for a movie before but I'll try to explain my opinions well.Let me just say that KickAss is nothing like any other superhero movie out there. It's not even like any other actioncomedysuspense movie you'll view out there!I loved DaveKickAss' character because he relates to most teens these days. He was very silly slow but smart and was just totally outrageously funny and had quirky lines. I thought Aaron Johnson played his part perfectly well. Especially the hilarious but 'kickass' fight scenes he was in. When I first saw Red Mist I already loved him. He was a spoiled annoying and conceited kid. And Christopher MintzPlasse did a very great job at portraying that type of character. It was definitely something different than 'McLovin' and much more of an interesting character brought to the table! HitGirl was absolutely amazing and ridiculously insane! I loved her and I'm pretty sure the audience did too. She can be so innocent and sweet as a regular child but when she's in her mask and hardcore crimefighting purple outfit she's just stunningly awesome! No one is like HitGirl and I can yell that to anyone! Chloe Moretz is an amazing actress and she seems like she has a very bright future ahead of her. I admire her acting and her movies. Lastly Big Daddy was not only the most hardcore character in the film but he had to do a lot with the plot and storyline. Not to mention his super funny Adam West impressions. I loved Big Daddy but hated what happened near the end movie and comicwise.KickAss the most exhilarating jawdropping and the most hilarious movie I've ever seen in my 16 years! I loved every single moment in the film and found most of the humor very funny. Before seeing the movie I got a little scared that it might be just another 'let down' or 'walkout' movie I'd have to deal with. But it wasn't. It was very perfectly entertaining and satisfying for me in many ways. KickAss is definitely one my favorite films ever and it was just simply the most amazing and hilarious film nobody can't miss! Not to mention that it was just super fun and exciting just like riding a rollercoaster! This is the perfect superhero movie anyone would enjoy.Thank you America for not letting me down on this one!".

I thought Hit Girl was what made the movie shine as she was cussing and slaughtering people. Aaron Johnson did a good job playing the lead role of Kick Ass and I thought Nicolas Cage was good at playing Big Daddy as it wasn't the typical Cage film. This movie beats a lot of those stupid high school movies and chick flicks that are trying to be funny but fail. This is a great combination of bloody action and comedy. Its the Super Bad meets Kill Bill genre. I highly recommend this film.".

His first film adaptation was the weak dumbed down version of the Matrix Wanted but luckily KickAss is a lot better.Dave Lizewski Aaron Johnson is a typical New York teenager who is a comicbook fan and not in any particular group in High School. He is ignored by girls including Katie Lyndsy Fonseca the girl he fancies. Dave however fantasises about what it would be like to be a superhero and he makes an effort to make it happen. After his first attempt at vigilante justice Dave ends up having a big accident and his nerve endings are damage. But this gives him a high pain threshold and after being videotaped fighting three men at once Dave becomes a internet sensation and his alterego KickAss is born. But Dave as KickAss gets in over his head when he meets two real heroes Big Daddy Nicholas Cage and his young girl HitGirl Chloe Moretz a brilliant martial artist and skilled assassin. Big Daddy sets out to bring down the crime lord Frank D'Amico Mark Strong taking down his organisation from the bottom up. As KickAss Dave is brought into their violence world. As well as these superhero actives Dave has to hide his identity whilst using his fame in the internet age to help people out through Myspace. He also finally get's Katie's attentions but for all the wrong reasons.The director Matthew Vaughn had been touted to direct comic book conversions before. He was offered the chance to do XMen The Last Stand but left because of the rushed production and weak script and missed out on directing Thor when his script turned out would have cost too much. He has proved to be a skilled director having done the great gangster film Layer Cake and the fun fantasy romp Stardust. With KickAss he is able to make a stylist colourful comicbook conversion. It is fastpaced actionpacked violence and very funny throughout. Vaughn was able to make a live action comic with stylist vision trick compared to Ang Lee who tried and failed with Hulk. An excellent film in vain of Frank Miller films like Sin City and 300. Vaughn shows how an action sequence should be directed with HitGirl and her wide range of weapons making excellent viewing. Vaughn made the film like a violence parody of Spiderman following similar plot elements scenes like Dave designing his costume having a similar score and basically plays on wider superhero conventions. But this was a parody which pays tribute and respects the genre it's lampooning not aiming for cheap laughs.Aaron Johnson offers an excellent performance as DaveKickAss. He is like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker going through similar issues using a voiceover throughout the film and even sounds like Maguire. He is an actor with a bright future ahead of him. Vaughn is able to assemble a good supporting cast. Nicholas Cage is a known superhero fan and he missed out playing both Iron Man and Superman in the past. He is excellent as the man of action as Big Daddy and is a deranged but loving father. He is one an important quest to take down Frank D'Amico. Mark Strong has been making headway in Hollywood recently being in films like Body of Lies and Sherlock Holmes. He plays an effective villain a gangster slowly becoming more violence and erratic because of the KickAss phenomenon. He too is a deranged and loving father despite his business. But the real star out of the supporting actors is Chloe Moretz as the foul month 11yearold assassin who is hard as nails but also at times a sweetnatured girl and it is wonderfully played when the two characteristics are compared. She is one of the most fun characters in a film this year.KickAss is not perfect and it will not cater to everyone's tastes but it is easily one of the most fun films of 2010.".

Along the way he clashes with the mob their mole hero Red Mist and a little girl and her father who are also superheroes.I'm under whelmed by this tale of teen angst turned toward acceptable violence. Sure its grand wish fulfillment for anyone who wanted to be Spiderman and Batman but at the same time it seems like it was constructed by the same people looking for said fulfillment. Its the story of a geeky kid who get to beat people up gets the girl and live happily ever after. The problem it has a story that not only has plot holes you could drive a truck through but it shifts tones almost moment by moment. Is it serious? is it a joke? What exactly am I suppose to feel? I don't know. I know some people have called it morally bankrupt and I can kind of see where thats coming from with the tone being uncertain you don't know where the film stands.I'm not going to say much more other than to say I was extremely disappointed. Neither bad nor good its kind of half baked.I'd wait for cable.".

	schema:reviewBody "KickAss is an excellententertaining and hilarious SuperheroComic Book film that's filled with great directiona wonderful castamazing Actionlaugh out loud Comedy and a great score and soundtrack makes KickAss one of the best Superhero films ever made and a Cult Classic.Based on the Comic Book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr. and Set in New York CityKickAss tells the story of teenager Dave Lizewskian outcast who has nothing in his life going for except for his love for Comic Books and Superheros. Dave's love for Comic Books and Superheros inspire Dave to become a crime fighter and calling himself KickAss and becomes a sensation. Howeverwhen KickAss angers local crime boss Frank D'AmicoMark StrongD'Amico wants KickAss dead. Nowwith the help of other crime fighters HitGirlChloe Grace Moretzand her Father Big DaddyNicolas CageKickAss has to stop D'Amico and end come out on top.KickAss is a brilliantActionpacked and funny superhero film that wears it's over the top spirit on it's sleeve and gives viewers a film that mocks and reconstructs the Superhero genre and a movie that is violenthilarious and offbeat and a true Cult Classic. One of the main reasons KickAss is a great movie is that it takes the Superhero Comic Book genre and turns it on it's head taking aim at classic and iconic Superheros such as BatmanSuperman and SpiderMan and the film's that associated with them taking all of the trademarks and familiar things and giving them a demented twist that is funny and stylish. Imagine the movie Watchmen if it was a Black Comedy. The Comedy and Humor is truly hilarious and done with a dark satirical glee that goes so over the top that you never know what's going to happen next whether it's with the film's characters or the violence and you as the viewer are pulled into a bizarre world where anything can and will happen. The Action and fight scenes in the film are fantastic and flawlessly executed with great skill and detail and fits in with the film's wild Comic Book energy. The violence is bloody and brutal but done in a funny way. While KickAss takes place in a realistic setting the look of the film has a Surrealistic Comic Book style and look throughout the film with bright colors such as redgreen and blue almost a Comic Book coming to life on the screen and it's just beautiful and visually stunning to look at. The screenplay by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman is just amazing and fresh with great dialog that is truly memorable and stylish and at the same time funny and quotable with very interesting characters that will stay in your mind after you have watched it. The film's main characters KickAss and HitGirl are amazingmemorable characters that are fascinating to watch because of who they are and how different the two are from each other. KickAss is a remarkable character because he is not like other Comic Book crime fighters or Superheros because Dave LizweskiKickAss' alter egodoes not become the hero KickAss for the sake of revenge or because of something awful happening to his parentsDave is just and awkward teenage kid who just wanted to be KickAss because he wanted to know what it is like to be a Superhero and fight crime. And while KickAss does not always succeed in kicking ass like much better and superior Superheros KickAss believes in what he's doing and you applaud him for what he tries to do even if he fails more than he succeeds. While the character KickAss called himself KickAss but in my opinion the real KickAss was HitGirl. HitGirl is such an amazing character because despite HitGirl being 11 years old and a little bit small she can fight with anybody anytime and can handle herself without hesitation or doubtusing either gunsknives or her own fists. Where as KickAss just became a crime fighter with no fighting skillsHitGirl was taught to fight criminals by her crime fighter Father Big Daddy so HitGirl can learn how to handle herself when she's all alone with the criminals. HitGirl is a character you will remember after watching the film. The most talked about and controversial thing about KickAss is Hitgirl's use of harsh language and violence that she does in the film which will offend most viewers. And while I admit the cursing from HitGirl is shocking at times it does not offend me and I find HitGirl cursing funny because it's in the context of Comedy and the surreal Comic Book universe. The ending of KickAss is amazing and Actionpacked and will leave viewers with a smile. A great ending.The whole cast is amazing. Aaron Johnson is excellent as KickAssDave Lizewskiwith Johnson bringing humor and likability to the role. Chloe Grace Mortez is brilliant as HitGirlMindy Macreadywith Mortez bringing toughnesslaughs and depth to the role. Christopher MintzPlasse is fantastic and funny as Chris D'AmicoRed MistFrank D'Amico's son. Nicholas Cage is great and over the top as Big DaddyDamon MacreadyHitGirlMindy's Father. Mark Strong is amazing and hilarious as Frank D'Amicoa local crime boss. Lindsay Fonseca is wonderful and sexy as KatieDave's crush. Clarke DukeMartyEvan PetersToddOmari HardwickSergant Marcus WilliamsMichael RispoliBig JoeStu RileyBig Goonand Yancy ButlerAngie D'Amicogive good performances as well.The direction by Matthew Vaughn is excellent and stylishwith Vaughn always moving the camera and giving the film a great pacewonderful energy and visual style and also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great directionVaughn.The score by Marius De VriesIIan EshkenHenry Jackman and John Murphy is fantasticepic and big and matches the tone of the film. A great score. There is also amazing songs on the soundtrack from Elvis PresleyBattle Hymm Of The RepublicThe DickiesBanana SplitsJoan JettBad Reputationand Ennio MorriconeFor A Few Dollar More Theme.In final wordif you love Superhero FilmsComic Book filmsAction films or ComediesI highly suggest you see KickAssan Actionpacked and hilarious Superhero film and Cult Classic that you will never forget.

Hit Girl is stealing the show right!?It's like telling a 3yearold to say 'F..k' and laughing because it sounds sooo funny. Then maybe he or she can kill a cat with a knife because you don't often see many 3yearolds doing such a thing. The wise producers could do another popcorn flick set in primary school about kids killing Nazis and necrophiliacs. Sure they've never ever done that before! But should they! Is it really that funny for general audience nowadays? Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies if it has SOME point to the story or even if it's nicely stylized Sin City 300. But in times of Saws the sickening violence has no other point apart from 'pleasing the audience' and KickAss might be at the top of this statement. It can really make someone feel that comic books are worthless pointless and derivative piece of crap that base their originality on pushing the boundaries in showing the violence rather than coming up with some decent storytelling.

They must all either be idiots who get a kick from seeing 11 year old girls saying the C word and fighting fully grown men or actually all be preteens who managed to sneak in to see it with fake I.D.sThe high age certification for this movie is correct due to the obscene language and over top fight scenes which contain a lot of violence and gore mostly done at the hands of the 11 year old character of Hit Girl. However this means that the only audience who would put up with the flaws and holes in this movie are too young to see it!Hundreds of Clichs and stolen lines from far greater movies are found in abundance from the robbing of the classic Scarface line Say hello to my little friend! to the typical guy gets girl tripe that seems so frequent in movies nowadays.None of the Super Heroes featured in this movie have any special powers but are more based on the Batman style of crime fighter. A vital plot flaw that is called into question when Hit Girlthe 11 year old foul mouthed super hero has a oneonone fight with the big boss man and he kicks her very hard in the face. She pretty much shakes it straight off as if it was nothing. If a young girl got kicked like that for real straight in the face she'd more likely be dead or in traction with injuries instead of just having a bloody nose. Further on in this unbelievable fight sequence she gets thrown into a solid table with such force that it breaks yet she still remains conscious.If you like watching badly acted flawed abominations that call themselves movies than this will be right up your street.If however you actually have a brain or can't stand child exploitation for cheap laughs you'd probably rather kick your own ass than watch this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I do remember hearing about KICK ASS on its release but for some inexplicable reason never got round to watching it until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight . I do recall it caused a bit of a stir along the lines of being a little bit violent but hey vigilante wannabes giving a few slaps to bad guys means we're not watching Walt Disney but did have the impression it was going to be a good natured movie that possibly the whole family could enjoy . I have totally embarrassed myself typing that last line and should have listened to the channel 4 announcer warn of violence  strong language and scenes some viewers might find offensive What we have is John Woo meets Quintan Tarantino meets Hollywood obsession with comic book heroes and this isn't really a criticism but it does indicate that this is certainly not the family friendly fare I thought I might have been watching . It does have a good natured premise ripe for all types of dark humour where Dave Lizewski a gauche New York teenager suffering from existentialist angst decides he's had enough of being a nobody and decides to take on the criminal underworld as  Kick Ass  a real life superhero who is going to live up to his nameThis is how the early parts of the film play out and is blackly comical as Kick Ass has a quixotic plan to clean up the streets . Try and think of TAXI DRIVER where Scorsese cast a happy clappy Christian youth as Travis Bickle and you're on the right tracks . The amusing tone of the film then changes as we're introduced to Hit Girl a prepubescent child who spends much of the film dispatching bad guys in a variety of graphic ways . Let's be honest here if she was in her early 20s and played by Megan Fox no one would have blinked an eyelid and if we were to be even more honest she'd be some sort of masturbatory fantasy figure but because the character is eleven years old that changes the whole game and watching Hit Girl jump around in the style of THE MATRIX literally slicing and dicing gangsters does make for uncomfortable viewing and some cynics might say she is included to stir up controversy Matthew Vaughn proves himself as one of the most interesting directors and if you want to say that he's more style than substance then I won't disagree with you but will defend him on the grounds that if you're this talented when it comes to style who needs any substance . Like his earlier film LAYER CAKE there's a danger of the whole film collapsing in to one big bad mess but is directed with such directorial flourish this never happens . He does help his cause by including a great soundtrack and might be seen as a cheap trick but is very effective KICK ASS is a very enjoyable film for those in the mood for some stylish designer violence but I should emphasise it is a violent film and the fact that much of the violence is tongue in cheek might ironically alienate audience members more than it might have done if everything had been played in a slightly more serious way  but there's an energy here rarely seen in other films featuring vigilantes and superheroes".

It is clear that the review system is being manipulated to give UTTER TRASH like this high ratings on IMDb. CHILD EXPLOITATIONI suppose if you're a Hollywood producer backed by enough money to market your product you can exploit children in your film. You can also assist in the progressive desensitization of the masses to violence and pretend to be provocative and original by getting your child actress to act out scenes of murder and extreme violence. You can do all this and still get rave reviews in the mainstream media  who are getting payed by your bosses so who cares about human values anymore? People who find this film funny or good in any way have some serious problems in my opinion. This is like a bunch of retarded cokedup teenagers with lots of cash to burn trying to be as awful as Tarantino in his worse moments. If you think this would be funny somehow you are mistaken. This juvenile onanistic sh!t is like the worse straighttoDVD American trash you can pick up for a buck in junk stores. The facts  this film is marketed to young people has received rave reviews and has not been utterly condemned for its abusive criminal exploitation of the worse parts of human nature and Amerikanised trash culture . Pretty depressing and this has lots to say about the hopelessness of our civilisation. It's funny if you have the humour of a sociopathic 13year old boy from New Jersey. And it is precisely this demographic that should be kept away from films like this at all costs.Hollywood continues with its campaign to completely erode humane values and desensitize people to violence and torture. How come fullon sex scenes including genitals are taboo but scenes of gory murder and torture are now so commonplace that even children can participate? How did we get here? Thugggish violence and shootings in schools by underage psychopaths can be expected to continue with increased regularity thanks to films like this.

	schema:headline " Excellent";
	schema:reviewBody "An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror 8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and nearflawless acting.Juror 1  a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film  when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury  a task he clearly does not relish.Juror 2  a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job  he is an accountant.Juror 3  probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant selfmade successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb  this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror 4  self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says  this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot day.Juror 5  here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy  with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty  he does not want compassion to influence him  so ironically it does.Juror 6  a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror 7  the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case  he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever  he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror 9  a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror 10  the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's  which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror 11  an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his  and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once  horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7.Juror 12  a young business type  perhaps he has his own opinions  but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today  developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters.".

The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror 8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and nearflawless acting.Juror 1  a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film  when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury  a task he clearly does not relish.Juror 2  a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job  he is an accountant.Juror 3  probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant selfmade successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb  this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror 4  self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says  this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot day.Juror 5  here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy  with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty  he does not want compassion to influence him  so ironically it does.Juror 6  a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror 7  the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case  he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever  he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror 9  a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror 10  the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's  which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror 11  an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his  and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once  horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7.Juror 12  a young business type  perhaps he has his own opinions  but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today  developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that for a film to be great it does not need extensive scenery elaborate costumes or expensive special effects  just superlative acting.The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteenyearold boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty only one Henry Fonda has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?The court case provides only a framework however. The film's greatness lies in its bringingtogether of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus we have the hesitant football coach Martin Balsam the shy uncertain bank clerk John Fiedler the aggressive call company director Lee J. Cobb the authoritative broker E.G. Marshall the selfconscious slum dweller Jack Klugman the solid dependable painter Edward Binns the selfish salesman Jack Warden the calm collected architect Fonda the thoughtful observant older man Joseph Sweeney the racially bigoted garage owner Ed Begley the East European watchmaker George Voskovec and the beefcake advertising agent Robert Webber who has plenty of chat and little else.Almost the entire film takes place in just one room the jury room where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises literally and metaphorically among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly the jurors apart from two at the end are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9 the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3 the hard stubborn aggressive vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982 as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long reputable career on film and t.v. including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' miniseries. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.Of the twelve only John Fiedler Jack Klugman and Jack Warden are still alive. Although around the eighty mark they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!John Fiedler died June 2005. Jack Warden died July 2006.".

I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old classics. This film blew me away however how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it has no real alibi. However one man played brilliantly by Henry Fonda is illat ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films masterstroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film one of the jurors a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats look out for Jack Klugman Quincy and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all if you have not yet seen this film please do so now.".

However juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as surefire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene and that is not easy to do in a film like this. Ed Begley Martin Balsam Jack Warden Jack Klugman Joseph Sweeney E.G.

He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great but Lee J.

For such a simplistic story set in one jury room it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense mystery and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty only one jury man Henry Fonda doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations doubts and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film that every time I watch it only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history  one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal which gave the film a more atmospheric experience like you were their in the jury room with them  and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film with such a simple setting had the world talking the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film  'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time  bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......Is it possible?  Juror 8Henry Fonda".

It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off I was incredibly impressed with the credits we not only had Henry Fonda we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure god I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour 8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of reasonable doubts one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making except for one stubborn 3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly i.e. 7th Heaven or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually the whole cast was terrific there wasn't a performance that was off key movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today it was so simple but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please if you have any taste you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror Mr. Davis Henry Fonda the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a shorttempered loud mouth to a straight laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits. This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.".

Disgraceful how far culture has sloped downwards over the year. A UK list of the best musicals of all time was recently completed. Guess what was ahead of Singin' in the Rain and My Fair Lady? Buffy the Vampire Slayer The Musical.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all what a cast! Fonda doesn't seem like much of a New Yorker but the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who in New York movies. All of them except Sweeney and Voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles.The plot comes from a TV show and is very tightly written. There's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. This has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. There's not much sense of real life here. Everything fits together too neatly for that. But if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. Like Stagecoach it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch.Also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. Each is a stereotype. They practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. I AM A SHALLOW AD MAN. BORED MARMALADE SALESMAN HERE. KICK ME I AM AN IGNORANT RACIST. They are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters.A third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what Tom Wolfe referred to as nostalgie de la bou  a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called Fantasies of the Art House Audience. What it boils down to is a dislike of the middleclass. Fonda is an architect a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb are selfmade men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line something like I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here. Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN  of marmalade! Yukk.Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography by Boris Kaufman is perceptive and adds to the tension the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together there is a rumble of thunder and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room practically the only set. There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse. Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point  once at the table and once in the men's room  and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall it's a marvelous movie a lesson in acting directing writing and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.".

Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called Fantasies of the Art House Audience. What it boils down to is a dislike of the middleclass. Fonda is an architect a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb are selfmade men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line something like I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here. Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN  of marmalade! Yukk.Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography by Boris Kaufman is perceptive and adds to the tension the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together there is a rumble of thunder and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room practically the only set. There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse. Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point  once at the table and once in the men's room  and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall it's a marvelous movie a lesson in acting directing writing and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.";

I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TVmovie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman an extension of his Tom Joad character from The Grapes of Wrath. E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent coolheaded and logical he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty tensionfilled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table a key piece of evidence hinges on this and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it put it at the top of your list.Grade A".

	schema:headline " A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system";
	schema:reviewBody "... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states not guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant the prosecuting attorney or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not set up in the first half hour as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E.G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing the riveting dialogue the character studies that don't choke each other out and the brilliant camerawork that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.".

	schema:headline " Benefit of Hindsight";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers I really liked the message of the movie A lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance upon deeper inspection aren't so clear. The acting was topnotch allaround especially with Juror 9. The product ends up being not very preachy which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight though one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt and as the climax approaches the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of that very well may be or some such and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect would it really then be fitting to have the happy a wrong has been righted swellingorchestra music as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no conviction or no this kind of peaceofmind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway and because of that will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor has had a rough background and has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is going with this since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem likely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other jurors but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way it could support any of Fonda's arguments is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself rather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't supposed to do.Four years after this movie was made the Supreme Court defined the Exclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt and in addition to that if you knew too much then you still couldn't convict. During the sixties conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling that a lot of District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society.By the seventies Americans were so fedup with the justice system failing us that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and Watergate this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today.What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about Taking the law into your own hands. Dirty Harry Death Wish and countless madeforTV projects. In summary the pendulum swung in one direction then a few years later the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort ultimately a successful one to get that pendulum swinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time just fifteen years or so leaving revolution out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then by doing this  convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's  earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons in subsequent years were arrested like they should have been.I would say if you're going to serve on a jury by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty it makes some great points and everything in this movie is highestquality. But also on your requiredviewing list would be Primal Fear the Richard Gere movie. Better yet watch that one last so the final scene really sticks in your mind.Nobody should be serving on a jury if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers I really liked the message of the movie A lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance upon deeper inspection aren't so clear. The acting was topnotch allaround especially with Juror 9. The product ends up being not very preachy which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight though one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt and as the climax approaches the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of that very well may be or some such and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect would it really then be fitting to have the happy a wrong has been righted swellingorchestra music as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no conviction or no this kind of peaceofmind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway and because of that will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen the film before we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair which by all appearances seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb one of the great American actors of the last century is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son who he hasn't seen in a couple of years having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about 12 Angry Men some people marvel there were no women in the jury or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all the times in which the action takes place and the fact that being a poor man the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors at all which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.".

Even though the word masterpiece is often overused like genius it certainly and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is topnotch and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small microcosmic little world  his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.Set in an actual New York jury room it's a claustrophobic tightly confined set where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices morals and personalities are thrown together and sometimes violently clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather at the beginning of the film it's a stuffy oppressive sweatbox which becomes sidelined by a dark stormy maelstrom outside the jury room this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing as Fonda's chainsmkoing softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker he manages to turn everyone around slowly but surely almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror  but he's not manipulative sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is  he's the pure voice of reason and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes  they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda  I don't know anyone cooler than this guy.".

I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange but the direction well the movie is one hell of a thriller  I well my verdict is clear GREAT MOVIE Juror 2 John Fiedler bank clerk I don't know. It's an excellent film served by great performances. Every character was convincing so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw for me there's nothing to add and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE Juror 3 Lee J. Cobb businessman I told you why this movie is great it's just  thought provoking everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a goodhearted hero and simpleminded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which even at the end makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment it's about justice ... without any prejudice and that deserves respect yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIEJuror 4 E.G. Marshall stockbroker First of all it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence 12 Angry Men delivers a brilliant intelligent and universally inspiring message. To conclude I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIEJuror 5 Jack Klugman the man from the slum What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is GREAT MOVIEJuror 6 Edward Binns painter A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects no bigstar cast no big explosions no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest simple movie featuring ordinary men but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover regardless of his or her age. Anyway GREAT MOVIEJuror 7 Jack Warden salesman Come on everyone is using big words and noble concepts but for me this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it the dialogs the way opposite characters interact create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch sometimes well  I think you can say anything but without entertainment a film is worthless and the movie could've been a bore just all talk and no walk but it wasn't it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIEJuror 8 Henry Fonda architect This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men blindly and implacably this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt and when you have what appears to be an openandshut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject well this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts our words our acts. 12 Angry Men is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIEJuror 9 Joseph Sweeney retired This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching 12 Angry Men I understood that a consensus when rapidly built means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure this is a GREAT MOVIEJuror 10 Ed Begley garage owner I hate the patronizing way some leftwing goodhearted people adore this film this has nothing to do with politics truth or justice it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point and that's the beauty of the film you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think but it's a GREAT MOVIEJuror 11 Joseph Voskovek watchmaker No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIEJuror 12 Robert Webber advertising executive Wow what I can say it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said why 12 Angry Men is a GREAT MOVIE".

Justice is done by men blindly and implacably this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt and when you have what appears to be an openandshut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject well this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts our words our acts. 12 Angry Men is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIEJuror 9 Joseph Sweeney retired This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching 12 Angry Men I understood that a consensus when rapidly built means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure this is a GREAT MOVIEJuror 10 Ed Begley garage owner I hate the patronizing way some leftwing goodhearted people adore this film this has nothing to do with politics truth or justice it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point and that's the beauty of the film you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think but it's a GREAT MOVIEJuror 11 Joseph Voskovek watchmaker No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIEJuror 12 Robert Webber advertising executive Wow what I can say it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said why 12 Angry Men is a GREAT MOVIE";

	schema:reviewBody "This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film or not one has to recognize the greatest achievement perhaps of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. Gone with the Wind represents a monumental leap as well as a departure for the movies as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South before and after the Civil War pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.Gone with the Wind brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course credit must be due to the director Victor Fleming and his vision as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty her sense of timing her intelligent approach to this role makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett the woman he knows is in love with a dream speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie but being realistic this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities such as the slavery were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge in the film they are kept at a minimum. After all this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South Margaret Mitchell who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's rereleases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now but Gone With the Wind book and film remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic but charming Rhett Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently. If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress at least in the USA Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the preCivil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically but loses all their previous affection. I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett decided to go after Melanie. It's a deceptive part superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character she's a slave but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.MetroGoldwynMayer kept itself in the black for years by simply rereleasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film it won new generations of fans with theatrical rerelease. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett Scarlett Ashley and Melanie and the world they knew will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind in its true essence is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel a classic within its own right does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War visvis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara the well bred haughty tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself who won not one but two Oscars while playing one first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara in which she perfectly blends panache poignancy and peremptoriness is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her onstage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional outandout bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars a usurper an egomaniac a damsel a nemesis a menace a guardian a savior a patriot a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However behind this facade just like Scarlet there is a human capable of love and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland who as Melanie is a paragon of love humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction cinematography editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes high on emotion and drama which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie especially its anticlimatic ending brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 1010httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars a usurper an egomaniac a damsel a nemesis a menace a guardian a savior a patriot a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However behind this facade just like Scarlet there is a human capable of love and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland who as Melanie is a paragon of love humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction cinematography editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes high on emotion and drama which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie especially its anticlimatic ending brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 1010httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com";

	schema:reviewBody "For some nostalgic dreamers Gone With the Wind is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order a Civilization forever gone with the wind. It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys' so common in the stories related by Southerners as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.But for some idealistic spirits Gone With the Wind resonates as one of the most heartbreaking pages of American History when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty Freedom and Justice and when History written by the victorious side ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. Gone With the Wind chronicles what the South used to be a world where coexisted two cultures the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simpleminded Prissy Butterfly McQueen who knew nothing about birthin' babies and the wisdom and authority of Mammy Hattie McDaniel in her Oscarwinning role two figures two extremes so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them despite the obvious stereotypes.For literate minds History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life where the passing of time can be felt when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara Vivien Leigh whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard married to the gentle and extremely goodhearted cousin Melanie Hamilton Olivia de Havilland. A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable antiheroine selfish greedy jealous but so brave courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic As God is my witness I'll never be hungry again.The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters she doesn't care for etiquette for traditions her spirit is free her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past Scarlett thinks of the future as she says after all tomorrow is another day. Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston' is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era they think of money greed prosperity and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for transcending the oldfashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.For many passionate hearts this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strongminded egos two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth a lost but so endearing cause a fire that burnt inside and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky during Atlanta's big fire. Love has never been as passionate as a loveandhate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett lost in her love for Ashley will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable comeuppance ever Frankly my dear I don't give a damn before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This I don't give a damn voted 1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge and he sure deserved it... and many wannabeScarlett would admit that too.But while Gone With the Wind deals with lost causes it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best seller it's one of the greatest films of all time the greatest casting ever the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's superproduction that would become a landmark in filmmaking with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree during a beautiful sunset. Along with The Wizard of Oz and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .".

This I don't give a damn voted 1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge and he sure deserved it... and many wannabeScarlett would admit that too.But while Gone With the Wind deals with lost causes it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best seller it's one of the greatest films of all time the greatest casting ever the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's superproduction that would become a landmark in filmmaking with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree during a beautiful sunset. Along with The Wizard of Oz and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .";

The movie lasts nearly four hours it's longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made. But the time goes by so quickly that you'll miss it when it's over.Of course we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the 1860s. It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara a plantation owner's daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times. She's willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it. When the movie opens the country is on the verge of civil war North against South but Scarlett barely notices and doesn't care in the least. Her biggest obsession is that she's in love with dreamypoetic Ashley Wilkes and she stays in love with him throughout 98 percent of the movie. The only problem is....Ashley doesn't have any particular interest in her at all. In fact he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end. Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtain.She would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler a much more solid rather dangerous man with a reputation as a nogood scoundrel. He is openly attracted to Scarlett grows to love her although he dare not let her know or she'll use it against him and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then ironically and they never really are happy together.The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens if not hundreds of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one the colorful supporting roles for another. A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish onedimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex multidimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family and Melanie keeping in mind that other than her father she doesn't even particularly like any of them are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done and she's fiercely courageous. Despite her hardness she does also grow as a person. To her great credit she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie she does finally realize how illsuited she and Ashley have always been for each other and how little passion ever actually existed there.Some quick high points and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular wise funny respected Mammy Hattie McDaniel and wistful decentatheart prostitute Belle Watling Ona Munson are standouts.The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta the whole city seemingly in flames is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jawdroppingly beautiful.Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave later an employee but she is smart funny observant and she's treated as an equal if not a superior throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever she scornfully refers to certain lowlifes as poor white trash and we know Mammy knows too that if they get called that they deserve it. She may be black but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.A few minor flaws and I do mean minor 1 Most of the acting looks pretty modern but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little oldstyle. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's method acting in the 1930s. 2 Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It was bigtime Hollywood after all. 3 The second half of the movie is more talky and less actionoriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring just less movement. I don't find it draggy but some people do. Still a heck of a good story and a great film so enjoy the ride!".

	schema:reviewBody "There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than Gone with the wind. It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs but despite all this it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it. It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil though only 28 while filming played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book so stative so smart so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal and I think he did not just because he won for Stagecoach that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.Of course Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's but later on she was given what she deserved Oscars for To each his own and The Heiress. She plays Melanie with such a sensibility but she manages to show her hidden strength but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectlyremember that playing those scenes like those after Scarlett's miscarriage needed acting talent. He's perfect. But I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch so they fought about it badly but finally Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.If you love good cinema if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old though almost 70! do not miss it.".

I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more. We were not disappointed either. When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more. A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime. Since then I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it. I bought the collectors sets vhs and finally the DVD.

Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and it's timelessness. We all love that great timeless love story despite it's tragic ending and Scarlet's tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part. Despite all this the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed. That is the true power of this film. Aside from being able to enchant it's audiences Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema. It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly welldone color not only that but the photography was phenomenal also.

He is openly attracted to Scarlett grows to love her although he dare not let her know or she'll use it against him and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then ironically and they never really are happy together.The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens if not hundreds of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one the colorful supporting roles for another. A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish onedimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex multidimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family and Melanie keeping in mind that other than her father she doesn't even particularly like any of them are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done and she's fiercely courageous. Despite her hardness she does also grow as a person. To her great credit she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie she does finally realize how illsuited she and Ashley have always been for each other and how little passion ever actually existed there.Some quick high points and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular wise funny respected Mammy Hattie McDaniel and wistful decentatheart prostitute Belle Watling Ona Munson are standouts.The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta the whole city seemingly in flames is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jawdroppingly beautiful.Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave later an employee but she is smart funny observant and she's treated as an equal if not a superior throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever she scornfully refers to certain lowlifes as poor white trash and we know Mammy knows too that if they get called that they deserve it. She may be black but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.A few minor flaws and I do mean minor 1 Most of the acting looks pretty modern but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little oldstyle. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's method acting in the 1930s. 2 Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It was bigtime Hollywood after all. 3 The second half of the movie is more talky and less actionoriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring just less movement. I don't find it draggy but some people do. Still a heck of a good story and a great film so enjoy the ride!";

	schema:reviewBody "'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler Clark Gable but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland Clark Gable is very good charming and sometimes funny Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music the sets the costumes the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most wellknown films even today. Still the highestgrossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person not at all. She's scheming manipulative almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable on the other hand oh so very much.And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's Olivia de Havilland straight up sainthood.The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable to tell the truth.Aside from that the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted masterfully scripted masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted.".

	schema:headline " The Best Film of All Time?";
	schema:reviewBody "Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939 it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado lets delve right into this masterpiece!This movie is broken into two sections preCivil War and postCivil War. Scarlett Vivien Leigh is a strongwilled woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing she is put through a lot. However she has feelings for Ashley Leslie Howard. But Ashley is set to marry her cousin Melanie Olivia de Havilland. Mammy Hattie McDaniel warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new mysterious man at the party Rhett Butler Clark Gable who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny both economically planting cotton and owning a lumber business and sexually going after the men she chooses. Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler Frankly my dear I don't give a damn comes from.  Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award.  It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the skyhigh expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his partyboy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable mesmerizing Scarlett.  One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores.  Nominated for 10 Academy Awards Gone with the Wind is a majestic sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face will make you laugh will make you shudder up with tension and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film. My Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Gone with the Wind in its initial commercial TV broadcast in 1976. I have since seen the film numerous times via a succession of home video media videotape laserdisc and DVD. Yet seeing the film once more on bluray and a large widescreen high def monitor is like seeing it completely anew. The sweeping cinematography of this classic epic film has never before been delivered to home audiences in such stunning power and detail. The achingly romantic score has never sounded better whether heard in original mono or reconstructed stereo. Rhett Butler Clark Gable has never looked more rakishly handsome nor Scarlett O'Hara Vivien Leigh more alluringly sensual. In short for anyone not having seen Gone with the Wind in glorious bigscreen Technicolor almost all film viewers under the age of 70 the recent bluray release is a mustsee revelation.Beyond the compelling audiovisual experience Gone with the Wind thankfully retains its fascination as a central piece of American popular culture  a work of art complex and rich enough not only to bear up under multiple viewings but to reveal like great literature different aspects of its meaning depending on the cultural and personal variables that a viewer brings to the experience. There were certainly a great number of impressions in my recent viewing that I don't remember having in quite the same way 30 20 or even 10 years ago.For one thing characters and character relationships impacted me much differently than in the past. Scarlett's multiple marriages and affairs  even the protracted lovehate odyssey with Rhett  seemed less interesting now than the strength of character that enables her physical survival and success as a business woman. In many ways Scarlett is clearly not an ante and postbellum Southern belle but a woman of the 1930s newly emerging from a patriarchal culture and acquiring a social role and status equivalent to a male's.As with other '30s films that touch upon the redefinition of female roles Scarlett's acquisition of masculine power is greeted with ambivalence or downright hostility. Even Rhett who is generally bemused by and attracted to Scarlett's unbridled selfinterested power grabs eventually tries to tame and dominate Scarlett via marriage. On one occasion he tries to persuade her to give up the lumber mill and become a more devoted mother to Bonnie Blue. On another he compares the heartless Scarlett unfavorably to Belle Watling another hardheaded businesswoman but one whose ancient profession is considerably less threatening. Ultimately Rhett attempts to assert his masculine power by an act of sexual aggression for which he would today be subject to domestic rape charges. Amazingly given the era in which the film was made nothing works for long. Scarlett is indomitable and irrepressible. Unlike other '30s heroines Scarlett is NEVER reduced to a subordinate role. In the end Tara and the screen are hers and hers alone.Another thing that struck me in my latest viewing of Gone with the Wind was how much its creators particularly David O. Selznick strove to temper the racist content of the story materials. Of course they were unsuccessful from today's perspective but when the film is compared to Birth of a Nation the original film epic of the South's secession and destruction one can clearly see its progressive designs. First of all glorification of the South's rebellion is tempered from the outset by the dissenting voices of such otherwise dissimilar characters as Rhett and Ashley both of whom foresee that the South has written its own ticket to destruction by entering into a war it cannot possibly win and for an historically dubious cause. Notably the two central male characters view slavery askance. Rhett is never a slaveholding gentleman. And Ashley who is the scion of slaveholders reveals plans to free the Wilkes slaves upon the death of his father. Moreover the slaves on the Tara plantation while still subject to stereotypical treatment are far more prominent and rounded as characters than in any previous American film intended principally for white audiences. This is particularly true of sagelike Mammy of course but not only of her.The stark differences between the MitchellSelznick version of Civil War history and D.W. Griffith's can be seen most clearly in the postwar Reconstruction period. In Gone with the Wind the really ugly stereotypes of empowered blacks are absent with the negative focus centering instead on white carpetbaggers. Even the threats to Scarlett's Southern Womanhood come not from renegade blacks but first from a white Northern deserter and later from white scalawags in Shantytown a locale that Scarlett intrepidly if foolishly ventures through. From this latter threat she is pointedly rescued not by chivalrous whites but by her former slave Sam who beats off the wouldbe rapists and drives Scarlett safely home. What a far cry this is from Birth of a Nation where Little Sister throws herself from a cliff rather than be raped by a former slave who has stalked her through perilous woods.Above all Gone with the Wind deliberately avoids all mention of the Ku Klux Klan the terminally embarrassing heroes of Birth of a Nation. The only scene that comes close to a Klan allusion occurs following the attempted assault on Scarlett when Ashley Dr. Meade and thenhusband Mr. Kennedy set about clandestinely to clean out the scalawags. Yet even then their targets are not primarily black nor do the avengers don robes. The audience is not even permitted to witness the attack  only Ashley's wounds from it.If Americans in the 21st century can still respond to Gone With the Wind  and clearly they can  it is not only because of its grand pictorial displays and epic action but because in terms of gender and race this classic of Hollywood's 1939 peak year looks forward to a modern tomorrow as much as if not more than it laments a tragically flawed American past.".

The director leaves out onehalf of the book. Yet he produces a wonderful classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Carol Reed and James Mason...it's Odd Man Out isn't it? Wrong! Reed and Mason also teamed up for the rarelyseen relatively inferior yet quite valuable The Man Between six years later. While the film is nowhere near the masterpiece that Odd Man Out is it has a number of redeeming virtues and is a mustsee for James Mason fans.Reed again focused his plot on his events that occur in city in turmoil. Last time it was Belfast and Vienna The Third Man. Now it's postwar Berlin and Germany divided into two. Reed liked these atmospheric shadowy morally bleak settings they become almost a character in the film and the physical the EastWest divide in Berlin the zones of Austria and emotional the attitudes of the citizens of Belfastbarriers that engulf and separate people.The Man Between was filmed in both Berlin and London as Odd Man Out was also in Belfast and London and The Third Man in Vienna and England. Yet it doesn't have the visual pull of the other two films perhaps because Robert Krasker is missing but probably more so due to a smaller budget. The photography is nowhere near as inspired as in the other two films and the filming in the first half of The Man Between is rather flat and ordinary. Once we get to the loveontherun scenes however it picks up markedly and we start getting the trademark Reed camera tilts shadowy streets and inspired visual flair.Claire Bloom that lovely intelligent graceful and ethereal actress gives a wonderful performance as Sussan Mallison a young English girl who travels to Berlin to visit her brother and his wife Bettina the excellent German actress Hildegaarde Neff looking strikingly like Ginger Rogers!. The film is really about Susan's personal journey as she goes from seeing things in blackandwhite at the beginning of the film to falling in love with Ivo Kern James Mason a criminal.Ivo Kern immediately draws comparisons to Harry Lime in The Third Man and many have referred to Mason's performance and the overall film as a pale imitation of the earlier film and a desperate attempt by Reed to repeat the success of The Third Man. Well I have to disagree. Of course Reed wanted to make another film as successful but he doesn't tell the same story in this film no. The narrative is much more focused around the romance between Sussan and Ivo whereas Lime is callous in his treatment of Anna Valli telling Holly Martin to be good to Anna you'll find that she's worth it. He only really sees her as a person that he can use Kern wants to protect Sussan. And Kern even though he is delved into postwar crime activities still maintains his moral core...he seems tired an unwilling accomplice in the attempt to get hold of Kestner.Perhaps the film falters in that's it's themes and concerns are not as powerful as Odd Man Out or The Third Man Reed seems to be lacking inspiration at times here. But the performances are excellent Mason and Bloom are a joy to watch.Apparently Mason fell deeply in love with the young actress at the time of filming. And the chemistry shows. They seem so intuitive together in their actingits the quiet moments the glances and the touch of a hand that almost give it away. They only kiss once but it's still probably Mason's hottest screen kiss. It is lovely to watch these two work together and so poignant when you know about the offscreen stuff to watch their final scenes together Will we ever meet again Ivo?.Perhaps the film's main flaw is that the first half is much too plotdriven you really have to pay close attention to the film to know what is going on with the Kestner plot otherwise you'll be confused the heavily accented English from the German actors makes it even harder though Neff is a clear and wonderful speaker. Mason too affects a German accent similar to what he did with Rommel in The Desert Rats he sounds a lot like one of my Uni lecturers who is German so he must have been doing something right.See it for the wonderful Mason and Bloom performances chemistry and their scenes together. It's a good little film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This taut film noir when compared to Carol Reed's masterpieces of that genre Odd Man Out and The Third Man is a flawed gem but still that  a gem.Filmed in Berlin just eight years after WWII ended and eight years before the Wall went up it stars James Mason and Claire Bloom as starcrossed lovers in a city still digging itself out of the rubble made by Allied bombs and still taking refugees from the east of Europe. The story tells of Susanne Mallison a young Englishwoman who has arrived in Berlin to visit her older brother Martin an army physician in the British sector of the city and his German wife Bettina. It is while Susanne and Bettina are spending a day in the eastern sector that Bettina finds herself reluctantly introducing Susanne to an old friend the suave and handsome Ivo Kern. Susanne doesn't like Ivo at first the audience isn't supposed to either  and she immediately becomes suspicious that he and Bettina are having a clandestine affair. She is curious though about the man but will she learn the truth about Ivo and his mysterious background? Meanwhile off the set of the film there was more going on behind the scenes between the two stars. From the book 'James Mason  A Personal Biography' by Mason's former sisterinlaw and life long friend Diana de Rosso I was to observe another side of his character rarely disclosed when he came to London to finish filming The Man Between. He was a frequent visitor to our London home and he began to bring with him increasingly his ethereally lovely costar Claire Bloom...He showed a marked interest in the young actress. There was a quality about her a stillness and tranquillity which set her apart from most artists her age yet she had a pointed wit and a fine intelligence virtues which appealed to James  and it was quite apparent that he was in danger of losing his heart. In truth I believe his heart was lost...His attachment to Claire was purely romantic. They used to sit on the floor together in our house hand in hand plainly adoring each other...But as with Ivo and Susanne it was the same with James and Claire. Mason did not divorce his estranged wife Pamela Kellino and de Rosso was surprised that he didn't but she has some theories. When he finally did get his divorce a few years later Claire had moved on to other things in her career and private life. Still when they met again several years later it was clear that Mason still was very fond of her and she likewise.When I first saw this film I questioned whether Mason's German accent was very good but when I lent it to a pair of friends who are German they said that he did a good job. As for the German supporting cast it is the best especially the lovely Hildegard Neff and the hauntingly beautiful musical score catches the bleak feeling of the city during a cold winter. They are also reasons I list this as one of my favourite film noir productions.".

	onyx:emotionText "This taut film noir when compared to Carol Reed's masterpieces of that genre Odd Man Out and The Third Man is a flawed gem but still that  a gem.Filmed in Berlin just eight years after WWII ended and eight years before the Wall went up it stars James Mason and Claire Bloom as starcrossed lovers in a city still digging itself out of the rubble made by Allied bombs and still taking refugees from the east of Europe. The story tells of Susanne Mallison a young Englishwoman who has arrived in Berlin to visit her older brother Martin an army physician in the British sector of the city and his German wife Bettina. It is while Susanne and Bettina are spending a day in the eastern sector that Bettina finds herself reluctantly introducing Susanne to an old friend the suave and handsome Ivo Kern. Susanne doesn't like Ivo at first the audience isn't supposed to either  and she immediately becomes suspicious that he and Bettina are having a clandestine affair. She is curious though about the man but will she learn the truth about Ivo and his mysterious background? Meanwhile off the set of the film there was more going on behind the scenes between the two stars.

Carol Reed cleverly disguises his picture with post war intrigue and ambiguous alliances  conspiracies in the first half but this is ultimately at its heart the story of an impossible romance attempted at an impossible time. While it takes a good half of the movie to get to the real plot once it cooks it sizzles. The extended chase sequence in the last third of the movie probably tops the far more famous THE THIRD MAN though it is a little less frantic and far more deliberately cat and mouse.All of the cast is excellent including the fetching and intriguing blonde wife the mysterious young bicyclist and the rotund scheming elder German kidnapper. Leads James Mason and Claire Bloom never prettier or sexier have amazing chemistry as the picture develops and one really wishes they had gotten together an hour earlier because this is the heart of the matter and the meat of the movie.Another major star of this movie is the location photography. The light and shadows draped on the characters flitting in and out of the jagged yet beautiful exoskeletel ruins and debris of the onceglorious cosmopolitan city of Berlin are hypnotic and amazing. The cinematography is remarkable there is great POV work of the snowcovered kidnap vehicle stalking Bloom but even better camera angles and lighting creativity in the bravura chase in the last 20 minutes shockingly good given this film's relative anonymity. This isn't THE THIRD MAN or ODD MAN OUT but it contains most of the best elements of each movie plus a better romance than either of those. Interesting that Claire Bloom is forced to watch helplessly as James Mason is shot down at the end of MAN BETWEEN. Only about eight years later she would share the same fate at a similar location on the Berlin border in the searing THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. A heartbreaking must for fans of postwar noir Mason or Bloom.".

It's their relationship in the second half of the story that heats up some of the cold war atmosphere of the tale.Suspense mounts as they hide out from the German authorities but all the while one gets the feeling that all will not end well for the illfated pair who have fallen deeply in love.If you liked the somber atmosphere of films like ODD MAN OUT and THE THIRD MAN you'll definitely enjoy the atmospheric effects achieved in the crisp BW photography on display here. Outstanding photography in scene after scene although the story itself never quite achieves the same degree of finesse as the previously mentioned Carol Reed films.Nevertheless it's all extremely well acted. Mason has never been more effective as a complex man full of moral ambiguities and Bloom is given a wonderful chance to display her charm and sensitivity in a wellwritten role.Definitely worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the release of his masterpiece 'The Third Man 1949' a refreshinglyoffbeat amalgam of British noir and Ealingstyle whimsy director Carol Reed was heralded as one of the era's most promising filmmakers. Critical admirers anxiously awaited his followup effort which was four years coming. Today the consensus appears to regard 'The Man Between 1953' as little but a pale imitation of 'The Third Man.' Certainly the two films share similar scenarios both involving a foreigner's espionagetinged visit to a wartorn city Vienna and Berlin respectively that has been divided by opposing powers. However despite lacking Graham Greene's wry sense of humour and particularly the boyish charisma of Orson Welles Reed's followup picture is nonetheless an excellent drama blending romance and tragedy with the director's usual flair for generating atmosphere and international intrigue. The fine chemistry between stars James Mason and Claire Bloom finds a life of its own amid the rubblestrewn ruins of a city still at war with itself.Young British woman Susanne Mallison Claire Bloom whom Chaplin had discovered the previous year for 'Limelight 1952' arrives in Berlin to visit her brother Geoffrey Toone who has married Germanborn Bettina Hildegard Knef. Through her sisterinlaw Susanne is introduced to the enigmatic Ivo Kern James Mason a professional kidnapper with ambiguous allegiances towards both the Eastern and Western powers. Screenwriter Harry Kurnitz had a talent for illustrating characters with hidden motives and concealed secrets see 'Witness for the Prosecution 1957' 'The Web 1947' or either of his 'Thin Man' features and his screenplay spends its first half ominously exploring the intentions of Bettina whose association with Ivo implicitly suggests a family betrayal. Interestingly the character is effectively abandoned in the film's second half but to the film's advantage as Susanne and Ivo are relentlessly hunted in the Eastern Bloc following a botched kidnapping. Here Reed narrows his dramatic focus but the doomed romance between Bloom's young idealist and Mason's warweary criminal remains appropriately understated inspiring empathy without stooping to melodrama.Despite the absence of Robert Krasker 'The Man Between' is a beautifully shot film with directorofphotography Desmond Dickinson capturing not only the atmosphere but the foreboding personality of the crumbling German capital. John Addison's musical score is haunting and graceful certainly a far cry from Anton Karas' zither but nonetheless effective in its own right. One thing I've noticed about every Carol Reed film I've seen and the tally currently sits at seven is that all the performances are perfect  not only the main and supporting stars but everybody down to the briefest of speaking roles. James Mason sports a convincing German accent and Claire Bloom is simply adorable in her naive innocence with a smile that will melt your heart. A particularly important character is young Horst Dieter Krause whose love Ivo instinctively rejects for such a criminal can never allow himself to form attachments to those he must inevitably abandon. Ultimately and tragically it is Horst's devotion that results in Ivo's death the final proof that love and death are never far apart.".

However the camera work in THE THIRD MAN was more daring and novel and the Berlin took far worse damage during the warand the sheer volume of rubble in 1953 is still very significant and adds to the atmosphere.Overall while not a great spy film it is very good and keeps your interest. I would say overall that the second half is a bit more exciting than the first.

It isn't long before she suspects Bettina Hildergard Neff her sister in law of some type of deception. When she meets the mysterious Ivo Kern she is drawn into the action further conflicted by the fact he is an extortionist and she is romantically drawn to him.Reed does a good job of keeping the audience in the dark for a good deal of the film with Mason and Neff both convincingly ambiguous and Bloom as innocent and confused as Holly Martins. The devastated Berlin backdrop with the ubiquitous visage of Stalin in the Eastern sector provide grim atmospherics with cinematographer Dietrich Dikisson ably filling in for Reed regular DP Robert Krasker.The editing which is a touch sloppy occasionally bogs the story down and the music score at times can be torturous to listen to but Mason's tragic turn as the cornered Kern never allows the film to fall into bathos for too long. He is the German version of the angry young man that would permeate film throughout the fifties and into the sixties and as The Man Between he is an eloquent spokesman in conveying the devastating disappointment of a generation betrayed by its government.".

	schema:reviewBody "A drama involving political intrigue smuggling and general malfeasance in the Eastern and Western Zones of Berlin. James Mason is the smooth operator who smuggles such commodities as meat from the West into the needy Stalinist East. Claire Bloom is the innocent who is visiting her brother Geoffrey Toone a British army officer and his wife Hildegarde Knef who was once married to Mason.In order to trap a Western operative the villains extraordinarily extradite Claire Bloom and hole her up in an East Berlin dump. She is rescued by Mason for selfish reasons. He's trying to flee to the West himself with a good deed on his record so that when he surrenders to the police they'll go easier on him. Mason and Bloom are pursued in a suspenseful chase through the Eastern Zone. By this time Bloom has fallen for Mason despite his warnings about his own character and deeds and they wind up spending the night together. The next day they make a break for the border. Bloom makes it. In an act of self sacrifice Mason does not.The first thing I thought of after missing the credits was that the writers and director had surely seen The Third Man and learned from it. The plot is similar. And the director tilts his camera at the same angles and at the same times as in the original and there are close ups of suspicious faces observing events out of the sides of their eyes. It was therefore no surprise to find that Carol Reed had directed both films.The location shooting is just fine as is the photography by Desmond Dickenson. Midwinter in a starving and rubblestrewn East Berlin. Everything burdened with a heavy snow blanket except the streets that are glazed with ice. Brrr.It's a good movie. The characters are well written. We're on one side rather than the other but the principal character is properly ambiguous. A plot for grown ups. Mason looks the part but he's simply not very good at a German accent. He was an embarrassment in another film as Irwin Rommel. And his death struck me as melodramatic. Claire Bloom in only her fourth movie does splendidly as the naive but righteous English girl. She's beautiful too in a classic way. Her smile lights up the screen and makes her piercing black eyes almost disappear for a moment. Hildegarde Knef is equally attractive and just as good an actress but in a very different way. Her appearance as well as her performance suggests a good deal of experience and knowingness.It's not The Third Man though. So few films can clear THAT bar. And Carol Reed entered a slow decline after this for some reason winding up with the abysmal The Public Eye in the early 1970s. Yet his talent shows through all the murky shadows on the screen and we find ourselves enjoying a taut and exciting story well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Mason is The Man Between in this 1953 Carol Reed film shot on location in postwar Berlin. The film also stars Claire Bloom and Hildegarde Neff. Bloom plays Susanne a young American woman who comes to Berlin to visit her brother Martin. Martin is stationed there and married to Bettina Neff. Bettina is clearly unhappy about something and Susanne soon realizes that her discomfiture has to do with a mysterious man Iwo Mason described as an old friend. When Iwo offers to show her the sights Susanne accepts and believing him to be having an affair with her sisterinlaw advises him to leave her alone. Iwo says he is trying to leave the area and a friend of Martin's can help by getting him the required documents and introductions. When Susanne asks her brother to help Iwo by contacting the man Bettina loses her temper and the truth about Iwo and his true relationship to Bettina emerges.This is an odd moody dark film with some haunting images of the destroyed Berlin and some beautiful shots particularly the very last one in the film which stays in one's memory. The serenely beautiful Claire Bloom and the enigmatic Mason are magic together and make this a poignant love story and very typical Reed  the innocent who has her eyes opened the man tainted by sin going to meet his fate. The whole last half of the film focuses on only the two of them and we sense their isolation an odd couple in a changing world.The German supporting cast is excellent particularly Neff whose career in Hollywood was brief. She wrote a wonderful bestselling autobiography The Gift Horse in 1970 which leaves no doubt of her feelings about the place. She went on to star in Silk Stockings on Broadway and eventually returned to Germany.Quite a beautiful film not up to The Third Man but still has the touch of the master.".

	schema:headline " From Vienna To Berlin";
	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of the international acclaim for The Third Man Carol Reed decided to try and repeat with another story about international intrigue with The Man Between. Though not as good as The Third Man The Man Between can stand on its own merits quite nicely.Taking the place of occupied Vienna is occupied Berlin. The story itself is a more formal cold war espionage story whereas in The Third Man it was about the black market which knows no politics. The innocent who churns thing up is Claire Bloom who is also in Berlin to visit her brother Geoffrey Toone a medical doctor on assignment in the Allied occupied west sector in the British Zone. Toone has a new wife that Bloom's never met in the person of Hildegarde Knef.And Knef's got a mysterious new friend in James Mason someone who has known Knef from before the war. Of course we later find out just how well he knew her as the film progresses.Aspects of two of James Mason's previous successful roles come into play and blend quite nicely for him in The Man Between. He starts out as an international man of mystery no Austin Powers cracks please as he is in 5 Fingers a rather ruthless individual operating in the netherworld between the west and east. Later on he reveals a lot more of himself to Bloom and by the end of the film you're thinking he reminds you of his luckless Irish revolutionary in Odd Man Out.

What their politics were who of us could tell unless we'd made a serious study of the subject. I've often wondered myself what rated the blacklisting an Emil Jannings got as opposed to a lot of others who did appear in Nazi propaganda films. Look at the cast credits of both Ernst Schroeder who plays a western sympathizing agent and Aribert Wascher who's a gangster operating in the Eastern Zone for the Russians. Look at their credits both appeared in propaganda films. Both also give good performances in The Man Between.Even the occupied Eastern Zone has been considerably built up since the reunification of Germany. The Man Between is a fine Cold War drama and it gives one a chance to look at the devastation of Berlin post World War II which hopefully will never happen again.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the wake of the international acclaim for The Third Man Carol Reed decided to try and repeat with another story about international intrigue with The Man Between. Though not as good as The Third Man The Man Between can stand on its own merits quite nicely.Taking the place of occupied Vienna is occupied Berlin. The story itself is a more formal cold war espionage story whereas in The Third Man it was about the black market which knows no politics. The innocent who churns thing up is Claire Bloom who is also in Berlin to visit her brother Geoffrey Toone a medical doctor on assignment in the Allied occupied west sector in the British Zone. Toone has a new wife that Bloom's never met in the person of Hildegarde Knef.And Knef's got a mysterious new friend in James Mason someone who has known Knef from before the war. Of course we later find out just how well he knew her as the film progresses.Aspects of two of James Mason's previous successful roles come into play and blend quite nicely for him in The Man Between. He starts out as an international man of mystery no Austin Powers cracks please as he is in 5 Fingers a rather ruthless individual operating in the netherworld between the west and east. Later on he reveals a lot more of himself to Bloom and by the end of the film you're thinking he reminds you of his luckless Irish revolutionary in Odd Man Out. The transition is accomplished smoothly under Carol Reed's direction.The rest of the cast is mostly made up of German players who were active in the cinema during the Nazi days. What their politics were who of us could tell unless we'd made a serious study of the subject.

	schema:headline " A Distinguished British Film Noir";
	schema:reviewBody "Some purists would insist that film noir is a uniquely American genre but in my view the term is equally appropriate to describe a number of British crime and espionage dramas and indeed some continental European ones such as Clouzot's Les Diaboliques. Among the leading British directors who made what can be regarded as films noirs were Robert Hamer director of It Always Rains on Sunday and The Long Memory and Carol Reed whose work in the genre included Odd Man Out The Third Man and The Man Between. It is noteworthy that all three of those films contain the word man in the title because noir tended to be a maledominated genre. There were occasional exceptions such as Double Indemnity in which a female character takes on equal prominence with the male lead but the general pattern is for a single male character to be at the centre of the film with the female ones and subsidiary male ones defined in terms of their relationship to him. I think that this pattern holds good in The Man Between although Claire Bloom's character Suzanne Mallison may have more screen time it is Ivo Kern the man between himself who is the real focus of the story.Like The Third Man the action takes place in a postwar European capital in this case Berlin rather than Vienna. During the Cold War Berlin the divided city was to become a standard setting for any thriller with an espionage theme The Man Between reminded me of another great British noir with an East Berlin setting The Spy who Came in from the Cold Bloom also appeared in that film. Suzanne files into the city from London to visit her older brother Martin a doctor with the British Army Medical Corps and his German wife Bettina. She meets Kern a rather mysterious acquaintance of Bettina who now appears to be working for the East German authorities. Despite Bettina's warning that Kern is not to be trusted the nave young Suzanne finds herself becoming attracted to him and allows herself to be caught up in his dubious activities as a result she is kidnapped and smuggled into East Berlin leading to a tense finale in which she and Kern have to escape back to the West. In the early fifties before the building of the Berlin Wall the EastWest frontier was rather more porous than it was to become in the sixties and seventies but crossing it was still difficult for anyone who had aroused suspicion or fallen foul of the authorities. A common noir characteristic was an air of moral doubt and uncertainty and this is certainly present in The Man Between. Politically the distinctions are clearcut East Germany is an oppressive Big Brother style police state dominated by ubiquitous huge portraits of Stalin and Ulbricht and those Germans who oppose the Communist system are shown in a heroic light such as Olaf Kestner a West Berliner who helps refugees escape from the East. Kern makes use of Suzanne in a failed attempt to arrest Kestner. The moral ambiguity comes in the portrayal of Kern himself who is not simply shown as a villain. Kern was formerly an idealistic young lawyer who wished to defend the innocent and the 'rights of man'. His idealism however was shattered by the rise of Nazism and by his witnessing and even being forced to participate in Nazi atrocities. His faith in human nature gone he turned to crime and became an associate of the East German secret service although he has no belief in Communist ideology. He is however still capable of remorse both for his past and for his present actions and wishes to return to the West where he hopes to atone for his criminal past. He is a complex tormented figure and James Mason here gives one of his finest performances bringing out the various sides of Kern's nature. Bloom in only her second film after Limelight looks radiant as Suzanne and Hildegard Knef is good as Bettina a woman who may also have guilty secrets in her past. Knef was herself German as indeed were all those actors playing German characters with the exception of Mason. This was the second film in 1953 in which Mason played a German the first had been The Desert Rats in which he played General Rommel. American noirs were often marked by dramatic blackandwhite photography and The Man Between follows this tradition with some striking shots of the snowcovered warruined city. I would not rate this film quite as highly as The Third Man one of the greatest British films of the immediate postwar period but it is certainly a distinguished effort. More than a mere thriller it also asks some pertinent questions about human nature and gives us a memorable psychological portrait of a man haunted by guilt. 810A goof. Kern declares his belief in trial by jury implying that it had been abolished by the Nazis. In fact jury trial had been a feature of the legal system of Wilhelmine Germany but was abolished under the Weimar Republic in 1924 nearly a decade before the Nazis came to power and has never been restored by any German government since except for a brief period in Bavaria. It is a common AngloSaxon view that jury trial is an essential feature of democracy but this opinion is not always shared by Continental Europeans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man Between has been unfavorably compared with Carol Reed's earlier masterpieces like Odd Man Out and The Third Man which is an injustice because this is an entirely different story and much more romantic at that. Of course in this gloomy film of Stalinist oppression and commie commissar thugs in Berlin under the snow in the dreariness of a harrowed world capital of which nothing remains but a mutilated ghost cleft in twain you miss certain more picturesque atmospheres of Ireland and Vienna and there is no comedy here although James Mason has a few dry and bitter laughs. His personification of what once was a man before the war turned into an abyss of cynical resignation is up to his best standards as an actor and he is excellently partnered by the lovely Claire Bloom who later returned to a similar playacting in Berlin in Martin Ritt's hauntingly sinister The Spy Who Came in from the Cold twelve years later which borrowed much of the moods in this film. What's especially haunting here is John Addison's spooky music dominated by a single saxophone constantly repeating the same wailing fragment of a tune which adds a certain metaphysical interest to this film lacking in Carol Reed's earlier ones. The flight among the ruins and the skeleton of the macabre building construction adds to the nightmarish mood of alienation in an hostilely inhuman world going futuristic in an 1984 manner  the constantly repeated threatening giant posters of Stalin everywhere in East Berlin stresses this point and adds to the helplessness of disoriented man. I saw this film now for the third time since 1971 and each time I have found it more interesting. There are some flaws in the script not everything is clear and especially in the beginning the audience is thrown into total confusion until Hildegard Knef at last answers some questions. Her part is perhaps the most vital to the story she has been married to a wonderful man lost in the war who suddenly reappears as a ghost from the ruins after the world when she has found a new happy marriage which unwelcome revisit from the past turns her life upside down. Of course Claire Bloom is also confused by her upset condition. The intrigue is humanly very complicated but the more interesting for its infected labyrinths which is one of the reasons why it will always be worth while seeing this film once again.".

Given James Mason's wonderful and heartwrenching performance and the young and naive Claire Bloom's great love for his character Ivo Kern the film had a great recipe for success  To all of these wonderful elements I have to mention the wonderful talents of Carol Reed's superb filmmaking. The viewer is willingly drawn into each and every scene of the film. The soulstirring music intertwined with the recreation of the principals watching opera at leisure is soon found to be more deceptive than it appears to be.The young and lovely Susanne Bloom who is very naive arrives in wartorn Berlin to visit her brother Martin Toome who is in the Military and his lovely wife Bettina Neff. From the very start Susanne begins to have a concern that her sisterinlaw's appearance of anguish and worry may be an indication of her having a dangerous affair. The beautiful Bettina appears to be sorrowing in secret and there is a boy of 11 or 12 who cycles back and forth from the airport to Martin and Bettina's home. In the background we hear soulstirring music. Later the music is intertwined with opera music but the tension level increases as it is soon evident that wartorn Berlin is enshrouded with danger.Susanne meets Ivo Kern who is soon revealed to have been Bettina's husband originally. He had been incorrectly reported dead hence Martin's marriage to Bettina. Susanne begins to suspect that Ivo was Bettina's source of worry. Ivo had been a blackmarket lawyer and was planning to reform in recent years. When Ivo invites Susanne to go skating Bettina appears concerned. This could be rightfully so for some dangerous former or newly acquired alliances could prove perilous to him and his family and friends.Susanne and Bettina along with her brother Martin are drawn into a plot which endangers Bettina and Ivo. Susanne's naivet may be a an endangerment to the principals which also worries the young boy on the bicycle. In his cycles back and forth he gathers information for which Ivo pays him. However The boy is soon worried about his good friend Ivo which is evident by his constant cycling back and forth.We soon find that Susanne makes an irretrievable error along the way.The plot thickens when Susanne is mistaken for Bettina and is kidnapped. In helping to rescue Susanne Ivo finds himself falling in love with her. Susanne returns his affection but worries about new and frightening developments.... She had formerly mistrusted her new friend but was now fearful for his safety.As the story builds to a perilous denouement every scene is important every character's actions adds to the heartstopping suspense. To avoid a Spoiler approaching I will stop here.My assessment of the story is an even 10 for cast content etc. Under Carol Reed's skillful direction the story is unforgettable.".

He now owns most of the town of Jericho and has hired a band of gunmen to enforce his edicts. Outside of town Martin ambushes a stagecoach that is carrying a passenger exmarshal George Peppard. From a hidden spot in the brush Martin shoots up the coach and rides away. Arriving in town Peppard meets Jean Simmons who has refused Martin's attempts to take over operation of her stage line. After a few days Peppard becomes attracted to Simmons but he sees that the odds against them are too great and is on the verge of leaving town. But after Martin physically roughs up Simmons Peppard organizes the few men in town who are willing to put up a fight and attacks enterprises that are owned by Martin. Finally in a showdown Martin and Peppard battle it out ironically in the same spot that Martin originally ambushed the stagecoach.";

This doesn't sit well with Dino he and Simmons have had their moments in the past.It's a good adult western with lots of action to satisfy everyone. One of the most brutal fight scenes in cinema history takes place between Peppard and Slim Pickens who's Martin's chief henchman. More brutal than the one between Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt against Barton MacLane in Treasure of the Sierra Made. More brutal because Pickens meets his demise. The rest of the film is Peppard rallying forces to take the town away from Martin's control. Of course having Jean Simmons to come home to is enough to inspire anyone.Simmons is no longer playing the young girls she played in the 1950s but she gives a good account of herself as the stageline widow. She's always good one of the most underappreciated actresses in movie history.Good adult western worth a view. And if you want to see a modern remake catch the Patrick Swayze film Road House.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a bit unusual seeing Dean Martin play the part of a villain especially having been a regular viewer of his variety show back in the 1960's. I couldn't help thinking that any minute he would enter the Ace Deuce hop up on a piano and start belting out 'That's Amore'. There was at least one similarity to Martin's weekly show with the presence of a gorgeous blonde babe hanging around. No not Jean Simmons but that saloon girl Claire Carol Andreson who if I had to bet would probably have shown up on one of his shows as well.Actually Martin handled the role of a heavy pretty well but I kept wondering if the movie might have been better served with Dino and George Peppard switching roles. The casting of Slim Pickens as Alex Flood's Martin top henchman also seemed to go against the grain. I mean can you picture Andy Devine as a bad guy or Smiley Burnette or Chill Wills or ... well you get the idea. But at least Pickens took the role and ran with it nasty bull whip and all.As for Peppard he becomes the reluctant hero after Flood pushes all the right buttons and especially when he makes the move on Molly Lang's Simmons stagecoach business. Martin's character makes it a point to own fifty one percent of every enterprise in Jericho but you know I kept wondering why he allowed the 4 Aces Saloon to operate in town it didn't seem like Jericho was all that big.Hey can you beat those medical fees back in the 1800's? For fixing up a gunshot wound in old Ben Hickman John McIntire the Doc charges just a dollar! Kind of makes you wonder how much it cost to go to med school. Too bad Hickman didn't make it to the end of the picture I kind of liked his deliberate methodical style.Of course the ending is never in question the fun is in watching how the good guy plan separates Flood's gang of outlaws so they can narrow the odds. The one thing I would have allowed for earlier in the story would be showing Peppard's character and his prowess with a knife. As it is the way Dolan took out Flood made me sit up and ask 'where did that come from'?".

The highlights of the film are the facing off between Peppard and Slim Pickens and the climatic showdown on the ending at the saloon and the town. Phenomenal and great role for Dean Martin as bad guy  he's the whole show. Vivid and lively musical score by Don Costa and atmospheric cinematography by Russell Metty. Watchable results for this offbeat Western.The motion picture is professionally directed by Arnold Laven . Laven formed a production company along with Jules Levy and Arthur Gardner. The first LevyGardnerLaven movie was 1952's Without Warning' in the decades since they have produced and directed dozens of additional features .

Peppard seems out of place while Martin does not come across as ruthless enough to be believable as a villain.But what really hurts the movie is the script. The mix between comic sequences and brutal action do not fit together very well. Also the first half of the movie is almost all talk talk talk and not very interesting talk. And Peppard's character doesn't do anything in that first half to try and change the desperate situation. Things do pick up somewhat in the last part of the second half but it's too little too late.By the way Leonard Maltin's video guide branded this movie as gory but by today's standards it's not very bloody.".

	schema:reviewBody "I basically went into Alien Raiders knowing two things It was for Raw Feed The makers of the classics Rest Stop and. Rest Stop 2 The Revenge of George Michael and it had a horrible title. Seriously visions of SciFi Channel Original Movies danced through my head and not the good kind with Bruce Campbell either. Already I was thinking about just missing it. Get some rest. Save up my energy for some other movies. It's day four after all.But my friend already had tickets for both of us so I figured at the very least if it was boring I could just catch a nap.Well the nap never happened. Alien Raiders rises up above its horrible title and executes a tense and exciting lowbudget actionscifi tale. Proof of this is the fact that out of all the movies I saw Zack and Miri which was great Feast 2 which was... all right couple more... can't think straight right now this is the only one I'm bothering to write a review for. I think it's because since it's a straighttoDVD movie it probably won't get it's fair share of publicity. So allow me to put on my publicity gloves And matching pants.... ahem...The movie is about a small supermarket in Arizona that one night while closing up is over run by a group of armed terrorists. The men claim that they have to check the remaining people mentioning that the king is there and they have to find himherit. Now obviously the title ruins any hope for keeping the movie's twist secret SPOILERthere are aliens that are in need of raidingSPOILER but this movie still does a pretty good job at keeping the viewer engaged and wondering what the hell is going on without ever confusing them.The thing I liked the most about the movie was how it ended up being a few different kind of movies in one. It's a mystery when the cops are trying to unravel the reason for the hostage situation it's an action film The opening shootout is pretty friggin' intense it's a scifi movie Aliens being raided and it's even got a dash of monster movie in there for good measure. The atmosphere of the movie is pretty tense throughout. And the pacing was great as well. The movie's just under 90 minutes and no part of it really lags.Actingwise TV fans are gonna' be pretty happy. The main character is played by Carlos Bernard who we all know and love as Tony F'ing Almeda on 24. The character he's playing here isn't that much different from Tony but it fits the character who as the movie progresses goes from being a quiet and almost creepy presence to being a very sympathetic character. Also good was Rockmond Dunbar CNote from the first two seasons of Prison Break and one of the hit men in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang as the heavy of the group... The guy who is all business and no nonsense... You know the asshole. He could have easily been a onenote character but is given a few instances to add a little flavor to his performances that help flesh the character out a little. There's another character that I don't really want to give anything away but he dies pretty early on and that kind of bummed me out. I would have liked to seen more of him. The rest of the cast did a great job as well with only a few weak points here and there. I got to hand it to firsttime feature director Ben Rock. The dude took a really tiny budget I've heard it was anywhere from 1.53 million and turned out one of the slicker movies I've seen. He and his cinematographer's use of lighting and different styles of shooting really makes this movie rise above their financial limitations. Although it is a shame that towards the end they have to resort to some old tricks Stutterylooking action scenes anyone?. But at least it looks better than Automaton Transfusion which looks like it was shot by a hyperactive kid with a camera strapped to his head while he tried to stand still. Overall this movie was a pleasant surprise. I'd have to give it at least an 8 out of 10. I heard this is going straight to DVD so I definitely say give it a shot when it comes out. Hope you use this review.".

It won't even make cult status.What it will do is entertain you  keep you on the edge of your seat.The premise is simple. A group of independent alien hunters have descended on a small town and specifically a grocery store where they seem to have found the original infection. Do they do the best job securing the location?? No. Do they seem dis organized and nervous?? Yes. But I think that adds to the plot. These are not trained police officers or ex military men. They are regular Joe's that have found something that needs to be stopped. What's most impressive is the way the tension is built throughout the film. You feel the same claustrophobic tension that you get in Splinter and there's a similar feeling to the great Spanish film rec This movie isn't quite as good in quality as those two movies but there's a good mix of what the heck is going on and how is this whole thing going to end.There are very limited special effects in this movie and when used they add to the story they don't take away. There's almost no CGI and that's a good thing. The Sci Fi channel could really learn something about creating movies like this where you have alien invasions without using incredibly cheap and campy CGI just a little make up and some cool camera tricks and hold back the pay off till the last minute. It's an easy formula that's been missing from science fiction films for quite some time. Directors have fallen in love with being able to create big creatures but don't know how to build tension.Now the movie does have plot wholes and relies on some clichs. The one cop that happens to be a hostage negotiator from the big city. The ending isn't as surprising as they want it to be. Still for a direct to DVD movie this is about as good as it gets.It's science fiction so suspend disbelief a bit and imagine how you would react if you were in the characters shoes. It's an enjoyable little trip.".

A film doesn't always need expensive special effects yes sometimes they do blow u away but the use of CGI is getting ridiculous now and a worthy script with good actors and some creative low budget FX can be enough to keep you entertained....if you haven't been brainwashed yet that is. Getting to my point Alien Raiders delivers because you don't expect it too I think they chose the name because of that reason. The name sucks the beginning with the dodgy camcording makes you think 'is this what it's gonna be like' and then wallop you become absorbed in this little gem. It may be because I love alien movies and people's interpretations on the whole alien invasion including what they look like and what power they possess. Yes the film is pretty much all in a supermarket and yes the protectors of the universe do some really stupid things but we're all human. You have to look at Alien Raiders for what it is and appreciate how well it was delivered for it's small budget. The actors did a great job they we're very convincing and the raiders we're relentless throughout which was great. If they think you're an alien well you're in big trouble coz they don't like aliens not one bit. The twist was mildly obvious but still it could only be one of the 5 or 6 hostages so what do you expect. Those that have been hating on this are not fans of indie flicks obviously and probably watch Die Hard 4.0 which I loved by the way and think that if a car doesn't take out a helicopter then it ain't worth watching. I've seen many bad indie horror flicks and thats why this gets positive comments from me. It stands out from the crowd and except for the supermarket setting has no similarities and is not a copy of 'The Mist' which again I loved. Give it a go...if you don't like it....well tough I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alien Raiders has proved that through masterful directions good actings a low budget thriller can still deliver high quality entertainment.The story is simple but interestingly fresh. The editing was skillfully done. The level of suspense was surprisingly high aided with clever cinematography surpassing one's expectation. One could sense that the efforts put into every scene of the film was made so with some kind of rare honesty and genuinity that are so lacking in many of the modern day thrillermovies. Never was there a moment when i feel cheated or wanna say Hey this is cheap.The intensity of this film would also put many of the bigger budget thrillers out there to shame. If u get hold of a copy of this DVD do watch it in dark!Lastly in my humble opinion many of those who were involved in this film are probably going it make bigtime in the not too distant future especially the director.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of former rocket scientists presumably as they worked for jet propulsion laboratories takes over a small town supermarket in order to find and stop the spread of an evil alien menace. Things go a bit off track when their spotter dies and they have to resort to secondary methods in order to determine who is or isn't an alien.There is a message board thread for this film that bears the title Ruined by a Bad Name. I could not agree with this more. I was aware of the film's existence for months and was hesitant to see a film called Alien Raiders because it's frankly a really stupid name. Even when my review copy arrived I was reluctant to give it a fair chance simply because I figured that creative people would be able to find a better name...But judging a book by its cover or a movie by its title can be unfair. And this falls in that category as Alien Raiders really isn't all that bad. It's certainly not great  it went straight to DVD for a reason  but nothing that's going to cause you to go brain dead or regret hanging out with your friends and enjoying some tasty Scotch and beer whilst the film rolls.The special effects were pretty decent and should be highlighted. There were aspects I hated such as the night vision which isn't a shock if you realize how close the director was to The Blair Witch Project. There were aspects I disliked such as the alien thrashing back in forth in strobeovision. But other parts such as the regeneration and the alien makeup were quite good. Not as good as say John Carpenter's The Thing but few films are. We are also treated to the high and low end of acting and character development. We are given two actorscharacters who are polar opposites on the scale of enjoyability. Samantha Streets brings us Whitney the female protagonist. She's an important part of the film and I suspect this may open some doors for Streets. But we also have Rockmund Dunbar as Kane a guntoting loudmouth who plays a very stereotypical angry black man and even pushes it a bit far. He's got no depth at all. I enjoyed Dunbar on Prison Break but if this is the sort of role he's going to choose for movies just stay home.I don't know that this is the sort of film you should run out and see right away. There are other fine options to choose from including Raw Feed's Otis if you haven't seen that yet. Alien Raiders offers a nice body snatcher story and held my attention firmly for its duration so that's a plus. I'm torn  don't go out of your way to avoid it but don't add it to the top of your Netflix queue. This is more of a backup plan.".

The screenplay could have a better development of characters and situation since the identity of the king was very predictable for me but considering the simplicity of the plot associated to the lowbudget the result was a remarkable movie with a great makeup and few special effects that exceeded my best expectations.

The suspense was set up perfectly. Lots of good payoffs but not too bloody and grotesque that it ever felt like a gross out flick. And the real test of a good thriller is always how tired are my arms from the tension?...complete fatigue. I really cannot say enough about this movie.

I agree with previous reviewers that the beginning and set up of the plot is the best thing this movie has to offer. Once the movie gets completely underway it loses a lot of appeal and slowly becomes more and more mediocre. Eventually the movie becomes a total bore and then is ruined by an ending that is super unoriginal and dumb.

One of the few things that annoyed me was the shaky cam when the alien roars it wasn't needed IMO.One could start about lack of CGI but come on it's a low budget movie and they did a good job making it entertaining. I enjoyed it.";

I was disappointed a bit with the way they shot the ending but I guess that's unavoidable these days.I can't help drawing parallels to The Mist  which also takes place in a store. They are both studies in terror and paranoia focusing on the interaction between characters which may or may not be representative for larger segments of the population.Watch this film if you have a spare 90 minutes  you won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alien Raiders a lowbudget horror flick revolving around paranormal mystery is a key example of the genre's most common faults. Despite starting off in a strong vein building momentum and establishing character the movie doesn't take long to reach a point of stagnancy. The second half which succumbs to the now clich structural devices of having characters be popped off one by one whilst running around the dark belittles what promise is shown in earlier moments. What results from this is a disappointing experience that titillates but never fulfils. Horror diehards may want to give it a shot simply because it does have its fair share of scares and tense atmospheres but for everyone else this is simply a case of too little stretched out for too long a tired exploitation of a strong premise.Taking place during the holiday season Alien Raiders centres around a supermarket which is promptly taken under siege with all people inside as hostages. From here the movie divulges into a series of intriguebuilding scenes which prompt us to believe that this simply isn't a robbery in fact it might just be from out of this world literally speaking. At this point the feature is fluid interesting and engaging not just from its expertly paced structure but through its construction of characters. Sure enough these aren't the most compelling of personalities to spend ninety minutes with but they at least show promise of going somewhere. Disappointingly however it isn't long before we realise that no this really isn't going anywhere at all.The remainder of the movie's runtime is devoted largely to killing off the main cast very slowly. All the while we are given overt hints as to special plot twists and turns to come later on not only are they made too obvious to the point that when they happen we feel underwhelmed but the twists themselves are largely inconsequential. So what the movie essentially boils down to during its middle and later acts is a lazy excuse for delivering drawnout scares. Granted there are moments when Alien Raiders achieves a real sense of foreboding atmosphere and horror but such moments are so far and few between long inane dialogue scenes that they irrevocably lose much of their visceral impact. A contrasting of the movie's opening shots and those that end it reveal obvious differences in tension and pacing Alien Raiders is a movie that relies on its audience members being confused so when things begin unravel a distinct lack of development from there on in hurts its ability to grasp the attention of the viewer.Aesthetically speaking however the feature is remarkably solid for such a small production. Performances from the main cast are strong even if their characters are too often found spouting clich lines from the book of scares and thrills 101. Visual effects and production values too are impressive in their concise simplicity that do well not to draw attention to themselves. In this sense Alien Raiders often reminded me of this year's similarly shot and located Stephen King adaptation The Mist combining simple photography and effects with interesting ideas and passable performances. Yet burdened with the fact that a lot of the characters inevitably meet their demise in untimely fashions a distinct lack of interesting qualities outside of its aesthetics too often means that such elements go to waste.By the time you inevitably reach the end of Alien Raiders that is if you indeed make it that far you will no doubt be left with a sour and bitter aftertaste. Despite starting off on extremely good footing the movie deteriorates into a sloppy mess wasting characters performers and a solid premise in favour of trying to be like every other Hollywood horror out there. Rather fittingly the movie's final note is one of bewildering inconsequentiality it's one of those twists that are more or less pointed out fifteen minutes into the movie and then restated every other ten the only mystery then is guessing just when in the third act the proverbial carpet will be pulled. If there's any reason to put yourself through the experience it's simply to see the promise that those involved so obviously have. Perhaps with a little more focus and development a project such as this could have been made into something of much greater value but this sadly isn't the case. In conclusion I must reiterate that Alien Raiders isn't a horrible movie it's just a really disappointing one.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say about Alien Raiders? It had a decent premise with a near guarantee of a cult classic but I wound up finishing this movie with very little understanding of it. In other words there was much information on the explanation of these Alien Raiders yet I got very little out of it. With a rather strong introduction it started out with a group of individuals that I can't really classify them as either scientists or criminals or a part of some secret organization. The confusing lack of explanation of our protagonists was rather intriguing since I anticipated disclosure of who they are and their actual intentions. They started the movie by this group shooting random individuals in a grocery store. Their group is led by a semi handsome boss with the help of this supposed seer who can determine whether or not an individual is an alien infested monster. Their explanation is that there is an alien infestation that was sourced at this particular grocery store and they were sent to search and eliminate the king of this alien race. This part confused me. The alien race seems to buy groceries and call police for help and also cry and drink alcohol. They seemed to be minding their own business. I went through this movie almost feeling sorry for the aliens disguised as human beings and that they started mutating and killing in self defense. We go through this movie not seeing any indication on HOW the aliens infect the human population it remains completely up to speculation. So HOW hostile are they really? Okay so one of them kills a few people and thats because he's been shot for defending himself. I think it would have worked if the build up actually paid off with a better climax in the movie maybe have these aliens much more menacing than they were actually portrayed here.The police are clichd as incompetent as always in film and all they do in Alien Raiders is negotiate for hostages with this semiterrorist group. They wait until the main character is fighting with the main monster until they charge in and start firing bullets. Another part that bothered me is why do they take soooo long in establishing who is an alien and who isn't even without their seer around? This was probably the most drawn out sequence for such a short film. They should have just hastily cut off all their hostages' pinkies and leave them locked in that cage they were in. They also forget to check one certain individual who wound up being the king alien in the end and I saw that one coming a mile away.The special effects and the gore scenes are good but they are few and far between. I've probably picked the story apart to the point of disliking it. The truth is the movie had potential and it wasn't a complete flop. Alien Raiders has no bearing on the cult classic Feast and it tried to be a smarter movie than it actually was. With a total of an 80 minute run time there could have been more to it. I wanted more alien raiders than human disguises in which I only saw a total of two mutated monsters well more like one and a half if you count the protrusion from that women's chest. The monsters weren't overall as menacing as I wanted them to be.I don't recommend this movie though I give it some credit for a strong intro. If this is not a good description of my opinion of this movie well I can only comment as much as Alien Raiders gives me.".

It gave the movie another plus.This movie does not let you fall asleep in fact you are every second on your guards staying alert watching everything that could happen. You never get bored you really are IN the movie. The actors play well we really believe in the story. The only negative point is that I guessed the end of the movie at about 12 or 23. But hey that's not that terrible and that could have ended differently...Like someone said earlier there is one of the characters we would have loved to see much more of and you will easily guess who by...

	schema:reviewBody "After reading some of the other folks' reviews its interesting to consider Alien Raiders objectively.If this had been the product of one of the teams in my university Screen Production course it would probably have got a high distinction because at uni there isn't any real money to speak of other than the provision of equipment. Students write their own scripts and in effect do everything with what's available.But Alien Raiders WAS a professionally made movie. Therefore we the viewers seem to automatically expect a professional product  but why is that? This movie was made for DVD on a very limited budget.Bigname stars aren't available on very small budgets. The best highdefinition equipment ain't cheap and so we get what we get from limitedbudget movies don't we?But does that mean we should get all supercritical of them? After watching this film I think not.I will say that the opening sequences of handheld camcorderquality shots almost made me stop the player right there and I guess if the drink I was busy slurping at the time hadn't been occupying me a bit I may well have. I'm SO glad that I didn't! This movie is gripping. It's FUN too! It's even almost believable if you are one of those people who wonders about extraterrestrial life  and if you are then be ready to be scared! It COULD just happen to you next time you go to the supermarket!!!.There have been plenty of alien raider movies through the years  Terminator  Alien  Independence Day  etc. etc. etc. and some of them have been bigbudget bigdirector bigstar productions that blow your socks off have more spent on a couple of the special effects than was spent on this whole movie and get nominated for all sorts of awards. Well this ain't one of those! But does that mean it's automatically rubbish? NO WAY!! My point in writing this review is to tell anyone contemplating spending 85 minutes of their life watching this movie to go right ahead and do it. It's all down to YOUR expectations so expect nothing and you'll enjoy what you get. I really hope that we haven't been totally spoiled by all the superhighdef noexpensespared SFX enormousbudget movies where it seems everyday mundane stuff to write off several dozen latemodel cars andor aircraft etc. to the point where we can't let our imaginations do a bit more of the work. Of course if you aren't into bloodandguts scifi stuff then don't watch it  but did you need me to tell you that?Get past that lousy opening and it's a good hourandahalf's escape from reality.".

	onyx:emotionText "After reading some of the other folks' reviews its interesting to consider Alien Raiders objectively.If this had been the product of one of the teams in my university Screen Production course it would probably have got a high distinction because at uni there isn't any real money to speak of other than the provision of equipment. Students write their own scripts and in effect do everything with what's available.But Alien Raiders WAS a professionally made movie. Therefore we the viewers seem to automatically expect a professional product  but why is that? This movie was made for DVD on a very limited budget.Bigname stars aren't available on very small budgets. The best highdefinition equipment ain't cheap and so we get what we get from limitedbudget movies don't we?But does that mean we should get all supercritical of them? After watching this film I think not.I will say that the opening sequences of handheld camcorderquality shots almost made me stop the player right there and I guess if the drink I was busy slurping at the time hadn't been occupying me a bit I may well have. I'm SO glad that I didn't! This movie is gripping. It's FUN too!

	schema:reviewBody "A Fantastic Fear of Everything is probably not what you're expecting from Simon Pegg. It's not horrifically funny like Sean of the Dead as outright entertaining as Hot Fuzz and mercifully it's not as tepid as Run Fatboy Run or as stagnant as Paul or Burke and Hare. Actually it's not very funny at all to start with.So what is it? Well it's a journey and if you decide to embark upon it you'll need to see it through to the end to decide if it was worthwhile. It begins with an engaging gentle animated title sequence before introducing us to Jack Pegg a flailing children's author engulfed by his research into Victorian murders for a prospective TV series that nobody wants. We quickly discover he has an allconsuming paranoia of being murdered. How do we know this? Because he tells us. And that's when it starts to go downhill.It's a steep decline that director Crispian Mills yes it is but more about him in a minute seems incapable of avoiding. He seems unaware of any filmic devices to portray the protagonist's thoughts and emotions without resorting to plodding turgid exposition and painfully obvious statements. It's part way down this terrible slope that you'll feel the urge to pick up your coat head for the exit and sneak into the screen next door even if it is only Top Cat The Movie.Don't! Stick with it. Somewhere around the halfway point the decline into cinema hell slows stops and gradually heads up to a satisfying peak via some strange and thoroughly enjoyable scenery. For the patient and slightly offkilter it's a very satisfying escapade indeed.At some point you'll discover that it's evolved into a most amusing and very dark trip through a world inhabited by the likes of Tim Burton when on form Wes Anderson Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl. It's a world I feel very comfortable in but doesn't suit every reader of my blog. There's murder in mind paranoia at large and animation sequences akin to Fantastic Mr Fox and The Nightmare Before Christmas on LSD.Castwise there's nothing remarkable on display Pegg is good but ill served by the stodgy first act and Amara Karan as Sangeet occasionally forgets how to act but gives enough to be enjoyable if not memorable. The absolute star of A Fantastic Fear of Everything is Crispian Mills and it has nothing to do with him being son of Hayley grandson of Sir John nephew of Maxwell Caulfield or lead singer of Kula Shaker although it's all interesting trivia.No he's a star because this is his directorial debut. And his first outing as producer. And the first screenplay he's written. As debuts go it's not up there with Duncan Jones' Moon but it's one heck of a start and he's the star because he's dared to be both dark and different at a time when Hollywood is determined to be predictable and repetitively upbeat.A Fantastic Fear of Everything is far from being a perfect movie but it's a solid enthralling film that hints at the possibility of Crispian Mills becoming a very fine filmmaker indeed and a hero of the offkilter cinephiles who are tired of Tim Burton's everdownward spiral and in need of someone new to rely on for their fix of surrealism.".

There's murder in mind paranoia at large and animation sequences akin to Fantastic Mr Fox and The Nightmare Before Christmas on LSD.Castwise there's nothing remarkable on display Pegg is good but ill served by the stodgy first act and Amara Karan as Sangeet occasionally forgets how to act but gives enough to be enjoyable if not memorable. The absolute star of A Fantastic Fear of Everything is Crispian Mills and it has nothing to do with him being son of Hayley grandson of Sir John nephew of Maxwell Caulfield or lead singer of Kula Shaker although it's all interesting trivia.No he's a star because this is his directorial debut. And his first outing as producer. And the first screenplay he's written. As debuts go it's not up there with Duncan Jones' Moon but it's one heck of a start and he's the star because he's dared to be both dark and different at a time when Hollywood is determined to be predictable and repetitively upbeat.A Fantastic Fear of Everything is far from being a perfect movie but it's a solid enthralling film that hints at the possibility of Crispian Mills becoming a very fine filmmaker indeed and a hero of the offkilter cinephiles who are tired of Tim Burton's everdownward spiral and in need of someone new to rely on for their fix of surrealism.";

It's a black comedy with a rather 80's touch that renders the whole atmosphere so mystical and hysterical. The humor is totally black orchestrated with extreme behavioral moods spastic grimaces and unbelievable dream sequences that you'd love to watch over and over again. The character Simon Pegg is playing is a kind of paranoid intelligent looser that is trapped between 2 worlds. The fears and insecurity he has carried over from the past as a kid have reached a point where they've become phobias projecting outwardly in schizophrenic behavior. The character believes or rather is obsessed with the idea that he is going to be murdered. I am not going to say anything more about the plot as it's worth seeing it afresh. This film captures some amazing ingredients of good black comedy films mystical atmosphere soundmusic synchronization with sudden camera moves funny faces extreme smart script dream sequences and spontaneous direction. It's British humor which I personally love with a few deeper meanings behind the whole phobia thing projected from a traumatized subconscious which tries to come to peace with the past. Having read a few other reviews before watching it I must say that I find it sad that people expect American style productions and high budgets in order to like a film. How rare good comedies are these days? I loved the film and if you like black comedy and other Simon Pegg's movies I suppose you'll at least like it since it carries a cinematic seriousness in its humor.".

It was frequently amusing without ever getting to real laughoutloud comedy levels. Silly humour mixed in with quite clever stuff. I'm not sure how it'll go down outside of the U.K. and indeed I felt that it was more suited to a television rather than big screen format. It's the sort of film I think you could really appreciate if you put it on after coming home completely inebriated from the pub although you'd probably have to shave 1015 minutes off the running time in order to stay awake till the end.".

There are some interesting visuals but they don't counteract the boredom and frustration that sets in 15 minutes into the film. Despite the visuals the film feels cheap because large parts of it are just one guy in a room. Avoid.".

	schema:headline " A new genre of comedy is born";
	schema:reviewBody "This immensely original film gives birth to an entire new genre of 'paranoid comedy' which we might call for instance 'cominoia'. The comedy in the film is in many cases hilarious but at the same time there is a sadness a profundity and a fear of loss and abandonment underlying it all. The film features what I daresay may be the finest performance by Simon Pegg in his career to date. As the hero Jack Pegg manages to give the funniest performance of his which I have ever seen but at the same time he combines it with some powerful and effective dramatic acting as well. This is a deeply satisfying combination although the film is often hairraising in its depiction of human neurotic desperation and it touches many raw nerves. It is really a serious film presented as an anarchic farce. It greatly surpasses even Pegg's previous masterpiece SHAUN OF THE DEAD 2004 see my review and it is about time that Pegg had the opportunity to move even higher up the hysteria scale. He has become the contemporary equivalent of Gene Wilder but without Wilder's more annoying mannerisms. I knew Wilder in the 1960s and he was more or less the same offscreen as on and his suppressed hysteria and his mannerisms and his strangely abstracted whimsicality seemed to be always with him. Pegg on the other hand gives a good offscreen impression of normality which might even be genuine for all I know. He seems to have mastered a kind of 'Mr. Nobody' look so that you would tend not to notice him in the street. That is a very good sign for a comedian as it demonstrates that he will not be consumed by his ego which if it happened would ruin his effectiveness. Although you would never know unless someone told you this is a first film by a new director Crispian Mills. He has directed the film with such assurance that you would think he had been doing it for many years. The editing is truly brilliant having clearly been cut and recut and recut almost to perfection. Mills was greatly assisted by his director of photography and camera operator because all of the shots seem to be so perfectly composed that one almost imagines a special adviser at their elbow suggesting the best perspective and framing. And these shots required a lot of thought because so many of them are weird and surrealistic with some extreme closeups at challenging angles. Everything about this film is over the top surreal and bursting with imaginative originality but in a thoroughly controlled manner. The film thus never descends to become a parody of itself. As a technical achievement it rates very high indeed. How all that hysteria managed to be controlled is in itself something of a miracle. To make an effective cominoiac film is not easy. The script of this film was also written by Crispian Mills which proves him to be a screenwriter of the first rank in his very first screen debut. And as if that were not enough he also coproduced the music for the film having at one time been the leader of the pop music group Kula Shaker. The music choices for the various scenes were welljudged. What this film shows on the part of both Mills and Pegg is a sense of balance and control in the midst of a raging hurricane of hysteria like two people walking a circus tightrope during a storm without a tent to cover them. How did they not fall off the rope? That is the mystery of genius at work. The two seem to have melted together into the perfect team. And a great deal of credit must go to the producer Geraldine Patten for letting them get on with it and trusting to her sure instinct that this perilous project would really work. And as if he had not done enough already Mills was also a joint producer. And Simon Pegg was a joint executive producer. This film is one of those handcrafted British sleepers made on a low budget which has the potential to score in a really big way worldwide if properly distributed and marketed. The film contains some sterling performances by others. Clare Higgins is superb as Pegg's agent. Amara Khan a Sri Lankan beauty adds a lot of lustre to the film with a shining screen presence and excellent acting abilities. She was a surprising but inspired casting choice. It should be mentioned that Crispian Mills comes from filmmaking families on both sides and has grown up living and breathing celluloid in between his bouts as a pop star. In homage to his muchloved grandfather Sir John Mills he shot the scenes of Pegg's lunch with his agent in Sir John's favourite London restaurant L'toile in Charlotte Street. In his very first film Mills seems to have shown a higher degree of directing talent even than his own father Roy Boulting. Is it in the genes? It's enough to make you believe in 'the inheritance of acquired characteristics.' As for the story of this film Pegg plays a man suffering from the most extreme fears 'of everything' which as the film progresses and we learn more about him we discover have a very understandable origin and the curious connection they have with a laundry is even explained. It is about midway through the film that we come to realize with a shock that this is really a film with a deeply serious intent dealing with loss and abandonment as its true central motif. The hysteria is a product of the most extreme emotional desperation. The philosopher Henri Bergson in his book LAUGHTER said 'At the root of the comic there is a sort of rigidity which compels its victims to keep strictly to one path ' The high comedy of this film exemplifies that.".

After wasting and hour and half of my life we both agreed that it was one of the worst films we've ever seen. Firstly its not a comedy because comedies contain humour it has no funny lines at all. Secondly much of the first 34 of the film is just Simon pegg getting increasingly paranoid. As we also have the benefit of a voice over explaining what is happening this soon wears thin and the constant repetition of this theme is as though the film is treating the viewer as a witless prat. The only witless prat I could see was whoever wrote this rubbish. The last 14 of the film finally moves outside Simon pegs flat and the twistfinale is so ludicrous that it doesn't bear repeating. Suffice to say that the film descends into something more akin to a horror film. I was left with the impression that the writer got bored and decided to just put down any old rubbish to finish the film off. I have mentioned this theme before that in sports if a player commits a serious offence they can be banned from their sport as a punishment I know its just a crazy thought but I would genuinely like to see the people who made this either get a ban from film making as a punishment or get points on their licence so that if they make another film as bad in the future they then get banned. Awful  awful film.".

Suffice to say that the film descends into something more akin to a horror film. I was left with the impression that the writer got bored and decided to just put down any old rubbish to finish the film off. I have mentioned this theme before that in sports if a player commits a serious offence they can be banned from their sport as a punishment I know its just a crazy thought but I would genuinely like to see the people who made this either get a ban from film making as a punishment or get points on their licence so that if they make another film as bad in the future they then get banned. Awful  awful film.";

	schema:headline " A Mediocre Remake for Our Mediocre Political Times SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS for both the original and the remake This was not a bad movie on its own terms. Good cast stylish direction by Jonathan Demme though now in his trademark style huge closeups of people looking right at the camera some nice suspense. But everything  and I mean everything  that made the original 'Manchurian Candidate' an unforgettable classic has been forcibly removed or revamped into dumbeddown mediocrity for our spedup soundbiteridden politicized times. Part of the problem indeed  is that we can't make a 1962 movie today. We're way in the future now and the quiet rather straightforward simplicity of the original could not be put on the screen today Van Sant tried it with his shotbyshot 'Psycho' and it didn't work.So instead of beginning after a brief prologue with a brilliant creditsequence and David Amram's deeply sad and aching score the new one begins with a herkyjerky burst of loud rock music and a helterskelter barrage of images of war. It's 2004 kids enough of that quiet emotional crap.  From the start the original had emotional resonance via its music and credit portraits of the pensive lead players alone. From the start the new movie has no emotional resonance at all. The biggest shock is how the emotion has been sucked out of the story entirely. In the original when Raymond killed the Senator and his daughter the daughter was Raymond's new wife the woman he deeply loved the only person in the world who might possibly save Raymond from the preprogrammed horror of his life. Raymond's killing of those two people was the turning point of the entire film  and filmed by John Frankenheimer as a dazzling Wellesian cinema sequence with the symbolic wit of the film's dark comedy the milquetoast liberal Senator dies shot through a carton of milk his bleeding heart bleeding the milk of human kindness. All gone now in the remake's bizarre attempt to merge the murder scene with Raymond's great 'jump in the lake' scene from the original. The Senator's daughter who looks oddly like Marilyn Manson barely cares about Raymond anymore. His killing her is of little emotional pain. The karate fight is gone which means the new film is actionfree but something else important is missing In the original Raymond sees his 'houseboy' and doesn't recognize him as the man who betrayed and tortured him. Marco sees the same 'houseboy' recognizes him on sight and launches his furious payback attack.There was a POINT to that. Raymond was weak controllable. Marco was tough his brainwashing didn't take. The contrast of tough Marco and sneering weak Raymond and their bonding as fellow brainwashees was emotional and meaningful. The new Marco and Raymond prove near the end essentially interchangeable. The simply magnificent 'garden party' dream sequences of the original have been removed and replaced with generic herkyjerky mindbend sequences we saw just last week in 'The Bourne Supremacy.' The wonderfully symbolic playing cardsQueen of Diamonds theme has been replaced by the old microchipsplantedinmybrain canard we saw just last month in 'The Stepford Wives.' There is no longer a visual linkage between the Queen of Diamonds and Raymond's mother. The wonderful trigger line 'Why don't you pass the time by playing a nice game of solitare?' has been replaced with a banal 'Sergeant Shaw. Sergeant Raymond Prentice Shaw'  so that when Streep utters the words she had to bark them like some sort of nutcase drill sergeant Lansbury simply offered the chilling invitation to her son. Classic movies bring the right actors together in the right combination. As good as they are none of the four leads here  Washington Streep Schreiber Elise  make the emotional connection that their four forbears made. Streep is the worst indulging her usual tics and selfreferential mannerisms to make Mrs. Shaw a onedimensional political ogre rather than the grand monster that Angela Lansbury was herethe Manchurian Global baddies look at Steep near the end as if thinking 'We hired this idiot politician to front us?' Times being what they are Streep will get an Oscar and mumble speeches like For little old me? I don't deserve this. She doesn't. Washington is a highly skilled actor who captures this version of Marco well  but Sinatra's Marco was a tougher character that karate fight rendered far more sad and soulful in Sinatra's best performance. Sinatra was always a great singer of lost loves and causes  he carried that emotion forward to his work as Marco. Washington can play tough but doesn't really get to here. Washington's fierce intelligence also neutralizes his emotional connection to the story. It's not whether Sinatra or Washington is the better actor both won Oscars its Sinatra's fitting the tale better.Liev Schreiber has it in him to match Laurence Harvey's singular performance in the original so unlovable  and yet so sad a killer beyond his ability to control it but the new script doesn't give Schreiber a chance.And yes Rosie is explained in this movie  as a character we've seen in 100 movies and 1000 TV shows. The mystery is gone. Kimberly Elise is given nothing new to play. And she is not the star  yet  that Janet Leigh was when she played the role. Identification with Leigh right after Psycho was more intense. The ending of the new film mangles the meaning of the original. The switch of assassins requires the elimination of the tragedy of the original and forces a expository epilogue in the modern 'gotta explain it all tradition.And the loss of Joe McCarthy World Communism the Chinese the Russians and the Koreans in favor of gutless Hollywood PC villainy an evil corporation white guys smoking cigars and a South African white scientist is standard issue. We've seen this movie before  and it wasn't 'The Manchurian Candidate.' That the new 'Manchurian Candidate' is worth seeing at all is because the source material is so good they can't totally wreck it and because the star actors are interesting enough even if they never soar where the original took its characters. It's a threestar movie of fourstar plus material and in destroying virtually everything that made the original such a special film and great classic the new 'Manchurian Candidate' deserves a drop of at least another star.".

I had no intention of seeing it but then I happened to catch Demme and Washington on Charlie Rose and Demme put my mind to rest that he was not trying to remake the original picture.  I was still skeptic but I decided to have an open mind and check it out for myself.  I'm glad I did.The only thing this film has in common with the 1964 film is a political background a domineering mother and the brainwashing angle which is done significantly differently here. This film is about what's happening now and it's as gutsy as any film in today's political climate can possibly get. The story is told through the inflamed paranoid POV of a Gulf War veteran who tries to unveil a plot between a corporate hierarchy that's involved in the defense industries and medical technologies among other things and certain politicians who want to stake their influence on a vice presidential nominee.  This 'influence' is achieved through the brainwashing of the nominee as well as several soldiers who had been stationed with him in Kuwait.  Political machinery and defense industries have always been dangerous bedfellows but when the politicians actually have worked in and have personal interests in those industries the motivations of such a partnership can be used to exploit the public in all sorts of ominous ways. This film brilliantly places the sort of paranoia that can derive from such precarious matches as a sign of our times.  Consciously or subconsciously conspiracies are on all of our minds.  Today because there is so much secrecy in the current administration no one knows just how terrible OR innocent these guys might really be. And where there is secrecy there will be conspiracy theories galore.  Paranoia is so commonplace in such a society that it is technically very easy for plots and lies to thrive healthfully. We tell ourselves the government is honest and probably has good reasons to keep secrets from the public so those who see plots and conspiracies must all simply be deluded and paranoid.  Right?  The fact is that politicians can easily lie and the media instead of demanding the truth puts outrageous spins on those lies claiming to present them as 'facts'.  This becomes an almost intolerable static that begins to blot out all meaning.  One of the most ingenious things about this film is in its use of that kind of static.  Throughout much of the film there is a cacophony of radios and TV spewing out their obligatory spins simultaneously as well as the nearly constant sounds of traffic and people talking over one another.  The people in this movie can hear but no one is listening.  There's also a proverbial static between science and technology and the moral questions that remain elusive. The survivors of the brainwashing experiment mentioned above have little chips implanted in their backs that somehow aid the brainwashers.  The chips could be some sort of homing device or perhaps some sort of hormone moderator that's supposed to keep the men in the mental state that makes them more easily susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  Well chips that can serve as homing devices or that can regulate hormones and amino acids such as tryptophan are in the experimental phase today. In other words this isn't wayout science fiction here!Okay I know I'm sounding like I'm paranoid and that I'm saying that everything in this film can and will happen.  Don't worry I know this is just a movie and that the events depicted in it are EXTREMELY unlikely to ever take place.  What I'm focusing on is how well the film takes themes facts and situations that are topical and at least emotionally legitimate and presents them in the context of a whopper of a good thriller.  The film is fresh and audacious and honest in all of its approaches with the one exception of Meryl Streep who seems to think she's in a Bette Davis movie. In the original Manchurian Candidate Angela Lansbury played her role and she was appropriately icy deliberate and almost iconic in the way she carried her power.  For some reason Streep tried to go to selfconsciously comic proportions you can almost see her winking at the audience saying don't you just LOVE how bad I am?.  The rest of the performances however are appropriately sober and solid.  I never caught Washington acting and Schrieber is masterful in the way he consolidates the conscious and subconscious friction of his character's agony into an invisible but palpable tension.  The score by Rachel Portman is eerily reminiscent of Howard Shore's score for Silence of the Lambs and just as exciting and effective.  And I can't help but thrill over Wyclef Jean's fantastic rendition of the CCR song Fortunate One a version as appropriate to this decade as the original version was to the late sixties check out the lyrics replace 'senator's son' with 'president's' son and see if George W. Bush doesn't come to mind!.  Finally is this film as good as the original version?  They're so different I honestly can't compare.  I can only say that this film is as appropriate to the political and sociological climate of today as the original was to its day.  Don't forget both versions were based on a novel so comparisons should be made in that context more than anything else I haven't read the book so I can't comment on that.  There are some loopholes in the current film's plot and I do love the cinematic style of the original film more than this one. But as I was only a kid when the first film came out this film has a slightly stronger emotional impression on me than the other one. I only hope all it stays science fiction!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the marketers insist that it isn't a straight remake of the original it obviously is  all they key elements are the same. The new twist is supposed to be a postmodern take on America because every liberal with a camera loves to point at the United States and laugh. Yet somehow it just feels simple and lazy. All the observations are obvious the supposedly sly political commentary is about as elevated as Al Franken pulling a funny face or Michael Moore ingratiating himself to Canadians by assuring them how stupid Americans are.Denzel Washington is the epitome of cool. I don't think he can give a bad performance. He gives this movie all his effort and I would say that his performance and the brief one by Jeffrey Wright as Al Melvin are the best parts of the film. But even Washington can't overcome a scenerychewing cringeinducing overacting seminar given by Meryl Streep the exercise in blandness that is Liev Schreiber and a generally inconsistent heavyhanded and patently ridiculous storyline.The movie starts off on the wrong foot with a jarring and poorlyconstructed opening. We are subjected to about five minutes of soldiers playing cards in the back of an armored vehicle while different loud rock tracks cut in every few seconds. This is the credit sequence and it is not crucial to the movie. But it completely fails to draw the viewer into the atmosphere the filmmakers are trying to set Wyclef Jean destroying John Fogerty's Fortunate Son doesn't help.Then we have brief action in Kuwait and a sudden jump cut to the present day. Raymond Shaw is running for the Vice President position and everyone believes he heroically rescued his entire squad in Kuwait. Marco is on the lecture circuit speaking to Boy Scout troops about his time in action. He is confronted by former squad mate Melvin who tells him that he is having bad dreams and who shows Marco a journal of drawings and notes. Marco reacts strangely to this  rather than admitting that he has these bad dreams himself he holds Melvin at arms' length. We all know at this point that Melvin will turn up dead later in the movie so it's best to say your goodbyes now.This is where the first plot hole of the movie shows up. Suddenly Marco is completely involved in this conspiracy theory merely by seeing Melvin's journal and having some more bad dreams. Are we expected to believe that in the years following the incident in Kuwait the men of the unit never got together to discuss what happened? That none of their superiors found it odd that they gave the same wordforword description of what supposedly happened or had the same nightmares? Marco tries to speak with Shaw who is busy with his campaign and incredibly controlled and domineered by his mother. On the way to speak to Shaw Marco is approached by a woman named Rosie the required love interest who mysteriously invites him to her New York apartment. Here we have another plot hole as Marco discovers an implant in his shoulder while showering so he never touched his shoulder for over ten years before this? but loses it down the sink. Marco then arranges a meeting with Shaw and in a curiously homoerotic scene bends him over a table and bites his back. This allows him to steal Shaw's implant which he then gives to crazy scientist friend Delp another plot line that goes nowhere who for some reason gives Marco a massive electric shock to the head. I'm sure he explained why he did this but his accent was so damn thick I couldn't understand a word and in the end it makes no difference whatsoever.More of the conspiracy is revealed as the presidential election draws near. Marco continues investigating clicking a Google link as dramatic music plays. Turns out that Rosie may be a federal agent. Shaw himself waffles he's a flipflopper! between robotic guilt and robotic ambition. Meryl Streep eats a couch. Shaw wades into a river in a full suit and kills a man with a kayak then drowns his one true love. Nobody finds this suspicious. Then suddenly the federal agents who didn't believe a word of Shaw's story completely trust him and escort him to a private room with the man on the eve of the election both men are triggered and start the assassination plot  which has a bizarre twist at the end.There is one aspect of the storyline  a dropped plot line  that particularly frustrated me. In the original movie it was killing his childhood sweetheart that caused Shaw to rebel. In this version we are subjected to a few torturous scenes of Shaw insisting that Jocelyne was his one true love despite the fact that the two actors have absolutely zero chemistry to be fair what woman could love a robot. Then Shaw offs her in a river with her dad and the entire plot line is dropped. This just makes no sense. In fact the entire scene where Shaw kills the Jordan family is ridiculous  killing a man in the open in his kayak? This screams screenwriter phobia.Why go to all this trouble just to get a guy elected president? It doesn't appear to be very hard to do particularly if you have the right last name. But at this point in time the demonizing of Americans has become a cottage industry and everyone wants a piece of the pie. It doesn't seem to matter to the people who buy this stuff whether or not the story is believable coherent or even entertaining. As long as it's critical of the United States it's in. If that's your mindset I suggest you cozy up with this tepid remake and lather up your back for a good patting. Otherwise it's just more grist for the cable TV mill.".

While John Frankenheimer's film written by George Axelrod was the apotheosis of the Cold War thriller and a scathing indictment of McCarthyism Jonathan Demme's remake is less subtle in its approach and paranoia but takes barbed jabs at current politics the corruptibility of our elected leaders and paranoia disguised as patriotism in a post911 America.The remake also owes a debt of gratitude to Alan J. Pakula's brilliant 1974 paranoiaconspiracy thriller The Parallax View.Although it isn't clear whether Raymond Shaw is a Republican or Democrat  his mother certainly seems more Republican in her outlook and politics  Demme and his writers' point is that all American politicians are bought and paid for by big business. As we all know we never heeded President Eisenhower's prescient caution about the military industrial complex.The villainous Manchurian Global clearly was inspired by Halliburton  there's even mention of the company getting nobid contracts. Pay close attention and you'll hear pointed references about the use of private contractors by the military malfunctioning touchscreen voting machines and our government's compassionate vigilance. Also look fast and you'll see a news crawl about a WalMarttype chain and a newspaper story about our treatment of Muslims.Washington's awfully convincing as a man fraying at the edges whose grip on reality seems to be slowly slipping and there were a few moments where Schreiber almost reminded me of Laurence Harvey. Streep on the other hand proves why she is undoubtedly the best actress this nation has ever produced. Her Eleanor spits venom. We're utterly convinced why Raymond's such a cuckold. We can only imagine what his poor father must have endured. Streep occasionally comes close to being campy but so completely dominates the screen that she scares us even when she chews ice.But several other talented actors including Jon Voight Vera Farmiga Dean Stockwell and Ted Levine are used to little or no effect.Some crucial plot elements make no sense. The Dr. Noyle scenario for instance proves to be illogical especially when we learn more about him. Neither Pyne nor Georgaris attempted to rectify this deficiency. Also the mysterious Muslim women are superfluous. I wonder if their bit wound up on the cuttingroom floor.The film contains an unmistakable cynical tone. As much as it's clearly an indictment of big business' control of politics it also denounces our leaders' insistence on keeping the public on edge with terror alerts. And as Senator Shaw points out The assassin always dies. It's necessary for the national healing.But after maintaining its cynicism for much of the film it comes apart completely at the end. Demme and his writers cop out with a pointless and weak denouement. That gunshot you hear is Demme shooting himself in the foot.It's almost as if they gave in to appease some mindless preview audience or dimwitted studio hack. Or maybe they envisioned it just like this. Given my admiration of Demme I'd like to think otherwise. Hope I'm right.".

You see it sort of jaded me. I mean after all you should never mix very good films with ones which are not well not quite as good.John Frankenheimer's Cold War drama was steeped in dark atmospheric brooding reflecting the paranoia of the times it was released during our closest brush with nuclear war the Cuban Missile Crisis  and it was reported that President Kennedy admired the movie and had a distinct antiCommunist message. This updated Paramount version doesn't really have a point to make and therefore loses any political direction or motivation it might have taken.In 1991 Kuwait US Army Captain Bennett Marco Denzel Washington and his unit are ambushed by a pickup full of Iraqis. During the firefight Marco is knocked out and we're left to wonder what actually happened that night.The film then advances to the present day with now major Marco giving a talk to a group of Boy Scouts praising the efforts of one of his men Sgt.

Why do they want to get rid of the President once he's elected? What's the motivation behind such plans and how many people are actually involved in it? The picture doesn't really answer any of these questions. We know something sinister is going on we just don't know what it is or why it's happening. The corporate angle is played off as sinister as possible and there's certainly no denying that great global conglomerates rule much of our lives but it just isn't frightening as presented by director Jonathan Demme Silence of the Lambs.Maybe it's because we don't know enough about who's behind Manchurian just a brief glimpse of a few of its leaders including Dean Stockwell. Manchurian is evil simply because Demme TELLS us it is evil.After Melvin is found dead in a river and Marco finds bizarre notes and drawings in the late corporal's apartment the major begins his search in earnest. Of course as in any film of this type Marco is completely alone no one believes him and everyone thinks he's insane. Supporting characters such as the annoying Rosie Kimberly Elise whom Marco meets on a train and is immediately invited to share her New York apartment are then thrown in for no apparent reason and Marco is arrested for assaulting Shaw in his campaign headquarters.During the altercation he bites that VP candidate and pulls out a GPS device of some kind just like one he had discovered in his own body. Marco is still unable to convince Shaw of what's going on but Senator Shaw hypnotizes the major into killing the Presidentelect was there any doubt he would win?! at his victory party. Instead Marco kills someone else but is totally exonerated while the whole thing is blamed on Manchurian Global and everything ends as convoluted and confused as ever.Film also speeds up slightly only to slow down to a dead crawl putting many into a stupor the kind Maj.

	schema:reviewBody "The one and only reason to see this new and much weaker Manchurian Candidate is Meryl Streep. The little space allocated to her character makes the film rise to undeserving levels. True I would pay to see Meryl Streep do the weather but that's quite besides the point. Even so the memory of Angela Lansbury's performance in the role towers over Meryl Streep's mostly because the original Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidte towers over Demme's. What a silly idea really. To update the story doesn't contribute a thing to the results. No matter how many monitor screens and details about the experiment we're let into. We quite simply don't care. We care about the drama of that mother and son. Of the soldier's and their nightmares. But those elements are treated in a sketchy sluggish way. Frank Sinatra gave a sterling performance in the original and we believed in his torment. Here Denzel Washington floats throughout the film without giving us the chance to connect the dots of his journey. Liev Schriver is a credible Raymond Shaw but the script doesn't help him to go where Laurence Harvey had ventured. After The Truth About Charlie I was fearful of what Jonathan Demme the great man behind Silence of the Lambs would do with this classic black comedy but I went to see it anyway because Meryl Streep was in it and because it was Demme again working with Dean Stockwell after that lovely romp they did together Married to the Mob but Stockell's work in Manchurian Candidate how can I put it? If you blink you miss it. How strange. How disappointing. However the scenes with Senator Meryl Streep are worth the price of admission.".

Most notably the film Godsend' came to mind almost immediately after seeing The Manchurian Candidate' as a prime example of the same flaw as well as to a lesser extent the films Training Day' the cryptic Mamet thriller Heist' and the Indy' nonHollywood but equally flawed and for the same reason Cabin Fever.'What these films have in common is the single major problem with dramatic screenwriting today the lack of a wellplanned wellexecuted welldeveloped payoff laden or at all logical third act.  For those who may not know what I'm talking about if you were enjoying Candidate' quite a bit as I did in the beginning then felt it slowed down a little and got less scary and weird in the middle but was still very entertaining and then at the end took one of the biggest dumps for lack of an expletive that a bad script can you've identified the problem too.  Think of the terrible plot holes and enormous flaws in the logic of the plot starting about half way through and getting worse and worse till the outofnowhere ending.  For instance if these people Manchurian Global were able to do this kind of mind control effectively why would they even have let Ben Marco go back to his normal life why wouldn't he be as under control as Raymond Shaw all the time?  The answer because then the movie would suck and the story would cease to exist.  Much more importantly at the end why or rather HOW could Marco fail in his objective to assassinate the president when in every other instance a mind controlled character does what they are told to do?  The answer because then the movie would have ended on a logical but unfortunate unhappy ending.  Is it an accident Marco killed the wrong people did Manchurian Global give him another order AFTER Mother' did?  If you start thinking about a number of things like this that happened as the film progressed and try and apply logic to them you'll find yourself quite muddled and confused.  You'll be left with snippets of information and jumbled footage and scenes that paint a clear picture that some critical screen elements and scenes you needed to see are in fact completely missing. In addition to the horrendous third act the general editing of the film was poor even the opening credits sequence featured unhinged jump cuts and strangely juxtaposed sequences that were jarring at best.  This is what happens when an edited film is edited AGAIN for the wrong reasons and by the wrong people.  It's dumb Harvard MBA Studio Execs using bad box office science to make a BAD movie which tests extremely well with monkeys.The problem is that what was a good screenplay with several very interesting ideas and great political intrigue was either abruptly finished the way studio executives thought it should be without any concern for logic story development or the plot or it was a major hack job on the third and most important act of the screenplay.  The film Godsend' has this same problem great first act okay second act which starts to go bad half way through and then a TERRIBLE third act and ending which ruined the whole film. Heist' has a very similar problem mainly third act related and the list goes on including Cabin Fever' for example same exact problem cool idea starts off great then the third act comes and SUCKS.  Training Day' ironically another Denzel Washington film also has this same problem a BAD third act where everything starts unraveling the wrong way for no reason at all.  On that film I can at least say after hearing from the writers' own mouths at a QA that I know they were not to blame as they had a much different ending in mind originally then they were told what to change and how to change it.I urge you please DO NOT tolerate this kind of banality or we will as the mindless' audience will continue to get films marketed on excellent highly proficient and welledited trailers as Candidate' had high levels of supposed intrigue and great performances that fall apart like a house of cards the minute a single gust of logic' is blown by way of the story.If you left the theatre entertained but unsatisfied demystified and feeling unfulfilled by this film and you don't know why I've had the same dream too it's not you and it's not something you missed.  Other people seem to think there isn't a problem and that everything is under perfect control' with this film but it is not there are major things wrong here that should have been fixed by any writer or studio executive with half a brain but instead they were left blatantly exposed like another huge logic plot hole concerning Dr.' Noyle and why there were press clippings of him doing things for Manchurian Global and then AT THE SAME TIME press clippings and research saying that he's a known illegal banned in Western countries certified mad scientist.'

	schema:headline " Manchurian Update";
	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen the original John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate which is considered one of the best political thrillers ever made. So it was curious that Jonathan Demme a great director whose previous work included The Silence of the Lambs chose to remake the The Manchurian Candidate. Still basing the story on the novel by Richard Condon and the 1962 screenplay by George Axelrod screen writers Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris have updated the Cold War political thriller to the global nuclear terrorism threat on our homeland and introducing the clandestine presence of a ubiquitous corporation like Manchurian Global. Demme along with reinventing a contemporary storyline assembled a powerful cast Denzel Washington Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber. Streep as Senator Eleanor Shaw the mother of Vice Presidential candidate Raymond Shaw Schreiber is absolutely powerful and compelling. She is playing against type her Eleanor Shaw is a Machiavellian Lady MacBeth. She is ruthless and smart. Streep's performance is awesome. During the Gulf War Sgt. Raymond Shaw Schreiber saved his fellow soldiers when his CO Maj. Ben Marco Washington is knocked unconscious. Shaw receives the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery. Back to the present day Eleanor Shaw Streep imposes her sheer will and brokers the Vice Presidential slot for her son the War Hero on her Party's ticket. Eleanor has political ties with the very powerful Manchurian Global corporation. Meanwhile Maj. Marco is plagued by incoherent memories of what happened in Iraq. Were his memories actually manufactured? His investigation seems to point to brainwashing and a conspiracy. And what is the ultimate goal? Demme is a good storyteller. He keeps the story taut and paced. He also enlists effective performances from his talented cast. Denzel Washington is good as Marco. He is also playing somewhat against type. His Major Marco is a broken man regaining some of his honor and he plays it very close to the vest. Marco is a not a charismatic character but Washington imposes his own force on the character. Schreiber is amazing as Raymond Shaw. Outwardly he might have played a puppet in an elaborate power play however he gives Shaw a strength of character that is riveting with internal conflict. Meryl Streep really steals the movie as Eleanor Shaw. Her performance is so commanding. Even in her ruthlessness and singularity she can not be dismissed as plain evil because ultimately her intentions are noble. That conflict embodied in her character makes The Manchurian Candidate worth watching.".

Really and truly I do absolutely love dreamlike movies and don't need everything explained to me but these useless lazy plot tangents are just plain dumb. I get the feeling that Demme and crew took some puffs on the stupid pipe to make this movie and thought what they were doing was really cool. Seriously this is the only explanation that makes sense. On the plus side somebody needs to put Denzel Washington in a decent movie where he can play crazy. He really was amazing. It's just too bad he was in this movie doing it. Also on the plus side the DVD special features were more interesting and thought provoking than the actual movie which is sad.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate  starring Frank Sinatra and Lawrence Harvey  caught the conspiratorial mood of the time when so many Americans saw a commie round every corner. The current 'war of terror' might have seemed like an apposite time to attempt a remake. I've been a fan of Denzel Washington since he played Steve Biko in Cry Freedom and I regard Meryl Street as the finest actress of her generation so the chance to see the two starring together for the first time was an attractive one. Since I'm a political animal the vehicle of a political thriller appeared to add to the attraction. But Jonathan Demme's remake of John Frankenheimer's classic although it has a certain style is overall a real disappointment. Frankly it is lackluster when it is not simply silly.Streep gives a bravado performance as the manipulative mother of the VicePresidential candidate who is under external control and Washington is always watchable but Liev Schreiber as the braindrilled war hero and politician is robotic even when he is not 'activated'. The 'updating' of the story to make corporations rather than Communists the enemy is a wellworn theme ranging from the Peter Sellers' movie Being There to the more recent television series 24. What this new version of Richard Condon's 1959 novel tells us is that Americans are no less fearful and paranoid than they were in the Cold War and Hollywood is no better at remakes than it ever was.".

	schema:headline " Solid Topical and Worthy of the Original";
	schema:reviewBody "Manchurian Candidate is far closer to the original than you've probably heard and even though it's not the exact movie it hardly could have been. That the original is truly relevant would count little for modern audiences who seem to have a hard time drawing parallels from anything out of their memory. One glimpse of black and white and funky old clothes and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty are out the door. Since they would only sit through a first run update it's truly fine that they have one. The wonder is the update stands up to the original. It even solves some of the problems of the first. Gone are the vaguely foreign looking actors standing in for Russians and Chinese agents. Gone are the poorly choreographed jujitsu moves. And the new film retains the strengths of the original. Every performance is fine. Liev Schrieber is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original gut kicking performance though it's Harvey by an edge. Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work. One of the wonders of the first is realizing that Sinatra could act that he did things with rhythm and cadence because those were his only tools and it worked. He was no method actor but damn. Streep's scenery chewing is frankly perfect because unfortunately really disgusting people actually do exist and the real ones are impervious to the critique that their behavior is overthetop. Seen or heard any Fox commentators recently? Streep's Senator may be overthetop but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is  surprise  she's only acting.Make no mistake both these films are paranoid thrillers and the overly literal would say of either preposterous. But then the overly literal don't usually get much out of anything that isn't underlined in Business Week with a magic marker. So if you fit in that category go rent something less threatening.On the other hand if you are the nervous type...The film's style is less dialog laden it runs more on mood. But it really does kick in all the same places the same incredible cynicism offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild earnest Patriotism.".

So have the rest of the unit. The brainwashing was carried out to equip the Communists with a means to one day take over America. Shaw the ultimate sleeperassassin will gun down a presidential candidate. His stepfather the vicepresidential nominee will make an emotional speech blaming Communism. The speech will fuel a Rightwing backlash that will sweep him and Shaw's mother into The White House.Fortunately Major Marco unravels the Manchurian plot. And poor tortured Shaw finally understands that he has been manipulated hypnotised and conditioned to such extent that he no longer has the capacity to exercise freedom of choice. Condon's message is clear. Politicians will sacrifice any principle in the pursuit of success. But being fundamentally stupid politicians are ignorant of the dangers their stupidity invites. So those dangers are instead perceived  but shrugged aside  by shadowy figures who exist behind the politicians puppetmasters to whom any ideology is worthy of cosmetic embrace so long as it enables them to satisfy their own monstrous vanity.Thus the idiot that is Shaw's stepfather. Thus the monster that is Shaw's mother. Thus Shaw himself not The All American Hero but the heroic All American Electorate sleepwalking its way towards the destruction of everything it once held dear.An America that could produce a writer like Condon and a book like 'The Manchurian Candidate' is America at its best for such a novelist and such a novel could only have sprung from a society with the wit to think the vision to see and the ability to reason. An America that could render Condon's masterpiece so beautifully on screen is also America at its best for in the hands of director John Frankenheimer and legendary screenwriter George Axelrod and with powerhouse performances by Frank Sinatra as Marco Laurence Harvey as Shaw Angela Lansbury as Shaw's mother and James Gregory as the deranged politician 'The Manchurian Candidate' of 1962 was and so remains moviemaking at its finest.And now we have The Manchurian Candidate version two.And director Jonathan Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris.And it is not merely that this is very possibly the worst American film of living memory a cheap conceit so utterly defeated by the consequences of its own larceny that the incoherence of its narrative is matched only by the ineptitude of its writing and direction.No. What's worse is that we have something that actually got made. In America. And seems actually to have been liked by a large section of the audience. In America.Gone from Manchurian 2 is the politician made to dance by a master behind the scenes. Gone therefore is the puppet master leaving Shaw's mother with no rational explanation for her actions. Gone too is Shaw the tortured Everyman and with him the entire point of the original fable. Instead and in so complete a misapprehension of character and purpose that it's no wonder Denzil Washington looks confused throughout Marco assumes the assassin's role.Finally gone is Manchuria and Communism the devices  which is all they were 'The Manchurian Candidate' is no more about the Cold War and Communism than 'Gulliver's Travels' is about foreign holidays  the devices via which Condon warned of the dangers to liberty that await when individuals are so manipulated that they bring upon themselves the very fate they've been most anxious to avoid.But because the purpose of Manchurian 2 is to profit from Manchurian 1 the makers can't actually junk that so produce in its stead The Manchurian Something or Other Corporation run by The Most Powerful People In The World employing A Mad Scientist from South Africa. . .Manchurian 2 isn't the first case of moronic moviemaking. And it certainly won't be the last. But it certainly ranks high amongst the most dishonest and disturbingly so because it begs the question if rubbish like this can be made in America today what's next? Catch 22 as a cop thriller about baseball? How about MASH then the tale of a potato grower taken over by aliens? Nashville? A private eye who composes country music in between solving murders.Never mind the talent that conceived and the intellect that drove those originals. And never mind the stories either those plots they're all much much too deep for today's moviegoers.Let's just take the title instead. Pretend it's a remake. Then sit back and let the money roll in from an audience whose collective brain has been so conditioned by the mindnumbing pap of so much in contemporary culture that it can no longer tell the difference between what's good and what's bad what's valuable and what's worthless.In which respect then maybe Demme Pyne and Georgaris have bettered the stellar combination of Condon Frankenheimer and Axelrod. They've shown that Raymond Shaw is no longer a fictional character way out in a mythical Communist China but a real live braindead human being now being serially replicated to the point that it's sitting in a movie theatre near you. . .".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of movies rely on the suspension of disbelief in order to make their stories work. The only way this film could have worked is if someone had taken a meat cleaver and cut out my disbelief without using anesthetic. I have seen some stupid ass motion pictures in my time pitiful excuses for entertainment that were so desolately dumb they would make you question the existence of a kind and loving God. The remake of The Manchurian Candidate might just top them all.That's because this colossally cretinous disaster wasn't pounded out by some talentless dreamers who scrounged together a few thousand dollars and rounded up a few desperately outofwork actors to try and make their filmmaking delusions come true. Jonathan Demme made this thing. Trying to put this alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia is like trying to imagine Leonardo Da Vinci taking a break between masterpieces to smear his own feces all over his bedroom walls. The sheer throw weight of idiocy at work here is that shocking.The remake of The Manchurian Candidate tosses plausibility into a wood chipper has all the subtlety of stapling your testicles to someone else's leg and shows as much attention to detail as an Alzheimer's patient. This is the kind of movie where it honestly looks like the cast and crew forgot what the film was about while they were making it changed their approach to the story at least 4 or 5 times and then somebody got hired to try and edit the resulting incoherent bits into something resembling a single story.I'm pretty much going to give away the story butA. If you haven't already seen the original you really should. AndB. This film is not only devoid of any mystery and tells you everything that's going to happen within the first 10 minutes it then repeats itself over and over to be sure that even singlecelled organisms that might be in the audience know what's going on.Raymond Shaw Liev Schreiber is a Gulf War hero whose viciously political mother Meryl Streep has maneuvered into being a heartbeat away from the Presidency. The only thing standing in his way is his old commanding officer Ben Marco Denzel Washington and his conviction that both he and Shaw were the subject of brainwashing experiments by an evil investment firm that wants to take over the government. In fact they were brainwashed as part of an dementedly convoluted plan that would have made Rube Goldberg blanch. The same basic stuff is gone over again and again until the movie wraps up by leaping from suggested incest to utterly contradicting it's most fundamental premise.If I tried to recap all the imbecilic nonsense in the remake of The Manchurian Candidate this review would be longer than the unabridged edition of Stephen King's The Stand. So let me give you only one example that sums it all up. After Raymond Shaw is named his party's VicePresidential candidate he goes back to his hotel suite. Well it turns out the people who brainwashed him over a decade ago have set up a sophisticated operating theater in the room next door. They cut a hole in the wall between the two rooms bring Shaw over and perform some brain surgery on him. And that all happens without anyone in the Secret Service with the media or on the hotel staff noticing anything. John Edwards can't have a baby momma without the whole world knowing but Raymond Shaw can get a hole bored into his skull in the midst of the campaign without anyone being the wiser.There's sooooooo much more to criticize about this movie but I'm afraid if I go on I'll give myself an ulcer. Watch the original Manchurian Candidate. All copies of the remake should be set on fire.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's very tricky to do a remake of a wellknown movie which has gone into the history of film as one of the greatest political satires of all time because the film maker runs the risk of having it compared to the original. Which means measuring up. In the 30s and 40s remakes were even more common given the fact that technology was advancing and if a B film could be remade into a much better version of itself then why not. Such were the cases of the second film versions of THE MALTESE FALCON and A STAR IS BORN whose first versions are good but dated and whose remakes have become the stuff of cinema legend. But when remaking those much better known versions in the 70s for a third time one can see just how inferior the resulting movie turned out to be.In the case of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE when it became picked as Jonathan Demme's next followup to THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE itself an updated version of CHARADE there was much speculation among those who know the story as to who would play Mrs. Iselin Raymond Shaw and Ben Marco. Once Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep were announced as principal actors speculations became even stronger Denzel could be seen as the tortured Marco but would Streep for all her perfectionism in acting be able to convince as Mrs. Iselin now dubbed Mrs. Shaw? No one had ever seen her play a character that evil and I could only assume it was the challenge to prove that she could. She would be up against a role Angela Lansbury had made her own.On viewing this version less a remake than a reworking it is its own film I was surprised in a good way. All of the actors measured up and the film is definitely stylized in Demme's lush sometimes surreal style. Out was the pitchblack humor present in the first version in was the heightened paranoia that at times seemed to want to bleed right off the screen. A conspiracy stemmed from Communism gave way to corrupt corporations  something which is more in touch with today's current events. Out too were the playing cards from the first in were dermal microchips used to manipulate the mind. Where both films become joined is in the depiction of the inhuman violence that soldiers were forced to inflict on each other in order to assure they would turn into killing machines and at times some of Demme's sequences had a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS quality to them.Demme does take his own liberty in changing plot elements in his version. Rosie in the first movie only suggested as much about her enigmatic character Kimberly Elise's role in obeyance of these more feminist times gets to do more than just suggest she does first in a submissive way but progressively dominant. Her role determines that every conspiracy has its own counterconspiracy.Speaking of Mrs. Shaw if I had any doubts about Streep with all her accolades I was proved wrong having her play less of an overt monster and more of what we see every day  a tough female politician with a soft voice  makes her equally terrifying Streep models her from a variety of sources ranging from Condoleeza Rice to Hillary Clinton and in her short yet powerful performance she makes you know who she is and what she is capable of she is on screen for less time than Lansbury was in the first version but you never forget her.The men are no less forgettable Liev Schreiber has the difficult role of the puppet able to do horrible things and being propelled to the spotlight and in many ways is similar to Lawrence Harvey. Washington's Ben Marco has a helplessness that lacked in Sinatra's portrayal his broken man is a far cry from Sinatra's cocky Italian who recovers too fast. Washington makes us know that such things always haunt the person  seeing his home in disarray his life in shambles looking like a man who is about to lose it at any moment as he sees another soldier Jeffrey Wright who suspects he was also a guineapig die or be terminated and loses Shaw's friendship. It's here that the emotional weight of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE becomes his story he is alone in a world of nightmares trying to make a dim sense of things having to do the ultimate act of violence.".

Almost anything. The movie was trite utterly predictable not a bit suspenseful tell me you didn't know that Meryl Streep was evil from about one minute into the movie and that her son was nothing but an automaton.But worse than this the movie made no sense at all. For one thing why would a conservative senator work so hard to put her liberal son in the White House? And why would she plot to do so by staging a fake rescue years before he had any political career as we all know heroes don't necessarily become presidents  in fact part time reservists and draft evaders have a lot better track record these days? And if you could brainwash the entire squad what's the point of murdering any of them? And if you have to murder some of them why have your son do it? And if you go through all of this why set him up for the vicepresidency? Why not the 1 post? And who did they plan to have shoot the president if Denzel hadn't shown up? And when Jon Voigt got wise to the scheme why send your son the presidenttobe to off them rather than some other henchman Denzel would have made a good choice there wouldn't he? And did that FBI chick really have a crisis of conscience before saying I believe you Denzel or whatever his name was? And as my 19 year old son pointed out even if they could brainwash the good honest and true blue Denzel to assassinate the president once he shook off the spell how did he do that anyway? why wouldn't he have just dropped the gun and exposed Meryl and her son instead of killing them instead? Is that how he acts when he regains free will? And finally what was with that would be erotic sequence when mom is drying junior off? I mean really this is moronic. And it gets an average rating of 6.7? Maybe that is the real message of this political horrornightmare script  if a big studio hires big name actors and budgets a lot of money for advertising not only will the American public go to see the movie they'll actually like it no matter how bad it really is! Maybe it is a parable of the 2004 election after all.".

The main difference between this film and the original was that the original villains were the Communists and the villains in this film is big business. The Manchurian Corporation pretty much could be seen as standins for not only Halleburton but also could be seen as a stand in for many other corporate entities that pretty much want to wield influence in our government.Another way this film works is as a strong psychological thriller. You pretty much have the troops brainwashed much as they were in the original only it is more technologically based. However the thing that really made this film as creepy as it was was the relationship between Raymond and his mother. In the original Raymond's mother was nothing more than a manipulative harpy who would stop at nothing to make sure she and her husband became the next president. However in this version the film goes even farther by even implying that Mrs. Shaw Mrs. Iselin in the original almost has an incestuous obsession with her son.

Characters come and go without rhyme or reason and the plot makes no sense they say. Well yes but that's not Fritiz's fault nor the movie's Metropolis makes little sense because 55 minutes of the film was hacked out and destroyed never to be seen again by the US distributors. Of course it's gonna be a dog's dinner with an hour missing ya clods!!The same is true of Cleopatra and this is basically the only reason the film fell flat on its' 1963 release. It was originally intended to release Cleopatra as two three hour movies the first dealing with Cleo's relationship with Caesar the second her affairs with Marc Antony. Fox said no to this idea and demanded a single four hour film instead. This decision is like taking Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and removing an hour from each film wherever an hours' worth can be removed...a recipe for incoherence and total disaster.So with two hours of footage gone major characters are reduced to glorified walkons vital plot points and motivations are lost and the story loses what LOTR has...length with the proper pacing. People will sit and watch 4 hours of Return Of The King because it flows properly. People will not sit and watch 4 hours of stitched together rough cuts...that's what Cleopatra is even in the DVD roadshow edition...because what we have is something that is too bitty and haphzard to sustain interest.But there is still glory in Cleo....Roddy McDowall Martin Landau and Rex Harrison all act their socks off the sea battle is kick ass and Liz Taylor looks pretty scrummy in Egyptian softcore porn clothes. And only a Gen Xer like me could love that hideously pompous overblown dialogue.Great film! For what it is. It just should have been TWO films that's all. Real eyepopping trippy spectacle done in a 'damn the money full speed ahead' way that just doesn't happen any more. Like Casino Royale Cleo is a wonderful disaster.".

Cleopatra is a luscious period epic and it's clear no expense was spared on either scenery or costumes gorgeous to look at but somehow unsatisfying at the end. The movie seems to lose it's way half way through as Rex Harrison departs so for me does the quality of this movie.It's difficult to tell whether this is due to over the top performances from Taylor and Burton or the forced cuts to reduce the running time. Roddy McDowell is the highlight of the 2nd half of the film and i'm sure Joaquin Phoenix must have researched his role for Gladiator here McDowell's Octavian is chilling in the extreme. But the rest of the 2nd half of the movie descends into melodrama where the 1st gave us the excellent Harrison restrained and regal as Ceaser the 2nd gives us real life lovers Burton and Taylor locked in an overacted doomed romance. But throughout the film there are supporting actors giving first class performances that without the cuts would be interesting to see Martin Landau Andrew Keir Hume Cronyn and George Cole all have their moments it's just a shame there aren't more of them.If I could split my vote over the two halves of the movie the first half would get 910 the 2nd 610 as I can't I'm going with a 710 overall.".

Part of that though had to do with the TaylorBurton affair and the scandal it created.  Liz Taylor in 1963 was not only considered the most beautiful woman in America she was also thought of as a serial homebreaker and a real threat to the morals of the American Republic.Why?  I don't agree with many positive comments about the acting.  Taylor and Burton were not too bad but they didn't handle the pompous dialogue as well as Rex Harrison Hume Cromyn Martin Landau and especially Roddy McDowell who was perfection itself and I believe accurately portrayed as the very young ambitious and unscrupulous but brilliantly intelligent Octavian later the emperor Augustus.Sure some of the dialogue stinks and the movie seems too long perhaps because so much of it was cut to fit into fours hours.

	schema:headline " A Story That Always Fascinates  No Matter How Many Versions We See Of It.";
	schema:reviewBody "The tale of the last great ruler of Ancient Egypt Cleopatra has been the subject of many films. Theda Bara played her in 1917. That version if it still exists is rarely seen  and if it were the broad gestures of early silent movies would probably strike us as funny. Nearly twenty years later in 1934 Claudette Colbert did a wonderful job as the Queen of the Nile under the guidance of Cecil B. DeMille. In 1946 England produced CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA with Claude Rains sharing acting honors with Vivien Leigh to dialog by Bernard Shaw. Finally came this 1963 version  which is different from most of the others the 1946 is the closest to it for a different reason.The 1963 version with Elizabeth Taylor Richard Burton and Rex Harrison is remembered for the beginning of the Taylor  Burton relationship which destroyed their respective marriages and got more news coverage than any items of that period except for the Cuban Missile Crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy. The film is also remembered for being up to that time the most expensive flop film of American movie history. It cost in 1963 money twenty five million dollars which was nearly twenty two million over original budget. Which is why the 1946 version is also so similar  it was the most expensive film of the British cinema up to that time and it too was a box office flop.The film was a mess  it was started without decent control of budget and cast from 20th Century Fox's leadership. The original filming was in England under Rouben Mamoulian but he got no where with his stars they included Peter Finch as Caesar and Stephen Boyd as Anthony. He was replaced by Joseph Mankiewicz at the demand of Taylor who had worked well with him on SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER. Mankiewicz tried to give coherence to the script  and eventually created a plan for a six hour two part movie first about Cleopatra and her romance with Gaius Julius Caesar and then her relationship with Marc Anthony. Mankiewicz apparently shot that much or almost that much but the leadership at 20th Century Fox was changed and Darryl Zanuck returned to command. Zanuck insisted on a single long film  the four hour version that most of us have seen.Despite the cuts the remaining film is quite a worthy one. It is attacked as pompous because the dialog is more formal than ours  it is based on Plutarch Suetonius and other ancient Latin and Greek historians as well as Shakespeare and a little of Shaw. But the basic story of the princess who fought her way to the oldest throne in the ancient world and twice came close to being the loverwife of the most powerful man in the Roman Empire. The supporting cast is fine including Hume Cronym as an Egyptian adviser to Taylor and possibly the best performance Roddy MacDowell as Octavian later Emperor Augustus who is a compound of brains suspicions and respect for his foes. Look at the end when he berates a soldier for dismissing Anthony as a drunken failure reminding the soldier that he was one of Rome's greatest soldiers.Mankiewicz may lack De Mille's gift for special effects only eight years after THE TEN COMMANDMENTS but there were no miracles in the tale of Cleopatra  she used her wiles her intelligence her looks to beguile to powerful men who also saw her as a key to their own ambitions. So there was no parting of the Red Sea here. But there is a fine production of the naval battle at Actium to really climax the second part of the story.For all the expense the ego clashes and the pompous language CLEOPATRA remains a good epic film retelling of a remarkable ancient figure and her world. It's nice to note that after twenty years it finally made a small profit from television rentals foreign distribution and later videos and DVDs.".

In addition because I watched the DVD version of the movie I also was able to view the outstanding documentary Cleopatra The Film that Changed Hollywood.  And once again I am all but overwhelmed by the movie.  Elizabeth Taylor may very well be one of the most underrated actresses of the last fifty years her public private life has always overshadowed her acting ability.  But it is not her notoriety that puts her in the same league with other two time Oscar winners like Jane Fonda Sally Field Tom Hanks etc.  In Cleopatra as in George Stevens' Giant she runs the gamut from adolescent to matriarch from calculating queen to devastated lover and rings every bell in between. But her performance alone does not make the movie.  Not only is she supported by Burton in one of his best screen performances and Rex Harrison in one of his best Taylor's old friend Roddy McDowall gives the performace of his lifetime how sad that a clerical error cost him his Oscar we see a young Martin Landau a young Carroll O'Connor a young Jean Marsh give performances worthy of anything they've ever put on screen since.  The documentary points out that the original Mankiewicz cut of the film was 6 12 hours long and that Fox is currently trying to reassemble the film as originally cut.  If they ever succeed in doing so I would stand in line to see it in theatres and buy it on DVD the first chance I got.  As a history freak it more than satisfies as a fan of brilliant acting it wows!  Everyone should see it at least once!".

	schema:reviewBody "That a film as good as CLEOPATRA is was created at all under the madness and panic of it's legendary production is indeed an amazing feat. That CLEOPATRA has been given such loving care in its restoration in this DVD of the Road Show print and the attendant bonus materials is a wondrous gift to those who love this film. The documentary Cleopatra The Film That Changed Hollywood is in on it's own an engrossing and informative two hour movie. For anyone who knows little of the history of CLEOPATRA or who was not around at the time this documentary will give them the feeling of what those last days of old Hollywood was like. And therein one can find the reasons why this intimate epic is indeed the wonder that it is. Many thanks should go to the Mankiewicz family and the producers of the documentary. The print and the sound of CLEOPATRA seems now to surpass what I recall it to be in its first presentation nearly forty years ago. The depth of the colors and the richness of the shadows are indeed splendid. In this restoration it is hard to believe this film is as old as it is. The commentary track is in and of itself like finding the lost treasures of the long dead monarch. For there are wonderful recollections by Martin Landau Tom and Chris Mankiewicz and even the one of the films publicists Jack Brodsky gets to read sections from his book The Cleopatra Papers which gave a blow by blow description of everyday events on the set. But I must give special mention to Landau's part. With his keen eye for the art direction of John DeCuir one sees things in the background and along the edges of the scene that one never noticed before. Such lovingly detailed sets and interiors will never be seen again. The costs today are just too prohibitive.   Also his insights into what was cut from the film particularly his and Richard Burton's contributions in the second act give one the idea of what Mankiewicz was intending. Poor Richard suffered the unkindest cut of all. The presentation of the DVD menus is so clever and exotic. The creators of this DVD are to be commended in their art direction. At last we now know what is behind the massive 20th Century Fox logo!The film itself remains what it has always been. It is a good film that might have been a great one if only Zanuck had trusted Joe Mankiewicz' original vision. It is said that they are still looking for the missing film one can only hope that they succeed in this task. The performances range from good to excellent. Particular praise must go to Rex Harrison Richard Burton Martin Landau Robert Stephens Andrew Keir and Roddy McDowall. Lastly in this department there remains Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Cleopatra. At the films release the brickbats were reserved for her and for reasons that had nothing to do with her performance. Many reviewed her behavior as seen through the narrow focus of the tabloids and emerging paparazzi.  Even today it is sometimes hard to separate the history of the lady from her film roles. But here is the moment in time in this film where she became the ELIZABETH TAYLOR she has remained in the mind of the world ever since. In this fact alone she is perfect in the role. But she is more than that. As Cleopatra she is at once regal and commanding strong and tender soft and hard. These are all the contradictions that have always been at the heart of Cleopatra herself. She and the Queen are masters of a public enigma wrapped within a mystery. In her performance as written by Mankiewicz Elizabeth Taylor is probably not too far off from the historical Cleopatra. Finally ever since Judith Crist gave CLEOPATRA the needle in 1963 and in the act made her name the public for the most part has viewed this film a failure. But today stripped of the scandal hype and hysteria of its release in June of 1963 it is now possible to view CLEOPARTA as the film it is. A near great film that is the signpost of when Hollywood passed from one age into another. Historically this is an important DVD and I recommend it highly. CLEOPATRA remains as seductive beautiful and intelligent as it was in Walter Wanger's original conception. Age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety.".

Taylor deserved the million dollars she got for the title role and Burton's occasional scenery chewing didn't detract significantly from his interpretation of Mark Antony.

In spite of all the troubles surrounding its production Cleopatra defined big cinematic spectacle for me I was 12 years old and saw it on a Cinerama screen. It was huge and it was grandiose. Elizabeth Taylor carried the movie on her back but she had not developed into a full dramatic actress yet and Leon Shamroy's Oscarwinning cinematography ranged from dramatic lighting to flourishes of color that resemble the light show of a cabaret in La Habana. But the story was compelling and everybody gave their best. It also became the entrepreneurial model for preselling movies before the cameras rolled. It did not have very good reviews and 1960's yellow press which had nothing to do with Mankiewicz's reflection of power and love tarnished its values. By the 1980s a tendency to reevaluate the movie had grown and moreover it became an icon of the big historical Hollywood spectacle. Not a masterpiece by scholars' standards it is nevertheless the big opus in the career of Mankiewicz maker of All About Eve.".

And also it was not a 'flop' as some people have mentioned its one of the highest grossing movies of all time but its just that its huge budget eclipsed this. And who can fail not to be enthralled by the real life love story that was taking place at the time with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton?

Remember this was released in 1963 far before the gimmickry of computer enhanced effects. The crowds in these scenes are real the buildings are real this is not a movie that was put together with the smoke and mirrors of computers. I truly do hope that restorers are able to eventually find the footage that was deleted primarily due to Zanuck's influence and not Mankiewicz's desire so that we may see more of what Mankiewicz had in mind.I also strongly recommend that one view the DVD release.

Richard Burton was in 1963 what Anthony Hopkins is to the cinema today a remarkably talented actor with a resonant voice and a larger than life presence strong enough to entirely captivate an audience.  Antony's struggle to break free of the shadow of almighty Caesar and his struggle against the beguiling wiles of Cleopatra are fascinating to watch.  The always brilliant Rex Harrison seems however a bit peevish for Caesar.  Nevertheless this movie is a masterpiece of cinematography and the chemistry between Burton and Taylor is riveting.  Roddy McDowell is wellcast as the bookish Octavian.  The spectacle of Cleopatra is only matched by such films as the recent Ridley Scott's Gladiator Benhur and Kubrick's Spartacus.  It's well worth viewing this piece of cinematic history.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that got me hooked on historical epics from the fifties and sixties. I do not know where to start. First I'll mention the spectacular sets particularly of Rome and Alexandria. This was before CGI! The costumes were also finely detailed. Now I will mention the great cast. Every actor gives their role so much emotional value that you think that a whole separate movie should be made for their character. My favorite characters were obviously Julius Caesar 1 and Marc Antony 2. Rex Harrison gave Caesar such a imposingly powerful presence yet at the same time touchingly vulnerable value that I was saddened to see him killed at the end of the first half. He lived up to Caesar's rep and more. Richard Burton was a different kind of lover for Cleopatra more tormented and at times insecure about his ability to live up to his fame. His abandonment of the Battle of Actium was particularly shocking. My two favorite Burton scenes were his rant to Cleopatra on her barge about being in Caesar's shadow and his soliloquy about his postdesertion guilt. Elizabeth Taylor was very emotional and intelligent in the title role. She can be commanding when she needs to be and vulnerable when it is safe to do so and at times both. She evolved Cleopatra from the young queen dropped at Caesar's feet from a carpet to the defeated monarch who lost her son her second love her kingdom but never her dignity. The ending was powerful and befitting the last of son many noble rulers. The dual romances were great because they took their time without dominating the film. You believed that she really cared about and loved both these men. Alex North's score is unforgettable and deeply emotional. The script is intelligent witty literate and strangely poetic. My one scruple is that the producers cut the original film by TWO HOURS! That is desecration right there. I hope they find that missing footage because I would definitely like to see more character development even though this film had its fair share. Still this is a haunting romantic and eyefilling spectacle that remains high on my list".

I well remember in 1962 you could not get away from all the talk about the hanky panky that Liz and Dick were engaged in. It took the Cuban Missile Crisis to knock it off the front page and out of people's minds. But as the costs on this version of Cleopatra mounted Darryl F. Zanuck couldn't have bought better publicity than this.And it's a pretty good film also. But I think the acting honors in this go to Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar. It is the best portrayal of Caesar I've seen on either the big or small screen. Harrison's Caesar is a man at the top of his conqueror game not anyone's fool. Though he's definitely charmed by Cleopatra he's fully aware of what she wants from him also. His fall is not from misjudging Cleopatra but misreading public opinion back in Rome.Contrast that with Richard Burton as Mark Antony. No doubt the love affair and eventual marriage to Liz Taylor helped his performance as a man is totally thinking with his hormones. As for Elizabeth Taylor she is a most bewitching and lovely Cleopatra. She was the perfect Cleopatra for her time.Roddy McDowall probably has his best adult screen role as Octavian. He undergoes a remarkable transformation from callow youth to bloodless conqueror. What Antony tears up and throws away he just hangs around and picks up the pieces. In the supporting cast I would single out Andrew Keir as Agrippa Gregoire Aslan as Pothinus and Martin Landau as Ruffio for special mention.A whole lot of tickets were sold to see the most publicized lovebirds of all time in 1963. They had to be because Cleopatra's cost over runs nearly broke 20th Century Fox. But the move going public saw and intelligent and literate spectacle. Director Joseph Mankiewicz gave us DeMille grandeur without DeMille Victorian dialog.And that's as good a reason as any to see Cleopatra.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a perfect movie.  No one has ever suggested it is.  That said it is much better than you may have been led to believe.  Technically it is superb with sets costumes cinematography music etc.  apparently unattainable by today's filmmakers.  If you doubt this watch Gladiator immediately after watching Cleopatra.  The technological weaknesses of the former are stark and unavoidable when compared to this film. The first act especially is without equal. Rex Harrison as Caesar dominates the screen and gives the performance of his life Henry Higgins not withstanding.  He earned his Best Actor Oscar nomination and then some.  The second act suffers more likely than not due to the merciless reediting by the studio that saw two hours of film hit the cutting room floor and major roles like those of Cronyn and McDowall reduced to little more than bit parts Mankiewicz originally envisioned this as two films not one from an occasional lack of cohesion I tend to think was not in Mankiewicz' screenplay.  While La Taylor is ravishing throughout she sometimes appears to be in a bit over her head.  Again this is more apparent in the problemmatic second act. There has been an active search for years by the Mankiewicz estate and others to find the missing elements from his original cut and restore Cleopatra to what he envisioned.  This may yet happen.  I hope it does. In the meantime this newly restored roadshow version is most welcome.".

Joseph Mankiewicz takes us onto the streets and and into the estates of Rome the horrors of battlefields and shows the idiosyncrasies of Egypt's Pharaohs and how death battled life for ultimate power. One item lacking in the VHS version of Cleopatra is the elimination of the beginning commentary by a gentleman standing by Egypt's great Sphinx. His comments on Egypt Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw provided an excellent setup for this epic film.All in all  worth a 10.".

Not so Mr. Mankiewicz  what worked so well in ALL ABOUT EVE tanks here. And for a film this excruciating and long made even longer by its lack of action it's a killer. It made me wish to do myself in especially in a painful way. But I hung on for dear life I've seen worse so this wasn't that bad. Just bad enough to make me feel like the one responsible for being under that massive caravan in CleoLizzie's entrance to Rome.

He's at a dead end job his girlfriend is sleeping around he takes antidepressants and his boss is a pain in the ass. He wonders how his life could be different but he's stuck in a fantastic rut with no end in sight. Little did he know his father had passed away leaving him to a secret fraternity of assassins and he'd be trained by a man named Sloan Morgan Freeman who operates outside the confines of the law and independent of any of the world's governments. Fox takes him under his wing tells him his anxiety problem is actually a gift of being able to speed your heart rate up releasing adrenaline and slowing down time. He also tells him his father was killed by a double crossing member of the brotherhood ironically named Cross Thomas Kretschmann.This plot eventually forces Wesley and his mentortrainer Fox Angelina Jolie to question the integrity of the brotherhood and Sloan's methods in a spectacular confrontation close to the end of the movie. Without giving away too much of the plot the theme of the movie appears to be in line with that of The Matrix in that it is a fantastical adventure for someone caught in what appears to be an inescapable reality of mundane existence. The fact that Wesley is barely living his life makes you want to cheer for this nerdy slob. He is in fact everyone who is sick and tired of their job life partner and in many ways living in general.Contrast is given when Wesley finds out he doesn't have common problems like anxiety and that he didn't need medication he needed to be trained how to use it to his advantage. Who wouldn't like to be someone like James Bond and a Thomas Anderson Neo all rolled up into one? It's only when he's made to be a fugitive by Sloan that Wesley embraces the lifestyle the Fraternity has to offer.This film uses gritty acting along with a ton of eye candy to tell the story. Real time three dimensional effects speed and slow time forcing you to suspend all disbelief and buy in to the premise that a lowly desk jockey named Wesley could become one of the greatest assassins the world has ever known.".

If you didn't immediately answer I just spent two hours watching a really dumb movie then you must be an easily impressed video game enthusiast. Some interesting visuals aside it's movies like this that give the term comic book movie a bad reputation. Unexplained gravity defying flipping cars curving bullets and rat bombs just push the envelope too far in to the land of the absurd. The easily spotted plot turn does help but the rather uninspiring cartoon action just sinks it. Too many WTF? moments in both the action and the plot to enjoy this movie unless you really relate to a frustrated nobody stuck in a deadend job and you want to fantasize about becoming an assassin. I can't figure out what was worse the few Matrix type rip offs or the bizarre Rocky type killer training session? Also how did they manage to make Angelina Jolie so unattractive? Not only does she look anorexic but add in the God awful tattoos and there is NOTHING sexually appealing about the character.Ridiculous uninspired action mixed with possibly the dumbest plot of any movie this century means Wanted is one to avoid at all cost.".

This occupies a lot of celluloid and you start to think where has the action gone. After some time passes I forget how long he joins a fraternity of assassins led by Morgan Freeman. Here he learns that his father who has been absent all his life was an assassin and can bend bullets round corners a trait shared by both Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie but its never explained why and other cool looking stuff. So after some training getting smacked in the face a lot and doing some knife training he never uses he does a couple of rather impossible missions.At this point you think this isn't that bad and you'd be right.Its when Morgan Freeman reveals that the fraternity kill orders come from a bit of cloth on a loom that things go downhill. Are we told why the loom wants to kill people? No. Maybe it's an evil loom.Now I was expecting a shadow organisation that was controlling things and the main characters father was behind all that. No.It turns out that Morgan Freeman has been lying about who the loom wants to kill and that it wanted to kill him and every other member of the fraternity again never explained why so Angelina Jolie kills all the fraternity members who just happen to stand still long enough for one bullet to go through them all in a circle considerate and herself.That leaving Freeman and Mcevoy ? to battle it out or not. In fact the same sequence from the first bit just happens all over again.It should be called Plot Wanted.Just goes to show cool looking trailers do not a good film make.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a bit apprehensive about this film from the previews and commercials what with the bending bullets and all but I figured with all of the action movies trying to outdo each other...maybe there would be a good story backing it. However in the opening sequence when a man leaps several hundred feet to slay some assassins on another rooftop before being aced out from miles away I started to lose any hopes for a good movie. Then any further hopes were dashed when it was revealed that a magic god loom delivers a binary code that says who is to be killed how the frat discovered binary and secondly that the people named were to be killed is beyond me maybe godfatewhatever wrote to them in binary on the first sweater that was and told them to kill the named ever thereafter This whole godfate fate being spelled out when the explosive rat truck hit the mill door loom thing really blatantly pointed out the problems with dogmatic irrational beliefs that can be found running rampant throughout our society but speaking of that society it's a shame to think that most people will be unable to find that point because it was buried behind quack gimics and special effects. This movie made Crank look like the Godfather. Aside from the absurd story backing why the frat was assassinating people all of the stunts were merely an attempt to outdo movies like crank with timespace bending cg that makes anyone who has any inkling of what physics are want to cry. If the timeslowing gimics were cut from the movie I think it would have maybe passed 30 minutes of film time. I could maybe understand the rapid heartbeat to be able to react quicker to things modeled after a fight or flight type of response on crack or something but the bullet bending thing got to be a little too ridiculous by the end where a bullet can be fired around a 20' circumference and have the same gun tossed to someone else before the bullet returns from its 360 degree trip to kill the shooter...I mean really? I really wanted to walk out of the theater about 30 minutes into this film. There isn't enough room in this comment box to enable me to voice the downfalls of this film. However I feel as though I must include this side note on society as well. On top of whole fate and immovable beliefs tangent from above the fact that movies like this can go over well in America is a great example of how dumbed down culture is making us...Oh let's make an action movie with a loom that dictates who should live and who should die...oh yea...and the assassins can bone physics with no rationale as to how...It truly made me sick. What luck for rulers that men do not think.  Adolf Hitler. It's understandable how we get leaders like George W Bush when movies like this are not only accepted but admired. Now if you will excuse me I need to read my binary sweatshirt for what to eat tonight.".

There's not a single element of realism in this movie  it's a very sad attempt to try  make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.I'd normally class Morgan Freeman  Angelina Jolie as a good cast but sadly they've got awful roles. The script itself is truly dire based on a comic I've never read or heard of ever.Basically we're in a world of superhero assassins where their abilities are right out of The Matrix. The film borrows heavily from things like Bulletproof Monk I don't actually think there's a single original idea in the whole movie and viewers are expecting to suspend way too much belief.The film has too much action yes you read that right! Too much! and suffers in the same way Bad Boys 2 did just having action scenes for the sake of it because there was no plot or script to follow so they'd just engineer an action sequence for no reason at all than seeing the hero or the other assassins use their magical powers.We're following Wesley Gibson a nobody who is dragged into the world of the assassins and trains to become one to kill the man who killed his father. Except thats not the case the man he kills IS his father and the guy in charge of the assassins Morgan Freeman in possibly his worst movie role ever has started to create targets for his own profit.The film is truly awful ignore the plot because it's nonexistent. Enjoy looking at Fox Angelina Jolie until she decides to kill herself near the end of the film. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused  his character could have done much more.If you can ignore the ridiculous special effects CGI and over the top action sequences then you might get a bit of pleasure from watching this. Personally I hated it and if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best bits of the movie as it really doesn't get any better than the trailer.".

James McAvoy totally lets himself down in this role he was brilliant in Last King of Scotland but doesn't do himself justice as soon as he starts speaking in a pretty naff American accent. His character isn't that believable and his excessive swearing makes him more unrealistic instead of realistic. The rest of the cast including veteran Morgan Freeman are paperthin characters which also lets them down as actors. As the characters die it is difficult to be upset as you barely know them or sympathise with them.Although there were some interesting twists in the end they fail to salvage a film that's only purpose was to try and lure people in with mindless violence blood and bad language with very little substance. The script is also quite poor like many modern action films. In my view this is trying to outdo Goodfellas in violence bad language and blood but otherwise would fail miserably in competing on the scale of quality and credibility.

And so when I entered the theater with a friend on an advance screening pass comic book store owners are very nice people to befriend fear gripped me. It HAS to suck...right? It's Hollywood...and a loose adaptation...And so once the credits rolled and I was one of the many people laughing and clapping the fear had long passed.The films works. It provides the amazing opiate of style and dark humor and in such massive quantities that both evoke the spirit of the source material and utterly ignore the latter 90 of the graphic novel. But that independent streak works for Wanted. You feel a sense of amused wonder and curiosity throughout and all the plot twists that follow are different enough from the source to actually hold your attention without ever being prematurely obvious.James McAvoy does an excellent job and his wry sarcastic narration sets the mood of the film perfectly. His evolution from pansy to Neo has a genuine and pleasantly arrogant feel to it although the stereotypical Rockyesquire training montage is used to speed things up a bit what a tiresome tool. Basically his version of a cinematic Neo is both smarter more entertaining and more intelligent.Backing him up more with sexy looks and an I'm too cool for you you're not Brad attitude than anything is Angelina Jolie. Her character screams Trinity. And loudly. Regardless watching her onscreen is a pleasure. She's terribly likable and extremely lethal throughout.Morgan Freeman's Morpheus called Sloan here is played well although the role is a bit beneath his skill as an actor. He makes it work though playing the wizened and mature helper very well. More importantly he delivers an excellent and unexpected line that rivals Samuel L. Jackson's memorable expression from Snakes on a Plane. That alone makes any price of admission worthwhile.Any other character serves as nothing more than white noise there to populate the world rather than intrigue.The theme of Wanted is all about taking charge of your life and making your own choices something that the very premise of the first hour of the film both adheres to and contradicts. Rather than analyze it here and waste time arguing the pleasantly mad logic of a movie where bullets bend stylishly I'll leave that to the people who inevitably will assuming the bulletfu and gore don't completely captivate them and they should. Wanted IS violent truly and yet it doesn't strive to turn every frame into a gory actionpacked orgasm. The film handles it with grace and a style I sorely wish more action movies took into consideration.As bullets curve heads get punctured hilarity ensues and rats explode peanut butter rocks BTW you'll smile besides yourself.This really isn't a superhero comic adaptation...it's The Matrix with a great sense of humor.Enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the naysaying... but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure the movie takes some liberties with plot and obviously physics but it makes for a fun actionpopcorn movie. It is after all just a movie. After seeing this film I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a deadend life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.The quirk with the Fraternity is that it's assassin's have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically bullettime. So you can expect a lot of overthetop stunts including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie I don't know. It's not really overused and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley's training with the Fraternity. The film also has a twist ending though it isn't difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan the overseer of the Fraternity and it's the first time I've seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film though I guess it's to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting Kill THIS motherfa in a film. Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox though I'm biased to the point where I'd love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson I had not seen any of McAvoy's previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek anxietyridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I've read quite a few complaints about this film I can't understand why. It's a guiltypleasure action film and it's not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It's just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film just sit back disengage your brain and enjoy the nonstop action and fun characters.".

At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like  The last King of Scotland  and ' Wimbledon . When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease.

You get the idea. This is put simply the pauper's Matrix. It wouldn't make for particularly interesting reading for me to recount just how many similarities there are between the two films it'd fill several hundred pages of doublesided A4 for a start but the overall difference in tone is mildly fascinating.It wasn't hard to empathize with Neo in the earlier film the Wachowski brothers clearly relished and nurtured the sense of wonder and excitement of his journey making the film's stratospherical success easy to understand. In Wanted after taking a plotunbalancing length of time to establish McAvoy as an ordinary joe who is ...a loser. Just like you... a sentiment that the film keeps repeating it then turns him after his lengthy 'training' sessions which amount to nothing more than him being repeatedly beaten and no I am not making this up into an arrogant belligerent ahole. The film pukes its cards on the table most succinctly with its final line of dialogue. After narrating his character's transformation for us over a sequence featuring yet another bloody slowmotion head shot McAvoy turns to the camera and says What the fk have you done lately? which I'm happy to report resulted in a smattering of mild applause at the screening I attended not for the dialogue but for the truly estimable chap who screamed FK OFF!!! at the screen as the credits began to roll. All of this wouldn't matter if the film was any good at all but it ain't. The action sequences are murky and unimaginative. The actors are given absolutely nothing to do Morgan Freeman in particular appears to be barely alive during his few brief scenes. Its derivative its stupid its condescending and its boring. Boy... is it boring!This is the best approximation of a turkey that you're gonna see before Thanksgiving. Chow down at your own risk.".

	schema:reviewBody "Putting it bluntly 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly office shutin with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination a world of flipping cars extreme gun fights and mindaltering stunts thus shedding every bit of his shy weak self. This we've all seen before.Where 'WANTED' stands apart from any other action film I've seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this perhaps I'm living the same existence as Wesley and I'm missing out. The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The AList cast delivers solid performances but the script they are given  with the exception of the last line uttered in the film  is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it  something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox  a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic however we've seen this character on her before. Still she does it well. Freeman as usual injects intelligence into his role playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However for all the edgy extreme events the film contains the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch it is never revealed who  if anyone  controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the highoctane action they desire. Lastly the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75 of the time but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mindbending stunts unique filmography and breathtaking visuals  yes Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story but in the execution of its stunts and action. 710.".

The film's major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.The AList cast delivers solid performances but the script they are given  with the exception of the last line uttered in the film  is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn't know how to change it  something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox  a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic however we've seen this character on her before. Still she does it well. Freeman as usual injects intelligence into his role playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.However for all the edgy extreme events the film contains the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch it is never revealed who  if anyone  controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don't ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It's the film's easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the highoctane action they desire. Lastly the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.When the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75 of the time but you won't care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mindbending stunts unique filmography and breathtaking visuals  yes Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story but in the execution of its stunts and action. 710.";

This is NOT James Bond Bourne or Die Hard. This is exactly the opposite. This movie in my opinion simply tries to make fun of all those movies. It's all a sarcastic view of today's action movies. Just like the bullets  bent to the fullest. For me it's more of an action comedy. The ideas are so stupid that it's funny. Why? Because it was fit in the action movie. I mean come on  the loom the bullets the healing stearine the rats... How can you ever compare it to any action movie that tries to be serious? This is not trying to do that. That's why I liked this movie  for its intelligent sarcasm and probably because of all the negative comments from people that expected a mature action movie and didn't understand the movie.".

I knew I was going to a violent action film I knew its story was about assassins and I am neither religious nor squeamish about screen violence when it serves a good story  but I did not agree to have my face rubbed in corpses of little old ladies impaled on meat hooks and used as firing range targets in geysers of blood bone brains and random gore spurting in extreme closeup and slomo from the craniums of Morgan Freeman Angelina Jolie and 48 for 50 minor others then repeated in reverse. Hollywood is sick. It is so devoid of able writers that it's reduced to serving up buckets of gratuitous graphic gore and human atrocities sufficient to nauseate Josef Mengele so as to fill that gaping void where a coherent story and more importantly a civilized code of ethics ought to be.In yet another of Hollywood's weird adolescenttype cries for help this film is yet another packed with gratuitous Beavis  Buttheadcaliber profanity between every fourth or fifth word of dialog. It's that thing where teenagers think that grownuptype bad words will impress all observers into ooohs and aaaahs and thereby obscure desperatelyconcealed deficiencies of character. Or maybe these writers assume their presumptive audience will be just as juvenile as they. Rather pathetic in any case now epidemic in Hollyweird. Again I am specifically not a WCTUtype religious fundamentalist  but it doesn't take much mental effort to understand the contempt for humanity and the impotent frustration with life that are implicit to gratuitous profanity. To hear actors of the caliber of Morgan Freeman agreeing to deliver that pathetic tripe is just painful. On the plus side there were some excellent action sequences and enjoyable spectacle  the train derailment sequence and the car chases managed to be original even balletic. None of the action in this film was plausible in context of basic physics of course but the film managed to suspend disbelief adequately to compensate.Unfortunately along with the walltowall human butchery and pottymouth dialog the story never rose above lame and sloppy. The intrigue of a secret order was quickly abandoned as a mere detail of setting the Loom of Fate apparently ran itself since no explanation was given as to who or what set it in motion the actors almost to a one were mere foils for extravagant and again atrocious visuals. I won't even bother to go into the contemptible Sling Blade ethic of Murder is AOK if you have a good reason. Suffice it to stand as a stark reminder of where Hollywood's proctological worldview has inevitably taken it.Bottom line Wanted is a film that left me feeling in equal parts annoyance disappointment and an overpowering desire to go home and wash.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't excited to see Wanted. I'm back in America for the summer and I was going to the movies with a friend and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with Angelina Jolie so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see. Personally I don't understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor but I have to admit she looks good with a gun so I decided to check out the movie.In perusing some of the reviews on the IMDb it seems that people either loved it or hated it. I liked it a lot although you have to understand that it's what I call an overthetop action movie where everything is taken to the extreme see Shoot 'Em Up. With movies like this the goal is spectacle not realism. Hence all of these piddly complaints about the physics involved in bending bullets are rendered meaningless.Why would you complain about realistic stunts when cars can flip through the air with precision and then accelerate off the side of a bus? Or when superassassins can throw bullet curveballs? Is it not obvious what that this is not exactly cinema verite? I have to agree that some of the plot devices are a little witless a magic loom that weaves fate? Come on... but the action is outstanding to say the least. Angelina has clearly been working on her war face every time she fired her gun and showed that grimace I could only imagine her in her cavernous mansion practicing for hours on end in front of a mirror but especially in comparison to a lot of the garbage sent to theaters these days the entertainment is high.The movie is loud fast and explosive but not exactly a cognitive workout. It's great as an hour and a half of action entertainment and it's also fun to pick out the scenes that feed off of other films the most obvious to me being Office Space one of my favorite comedies.I have only recently become aware of James McAvoy after seeing The Last King of Scotland and Atonement which in a single shot features by McAvoy one of the finest pieces of acting I've ever seen in a movie  see my Atonement review... and while he doesn't exactly knock my socks off here with his performance he's perfect for the role and pulls off a disillusioned bluecollar American perfectly. Add him to the list of British actors so talented that many moviegoers didn't even know he was British.To a greater extent than McAvoy obviously the great Morgan Freeman is also clearly just having a good time here. The material is distantly below his talents as it is for McAvoy but at the same time I see no reason why actors of his caliber shouldn't do a movie like this every once in a while. Shoot 'Em Up as well is also distantly below the talents of Clive Owen but MAN he was good in it! Angelina Jolie however fits right in here because this is the kind of movie that she is best in. I am thrilled by the way to have read that she has been ordered to gain weight for her next role partly so she will be attractive again and partly so she won't faint on set like she did while making this movie.At any rate I won't say to ignore all of the bad press about the movie because it's true that a lot of people won't like it but it seems a perfect example of a movie that if you go in with the right state of mind it can be great fun. The cleverness of the highly choreographed stunts for me often outweighed my lack of belief. Enjoy!".

The only problem is if you have't read the comic book every farfetched ridiculous plot point and scene seems just that farfetched and ridiculous.So what about the action scenes? The preview made it look great right? If you like beautifully crafted action scenes then you are in for a rock and roll time... for about 25 percent of the movie if that. Whenever an action scene pops up it does something exciting and fun to watch and then suddenly disappears in an instant leaving us with our narrator and central character Wesley droning on and on for the next 20 or so minutes.And what else do we get with him? Aside from a poor Chicago accent we get a very boring unsympathetic character who is able to accept his fate without any real believable scrutiny and somehow miraculously learns to become the best assassin ever in a matter of about two weeks or so. And don't get me started on how all of these amazing assassins all throughout the film drop like flies one after another while none of them can compete with our hero Wesley who just picked up the job a short while ago. But I suppose I should concede something. I mean Wesley does have his amazing 400 heartrate that gives him adrenaline instead of a heart attack.But wait there's more! We also have the wonderful privilege of his incessant whining about his pathetic life it is a style of narration extremely reminiscent of Edward Norton's character in Flight Club. I'll paraphrase for you I am a loser who buys IKEA furniture and who wades through life without meaning. You are a loser too. You and I are just alike. Keep watching me in all my loserness and I will keep pointing out to you in every other scene that you are a loser too. Despite not actually being a loser I found this to be quite aggravating. I didn't pay ten bucks for a movie to be told over and over again that I am doing nothing with my life. Does Hollywood or at least the film's writersdirector really believe that because someone is at a movie that they are as big of a loser as our little character Wesley here? And the last line of the film simply sealed that annoyance for me.But it wasn't all bad. If you like Angelina Jolie she looks just as good in this as she has in previous shoot 'em up thrillers. Moreover you even get to see her partially naked so who can argue with that right? And what about all of those awesome action scenes I mentioned? On the rare occasion they actually popped up I admit they were indeed fun and entertaining albeit unbelievable.Unfortunately I found myself in disbelief at all of the phenomenal feats they were accomplishing throughout the feature during said action scenes. Our main character as well as others has the unique ability to pump out an over 400 heartrate giving them nasty abilities like jumping tall buildings in a single bound and slowing down time and most of all the uncanny ability to curve the angle of bullets as they are fired.Now I am not one without an ability to suspend disbelief. Shooting wings off the fly? Sure. Curving a bullet as its fired so it can slightly bend around an object and hit something behind it? Sure why not? But when it comes right down to it when you have a single bullet fired from a gun and it curves around a 360 degree angle blowing through 9 different skulls of the most prominent assassins in the world and the bullet flies in a perfect circle killing everyone with no ducking or anything? Sorry. Angelina who fired this bullet is just human. And bullets just don't do that. And in the end or more specifically about halfway through the preposterousness that is this film all I wanted was for one of those bullets to fire off curve its way through the movie screen and just end the torture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Calling all Steve Buscemi fans! I started watching this movie on cable quite by accident. In the opening scene I thought I recognized a friend of mine in a minor role and while waiting for him to reappear and see if it was in fact him I found myself captivated with this brilliant little indie until the end. Steve Buscemi is one of the best and most interesting American actors today. Check him out in his early role as Nick in Parting Glances from 1985. He elevates the level of every movie he does. Although this film doesn't need any help from him. It's good. REALLY good. It is a character study. And as with most character studies the characters studied are somewhat unpleasant and maybe not very sympathetic. But in this movie they are well worth taking a closer look at.Les Galantine Steve Buscemi is the dregs of the paparazzi. He lives in a crap hole apartment in a bad neighborhood and the only thing worse than the neighborhood he lives in is the inside of his apartment. He has horrible parents whom he still visits and has attachments to. And when we see the three of them together it is very sad. A homeless guy named Toby Michael Pitt weasels his way into Les's life and his crap hole apartment and is eventually promoted from nonrentpaying roommate who sleeps in the closet to paparazzi's assistant. Had enough yet? There's more. Wait until K'Harma Leeds pop diva shows up with her entourage. At one point we see her sitting before a Magnus Chord Organ like the one I got for Christmas in 1974 composing her next hit. When we later see her perform it at a music awards show we realize what a joke it was that she agonized over whether to use the word searching or looking because her ONLY talent is that she lip syncs and dances like a stripper i.e. a pop diva. The relationship between Les Galantine and Toby is the centerpiece of the story. Les is needy and repulsive all at the same time. He perspires desperation and fear of abandonment. Toby goes with the flow. And the flow eventually takes him from homeless guy to pop diva hanger oner to star of his own really really bad TV show called Toby where he plays a homeless serial killer named Toby. And just a quick reminder here his name in real life is Toby. This show is so bad they couldn't even be bothered to imagine a different name for the main character so they just used the name of it's star. His rise to stardom his romantic intrigues and his go with the flow style of living are all expertly written as commentary on the vapid lives and personalities of people who are famous for being famous. The writing and directing by Tom Dicillo is witty poignant and surgical in it's precision. There is not a wasted word or moment anywhere.Steve Buscemi is great in everything he does. He is brilliant in Delirious . Michael Pitt plays Toby with a warmth and sympathy that makes the process of getting a closer look at those around him tolerable. Honestly I don't think I'm in the Michael Pitt demographic and I've never really gotten him as an actor until this film. He expertly ties all the disparate elements of these characters Les Galantine the talentless pop diva Allison Lohman the casting agent Gina Gershon and their stories together in a very compelling performance. I have way big respect for him now...It is not explicitly spelled out but I would like to go on record here to say that I think Les Galantine is gay and in love with Toby. And although that's not central to the story line it does inform us somewhat about this sad injured creature. Steve Buscemi as Les Galantine is hard to watch and hard to pull away from from beginning to end. That's talent. Equal credit has to go to the writerdirector Tom Dicillo. The story sometimes mocking sometimes tender is written and executed perfectly. The pace is perfect. When it's done you don't even know where the time went. If you like well made interesting movies with gobs of talent from beginning to end watch this one. The ending will surprise you and the journey is well worth it no matter what. By the way my friend was not in this movie and the character I thought he was playing never showed up again...".

What you get with this movie is a very solid performance from Michael Pitt who plays Toby a homeless kid in his early 20s that through a chance encounter finds a friend in struggling paparazzi Len played by a on fire Steve Bescumi. The movie follows Toby across a wide range of changes in his life that puts a strain on his relationship with Les and questions how far apart are those in front of the camera from those behind it. Micheal Pitt really breaks out here playing the role of Toby with a very natural wide eyed enthusiasm that wins over the audience from the beginning. Steve Buscemi tears it up in this role as the edgy Les he perfectly portrays a loner who deeply wants to be something more then the despised paparazzi that he is. Some nice performances from Gina Gershon and Alison Lohman round out the cast. I felt entertained and satisfied by the end of the movie however film takes a a misguided turn at one point and I could fell most everyone in the audience thought it was regretful on the directors part and felt out of place in the movie. In the end though the film still works unfortunate plot twist aside you've got quality acting fresh cinema and a excellent soundtrack that adds up to a solid experience.".

Probably the more impressive performance is Buscemi's who you can believe might have wanted to pass on this low budget indie. That would have been a great error as for my money this is his most memorable role by far.Mr Buscemi easily captures your attention and holds it throughout the film not that Les is the most admirable of people. He's often barely tolerable and unduly selfabsorbed at the most inopportune moments in complete contrast to his wannabe assistant Toby. Michael Pitt plays Toby with affection as though he wishes his reallife counterparts well. And then there's Alison Lohman as the rising young fan magnet K'Harma Leeds and Gina Gershon as the publicist and agent Dana. All the leads are played extremely well and are peculiarly memorable. But it took a little bit of magic to have brought all these players together with an entertaining script and actually pull it off. And the credit has to go to Tom DiCillo who obviously has the knack.

This movie is so deep in a very entertaining way you feel as if you just read a classical novel instead of the silly flicks we all are so accustomed to see these days. Steve Buscemi's captivating performance Michael Pitt's innocent yet noble attitude Gina Gerswin Allison and Callie's brilliant and lovable performances just drags you into the movie where you feel a connection with most if not all of the leads... It is not a fast paced action movie it will not make you sit on the edge of your seat throughout but you will feel enriched when you leave. Tom Dicillo has outdone himself and certainly many others! We all need more movies like Delirious.".

What makes the movie is the way the story follows Pitt's innocent progression up the celebrity ladder while at the same time chronicles Buscemi's growing jealousy and despair at having lost his only true friend and his antagonism that he very indirectly helped him acquire this new found fame and fortune. Great cast who all worked well with each other great suspense at the end and a good parody of the whole celebrity industry currently on starz don't miss it!".

Steve Buscemi was great in Reservoir Dogs Fargo Trees Lounge The Saprano's and even Gforce. I really have to give him credit on this one too. He is absolutely passionate within the role of a semisuccessful Paparazzi who takes unstaged photographs of the famous or nearly famous.His character Les is not the most admirable or likable person. In fact he is often selfabsorbed spouting off his philosophical beliefs to his assistant Toby played incredibly by Michael Pitt. However it's Les' quirks that have the greatest impact on Toby when he obtains some form of stardom as he often quotes Les in terms of his feelings and beliefs. Alison Lohman plays K'Harma and does a great job.The twist at the end which is heightened by the tension between Les and Toby was great. This movie could have been a tragedy but it ended up being a sweet incredible story about relationships and romance.".

Toby is a homeless man turned actor with the help of Les. It was enjoyable seeing this process take Toby gradually to the top. Just proves that anything in this world can happen. Sometimes it's just a matter of being at the right place at the right time. Which brings me to Alison Lohman who played K'Harma Leeds. K'Harma is a famous singer. Toby being at the right place right time with K'Harma helped launch his soon to be career. I also enjoyed Gina Gershon who played Dana a casting director. Overall a very enjoyable film about the filmTV world. Oh and about the paparazzi who follows them of course.".

But on Delirious he only gets it right some of the time. He's out to at first it seems make a satire on media hype and celebrity and the inanities of shallow attention given to people who don't do much to deserve it if you need proof of that watch the Soup on E!. But then it goes a little in a different direction which I respected and wanted to go along with as a fablefairytale where Toby Michael Pitt is just about the nicest most generous and fishoutofdumpster homeless kid who somehow becomes an 'assistant' to fledgling photographer Les Steve Buscemi who shows him the ropes and introduces him to a casting director Gina Gershon and eventually accidentally of course falls into the company of a pop star Alison Lohman as the two all but fall in love on first sight.Good premise and scenes between Buscemi and Pitt most often work the best and funniest as one sees subtle layers peeled by Les's pathetic paparazzi who just doesn't admit he's not ambitious enough to be marginalized as a photographer. There's even some good comedy thrown around the kind that is that strange absurdity that we also saw in 'Oblivion'. But somehow it just didn't all click for me after a while. There's a very bitter pill being sent out in often very corny and illshot scenes the latter of which I could accept but for one brief instant as Toby walks back to Les's place the morning after he's had that whirlwind night with Lohman I was shocked at how cheesy a scene it turned into. The problem also is that it's difficult to mix such a delicate romanticfable angle while also working in some mockery at the entertainment business. It's all in good amusement to see the reality serialkiller show being directed for realism but it all doesn't lead up to anything significant to say past some shallow messages.Maybe I didn't see what others have been it's become a minor little hit with most and I'm sure if you have any desire to see actors like Buscemi and Pitt and Lohman who is also very good and Gershon and hey there's even a really hip and hilarious cameo from Elvis Costello you'll seek it out anyway.

The plot follows a minor celebrity photographer Les Galantine Steve Buscemi has big dreams but he can't quite talk himself into the right parties to get that one great exclusive photo. He meets Toby Grace Michael Pitt a homeless kid who is drawn to the bright lights of New York City with a desire to one day achieve stardom himself and hires him as his assistant. Alison Lohman also stars as Toby's love interest as a pop musician K'Harma Leeds alongside a guest appearance by Gina Gershon.The last we saw of Tom DiCillo Double Whammy Living in Oblivion and Steve Buscemi Armageddon Con air was on the set of Double Whammy 2001 when they collaborated to form a rather mediocre film along with the infamous Dennis Leary. This time around with the introduction of Michael Pitt Bully The Dreamers and Alison Lohman White Oleander Matchstick Men along with a cameo by Elvis Costello Cold Mountain Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me who also provides some of the music for the soundtrack DiCillo a former Sundance winner is surely here to make his mark. Delirious has already won awards at the San Sebastin International Film Festival for Best Director and Best Screenplay and is currently sweeping audiences of their feet at The Sundance Film Festival.Delirious explores the theme of datingexploring the celebrity lifestyle which has been around in Hollywood for a while from movies like Paparazzi 1998I to Being John Malkovich 1999 and Almost Famous 2000 among many others. This film promises to deliver the glamour of the shallow celebrity lifestyle in contrast with another prominent theme of the irony that separates appearance vs. reality in Hollywood. The soundtrack shows potential with most of the music delivered by Elvis Costello himself.In conclusion be stoked for delirious because it promises to be hilarious but with a little twist! I recommend you check this movie out as soon as it hits theatres near you in New York City August 15th 2007 Los Angeles August 17th 2007 and Chicago August 31st 2007 just to name a few.

Somehow the homelier regular folk make the beautiful people beautiful a metaphor for the whole celebrity industry.These stars shine. There is nothing assuming. It is an understated bit of film making that simply uses the medium to tell its tale.

	schema:headline " Rule number one Buscemi is always funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Les Steve Buscemi is an amateur celebrity photographer who longs to get better shots that are worth more money. Yet time and again clubs and venues where stars may be eating or partying have bouncers. Bouncers that tell Les to get lost. One day by chance Les and a crowd of shutterbugs like him make an attempt to photograph a hot young singing star K'Harma Alison Lohman. No one gets much but Les meets an affable guy Toby Michael Pitt. Turns out Toby is homeless and has a vague inclination to be a movie star. On a whim Les offers Toby a chance to bunk with him for the night. Once back at Les' small apartment Toby starts cleaning up a few things hoping to help Les for his graciousness. Les is a bit annoyed at that. But the older man loves having the idea of an underling to lecture. Soon every other phrase out of Les' mouth is rule number one as he gives Toby pointers about photography and life. One night turns into days and the two men hang out even snagging a photo that sells on the Internet for 700! After this Les drags Toby over to his aging parents house but its not clear why. The older folks are not impressed with Les' news of the 700 bucks and they are categorically critical and unpleasant. The two leave soon. Not long after Toby actually MEETS K'Harma and she likes his looks. Soon they are hanging out. But will Toby let Les capitalize on this great chance to photograph K'Harma and those around her? If he doesn't how grateful is that? This film has truly great cast members who elevate the material. Buscemi is a stitch as his mantra of rule number one becomes an infinite number of rules. Pitt is adorable as the erstwhile actor while Lohman is comical also as the insecure star who wants her own fragrance and demands many things of her staff. All other matters are fine costumes sets script and direction but nothing out of the ordinary. Therefore if you like Buscemi or any other cast member do find it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les a self proclaimed photo journalist can be found at many of the media events in Manhattan on any given night. He is tough but alas he is not as fortunate in his work. There are others with better connections that get to places where Les cannot fathom to go. His luck is about to change much to his surprise when he meets Toby a homeless young man trying to eke a living in New York. Toby is a perfect match for Les. When the two meet Les has been waiting to get a picture on the luscious K'Harma a singer with a lousy love life.Les buys into the idea that Toby can be his assistant when they meet again. Toby is asked to come to stay in Les' dilapidated Chinatown apartment. One thing though Toby is not to mess around with the computer where Les keeps his files. Things change for Les as he takes Toby into his home even though he never trusts the kid. Les is a hoarder always insisting in taking the gift bags that are given at any of the events.Les begins to get lucky. With Toby's help he snaps a picture of an actor as he comes out of a private doctor's office where he has undergone a procedure that has to do with his penis. That picture brings him seven hundred dollars and the temporary fame that goes with it. When Les brings Toby to his parents' home. All the parents want to know is whether Toby with his good looks is gay. Evidently they have their doubts about the strange pairing he makes with their own Les.Toby doesn't realize his life is about to change when he happens to be innocently standing next to K'Harma at an event he is helping Les to cover. K'Harma likes what she sees inviting the young man to the VIP lounge and later on to her hotel where they spend the night without engaging in sex. Les wants to get to be near the singer because she is hot. The opportunity comes in the way of an invitation to K'Harma's own birthday party. Les unfortunately decided to bring a small camera to take pictures of the celebrities at the party something that annoys the guests and the birthday girl. Eventually Toby discovers the truth about Les' intentions for selling the party's photographs to a trashy magazine and bolts from Les' apartment.Toby catches the eye of Dana a casting director. He is asked to play an ongoing part in a series based more or less on his own experiences surviving in the city. Toby who becomes a minor celebrity is reunited with K'Harma as they both attend an event that put them together in the red carpet while Les who has come to deal with his former assistant is singled out among the crowd by none other than Toby himself.Tom DiCillo the director of Delirious is a man that is familiar with the trappings of celebrity as he has shown in some of his other movies. Mr. DiCillo knows about hype and what is real and what's not. He takes an incisive look at all the phoniness of that silly world in which illiterate nobodies have their fifteen minutes worth of fame and how they burn after their lack of talent make them disappear from the scene. Les is an empty soul trying to make a living out of that unreal world. He is one of the many predators trying to take the shot that will sell in the printed media at all costs.Steve Buscemi is perfect as Les. Mr. Buscemi who has worked with the director before does an amazing job creating this reptilian character that doesn't show any redeeming qualities and who feeds the public's appetite for gossip and the latest dirt. Michael Pitt does an amazing job as Toby the sweet street guy. Alison Lohman plays K'Harma. There are many many well known faces in the cast. Tom Aldredge and Doris Belack are good as Les' parents. Gina Gershon shines as Dana the casting director with an ulterior motive.Frank DeMarco the cinematographer captures the Manhattan of the late night crowd. Good views of the Meat Packing District and other locales. Anton Sanko's score blends well in the background.The film is highly recommended to Tom DiCillo's and Steve Buscemi's fans. They will not be disappointed.".

When he gets his shot at fame Pitt's relationship with Buscemi becomes strained...This starts out like it might be a modern Midnight Cowboy 1969 then wanders into Star 80 1983 territory. Delirious ends up being closer to a satire on celebrity. The thesis is never quite fronted although director Tom DiCillo certainly does it with style. Buscemi contributes an engaging manic characterization suggestively managing to make the story seem like something greater. Everyone else is fine with foulmouthed parents Doris Belack as Lois and Tom Aldredge as Carl providing a veteran treat. The song selection and soundtrack are very strong.

The lighting and photography are exquisitely dark and real. The editing is humorously witty a paper is thrown down in one scene and a bomb goes off on the television in the next which sets up the emotional tension in the next scene exquisitely you'll recognize this if you see the picture!!! I especially enjoyed listening to the director give his take on the DVD as the movie plays. He has his doctor there to supervise him with thorazine an occasional shot of JD whiskey how cool is that! I guess you might say who knows what is real or unreal about life anyhow!? He could really be crazy I doubt that!! So you essentially get two movies for the price of one. A fine movie and wonderful bonus ability to see the movie again with director commentary. Just Brilliant. I must say that Steve Buscemi's acting is exquisite. He could have been a great silent film era actor All one has to do is turn the sound off and watch his expressions. Not over acted but superbly expressed with a realistic demeanor. Love this actor!!! Not a handsome actor but a real one which I prefer over the prior.Please if you have any cinematographic artistic LOVE in your spine don't you dare miss DELIRIOUS!!!".

It's more about trust and friendship than jokes.

Without any real connections to anybody else without any real friends.Once again Steve Buscemi gives a stellar performance even if this is not his best. Buscemi is to me one of the most underrated actors out there. However it is a shame that his character in Delirious Les Galantine is a pretty sad one. Les is egoistic and has big problems with trusting anyone else and letting someone in close. His character is very much not especially funny. Unfortunately. Buscemi has the talent to give his character a much more comic aspect but I don't think that that was the idea here.Pitt is also good as the nave and confirmation seeking Toby. He has dreams but his humble situation makes him thankful for anything that comes his way. His journey is the longest and reaches from almost the deepest low to the highest point on the status ladder and he has not always an easy time to handle that change. The conflicts that arise between him and Les is interesting.It is a good movie especially if you don't expect a wacky one from the outset. Good cast and an interesting story.

Zaror's character is lovable you can't help to feel the rightness of his cause in a much deeper way than other superheroes movies like Spiderman cause he is real! The TV's abuse on Miragamen is also a good metaphor on how the Chilean media is. The only thing I hope is that they don't make a second part...

He doesn't have a police scanner or anything so he has to rely on people emailing him their problems to find out where to be which some people abuse naturally.Mirageman is no god among men either he gets surprised beaten within an inch of his life and wonders what the hell made him think he could do this after a disastrous setback.

	schema:reviewBody "Here comes a new superhero movie from Chile? Why not? This is not a typical superhero story. In fact 'super' is downright inaccurate while 'hero' just barely applies  at first.Marko Zaror a stuntman and reputed martial artist stars as Maco a quiet and respectful bouncer working at a local strip club. When not working Maco is a fitness and workout nut. The seemingly gratuitous scenes showing Maco working out charting calories and taking amino acids seem like filler at first but what the film is doing is introducing the character and showing his solitary life that contains little meaning outside of fitness and his institutionalized brother.Maco's family was brutally attacked three years earlier. In the attack the father and mother were murdered the youngest brother beaten and sodomized and Maco was beaten to near death. Since that time Maco has been training working out fanatically practicing martial arts for something. Maco's brother is in a mental hospital due to the severe trauma of the murder and rape.One night while jogging Maco stumbles across a robbery in progress outside of a suburban house. After instinctively disabling one bad guy Maco hears screams coming from inside the house. Maco grabs the bad guy's mask and enters surprising the bad guys and saving the day. One of the rescued victims is ambitions tabloid television reporter Carol V Mara Elena Swett.Carol V broadcasts a commentary piece the next night on her television show in which she calls the man that rescued her a hero without a Batmobile or cape. Maco is stunned by the reaction and the gears in his head start clicking. The gears become unstoppable when Maco visits his brother at the institution. For the first time since the attack Maco's brother is responsive. It seems he was inspired by the report of the regular guy superhero. Maco then becomes convinced that he can stop the type of evil that happened to his parents inspire his brother to get better and perhaps earn the adoration of such public as Carol V.Mirageman is a difficult and ultimately rewarding movie. In it's short 87 minute running time Mirageman changes tone three different times. By far the most amusing scenes come early in Maco's career as Mirageman. Mirageman has to fight what would be the first real life challenge of any superhero Practicality. Mirageman has to overcome cumbersome costume difficulties which include time required to change into the costume and where to stash his nonhero clothes. And of course transportation. Although Maco's origin story is similar to Bruce Wayne Maco is no billionaire. His costume is pieced together from a sporting goods store and he owns no car. At first he takes the bus when battling villainy. Mirageman also revels in the bellybouncing glee of how a superhero must hold himself while walking around. The Dark Knight and SpiderMan never shows the viewer what it's like when the Caped Crusader or the WebSlinger has to say simply walk up stairs or down a hallway. How would they act while doing the mundane? Marco deals with that as Mirageman. The extended sequences showing the costumed Mirageman 'creeping' in bright sunlight with his arms held to ready like an arcade game are both funny and uncomfortably awkward.The second tone of Mirageman deals with the life of a hero after he's sorta figured it out. This includes the surprising public reaction to their very own superhero and the ways that a simple masked man trying to do good can be exploited and become something of which he never wished. Maco also has to deal with what fans he has and hopefully deal with that embarrassing transportation issue. Maybe a sidekick would be just the thing? Maco goes through many transformations during the movie. I honestly can't remember more than one or two lines that Zaror has as Maco. Most of the character building is deftly conveyed using what the viewer already knows about 'superheros' and situational drama. Although he never says it we feel Maco's pain inadequacies and sense of justice. The third tone is set as Maco has to deal with these issues and the very real likelihood that in order the make a real difference he may have to risk it all.The last act is brutal and realistic  a sharp contrast when compared to the relative camp of the opening act. One gets the feeling that this is what it would be like to take that mantel of responsibility.Mirageman is left exploring a final question. Does he truly want to be a Hero? from www.PopBunker.net popbunker".

The martial arts are good and although it's not Tony Jaa good the important thing is that it looks and feels very real. That is a first achievement. There are some funny scenes sort of self humor that have this WTF? potential and will make you laugh. Like when the Mirageman jumps from height to land bad on the hard asphalt and then he rubs his foot like it really hurt him. This small self humor is another achievement.The story is rubbish of course full with melodramatic moments and silly situations. The production value is very poor some of the street scenes were filmed with hidden camera and the reaction of people is real.The Mirageman is not bold thematically and mainly uses primitive and stereotypical tearful situations to awake some emotions in the viewer and create an empathy toward the heroic protagonist. You will find just a little complexity in this movie. But Mirageman explores some difficult issues too like what people are capable of in order to get famous the price of fame and what is it mean to be a hero and what are the reasons to be one. Overall the watching experience is very decent and it even gets some big reinforcement by the ending which is surprisingly good. The ending puts all the movie in the correct proportions tights properly the plot and delivers the movie as a good and solid product. The ending is the final and the biggest achievement.".

The problem is that the realism creates a silliness that probably wasn't fully intended. Its silly because you see how ridiculous the notion of a superhero is.

As could the editing. I think they did too much of this quick cut editing.I think Marko actually punched too fast in some of the fights. He punched so fast i couldn't see them. I think they should have told him to slow down so the viewers could actually see the punches. I didn't like the sound effect's they used for the punches. I think it literally lacked punch and bass. Other than that it was good. I really liked the reporter in this film named Carol Valdivieso.I was just glued to screen every time she appeared. I love those fine dark brown eyes. What a looker!. But one thing i didn't like was that she dyed her hair blond later in the film. I think she looked best with brown hair.

	schema:reviewBody "Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years even if Matchstick Men is not quite either's great contribution for this year in film.  What they have done from Eric Garcia's novel adapted by The Griffins come off rather entertaining if anything else and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film.  Nicolas Cage who plays Roy part anxiousobsessive compulsive part sly con man and part father to a daughter he never knew he had is a main reason to see this movie.  His performance is on par with someone like Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets for watchability of a truly sad lifestyle and while Nicholson's performance was and still is funnier and more charming Cage gets so into his character the little mannerisms that pop up more often than expected that we feel for the guy even as his eyes get twitchy and goes over certain spots in his house like a detective.  He may be the most believable obsessive compulsivecon man you'll see in a long while.  Add then an outgoing occasionally sneaky daughter Alison Lohman in a performance that skillfully balances sweetness and irritability sorrow and playfulness in a teenage girl to the mix along with a protgcumpartner a cool Sam Rockwell who has a loveloathe relationship Roy and there's the map work for an interesting if here and there predictable dramacomedycrime film. Along with the performances which are all above average Cage could be deserved of an Oscar nomination come February and Lohman could deserve the win possibly is the visual framework that Scott pushes in each scene.  By getting certain camera tricks and fantastic editing by Dody Dorn of 'Memento' fame the viewer can really get into Roy's head even in the smaller scenes the ones that have little to do with the plot and only to do with the neuroses of Roy there is even a little touch that I loved when Roy is waiting online early in the film at the supermarket and the music in the background is an excerpt of the mental hospital music from 'Cuckoo's Nest'. This echoes the style that Scorsese used in Bringing out the Dead also with Cage in moving the film to get so into the mood that the story no matter how intriguing and important becomes secondary.   Which brings me to my own personal beef with the movie and that is the last fifteen minutes or so.  It was clever up to a point but as it unfolded no matter how much I was still emotionally involved with these people I felt that the twists I won't reveal them here undermined a lot of the rest of the film.  It will be based on viewer to viewer but I just thought that it did a little too much to jab at Roy's lifestyle.  And yet when I walked out of the theater though I wasn't sure I had seen anything spectacular I didn't feel like I had wasted time and money either.  Matchstick Men is witty sometimes wonderful moviemaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years even if Matchstick Men is not quite either's great contribution for this year in film.  What they have done from Eric Garcia's novel adapted by The Griffins come off rather entertaining if anything else and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film.  Nicolas Cage who plays Roy part anxiousobsessive compulsive part sly con man and part father to a daughter he never knew he had is a main reason to see this movie.  His performance is on par with someone like Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets for watchability of a truly sad lifestyle and while Nicholson's performance was and still is funnier and more charming Cage gets so into his character the little mannerisms that pop up more often than expected that we feel for the guy even as his eyes get twitchy and goes over certain spots in his house like a detective.  He may be the most believable obsessive compulsivecon man you'll see in a long while.

	schema:headline " Nice change of pace for Ridley!";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest effort from Ridley Scott equates to Spielberg's latest Catch Me If You Can. It is a nice technically simple film that follows their more epic effects and set piece driven movies preceding them. Spielberg followed Minority Report and AI whereas Scott is following Gladiator Hannibal and Black Hawk Down. It is a nice and welcome change of pace for a master director as CMIYC was to Spielberg.The film stars Nicholas Cage who is making up for some lost years thanks to his role here and of course in Adaptation. Cage plays an obsessive compulsive con man who has an obsession of cleanliness and a fear germs and wide open spaces and is hyped up on prescription drugs. Cage is superb here it is a great performance amusing and likeable. This is the sort of quirky character that brings the best out of Nic Cage. Costarring as Cages partner in crime is the up and coming Sam Rockwell. I have been a fan of his since I first saw him in Charlie's Angels and then in his best role thus far in Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind. He was superb in Confessions and looks like he could be a top new star. Rockwell plays his character here with panache. Also starring as Cages daughter who turns up out the blue is Alison Lohman. Lohman is playing a 14 year old who Cage has never seen and didn't know of at the start of the film. Lohman is much older in real life and so playing a 14 year is something she can do well but with the maturity and actress of that actual age may not have. Lohman is a lovely presence she is charming and sweet and endearing to the audience she is also a good young actress.The film is funny charming and simplistic. It doesn't tax too much and is a quick and pleasant much like junk food only more good for you. I love it when Scott does his big epic and more elaborate films but this is a good change of pace that Scott must have really enjoyed. It is something he could do with his eyes closed compared to say Gladiator.The film is well paced and there is a great twist that lets the film end on a real high. This is a good use of a great cast and imaginatively edited. Overall a pleasing viewing. ".

We have a very personal upclose light drama here. Con artist movies have been swarming the theaters lately but Matchstick Men is far more intelligent and more surprising not to mention wellacted written and directed than Supercast films Heist and The Score. Nicolas Cage after several years of Baction movies Gone In 60 Seconds 8 mm The Rock FaceOff... makes a welcome return to what he does best  disturbed neurotic sensitive individuals a comeback that got off to a good start on the schizophrenic Adaptation  and delivers an Oscar nominationworthy performance as con artist Roy Waller. Roy discovers a longlost daughter played brilliantly by Alison Lohman  also Oscar material. The relationship between the two is well crafted and the story wonderfully written. Sam Rockwell also makes a fine contribution as Roy's partner.Elements of the plot may owe much to many other films  The Sting perhaps Jacky Brown and there's a bit of Leon AKA The Professional in Roy's relationship with his daughter trying to balance a life of crime with a newfound family and Lohman's performance is no less charming than that of Natalie Portman on that memorable classic. Worthy of praise is Ridley's directing which proves he can make a small human theater piece as well as grandiose historical epics and scifi odysseys. The editing is wonderful well visualizing Roy's condition and giving the movie an apt atmosphere. Overall Matchstick Men is one of the freshest films of the year and a very enjoyable watch.".

In one scene he attempts to prove to her that he can cook by preparing a spaghetti dinner...after one bite the scene shifts to the arrival of the Domino's delivery boy!Ultimately however MATCHSTICK MEN is a tale of 'The Con' and Cage and Rockwell's 'Sting' against 'fat cat' Bruce McGill while appearing deceptively simple has a series of twists and turns leading to a climax that is both stunning and unexpected.

He suffers from obsessivecompulsive disorder panic attacks and gets totally hysterical when people leave doors open don't take off their shoes get mud on his carpet etc. He takes pills for the many problems but he accidentally knocked them down the garbage disposal and is a big frantic mess now complete with nervous ticks of the face and exclamations of mmm... at the end of his sentences.That's a problem that severely interferes with his job as a con artist. He's not a con man he's not a ripoff man he's a con artist with added emphasis on the artist part. He views his job as a beauty a sort of majestic way of expressing himself but not really that's a lie it's just something that makes him sleep better at night.He hates his job because it makes him feel dirty. It's not fun ripping off old people or fat people but he is a high school drop out how else can he get a decent paying job?His partner Frank Mercer Sam Rockwell is a bit more at ease than Roy. He doesn't seem to mind his job all that much. Roy on the other hand is turning into a complete nut and after going to a recommended psychiatrist he musters up the courage to confront his 14yearold daughter Angela Alison Lohman who is eager to escape her controlling mother and check out her longlost big pop.The film has a lot of different stories going on  the worrywart who learns to put aside his nervous ticks the longlost father who reunites with his daughter and the con artist who tries to give it up for a normal life. They all succeed as a story but the film's only flaw is its wandering which goes on far too long.Who cares and I mean that as a statement not a question. The film is one of the great entertainments of the year. It has twists turns and a big streak of enjoyability running through it.Nicolas Cage is on a winning streak. First 2002's Oscarwinning Adaptation now this rumored to be entered into the Oscar race for 2004. Who would'a thunk it?Sam Rockwell Confessions of a Dangerous Mind continues to impress while Alison Lohman a 20something actress playing a teenager shines and convincingly portrays exactly what the character needs.Ridley Scott Alien the infamous British director uses some great camera techniques here  filmed in a blue shade with lots of different camera flashes he subtly forces the audience into Roy's head especially during sequences when Roy is having little breakdowns and the people and objects around him start moving at warpspeed.I'll admit that I'm a big fan of con man movies because I find them amusing. But Matchstick Men is not really a con man movie  it's a movie about a con man who has to cope with his job and private life. And a movie about a con man who finds he has a daughter. And a con man who gets conned. It's all enjoyable and though the film is long I never felt very bored by it at all  it sustained my interest throughout its running time. That's rarer and rarer nowadays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewing a movie like Matchstick Men is tough because it's a con movie and as such I really can't go into the plot all that much.  So I'll just give a quick little synopsis of the plot but really if you've seen any trailers for the movie you know the plot pretty well.Nicolas Cage plays Roy a con man or as he likes to say a Con Artist! who has a lot of problems.  For one he's a compulsive cleaner he hates the outdoors and he has  lot of ticks  Roy needs medication to keep him sane.One day he knocks his pills into the sink and when he calls his doctor to get more he finds out that his doctor is no longer in town!  This provides one of the funniersaddest part of the movie.  I'm not sure if it was suppose to be played up for laughs or not the tone was kind of hard to tell but Roy spend the next day and a half cleaning his house his ticks got worst and well it made me feel kind of bad for him.His partner Frank played by Sam Rockwell provides him with the number for another psychologist who can help.  Roy goes to the psychologist thinking that it'll be easy to just ask for the pills and he'll get them.  No this guy wants to help Roy and will not give him any pills until he talks. Which I must say shows two things.  One Nick Cage is great when he plays these type of rolls and two he's damn funny.  What he tells the psychologist was both funny and sad.  During that time though it's reviled that Roy was married at one time and when his wife left she was pregnant and he doesn't know what happen to the child who would be 14 by now.After getting the pills only a weeks worth mind you Roy decides to find out about his daughter but he can't because he's too scared so after getting the number of his ex wife he asks his psychologist to make the call when he can.  Later that night he gets a call from him and finds out that he has a daughter who wants to meet him.That's as far as I'll go with the plot because the movie really picks up from there as he bonds with his new daughter and sets up a really complex and dangerous con.Like I said Nick Cage is great in the movie but I also want to point out that his daughter  Angela played by Alison Lohman was just fantastic to watch.  She really lit up the screen when she smiled and it looked like Alison Lohman was just having a ball playing her. She was your typical 14 year old only and this shocked me when I found out Alison Lohman is 24 years old!  If you watch it keep that in mind and tell me she doesn't look like a 14 year old.  who knew just how to work her dad!  Some of the funnier moments came after he would yell at her then she'd start to cry and Roy would just completely collapse and start apologizing for what he said even if he was completely right!  It was just really funny.Matchstick Men isn't a fast paced movie it's more of a character study between Roy and Angela and how she changes his life and makes him reprioritizes his values and the way he runs his life.".

Roy also suffers from agoraphobia yet despite these problems is an efficient con man. Much like in Luc Besson's Leon 1994 Matchstick Men adopts the same theme of a criminal figure taking in a young female apprentice. Although after the exciting exposition the film has a rather drab middle the conclusion is stunning. This film is one of Nicolas Cage's finest whom I have long questioned as to ability in acting. Alison Lohman does a fine job as Angela. Due to the spectacular finish I am going to give this film 12   or 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "The little problem that 'Matchstick Men' has is that there is not a real highpoint in the movie if the ending wasn't there. I think the movie starts as a very good movie. Roy Waller Nicolas Cage and Frank Mercer Sam Rockwell are con artists and the movie opens with showing how they collect some money. It is not as great as how George Clooney does it in 'Out of Sight' but it's a lot of fun. After this the movie shows who Roy is a guy with all kind of weird things. Spasms panic attacks compulsive behavior. He wants things clean he wants things a certain way or he becomes a little crazy. He has pills for these things but he loses them and this is how he meets Dr. Klein Bruce Altman a psychiatrist.Because of him Roy learns he has a 14year old daughter Angela Alison Lohman who was actually 24. He wants to care for her spend time with her and even reveals what he really is. In a great scene she shows her father and us how she would be if she had the same job as Roy. Roy and Frank have a big job planned where they would collect 80000 dollars from a guy named Frechette Bruce McGill. In a way they are taking money but Roy looks at it differently. He thinks and he is actually right that they just give it to him. Because it is all illegal they can't complain after they are cheated.Hoe these three big stories fit in one you have to see for yourself. The middle part is a little slow but the ending makes up for that. All characters are played very well and Nicolas Cage is great. Ridley Scott has made another fine movie.".

Nic Cage gets to display a good range of his acting skills. He really is the master of the facial tic as anyone thinking back to some of his earlier films such as Vampyr's Kiss' will recall. To those who scoff at his recent choice of projects e.g. GForce just remember he is an actor. You take the work while you can. Anyway to summarise for me above all this film was refreshing as all of the actors acquitted themselves really well. A polished piece of cinematography that I will definitely enjoy viewing again.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 'Matchstick Men' Nicholas Cage plays a con man so obsessivecompulsive in nature that he makes Jack Nicholson in 'As Good as it Gets' look like Oscar Madison in comparison. Fastidious to the core Roy Waller freaks out at the first sign of dust dirt or bacteria invading his personal environment so much so that he keeps his place not merely immaculate but almost hermetically sealed off from the outside world. Somehow even with this crippling neurosis plaguing his every waking moment Roy has managed to eke out a pretty decent living as a shyster ripping off gullible common folk with his partner Frank played wonderfully by the gifted Sam Rockwell.One day into Roy's life strolls Angela the 14year old daughter he never knew he had. Suddenly Roy is confronted with the need to reexamine both his life and his priorities and to make some crucial decisions about just how this strange young person should fit into the overall scheme of his existence.Written by Nicholas and Ted Griffin and directed by Ridley Scott 'Matchstick Men' provides a stylish clever and witty psychological riff on the old scam artist scenario featuring fine performances by Cage Rockwell and Alison Lohman as well as an intriguing visual style by Scott cameraman John Mathieson and editor Dody Dorn which often approximates Roy's mental and emotional state. Cage once again indulges in those nervous tics that seem to have become his actor's stockintrade of late but he does manage to tamp them down long enough to allow a real character of fleshandblood to shine through the potentially distracting surface. Alison Lohman so brilliant in 'White Oleander' last year makes Angela into a multifaceted teenager who runs the gamut from immensely likable to slightly irritating  just about right for a character her age. Rockwell practically steals the show as Frank the con man to the core who may be a bit better at his job than even Roy himself realizes. Hans Zimmer has provided a humdinger of a musical score one reminiscent of some of Nina Rota's work for Fellini back in the early '60's. 'Matchstick Men' is not a perfect film it sags in spots doesn't dig deeply enough into its themes and sometimes feels too clever and calculated for its own good. Still the movie has an originality and an assurance that come when a group of old pros get together to have a good time and end up sharing that fun with their audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another movie with Nicolas Cage playing a weirdo after Leaving Las Vegas Adaptation.... Cage is really great in this kind of roles although I love all his movies. The story is good as well as Sam Rockwell but it is actually Alison Lohman who's steeling the show. Although she plays a 14 year old girl she was in fact about ten years older.Her performance was wonderful and just like Nicolas Cage I think we all fell for this girl.

The story is good as well as Sam Rockwell but it is actually Alison Lohman who's steeling the show. Although she plays a 14 year old girl she was in fact about ten years older.Her performance was wonderful and just like Nicolas Cage I think we all fell for this girl.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not very good at being a dad alright? I barely get by just being me. RoyIn a movie full of cons lies and misleadings truer words could never be spoken by a character. In Matchstick Men Nicolas Cage plays Roy an obsessive compulsive germaphobic con artist. His life is a mess not in the traditional sense but in the sense that he has made himself a prisoner to his own tedious routines and arrangements living a life of repetition monotony and misery. Roy is likable because even though he's a criminal and an eccentric he's sympathetic because he's lost control of everything and deep down he desperately longs for happiness.Happiness becomes attainable when Roy's estranged daughter enters his life. He tries to change things around for her sake. For the sake that he actually finally has a reason to. Usually in a con movie the main character should have things together and should be in control but since Roy clearly isn't calling him a wreck is just a bit of an understatement we aren't simply rooting for the cool grifter to successfully pull off a con we're watching a human being's life change and improve. Ultimately the movie is not about a mindblowing con but about the main character's redemption.The ending seems to be quite controversial around here it's a love it or hate it deal and I absolutely love it. People who ask Why isn't he angry? must not have been watching the same movie as I was. Just look at the opening scene and then the very last scene and tell me the movie hasn't gone through an amazing process. It's a wonderful ending because the big reward of the movie was not a cash payoff but something much much more profound.I loved Matchstick Men. It's a lovely quirky movie that is unforgettable. Cage Sam Rockwell and Allison Lohman create 3 awesome characters that really come to life and light up the screen. Amazing music by Hans Zimmer as always with the use of a catchy little tango as the main theme. This was an unpredictable directorial move from Ridley Scott who is among the great directors working today and this is my personal favourite of his works and one of my favourite movies altogether.123...My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The amazing thing about Matchstick Men is that it shouldn't have worked. It tells three stories primarily the story of a brilliant con artist. It also tells the story of a man driven by germofphobia fear of dirt and the story of the relationship between a man and the daughter he never knew he had. The protagonist of all three stories is Roy Waller played by Nicholas Cage in an Oscarworthy performance I might add. I've always admired Nick Cage but in this film he outdoes himself. The three stories should contradict according to their nature. The three characters do contradict but at the same time contain a certain unity. Cage plays all three roles effortlessly and convincingly. In a film where a lot of actors would have gone over the top he finds the right notes. There are scenes where tow and even three of the same characters emerge at one time. He finds the balance where a lot of actors wouldn't have. He is intense subtle and ruthless all at once. The script too is Occar worthy so absorbing that even when it goes off track it still manages to keep you interested. Sam Rockwell lends a convincing performance as Roy's partner Frank and Allison Lohman is equally entertaining as Angela the daughter who winds up wanting to be too much like her dad. The chemistry between these characters is there. They speak in convincing dialogue that shows who they are while propelling the plot forward.They manage to be likable even though by nature we wouldn't feel comfortable leaving a fivedollar bill anywhere around any of them.On a final note I would like to comment on the last scene. Without giving anything away I would just like to mention the many ways that it could have flopped or given a final plot twist for the viewer. It could have been bitter of hurtful but Ridly Scott is smart enough to know that and the scene is done in such a fashion that we understand without being outrightly told that this movie ends in the only way it possibly could.".

	schema:reviewBody "Matchstick Men represents a pleasant change of pace for Ridley Scott. For a director known for doing films that are both large thematically and in scope it's nice to see him tackle a film that has a simple premise which allows him to build the themes that he wants to discuss. Matchstick Men is a difficult film to categorise as is the case for most con films. It has touches of dark comedy and pieces of crime thriller plenty of drama without losing its quirkiness. It often plays out like a character study of a man who struggles to balance his dirty deeds with his mental issues. All of this delivered in a very freeflowing and vibrant way much like the majority of Scott's work.At its core the film is about con man Roy Waller who suffers from serve OCD which become even worse once he loses his pills shown in a scene that is both funny and sad where he spends a day cleaning his entire house. He then goes to see doctor who takes an interest in his life and wants to help him defeat his illness. Cage is the star centrepiece of the film. He also provides one of his best performances. In a way it is prefect casting Cage has always been at his best playing edgy and jittery characters and here he gets a legitimate reason to act that way. His performance provides a surprising amount of sympathy as well as humour he gets so into the character that his frequent ticks seem natural. The story develops further when it turns out Roy has a 14 yearold daughter called Angela who he decides to meet which leads to him struggling to balance out both sides of his life. Enter Alison Lohman who is fantastic. It's hard to believe that she is playing a character ten years younger than she was at the time given how natural her performance is. She manages to capture the essence of what a character that age would be like without detracting from the emotional weight and likability that she brings. I also think that Sam Rockwell who I swear has never put in a subpar performance deserves some praise for his role as Roy's confident business partner.It is tough to reveal much more about the plot without giving away pieces of information that might spoil its ending. Scott's direction is certainly a highlight as usual with his films. It is possibly his most fluid film and he manages to convey Roy's breakdowns with his subtle use of the camera whilst the frequent use of blue shade invokes the calmness of water which becomes something of a motif. From a visual standpoint the film reminded a lot of 'Catch Me If You Can' given its vibrancy and colour scheme. Adding to this is both the editing and the transitions which are seamlessly done. Hans Zimmer's score is also worth a mention trading in his usually bombastic compositions for more jazzy and bass heavy pieces that fit the film perfectly.The only part of the film that left me cold was its climax and its eventual twist which I won't reveal. For me the twist did disrupt a lot of the film's emotional and grounded aspects that had been developed excellently throughout. It brings a jolt that almost pushes you out of the film and instead of feeling that the twist transformed the film into something completely different it simply felt like an unnecessary addition. I think the film would have been even stronger had it avoided said twist all together.Matchstick Men ends up feeling exactly like what Ridley Scott wants it to be. It's a film that blends multiple genres together and basically plays them off against the typical con man film style. It does go deeper than the story initially suggests almost working as a psychological study of Roy and the building of his relationship with the daughter he never knew existed. On a surface level however the film is constantly entertaining. Whether it is for the excellent acting the charming central narrative the tension building con or Scott's wonderful direction it doesn't really matter because all of these aspects blend with and play off of each other so well. I don't think the twist works but it's a testament to the films strength that it isn't overly damaged by that. For me it's a film that is meant to be enjoyed on the surface before you start to analyse what is underneath.".

The status quo of their work is disrupted when Angela Alison Lohman the daughter that Roy never knew he had bumps into his life.Cage's performance as Roy is definitely the reason why you would want to watch this movie. He got very into character a con artist with unique psychological traits where agoraphobia and OCD do not cover it all. Throughout the movie it's impossible not to feel for Roy when his eye twitches or whenever he has a nervous breakdown. This is most likely going to be the best obsessivecompulsive character performance you'll see in a while. Roy's organized and simple life is disrupted when a smart and outgoing daughter shows up somewhat out of nowhere. Lohman's performance as Angela could be described as a unique balance between lovable young lady with parent issues and sneaky little brat that wants things her way resulting in a very solid performance note that she was 24 at the time 10 years older than her character. Frank Rockwell's character is an eager protg trying to convince Roy into going for big hit instead of the usual simple is safe. Frank's passiveaggressive patience to deal with Roy's shenanigans adds a hint of comedy to the movie.The relationship between Roy and Angela actually remembers Leon the Professional 1994 at some point. It's always refreshing to see small homages to certain movies  and this one by Scott and Cage is a refreshing 9 year gap fill. Also two other things should be mentioned. First the small but decisive aspect that Roy always uses matchsticks to light his cigarettes overlapping a character performance with the title. Second it's based on a novel by Eric Garcia with the same title as the movie.An overall brilliant performance from these three characters and starting plot would be more than enough for anyone to watch this piece. However the plot twist at the end even though it's not that predictable could be disliked by many me included. Still it's a movie worth watching and one that I would recommend given Cage's performance and character.".

Most of you were probably thinking Why wouldn't he go back to his trade?  To me it shows how affected he was by the experience.  The greatest effect was realizing how he felt what he had never known before in his lifethe realization that having that personal connection with someone had done more for him than anything else he had experienced in his life to that point.  So much that it conquered his compulsiveness allowed him engage in a relationship with a woman he could never have approached before and to get so much more out of life by investing himself in that endeavor completely.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1967 Dr.Christian Barnard made world history by carrying out the very first heart transplant operation. Much speculation was generated as to how far the new technique could be taken. Would it be possible to say transplant a brain? Or any other organ? It sounded like the ideal subject for a movie and in 1971 one got made. 'Percy' based on a book by Raymond Hitchcock was adapted for the screen by Hugh Leonard and directed and produced by Ralph Thomas and Betty E.Box the team behind the popular 'Doctor' films based on Richard Gordon's books.Hywel Bennett is 'Edwin Anthony' a hippielike antiques dealer who lives alone in London  his wife has recently left him . One day he is carrying a chandelier down a street when unexpectedly a naked man falls out of the sky and lands on him. Guy Warrington had been in bed with his lover Helga  Elke Sommer  when her husband came home early and in his panic he jumped out of the window forgetting she lived in a highrise apartment. He is killed but Edwin survives. However a shard from the chandelier has cut off his penis  ouch! . Surgeon Emmanuel Whitbread  Denholm Elliott  removes Guy's pecker  nicknamed 'Percy'  and grafts it on to Edwin.When Edwin wakes up he is horrified at what has been done to him. The tabloid press regard the whole affair as one big joke and set about trying to locate Percy's new owner. On leaving hospital Edwin is driven by a mad compulsion to find the donor's identity and obtaining a list of men who died in the hospital that day tracks down their wives and a glamorous lot they are too...It is hard to believe that 'Percy' was made only five years after Norman Wisdom ended his run of clothcapped comedies. Directors such as Thomas and Val Guest sensed that the audience for British film comedies had changed and tailored their material accordingly. Hywel Bennett is the best thing about the film portraying Edwin in a sympathetic light as a man who wants a normal life but has become a carnival freak and does not like it  today he would probably be invited on 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!' . Denholm Elliott is wonderfully smarmy as the surgeon. We first see him on a B.B.C. talkshow  he walks out in disgust when the producer  Angus Mackay  keeps bleeping out the word 'penis'! The script is peppered with what Ben Elton used to call 'knob gags'  a nurse tells Edwin Let's see how it stands up in the light of the day! while Whitbread whistles a selfcomposed ditty entitled 'Penis From Heaven'  but strangely the film is a lot tamer than you might expect. It is quite thoughtful in its depiction of adult relationships. It did not warrant its 'Wahey! Penis transplant comedy!' marketing. The only nudity comes from Antonia Ellis' stripteasing nurse. Edwin's meeting's with Percy's girlfriends brings us glorious sightings of Britt Ekland and Elke Sommer while Julia Foster Cyd Hayman Adrienne Posta Gaye Brown Tracy Reed and Sheila Steafel and Sue Lloyd appear elsewhere. George Best graces a 'Billy Liar'styled fantasy sequence while Arthur English is seen as a seedy pub comic.Yes it is a onejoke film but manages to camouflage its deficiencies rather well. It is the work of professional film makers. The same story in the hands of say Stanley Long or Derek Ford would have been an unwatchable mess.When 'Percy' was in production Mary Whitehouse thundered to the press that it was in 'poor taste'. As so often happened whenever she complained about anything the public flocked to see it in droves. In 1974 there was a sequel  sans Bennett  entitled 'Percy's Progress'.Nice songs by Ray Davies  The Kinks with 'Lola' being put to good use during Ellis' strip.The summary quoted above came from the trailer. It asked 'How long is Percy?' and then responded with 'About 100 minutes!'.".

The tabloid press regard the whole affair as one big joke and set about trying to locate Percy's new owner. On leaving hospital Edwin is driven by a mad compulsion to find the donor's identity and obtaining a list of men who died in the hospital that day tracks down their wives and a glamorous lot they are too...It is hard to believe that 'Percy' was made only five years after Norman Wisdom ended his run of clothcapped comedies. Directors such as Thomas and Val Guest sensed that the audience for British film comedies had changed and tailored their material accordingly. Hywel Bennett is the best thing about the film portraying Edwin in a sympathetic light as a man who wants a normal life but has become a carnival freak and does not like it  today he would probably be invited on 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!' . Denholm Elliott is wonderfully smarmy as the surgeon. We first see him on a B.B.C. talkshow  he walks out in disgust when the producer  Angus Mackay  keeps bleeping out the word 'penis'! The script is peppered with what Ben Elton used to call 'knob gags'  a nurse tells Edwin Let's see how it stands up in the light of the day! while Whitbread whistles a selfcomposed ditty entitled 'Penis From Heaven'  but strangely the film is a lot tamer than you might expect. It is quite thoughtful in its depiction of adult relationships. It did not warrant its 'Wahey! Penis transplant comedy!' marketing. The only nudity comes from Antonia Ellis' stripteasing nurse. Edwin's meeting's with Percy's girlfriends brings us glorious sightings of Britt Ekland and Elke Sommer while Julia Foster Cyd Hayman Adrienne Posta Gaye Brown Tracy Reed and Sheila Steafel and Sue Lloyd appear elsewhere. George Best graces a 'Billy Liar'styled fantasy sequence while Arthur English is seen as a seedy pub comic.Yes it is a onejoke film but manages to camouflage its deficiencies rather well. It is the work of professional film makers. The same story in the hands of say Stanley Long or Derek Ford would have been an unwatchable mess.When 'Percy' was in production Mary Whitehouse thundered to the press that it was in 'poor taste'. As so often happened whenever she complained about anything the public flocked to see it in droves. In 1974 there was a sequel  sans Bennett  entitled 'Percy's Progress'.Nice songs by Ray Davies  The Kinks with 'Lola' being put to good use during Ellis' strip.The summary quoted above came from the trailer. It asked 'How long is Percy?' and then responded with 'About 100 minutes!'.";

Another surprise is that the movie doesn't try for as many attempts at humor as you might think. The second half of the movie is serious for the most part. As you might have guessed this movie is not that much fun and you'll get tired from it long before the end. The most curious thing about it is the score from The Kinks. It doesn't fit the movie for the most part like how they play an instrumental of Lola when a woman is stripteasing for the main male character! Somehow this movie was successful enough to inspire a sequel several years later. Thanks but I think I'll pass.".

	schema:headline " Not quite a bloodbath or a laughfest but fun enough";
	schema:reviewBody "This completely bizarre horrorcomedy is notable for a few reasons mostly due to the fact that it features a late performance from the great Vincent Price and because it stars British comedian Kenny Everett. The humour is something of a mixed bag as the film attempts to get laughs from a range of places and doesn't always succeed. Some of the humour is absolutely pitch black to the point where I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh or not while other areas of the movie are really stupid and overall not much of it fits together nicely. The film does manage a few moments of hilarity however most notably the discussions about the deaths at the central location in a local pub and a great scene that sees Kenny Everett's doctor operating on a patient. The plot follows a group of scientists that travel to a house known as 'Headstone Manor' which is infamous for the savage murders that took place there some years earlier. The house is also inhabited by a group of satanic monks that won't sleep until they have purged the house of its unwelcome guests.As you would expect the film is at it's strongest during the scenes that include the great Vincent Price but this is also one of the problems as there aren't enough of them. I don't know if director Ray Cameron simply couldn't afford to have Price in the film more but Bloodbath at the House of Death would have been a better film if he could. Kenny Everett manages to keep things ticking over when Price isn't around however and the comedian does well in providing the film with most of its laughs. I'm not sure how into horror the director and lead star are as the film is mostly played out for laughs but there is time to include some delicious horror elements. The central location is a nice play on the common 'haunted house' theme and the house itself is dark ominous and features numerous rooms. For a film with the word 'Bloodbath' in the title there isn't a lot of gore and this is slightly disappointing after the first sequence which features a fair amount of it. Overall this is undoubtedly a disjointed effort and not everything works but it's a fun film and things such as the nods to classic films like Star Wars and The Evil Dead are nice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bloodbath at the House of Death did have a lot of potential a talented cast and writer and a great title being the starting points. But the execution undermines this so in the end Bloodbath at the House of Death is a failure. It is not without redeeming merits though the film is not badly made Vincent Price while underused looks and sounds as though he is thoroughly enjoying himself and the Can Opener and toilet scenes are very effective. However I just didn't find Bloodbath at the House of Death all that funny or horrifying. I do love comedy and I don't mind it when it is stupid and rude but I've never liked it all that much when it's distasteful. And Bloodbath at the House of Death showed great distaste the toilet humour is utterly infantile and the innuendos are incredibly smutty making the worst Carry On moviethe later entries had a lot of smut seem tame. The dialogue is similarly unfunny crude and somewhat stilted too I even questioned whether Bary Cryer actually had anything to do with the writing at all. The story is very thin structurally and doesn't make any sense at all. I got the parodies but with two exceptions they seemed randomly strung togetherand that is pretty much what the story was and were too predictable and badly written to have any kind of impact. The ET parody was also rendered cheaply. The direction was leaden and the entire cast were wasted. Only Price was good and even he deserved much better. Kenny Everett was very talented and evidently does try very hard but the quality of the humour here disallowed him to do anything interesting or fun with what he has. The rest of the cast don't make any kind of impression. All in all a embarrassing failure for all involved. 310 Bethany Cox".

Made at the time when both horror  leading man Kenny Ecerett were popular it probably seemed like a good idea at the time to combine the two quite why Everett agreed to be in this crap is a mystery to be honest. With virtually no story to speak of it's left to the loosely connected little comedy sketches that try to spoof  mock various horror films including The Haunting 1963 Carrie 1976 Alien 1979 The Shining 1980 An Emerican Werewolf in London 1981 The Entity 1982 E.T. The ExtraTerrestrial 1982 all the teen slashers that were big business back then  even references Star Wars 1977 with little success is has to be said.

At just under 90 minutes long there is very little story here  none of it makes sense one bit as things happening for no apparent reason with no apparent consequence. Why is Everett given a false leg? Why not kill the scientists rather than try to scare them away?Bloodbath at the House of Death really does feel like a five minute comedy show sketch drawn out to feature film length not one of British horror's finest moments.The film is reasonably well made  spoofs various scenes in films like the pub scene in An American Werewolf in London the chestburster scene in Alien the rape scene in The Entity  even has a character decapitated by a Stars Wars style Light Saber. The special effects are variable the E.T. spoof at the end looks awful for instance.

	schema:reviewBody "Horror deity Vincent Price is my favorite actor and the credited name of his character in Bloodbath at the House of Death  'Sinister Man'  more or less describes the roles this great man played with brilliance throughout his fantastic career. Bloodbath at the House of Death 1984 is a title that is impossible not to love for a fan of Horror and Cultcinema and while the film is neither a particular highlight nor exactly a bloodbath it is an enjoyably bizarre spoof that Pricefans should give a try even though the master's role is regrettably small. The film stars British Comedian Kanny Everett I don't really know the man's other work but as it seems he was a funny guy.In 1975 Headstone Manor was the site of the grisly murders of 18 people. Some years later a couple of Scientists including Dr. Lukas Manderville Kenny Everett and Dr. Barbara Coyle Pamela Stephenson gather at the the rural mansion which is now known as the 'House of Death' in order to investigate strange phenomena...Bloodbath at the House of Death parodies Gothic Horror and Occult Horror films as well as Slashers. Primarily however the film is full of extremely bizarre slapstick humor. This is great fun at the beginning but I must say that the nonstop slapstick and fartjokes gets a bit monotonous towards the end. Fans of weirdness and bizarre humor should still like this however as it doesn't get a lot more grotesque than Bloodbath at the House of Death. Vincent Price is as always magnificent in his role here. Price is hilarious as a warlock and leader of a Satanic coven who is aptly credited 'Sinister Man'. His screen time is regrettably short though. Kenny Everett is also very funny in his role as are the other cast members. Pamela Stephenson is particularly funny and very sexy even though she plays a nerdy scientist. The murders in the film are amusingly bizarre and the goreeffects are hilarious. Bloodbath at the House of Death isn't a particular highlight and certainly no Comedy masterpiece but overall it is a fun flick for my fellow Vincent Price fans and lovers of bizarre humor. Recommended.".

Tiresome beyond belief the makers somehow managed to persuade some talented stars to lend their faces to this garbage. Vincent Price for example as a 700 year old cult leader who swears a lot Kenny Everett as a paranormal investigator who was formerly a brilliant surgeon in Germany until he accidentally dropped his monocle into a patient's insides during an operation Pamela Stephenson as a lisping scientist who ends up getting the best sex of her life from a randy poltergeist and Graham Stark as a blind man who inadvertently destroys everything in his path wherever he goes. On paper it sounds almost funny but in reality sadly it never gets that far in fact this pitiful film is buried irretrievably several feet below rock bottom.Following the massacre of 18 people at a creepy country manor a number of scientists visit the house in question several years later to investigate high levels of radioactivity at the site. Here they experience numerous supernatural goingson as they try to find out what's going on. Meanwhile a number of local villagers led by a700 year old cultist Vincent Price march upon the house and attempt to 'cleanse' it of the unwelcome outsiders.The plot itself doesn't hang together for a second and there's little point wasting another word trying to describe it. Instead the film unfolds like a series of randomly connected comedy skits sometimes poking fun at other horror films as they go. Everett hacks down a door with an axe a la Jack Nicholson in order to tell the girl inside that it's dinner time. Whilst walking through a dingy tunnel one woman looks up and screams Bat!  a moment later a cricket bat falls down and clonks someone on the head. At one point Everett stops midway through a meal clutches at his stomach while an alien lifeform rises up inside him then burps and excuses himself. That's the general level of humour throughout with lots of infantile toilet humour thrown in for good measure. The film is extremely tedious and barely raises a single smile during its entire running time. Most depressing of all is the absolute waste of horror icon Price in a role that simply has to be seen to be disbelieved. The kindest summary I can come up with is that Bloodbath At The House Of Death is about as funny as a serial rapist. Avoid.".

And the whole thing felt very flat and sometimes almost awkward to watch. I don't really like British slapstick comedy so that was probably my main problem. I got what the film was all about I so did. It was an okay movie enjoyable in an 80's going on 70's old timey kind of way but it wasn't funny! And when you are watching a horror comedy that ain't a good thing! Okay to be totally fair and honest there were three times in which the film did make me laugh. The first was during the spoof of Carrie when the crazy lady's hat flew off the second was when Vincent Price was talking about how they should burn all the faggots! And the third was when everyone is at the dinner table and they hear noises outside. Asked what it could possibly be Pamela stephenson exclaimssounds like a lot of monks exploding! As you do! Well it would definitely be the first thing to pop into my head! The acting wasn't bad. It was wacky fun but all that means nothing if you're not having a good time. Kenny Everett was apparently some great British comedian but I never heard of him before seeing this movie. He was way before my generation anyhow. I didn't find him any funnier than anyone else in the movie was trying to be I did find him more annoying however. Poor Vincent Price! I love him of course. He is one of the founding fathers of horror but to me in this movie he really makes an ass of himself. That bit when he's on fire that's not funny! He just sounds like a whiney silly old man! Rest in peace sir Price. The absolute funnest element of the movie for me was spotting and trying to guess all the nods to great sci fi and horror movies. I could have listed them but I think that would spoil all the fun plus I'm pretty sure another reviewer already did! So E.T. was running around all the time huh? So I guess that makes this movie a possible prequel to E.T.? Cool! There was one scene that I actually found scary as hell. It was a scene where a drunk guy gets wasted by a creepyass teddy bear. I couldn't really get into it. It was very watchable and easy to follow. I had a lot more fun with the movie Return To Horror High. So yep a goodAs in enjoyableexample of a horror comedy missing it's mark. Despite there being enjoyable and funny moments I would have to say the film ultimately stunk to me. Hasta la pasta!".

And the third was when everyone is at the dinner table and they hear noises outside. Asked what it could possibly be Pamela stephenson exclaimssounds like a lot of monks exploding! As you do! Well it would definitely be the first thing to pop into my head! The acting wasn't bad. It was wacky fun but all that means nothing if you're not having a good time. Kenny Everett was apparently some great British comedian but I never heard of him before seeing this movie. He was way before my generation anyhow. I didn't find him any funnier than anyone else in the movie was trying to be I did find him more annoying however. Poor Vincent Price! I love him of course. He is one of the founding fathers of horror but to me in this movie he really makes an ass of himself. That bit when he's on fire that's not funny! He just sounds like a whiney silly old man! Rest in peace sir Price. The absolute funnest element of the movie for me was spotting and trying to guess all the nods to great sci fi and horror movies. I could have listed them but I think that would spoil all the fun plus I'm pretty sure another reviewer already did! So E.T. was running around all the time huh? So I guess that makes this movie a possible prequel to E.T.? Cool! There was one scene that I actually found scary as hell. It was a scene where a drunk guy gets wasted by a creepyass teddy bear. I couldn't really get into it. It was very watchable and easy to follow. I had a lot more fun with the movie Return To Horror High. So yep a goodAs in enjoyableexample of a horror comedy missing it's mark. Despite there being enjoyable and funny moments I would have to say the film ultimately stunk to me. Hasta la pasta!";

Eight scientists go to your typical haunted mansion and they are cut down onebyone until the last one survives. In amongst the plot there are plenty of subtle references to films of the time such as Alien Star Wars and E.T. etc. The problem is that the film is not really sure what it's trying to do. Is it horror? comedy? A thriller? Frankly it does all three very poorly. It's not even trying to be intelligent and make any social commentary.I have to come to the conclusion that the film just enjoys itself being a BAD film. It's attempt to spoof the Bgrade horror movie results in this film turning itself into an even worse horror film  at which Bloodbath at the House of Death largely succeeds. In an attempt to take the mickey out of similar films the dialogue is almost deliberately wooden full of useless lines and blithe exposition. The jokes are often hitandmiss mostly tasteless and many falling flat. The horror scenes largely just look weird and stupid. This whole disaster wraps up in a completely awkward manner. Even Vincent Price  in some of the best performances of the film  cannot salvage this shambolic throwntogether mess.This film is definitely one for bad film connoisseur  who will relish in it's deliberate transgressive abuse of the medium of film.

Oh wait did I forget to mention that the guy David Hugh Laurie is twice as old as the girl Nina Leighton Meester who happens to be the daughter of David's best friend Terry Oliver Platt and that the two families live across the street from each other? And it gets better David's daughter Vanessa Alia Shawkat  used to be best friends with Nina and his son Toby Adam Brodie is romantically interested in Nina. Now you have the premise of The Oranges. But is this just another movie about naughty MayDecember relationships of which the bestinclass is undoubtedly The Graduate? Not really. The relationship itself is basically a given. It happens quickly at the beginning of the movie and is almost immediately discovered by Nina's meddling mother Allison Janney. But rather than ending with this discovery the film really begins here exploring the conflicted views of society or at least of American society toward such relationships through the lens of the tragicomic reactions of the two families and a few friends. These reactions which range from awkward to furious form the heart of the warm funny and occasionally touching screenplay by Ian Helfer and Jay Reiss. Some viewers may be dismayed by the moral neutrality of the film. But since when did an intimate relationship between consenting adults one of whom happens to be unhappily married require the Hollywood plot line to issue a strong moral condemnation? In general not since the 1950's but should there be an exception in this case? What about the May December thing? And the other lives that were changed  were they changed for better or worse? Whatever you think about all the questions it raises I hope you appreciate the spoton performances by the entire cast and that you find The Oranges to be as enjoyable and thoughtprovoking as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm your ex girlfriend's boyfriend's wife.I'd rather sit through an hour long episode of Dr. House The OC or Gossip Girl rather than watch this film starring some of the actors from the above mentioned series. The Oranges was directed by Julian Farino who I had never heard of before this film. I actually went to see this film because I thought it had an interesting cast. The biggest flaw of The Oranges was its screenplay written by Ian Helfer and Jay Reiss. The dramedy never quite manages to feel authentic and everything felt like a complete farce. The dialogue in this film felt very light considering the subject matter and the comedic moments weren't effective. The relationships didn't feel real either although I must admit that the friendship between Laurie's character and Platt's was probably the strongest thing about this movie. Beside the three TV stars Hugh Laurie Leighton Meester and Adam Brody the film also stars Allison Janney and Catherine Keener whom I always thought looked very much alike. These are all very likable actors but they were given some really underdeveloped characters and the film never really rang true to me. Other films have tackled this subject matter in much better ways. Examples that come to mind for me are The Graduate and American Beauty but this movie doesn't even come close to what those films achieved. Despite how much I wanted to like this movie because of the actors I had a hard time watching this. I would pick any of their television series over this film anytime.The film focuses on the relationship between two Jersey families. On the one hand we have David Hugh Laurie and Paige Walling Catherine Keener who have two children Vanessa Alia Shawkat and Toby Adam Brody and then we are introduced to their neighbors the Ostroff's consisting of Terry Oliver Platt and Carol Allison Janney. Terry and David have been best friends for a long time and their families get together often. The Ostroff's have a daughter named Nina Leighton Meester who decides to return home after five years for the Holidays. Her presence will change things when she falls in love with David. The two begin seeing each other and it has a tremendous effect on both families. Nina convinces David that there are no rules to happiness but at the same time his decision affects everyone around him. When Paige finds out about this relationship she confronts David and soon everyone's life is affected by this relationship. The film doesn't seem to take sides on the moral issue but it doesn't ever feel like it takes things seriously either. The entire film felt like a complete waste of time. The relationship between David and Nina never felt authentic and there was no chemistry whatsoever between them. The film really suffers from a poor script and the likable actors aren't enough to save this film. The narration of the film didn't work for me either and I felt like it was simply used to simplify things. The question the film seems to be raising is whether it is really worth doing whatever makes you happy without measuring the consequences and how it can affect the rest of the people around you. At first it seems as if it agrees with this premise but later their consequences catch up with them. Some characters seem to be better off but things never remain the same. I think I am getting a little too philosophical for a film that really didn't take itself too seriously but I definitely felt that something was completely off with The Oranges. It is an awkward film and one I wouldn't recommend. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The dialogue in this film felt very light considering the subject matter and the comedic moments weren't effective. The relationships didn't feel real either although I must admit that the friendship between Laurie's character and Platt's was probably the strongest thing about this movie. Beside the three TV stars Hugh Laurie Leighton Meester and Adam Brody the film also stars Allison Janney and Catherine Keener whom I always thought looked very much alike. These are all very likable actors but they were given some really underdeveloped characters and the film never really rang true to me. Other films have tackled this subject matter in much better ways. Examples that come to mind for me are The Graduate and American Beauty but this movie doesn't even come close to what those films achieved. Despite how much I wanted to like this movie because of the actors I had a hard time watching this. I would pick any of their television series over this film anytime.The film focuses on the relationship between two Jersey families. On the one hand we have David Hugh Laurie and Paige Walling Catherine Keener who have two children Vanessa Alia Shawkat and Toby Adam Brody and then we are introduced to their neighbors the Ostroff's consisting of Terry Oliver Platt and Carol Allison Janney. Terry and David have been best friends for a long time and their families get together often. The Ostroff's have a daughter named Nina Leighton Meester who decides to return home after five years for the Holidays. Her presence will change things when she falls in love with David. The two begin seeing each other and it has a tremendous effect on both families. Nina convinces David that there are no rules to happiness but at the same time his decision affects everyone around him. When Paige finds out about this relationship she confronts David and soon everyone's life is affected by this relationship. The film doesn't seem to take sides on the moral issue but it doesn't ever feel like it takes things seriously either. The entire film felt like a complete waste of time. The relationship between David and Nina never felt authentic and there was no chemistry whatsoever between them. The film really suffers from a poor script and the likable actors aren't enough to save this film. The narration of the film didn't work for me either and I felt like it was simply used to simplify things. The question the film seems to be raising is whether it is really worth doing whatever makes you happy without measuring the consequences and how it can affect the rest of the people around you. At first it seems as if it agrees with this premise but later their consequences catch up with them. Some characters seem to be better off but things never remain the same. I think I am getting a little too philosophical for a film that really didn't take itself too seriously but I definitely felt that something was completely off with The Oranges. It is an awkward film and one I wouldn't recommend. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com";

On the one hand there's nothing wrong with an loving relationship between two consenting adults right? Nina the girl hooking up with her family guy neighbour says it herself in one scene But what if there was no wrong? ... There is no wrong. On the other hand the very proximity between all persons involved turns against the love affair between Nina and David family guy. David's daughter feels this most acutely she doesn't want to become a nagging moralizer for family values. On the other hand she doesn't want her former schoolmate Nina to become her new stepmom either.I find this a great movie about an interesting moral dilemma.".

	schema:headline " A plethora of actors show how to make a dysfunctional family dramedy funny";
	schema:reviewBody "The Oranges centers on two families each with mom and dad and former teenage daughter now a twentysomething daughter living across the street from each other in West Orange New Jersey. It's kind of like a dysfunctional family dramedy except the families really do function normal enough and well enough prior to the beginning of the plot. And also it's a comedy. It poses some fairly serious questions but presents them all in a lighthearted humorous fashion.Paige Walling Catherine Keener and David Walling Hugh Laurie still have their adult daughter Vanessa Alia Shawkat living at home unable to let go of some hostilities from her teenage years. Carol Ostroff Allison Janney and Terry Ostroff Oliver Platt are trying to control their daughter Nina Leighton Meester but she's off on the other side of the country still acting like a teenager. But after a perceived personal tragedy Nina comes home. And then comes home Paige and David's successful son Toby Adam Brody who's in love with Nina.Two individuals choose to commit or almost commit a morally repugnant act. The good thing is everything is still funny. In the aftermath though they decide that they're adults and choose to question the line of morality. Not only is the audience not expecting that and thus we're forced to start questioning or stop judging but the other characters definitely weren't prepared for it and they start questioning the directions of their own lives. While of course keeping it funny.Another interesting choice the film made was to make Vanessa Shawkat the narrator. She is not directly involved in the action she's only involved in the repercussions but she's also the type of character that we normally don't think about how she would be affected but now we're forced to. The character that we would normally associate with in the aftermath is Paige Keener but here she puts herself on the sidelines.The highlight of the film of course is the incredible cast. The reading of the credits goes something like this Alia Shawkat  oh yeah the girl from Arrested Development she has some decent comedy skills Leighton Meester  a new Hollywood it girl let's she what she's got Hugh Laurie  he's always fun and straight from a string of welldeserved Emmy nominations Allison Janney  awesome ! Catherine Keener  awesome ! Oliver Platt  really?! He's a comic genius this is doubly awesome !! and Adam Brody  well now we've just topped off a dream come true.The best news is that the cast completely delivers. Meester and Laurie are expected to carry the majority of the film and both do it by playing characters that they've never really played before. Laurie pulls of sympathetic so well and Meester goes a little more subtle to be able to show us what her character is thinking and show us what her character wants people to see. Janney is her usual funny self so is Brody while Platt is again at top form delivering some hilariously subtle facial reactions and some comic gold physical comedy. The least famous actor of all of them Sam Rosen threatens to steal the whole show as Ethan Nina's hilariously sympathetic fianc turned exfianc turned superapologeticexfianc. He's relegated to a pretty small role otherwise the movie would have been about Ethan. And it's not supposed to be.Now that the highlights are all uncovered it's time for some warnings. The plot is exceedingly simple and we have to wait for each character to catch up to it before the next turn can proceed. For those that are completely invested in each character this won't be a problem. For those that like fewer characters this will be a problem. Also depending on where your moral center lies you could have a conflict with the film's decidedly ambiguous morality. For all the lines the film attempted to cross they went for a much simpler more dramatic ending never crossing into the dark comedy territory. That might stop it from reaching more brilliant heights but it also keeps The Oranges more consistently enjoyable.Who Might Like This People who like dysfunctional family dramedies anybody looking for a comedy that questions some of society's morals fans of anybody in the main cast.".

I did enjoy the soundtrack. I thought there were numerous continuity issues that should have been picked up prior to this showing. Does no one in Hollywood know what New Jersey would look like in late November and December? Trust me  there would be no leaves on the trees or emerald green lawns. There were some very funny scenes but I wasted two hours of my life that I will never get back.

	schema:reviewBody "The Oranges gives the viewer a light hearted look at what is traditionally considered very taboo. A middle aged man whose daughter still lives at home falls in love with his best friends daughter who happens to be the same age as his daughter. Factor in that he is still married and she as of last week was engaged and all the makings of a dark depressing midlife crisis come to a head in tragic and heartbreaking ways in what could only be an indie drama... Except that it isn't a drama it is a lighthearted family comedy. Such taboo subjects under a different light with different music could easily have found itself in contention for being quite the drama but alas the whole film is flipped upside down with a plot that feels so unauthentic and ridiculous that I often had to stop myself and say no way his friend would be feeling okay with this. It felt like these families were alien living in a different sodapop world than the one I have seen of the suburbs. If this didn't make me cringe enough the music would pop in and make me feel like for some reason I'm supposed to be okay with throwing your wife away for a newer model. However oddly enough at the end of the day the complete and total disregard for all things righteous actually won me over. I won't by any means label this as anything worthwhile to filmmaking which it wasn't but the absurdness of all of this especially the music piling up somehow worked and the film mainly works because the acting really makes the ridiculous believable. Catherine Keener gives an awesome performance as well as Oliver Platt who sells the most unrealistic character ever devised like he is more real than Shakespeare yes Shakespeare is real. This film at several moments felt like by all means it should fail miserably but thanks to the talent involved it manages to be saved. One can tell that the screenplay just wasn't very good but at the end of the day somehow this film works. It is far from a great film by any means but it works. 7 out of 10.".

There is such a great range of talent here and they all looked like they were having fun in a comedy with darker moments. This is a film about consequences after all and is not really a romcom romp nor a morality tale. It reminds me of a suburban memoir and the writing reflects this. The short season between Thanksgiving and Christmas has been done to death in American cinema with all of the inherent conflicts compulsory traditions and conspicuous consumption. The writers have used this backdrop to do something eversoslightly subversive.Leighton Meester and Alia Shawkat are wonderful in their respective roles as the lifelong neighboursfriends who are further entangled in a world they really want to leave behind. I hope this becomes a Christmas classic. Hugh Laurie Allison Janney Catherine Keener  Oliver Platt  who could ask for anything more?".

He's ripe for the picking and she has no sense of decencymorality at all. This movie made my skin crawl there was nothing funny about it. The vixen feels there are no rules and that's her game in all of this. Take what you want and to hell with the consequences. In fact she sees people who don't take her side as being prudish oldfashioned biased again her youth etc. The movie is without value. Give it a pass.".

To me this role isn't much different from any other of Leighton's films but she was fine nonetheless.If you go into the film expecting a cute romantic comedy with some drama think deeper. It has wit and drama but not as much one on one romance. It's more about the relationships people have with everyone in their lives and how delicate each one truly is for its own reasons.".

SCANDAL which was kinda misleading people to see the movie through that glasses. only to find that they felt uncomfortable watching the romance between a 24 years old girl and a man which was her father's best friend. the movie is more than that it's actually about two family dealing with this kind of conflict and finding happiness. it's about what you really wanted in life that will makes you happy. only they put it in a more complex situation. and i don't like the jokes onfrom? Ethan's part. it felt kinda dry. he shouldn't even bother to come.";

	schema:headline " Awkward quirky little indie comedy that mostly works";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing the trailer for this film a long time ago and thinking it looked sort of fun. I do love Hugh Laurie and my wife loves Leighton Meester so we were both excited to watch it. I love a good indie film and this is certainly good. It doesn't go much beyond mediocreville but that's okay. In some aspects it tries to do much and then at the same time doesn't do enough. It's a Graduate type MayDecember romance a story about best friends and family and a coming of age story all rolled into one. The film perhaps doesn't do quite enough to explore each facet of this concept but it still does it well. In a reallife situation like this it would be incredibly awkward for everyone and guess what? The film perfectly captures that family and friendship tension and awkwardness. There are certain scenes where you're almost squeamish feeling how these characters must feel. That being said I wasn't the least bit awkward over the romance between Meester and Laurie. I actually thought they were pretty good together and while the film NEVER implies their romance is right it does explore the feelings and the concept of what makes a person happy.The ensemble cast is very good. I will start with Hugh Laurie because I've liked him for a very long time since House. Laurie in this film plays a softer likable misunderstood guy trying desperately to hang on to his family while doing what makes him happy. They could portray Laurie as a jerk but you never feel that way about him. Mostly you feel sorry for him and wonder what he will do and what is right for him. He proves he can star in a film for sure. Leighton Meester gives an intelligent and provocative performance as Nina the object of Laurie's affections. As I said before her chemistry with Laurie is actually very good and unlike most other women in films she isn't someone you hate. It actually feels like just a bad situation that they've dug themselves into. Catherine Keener is someone I usually find very dry and in this film she is appropriately dry right up until her melt down on the front lawn in her car which is one of the best scenes in the film. Kenner works for this role because of her ability to seem a little rigid. That is a backhanded compliment I suppose. Oliver Platt is great as he almost always is...I wish he did more. He is a fun lovable misunderstood guy who has lost his best friend and daughter and is trying to hold his life together and his family. I think they really underexplore his character and his relationship with Laurie but he still does a great job. Alia Shawkat is the daughter of Laurie and Keener and former best friend of Meester who is truly caught in the middle of this. She does an okay job but sort of falls in the shadow of better performers like Meester and Laurie and Platt. Her character could have been far more explored too but she serves her purpose. She is best when trading jabs with Meester physically or verbally. Adam Brody is featured as main cast but he is really hardly in the movie. He comes and goes as almost a cameo and I can't say much to his performance because outside of a few good lines he doesn't have much.Shakespearean family dynamics. That's what this movie is. Its like when you're spying on a couple arguing because you want the real life drama...well this is nonstop drama and its fun to watch because its so awkward. Its well performed a decent script and good direction by Julian Farino who comes mostly from Television but good Television so that's something. Honestly by the end of the film I almost hoped Laurie and Meester would stay together but you know throughout the movie that it literally just can't happen. Still their relationship shakes up their entire lives and turns everything on end. Somehow everyone learns something and finds their comingofage. The film's real feat is not making you feel angry at any of the characters but actually root for them and want to see everyone get what makes them happy. The film is in some ways a Christmas film but the most bizarre one in many aspects. The ending is almost too cut and dry and yet perfect also. I can't even call the film a dark comedy but it certainly has its moments for laughing and moments for being serious. All in all very entertaining and while it doesn't knock anything out of the ballpark it is absolutely worth seeing. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This German film by Fritz Lang was considered lost until a nitrate copy turned up in Brazil where it was partially restored. It has Portuguese intertitles with some English translations muxed in. This means that I found it very difficult to work out what was actually happening though I got the impression it was an early bergfilm. A woman travels by train and local tram on which she receives a telegram through the woods to the Knigsee. She is followed by a man and someone who may or may not have been her husband travels by car. At her hotel they have relet her room but the man offers her one of his. She then takes a motor boat across the Knigsee with the man following by rowing boat. To get away from her pursuer she goes into a house and persuades a woman to give her mountain clothes. She immediately starts climbing into the mountains. High up a shepherd refuses her shelter so she goes to a nearby farm. By this time her husband has caught up with her. She rejoins the shepherd who appears to be a former lover but who has made a celibacy vow to the nearby Notre Dame des Neiges perched on an ice cornice. They hide from the husband in a mountain refuge but he steals some dynamite from a nearby quarry and blasts an avalanche to bury the refuge. When the rescue party arrives he throws rocks at them but after a struggle falls off the mountain and is killed. The shepherd explains that he cannot return to civilisation because of his vow. On the way down the woman calls into the farm where the mother is dying. She comforts the child closes the mother's eyes and takes the child down to the town. Meanwhile the farmer has been praying to the Virgin asking to be released from his vows. A storm destroys the statue and he then sees the woman and child Madonnalike in a superbly composed scene going down the mountain. He follows and everyone recrosses the Knigsee. Back at the hotel the woman is having dinner with the man who had been following her when the shepherd walks in. They appear to be reunited. I may have got this completely wrong but the film was worth watching for the scenery alone in addition the acting was of a high quality without too many histrionics.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das wandernde Bild 1920 12 out of 4 This 1920 German film is one of Fritz Lang's earliest and for decades it was considered lost before a print turned up in Brazil in 1986. As with FOUR AROUND A WOMAN another Lang film this one here is missing at least two or three reels. I've read four different reviews for this film and each one gave a different description of the plot. What is certain the film is about a woman Mia May who runs away from her abusive husband. She ends up in some mountain era where she hides out only to run into what appears to be her husband's twin brother. Soon the husband is back on her trail as she runs into a former boyfriend who had taken a vow of celibacy. There are other plot twists with more people coming and going but it's pretty hard to tell exactly what's going on for a couple reasons. Of course there's the fact that so much of the film is missing but another negative thing is that the film has Portuguese intertitles and the English translation is extremely poor at times. With that said there's enough interesting aspects to make this film worth watching. There's no question that it's quite unlike anything else that Lang was doing around this time unless his other lost films turn out to be like this. The film really seems like it could have influenced Luis Bunuel due to all the religious stuff here. There are some striking images including one of the Virgin Mary coming down a mountain as well as other scenes that take a look at religion. I've heard one person call this film something that Dreyer would make instead of Lang and I think that's a fair statement. Another thing that makes this worth viewing is the performance by May who is downright breath taking at times. I thought she did a marvelous job showing how tortured and frightened this woman was. The actress never has to overact and makes for a very interesting character and one that you really care for. The rest of the performances were decent at best so there's no question this belongs to May all the way. Also known as THE MOVING IMAGE you can't help but hope that a complete print turns up at some point because it would undoubtedly make the film all the more interesting. There appear to be all sorts of subplots that have been cut out so I'm sure a complete print would help when it comes to figuring out the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "My DVD copy of this movie is a really beautiful print  and in lustrous color I might add. A friend purchased it for me in Germany about ten or twelve years ago. The DVD caries no label at all and almost needless to say with my customary dexterity I mislaid it. It turned up last night when I was actually hunting for something else. Don't get too excited! The frequent subtitles are in German and French. They are not plastered on the image but have frames to themselves German on the top half of the screen French on the bottom half. Fortunately I have a smattering of both German and French and the subtitles were obviously designed to be read by people like me who have what I would describe as a tourist vocabulary. There is no way in the world that I could read Mein Kampf but I know enough words to book a room order a meal and ask passersby the way to the zoo or how to get back to my hotel. So far so good. The problem is that the titles don't stay on screen long enough to read both the French and the German. Unless you want to freezeframe all the time  and as there are more than a hundred titles  you really need to pick French and ignore German or vice versa. So I finally settled on French.After going to all this trouble I later discovered there was a synopsis of the story in English on the back cover of the DVD! But it was all worth the trouble. A beautiful print and a certainly engaging if rather odd story that you would never associate with Fritz Lang. Filmed on real snowladen locations too!".

	schema:reviewBody "Das wandernde Bild or The Moving Image is a German blackandwhite silent movie from 1920 so it is not that long anymore until this one will have its 100th anniversary. The star here is clearly writer and director Fritz Lang but the cast includes a couple pretty famous names from the old days too such as Mia May or Rudolf KleinRogge of course. Unfortunately the film has not survived in its entirety but the version that still exists runs for 66 minutes and luckily they managed to include text notes about the scenes we cannot watch anymore. I think in this case it works in the film's favor that it is such a relatively short movie because it stays pretty essential. It did not drag and it never felt as if the film was too long for its own good. The scenes made sense in putting together a convincing product. The film has some good writing about family crime and drama and also has really nice photography for such an old movie. It is also an interesting example of how actors back then played effortlessly several characters in the same film. This one is better than most of Lang's more known works in my opinion. I recommend the watch.".

Not only because it was a failure as a comedy but that the quality cast it assembled and capable directorproducer team had seen much better days and illustrated how much of a rut the UK film industry was in the mid1970sThe film's humour a predictably endless series of doubleentendres is generally tedious.Having said that it could've been worse and is a slight improvement on the original 1971 film Percy. This is because Percy tried to have it's cake and eat it too be both a lowbrow sex comedy and a serious analysis of the central character's predicament and unsuccessful on both counts. This resulted in star Hywel Bennett's sad sack performance which belonged in another film.At least Percy's Progress doesn't pretend it's anything other than a bawdy sex comedy and is a bit livelier than it's predecessor. It's farcical elements aren't particularly funny but at least it's trying. And there are minor pleasures in the performances. As the central character although actually playing a different person from the first film technically Leigh Lawson is an improvement on Bennett and is a fairly amiable rogue of a character.And there are inevitable minor pleasures from a strong cast including Corbett in an enjoyable performance as a Harold Wilson type PM. And any film that has Vincent Price in it is always raised a level or two.But overall apart from being curio of 1970s UK cinema this is a film not worth seeking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Percy' was a 1971 British comedy starring Hywel Bennett as the recipient of the world's first penis transplant. Three years later a sequel  'Percy's Progress'  appeared. Bennett chose not to return so Leigh Lawson  later to become Twiggy's husband  replaced him. In a bad note of continuity 'Percy' is now the name of the lead character  in the first film he was 'Edwin' and 'Percy' was the nickname given to the penis . Bennett's shy antiques dealer has become a more extroverted character determined to sleep with everything in lipstick and a skirt. After his marriage to the lovely Moira collapses due to his constant infidelity Percy decides to escape from Britain by taking to sea in a luxury yacht. He spends a year on his own  how awful that must have been for him!  before going ashore seeking female company. He finds that a U.S. bomber has crashed releasing into the sea a toxin called P.X.123 rendering every man on Earth impotent. Because he had drunk nothing but Bollinger 69 for a year Percy is unaffected. When the girls at the local bordello realise this they pay him for his services. Percy returns to a hero's welcome in Britain and scores of redhot women demanding his attention...If you think all this sounds pretty ghastly you would be right. The first 'Percy' was a onejoke affair but this has virtually no jokes at all. Lawson is rather good as the amiable cad but has nothing to work with. Sid Colin can be blamed for the script along with Ian La Frenais  the wit of 'Porridge' and 'The Likely Lads' is conspicuously missing . The only vaguely amusing moment comes when U.N. countries stage a televised beauty contest to find girls of all nationalities to sleep with Percy  among them Maddy Smith  hosted by a Terry Wogan lookalike played by the late Alan Lake. Harry H.Corbett plays the British Prime Minister clearly based on Harold Wilson. Other big names camping it up to no avail are Vincent Price Ronald Fraser Milo O'Shea Bernard Lee Elke Sommer Julie Ege Judy Geeson and Barry Humphries. Its a little disconcerting to see the force behind the splendid 'Barry McKenzie' movies in something so dismal as this. Denholm Elliott reprises his role as 'Emmanuel Whitbread' the surgeon who originally grafted 'Percy' onto Edwin Anthony.Quite a lot of pop songs  by Tony Macaulay  grace the soundtrack presumably an effort by the producer to recover some of the budget  location filming took place in Cyprus  through the issuing of a tiein record. Raymond Hitchcock author of the novel on which 'Percy' was based wrote a novelisation. In Harry and Michael Medved's book 'The Golden Turkey Awards' the film is nominated in the category of 'Most Unerotic Concept In Pornography'  it did not win .This marked the end of the longrunning collaboration between producer Betty E.Box and director Ralph Thomas. What a sad picture for them to go out on.".

You'd be hard pressed to find any jokes and when there are any glimpses of anything resembling one it was the kind that is better flushed down the toilet. The story is thinly structured and so poorly focused that it is very difficult to find anything interesting or easy to comprehend while the characters have no likability or any sense of development the direction from Ralph Thomas lacks life and has the feel that he didn't know what he was doing the soundtrack feels misplaced and too much and it even looks amateurish. Leigh Lawson in an attempt to give him greater exposure is also rather bland in the lead role.Overall the cast were promising but are grossly poorly utilised in a frankly infantile waste of time. 110 Bethany Cox".

Hacking can be done well goldeneyeswordfishdiehard4...Not just an easy contrived plot device. Can we have a proper explanation the ruleslimitations of Silva's hacking ability in this fiction? For all I know Silva can make satellites fall on people.3. The irony of the 'can Bond operate in an internet world' theme...he failed twice and got M killed...so he can't? 4. How out of place the above theme is Bond is mature but always current. His a walking encyclopedia watch the start of any ConneryMoore film. In the last 2 films he was using advanced mobile phone tracking systems...adding hacking does not suddenly make Bond take on the 'modern' age. Are economics or funding civilwars outdated?There was hackingcomputers in 1995's Goldeneye..all of a sudden NOW there are no more shadows? Did MI6 stop evolving in the late eighties?5.They have a meeting to discuss MI6? This was relevant in Batman a vigilante was trying to inspire people It was intertwined in the narrativetheme. Skyfall enquiry was just Sam Mendes ripping off Batman6. Silva's planned capture Another overused device that was coincidently in Batman. So what did Silva achieve? A conversation with M? When this is revealed shouldn't we look back and have everything make sense? But NO I was left wondering why they tried to kill Bond twice in China.7. Why was a hacker in a cell controlled by a computer? Why is Q so stupid he plugged in the laptop to the building? Why was the trap door on the inside of the first glass door? why was there a trap door? How did Silva evade an armed MI6 guard 20 meters from his cell?8. Super calculating hack crazySilva's plan at the end was a firefight? With a backup plan of another firefight?9. So they figured out Silva was dressed as a cop and noone told anyone? The irony of M defending herself reading a poem knowing her own ex agent was about to shoot up the place was lost on criticswriters alike.10. Could Bond not take a Sim free phone or'radio' call backup when Silva arrived at the end? Instead they had their Home Alone moment even Macaulay Culkin eventually called the police11. Silva is supposed to mirror Bond. But compare Bond's 'betrayal' to Silva being handed over for torture... Some forced connection is made considering they never met before. Silva tells a story of 2rats so we know what we are supposed to think.12. Bond's betrayal is M ordering Naomi to take a risky shot. Bond later tell's M he heard the order... why didn't he get out the way then? he just kept fighting like an idiot. did Naomi only have 1 bullet?13.You can't make Bond survive 2 gun shots and a fall like that. His already an established character. The PunisherBourne are special BECAUSE they survive. It can't happen to them again mid film mid franchise.. 14. Bond follows an assassinlets him kill innocent people! How is this in his character?! The previous 2 films already rebooted Bond to show WHY he doesn't let innocents die.15. Naomi is a forced character..appearing randomly to remind us she still exists so we can think it's 'clever' when she becomes Moneypenny. Money penny gets demoted from field agent to secretary?!! not even analyst. If she is that hopeless why is she on the most important mission ever? I think Sam Mendes hates women. 16. Bond doesn't even blink when the girl he just bedded a few hours ago gets shot in cold blood. He identifies Severine as being sex traffickedabused He then just jumps in her shower. I had little problem with Bond tricking a woman into bed in live and let die but the skyfall scene should land him in the Soffenders list. 17.They traced the shrapnel in Bond's chest to a 'special'bullet that only 3 people use? His a 'ghost'...but we have his full flight manifesto. This is how they advanced the plot? wait a minute....didn't that bad guy shoot up half of turkey..? A contrivance a plot hole in one plot device that takes some doing.18. One minute he can't shoot...10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a 360 arc? so what happened? oh we are just abandoning that theme mid se.. 19. Quite a few instances of Bond just standing in front of a landscape shot with his legs apart 'being deep'. I thought he was urinating at first. 20. Q is both a quartermastera programmer for the sake of the illogical theme.. but these are completely different skill sets...?21. Knowing all this...what is the list doing in Turkey? on a laptop hardrive? why are only 23 agents on the case? They couldn't even do the liberty of making something up for the audience. Imagine Thunderball didn't show how SPECTRE got the nukes...Why couldn't Silva just hack the list? Oh because it isn't connected to the internet you say...but the MI6 heating system is?The script makes no sense the themes are inappropriate Bond's characterdecision making has been altered they have confused mature with dinosaur.

	schema:headline " A Truly Awful Movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie you can't just wave it to one side.For example when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the campgay innuendos were painful to watch. I couldn't believe what I was watching.This was an appalling movie. It relied on Judi Dench to hold it all together. Sadly I am not able to give it a 0 so I will give it 110. No action in the movie what so ever after the opening scene. Two men hugging on top of a train has been done so many times. Pathetic movie and the only people who will enjoy this are the brain dead. Shame on critics who were saying this was the best Bond movie ever you should be ashamed of yourselves.I used to like Daniel Craig as Bond but thanks to this movie I now dislike him too. Well done to Sam Mendes and Co it takes a certain amount of talent or the lack of it to single handedly destroy Bond. The hero in this movie was the final credits the real baddie in this movie was the man behind the camera.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie you can't just wave it to one side.For example when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the campgay innuendos were painful to watch.

O.K. when Bond is no bigger than life daredevil anymore it seems to be a logical consequence to let the audience learn more about the true psyche of Bond. But this is completely crap in my eyes!An other complacent try by Mrs. Broccoli to revitalize the dusty genre of spy movies. But the audience was always smarter and realized of course that Bond never was realistic. The audience does not need to be educated in the direction of a more temporary 21st. century Bond by some filmmakers who do not want become suspects of doing the same thing all over again. Bond WAS always the same for 40 years till Albert Broccoli died and his very very untalented daughter took over the franchise automatically. This happens when you bequeath a businessthere is no warranty that your children are going to handle it well.The real Bond is a classical archetype male and a chauvinistic arrogant womanizer with a very dangerous job secret agent no woman can withstand although she knows what a heart breaker he is. This worked for 40 years and would have worked for another 40 years or so. The Bond we knew until Craig appeared might not be the type of man radical leftwing Ecoactivist broads would like to welcome to their sitin. Fact is the real Bond is dead!This is a private version of Mrs. Broccoli's fantasy Bond 008 a guy who deeply comprehends women instead of bumping them before they can count to three which might be a challenge for some real Bond girls.... Of course it's intended not to be your dirty old father's Bond. It's a Bond for the masses not for the classes offering a bit of everything the average movie goer under 20 Twilightfans might want to consume.Craig's Bond has become a sissy who has a complex oedipal relationship to elder women especially to those he calls M. Now in Skyfall we will learn that M is for mother... There really was no need to change the Bond franchise so completely except to squeeze out some dollars more out of the franchise. R.I.P. 007!".

	schema:headline " Familiar yet original";
	schema:reviewBody "For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise the latest James Bond thriller Skyfall is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula insideout. While there is an element of globetrotting and exotic locales are definitely featured much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And without giving too much away the movie's finale is setup as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up it is a Bond movie after all. But when they do we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe when things go wrong M is called to testify before a committee hearing.The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job but we also dig deeper into his backstory than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series then Skyfall completes the Bond origin story. In this movie we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.Of course most Bond movies are only as good as their villain and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever he may rank pretty high on the alltime movie bad guy list too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination but rather revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie two great actors going headtohead.There are also Bond girls naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory womanwithatragicpast. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a nonromantic way she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits James Bond Will Return.".

	schema:headline " Boring";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought Skyfall was awful. Worst of all it was just boring something I would never think I would say about any Bond film.The movie starts off well enough a good chase scene in an exotic location and it sets itself up for what could have been a good story. The trouble is after the first 15 mins the story seems to go nowhere.MI6 is in trouble a list of its agents goes missing and has to be recovered. Bond who everyone thought was dead comes back to save the day. All good so far. Now for some very thin reason Bond has to go to Shanghai. I wonder if this scene was added to boost box office figures in China because it was totally irrelevant to the story. Next scene Bond meets the 'baddie'. Not some master criminal but an ex MI6 agent out for some revenge. This plot had already been covered in Goldeneye with much better results. The Baddie looked more likely to Blow Bond than Blow up MI6 and there was even a joke along that line.The story now moves to London. I applaud the decision to have a Bond movie in the UK especially in the JubileeOlympic50 year Bond year but frankly it just painted England like every foreigners stereotype. Cold Wet and miserable. Now it is about a plot to kill M this has also been covered before in 'The World is not Enough' and the movie never returns to locating the missing list of agents.Why didn't the bad guy just kill M at the beginning of the movie and spare me sitting through 2 hours of boredom? I gave this film 410 because it has an unexpected twist at the end that the production team have managed not to leek prior to release. If it were not for that then Id probably have given it only 310.Craig is now showing his age and in my opinion there are many better suited actors to the part. People moaned about QOS but frankly this movie is the worst Bond film ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen harddrive makes M Dench look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough not fun enough not enough sex not enough action not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies but we do live in different times now the world has changed and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he and M etc outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operativesorganisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. The plot of Skyfall as written is simple absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning precredits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves. A washed up Bond enters the fray and he convinces he's dishevelled unshaven and unfit but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon we know this and he will be in wonderful physical shape and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah but there's the adversary on the scene now a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's perfect Silva a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well not just a steamy shower scene but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' excellent Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves and Bond in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know all turf is Bond's turf but this time it really is HIS turf and as a little back story comes seeping out Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old. All the Bondian trappings are still here exotic locales gorgeous women speeding vehicles fights stupendous stunts bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film but for many it's not Bondian enough and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast with Craig surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley are eye delights his colour tones are beautiful I promise you nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins. It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for and it does have flaws new Q a bit too geeky safe finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain and remains simple in plot but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure but that most definitely isn't a bad thing it knows its past and it now knows its future and without doubt we all still know the name. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "My first review on IMDb couldn't resist offering some balance to the obvious early march of fanboy reviews! Always been abit of a Bond fan and I was looking forward to being taken away to some exotic locations to escape for a few hours and some edge of seat action but these things were missing from Skyfall.Production standards have slipped terribly on Skyfall with stuntmen clearly visible motorbike chaseand some of the worst sets I have ever seen. The Skyfall Lodge Bond's family home is especially appalling and some people even laughed in the cinema when they pulled up in the old Aston.The Q character doesn't work at all not convincing in any way with the fake glasses and daft hair...EON please rethink this for the next movie and also forget the Moneypenny actress because she cannot act least not in this character anyway.Some of the SFX were good but the opening chase scene was way to long and instead of building suspense most people just got bored.The french actress Berenice was superb as was Rory Kinnear though for me Craig struggled to capture my attention like he did in Casino Royale.Bardem was underused or poorly directed and never intimidating as a true 'baddie' should be and why oh why did they dye his hair? it was so so unconvincing.I have yet to meet anybody who thinks this is a great movie let alone 'the best Bond ever!' I am staggered that some people like this Bond but I guess we are all different! I wonder how these figures are calculated as most of the last few thousand votes have been poor but I am new to IMDb great site by the wayso maybe it takes awhile for the early enthusiast votes to be corrected by more 'normal' viewings?! And I suppose there will always be the fan element hell bent on 'talking a movie up' whereas someone who has watched a film they dislike generally will just want to forget about it!".

The Scottish countryside shown was so grim.Where are the cars and gadgets? Nothing but the old Aston Martin. Just that pistol and tracker. The new Q is so ineffective. The villain played by Javier Bardem. He is more comical than sinister. With the blond fright wig the campy overtures and the most frightening of all the dentures this must the most absurd bad guy in Bond history.The climax feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defences and geriatric defenders it felt like Home Alone meets the Golden Girls. Might as well have asked Betty White or grandma to join in. The new Bond girl Berenice Marlohe is exotic and fascinating to look at. But why only one? Writing her out of the show so early and not having another was a mistake. The Bond girl is supposed to end up saved by Bond with a hook up at the end. Unless you consider M a Bond girl.The focus of the movie is M. Judi Dench was always too provincial looking for MI6. The only good thing about this movie is that Ralph Fiennes is replacing her. Finally. There was no need to dedicate a whole movie to her farewell. Daniel Craig is just so haggard he looks worse than the villain. It's time to replace him with someone younger and handsomer. Baffled by the good reviews. Be warned we are being short changed.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been a long ride for the Bond series since the creation of the character there have been 15 novels by Ian Fleming plenty of spinoff novels comics cartoons and video games and the film series is now 50 years old. There have been an extraordinary 23 official films but few as extraordinary as Skyfall.After a mission goes wrong in Istanbul MI6 loses a hard drive containing a list of all NATO agents within terrorist cells and James Bond Daniel Craig is presumed Killed in Action. M's Judi Dench competence is questioned and the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee Gareth Mallory Ralph Fiennes plans to replace her. Making matters worse a cyberterrorist targets MI6 and M personally getting a hold of the list and causing an explosion within MI6's headquarters. An older more damaged Bond then returns to duty to serve Queen and Country having to prove he is in shape before going on the search to find the terrorist.Skyfall is a longawaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes but it delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond films Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and continues strongly from then on including a very stylish silhouette fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and practical effects were at the forefront.A challenge for the Bond series has always been realworld relevance. The series has faced down all challenges from the end of the Cold War to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage. MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government denied existed it has to face the realities of the 24hour media age we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.The nature of the threats have changed Bond faces a cyberterrorist and along with the new Q both could cause more damage than Bond can. In the real world we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says she is scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now faceless and nationless and this element can work in the series' favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark which is why it is so enduring.Skyfall also goes full circle for Bond as the filmmakers reintroduce popular characters gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale Bond is a young man who is bold arrogant and reckless but can get the job done in Skyfall Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and emotionally vulnerable.The idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film Never Say Never Again but that was more to accommodate a 52yearold Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance cementing his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond and the script treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's character arch the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can be cleansed.The casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms but the master planner has a very sinister delivery. He has a complex tragic background but he is not like other Bond villains looking for control world domination money or even selfpreservation he simply wants revenge.Skyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing but rather nice touches. The last anniversary Bond film Die Another Day was a disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few major references to previous Bond films Bond getting injured The World is Not Enough Bond faking his death You Only Live Twice the gun that can only work with Bond's palm print Licence to Kill and a similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you would want to find not being forced upon you.Skyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a film that has a 143minute running time the second longest Bond film Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting entertaining film.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com".

	schema:reviewBody "As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts with the exception of Casino Royale I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today. Although I've always been the one to say that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever I can now confess that Daniel Craig now holds that honor. Sean plays the comedic smooth and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious dark and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is if you are drinking by yourself in a bar then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.Aside from Daniel Craig you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty exMI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort Quantum of Solace. I look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy. If Skyfall is a sign of things to come then I will remain incredibly optimistic about the future.".

	schema:headline " Skyfall 007 Reloaded!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Could we discuss the next part of your performance over that drink?' asks the glittering Severine Berenice Marlohe from a suave tuxedoed James Bond Daniel Craig. And indeed this 23rd Bond outing superbly directed by the usually reliable Sam Mendes does just that pausing appropriately to settle down leisurely over a drink for some flirtation some tense verbal confrontation some selfreflection and brooding just before cutting away to some cleancut thrilling action. The result is the uniquely named 'Skyfall' a Bond film so full of the vintage charm and charisma yet fashioned in modern urban and instantly accessible style that it ends up being one of the finest films of the franchise.Yes Mendes' film is a solid revamp of the Bond franchise bringing in welcome dollops of humor luxury and sensuality that went missing from the franchise with the last outing. And impressively enough there is enough emotion without slowing things down enough tension and action without making it too frenetic and the pacing is so so perfect that you seldom feel the film falling short or dragging too long.Pretty much everyone would agree that the 60s were the heyday of the Bond films. Those Sean Connerystarrers were primarily all about the leading man and his ladies but each was fashioned with such a slick ease wiseass humor and layercakes of moments that we embraced them all as subversive classics. 'Skyfall' fortunately is a film that reaches up to that caliber.Clearly the best thing about the film is the pacing. Mendes is in no hurry to let the film unravel. The story begins in Istanbul with Bond and his sidekick Eve Moneypenny a sharptongued Naomie Harris smarter than ever chasing down a man with a list. The action scenes come in neatly and the opening pursuit shifts from a hectic bike chase on the rooftops to the cliffhanging fight on top of the train and it all looks truly spectacular.The plot is simple enough MI6 is under attack from a former agent a renegade named Silva Javier Bardem who has a knack for orchestrating terrorist attacks with a simple click of the mouse. But trust me this has to be one of the smoothest Bond outings in recent years Mendes smartly and adroitly navigates the action from Istanbul to alternately grey and sunny London and from the stunning Shanghai to the villain's lair ideally an abandoned island and finally in Bond's ancestral home in rural Scotland's foggy moors setting the stage for a truly dramatic experience.And boy it delivers. For all the charm that it delivers this has to be one of the most intimately dramatic Bond outing since ages. The plot is about how the ubiquitous computer can be used as a weapon for security breach but more importantly this is a film that pairs both Bond and his nemesis in the same light both are tortured souls both were MI6 heroes who had been left for the dead in the name of protocol and duty and M played superbly by Judi Dench looms like a domineering matriarch over both the men. Silva's angst is against M's coldblooded dedication to her duty and Bond feels some of it as well but the latter clings to his morals out of loyalty to his nation. The stakes are downright personal and high and clearly each scene of action or searing tension feels immediate urgent and the film gels with us on a personal level.But none of it jars. Smartly enough everything is on an even keel the action feels perfectly urgent but it does not stretch the drama is poignant and painful the humor comes in like a fresh breath into the taut proceedings and it all works impeccably as smoothly as the click of a mouse itself.'Skyfall' also proves quite what everyone is saying since 2006's 'Casino Royale that Daniel Craig is the best Bond we had since Connery. This is a film where he is never as before instead of the hardened brutal action hero we were handed last time here is a more relaxed Bond clearly at greater ease flirting with women and sparring with M and Q an impressive Ben Whishaw with equal dry charm and sarcasm. He makes his oneliners blaze and his quieter moments are played out with a subtlety. He rules the film without trying too hard. It is a solid compelling act.And he is matched by the villain as well. Super performer Javier Bardem shows up in an unforgettable role as the menacing Silva a man whom you might cringe at yet a character who stays with us as long as he is there in the film. He flips between smooth talking to a nasty edge with superb ease and his confrontation with Bond is clearly the highlight of the film. This is also an action film where the cinematographer also stands out. The work of veteran lensman Roger Deakins is clearly one of the best things in this film. Deakins bathes each frame from the action and suspense to the more reflective and emotional sequences with a fantastic play of light shadow shade texture and perspective. Everything looks stunning perfectly placed and in balance yet urgent and explosive.'Skyfall' is clearly a Bond film for the ages. The layercakes of vintage moments are perfectly underlined with a modern style the scene between Q and Bond is a moment of selfreflexive humor clearly revealing the generation gap between the two and the one between the new and the old Bond. Clearly this is a film that has something for both the fans of old and fans of new. And that is a grandstanding achievement itself.Thank you Daniel Craig. Thank You Javier Bardem and thank you Sam Mendes for making me believe in James Bond again.Now give us some more. Ah! It was worth the wait.".

Smartly enough everything is on an even keel the action feels perfectly urgent but it does not stretch the drama is poignant and painful the humor comes in like a fresh breath into the taut proceedings and it all works impeccably as smoothly as the click of a mouse itself.'Skyfall' also proves quite what everyone is saying since 2006's 'Casino Royale that Daniel Craig is the best Bond we had since Connery. This is a film where he is never as before instead of the hardened brutal action hero we were handed last time here is a more relaxed Bond clearly at greater ease flirting with women and sparring with M and Q an impressive Ben Whishaw with equal dry charm and sarcasm. He makes his oneliners blaze and his quieter moments are played out with a subtlety. He rules the film without trying too hard. It is a solid compelling act.And he is matched by the villain as well. Super performer Javier Bardem shows up in an unforgettable role as the menacing Silva a man whom you might cringe at yet a character who stays with us as long as he is there in the film. He flips between smooth talking to a nasty edge with superb ease and his confrontation with Bond is clearly the highlight of the film. This is also an action film where the cinematographer also stands out. The work of veteran lensman Roger Deakins is clearly one of the best things in this film. Deakins bathes each frame from the action and suspense to the more reflective and emotional sequences with a fantastic play of light shadow shade texture and perspective. Everything looks stunning perfectly placed and in balance yet urgent and explosive.'Skyfall' is clearly a Bond film for the ages. The layercakes of vintage moments are perfectly underlined with a modern style the scene between Q and Bond is a moment of selfreflexive humor clearly revealing the generation gap between the two and the one between the new and the old Bond. Clearly this is a film that has something for both the fans of old and fans of new. And that is a grandstanding achievement itself.Thank you Daniel Craig. Thank You Javier Bardem and thank you Sam Mendes for making me believe in James Bond again.Now give us some more. Ah! It was worth the wait.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like thousands of others I am a Bond fan and although we all have differing views on what Bond should be we all expect a good Bond movie to be an escape from our day to day lives. A glamorous life full of suspense and intrigue. Skyfall has no suspense intrigue or glamour save for Berenice and as such is not escapism and not a 'Bond film'. Casino Royale was a Bond film and a very good one at that so this mess isn't Craig's fault.Like others I also saw terrible sets especially Skyfall Lodge which looked like something from a sixties TV series crossroads or it's a knockout!Also I noticed clear as day Craig's stuntman on several occasions completely ruining for me the roof top motorbike chase. Continuity errors all over the place not worthy of a Bond film from any era.Q was miscast and his specs were embarrassing all wrong wrong wrong.The new Moneypenny should never sleep with Bond and Naomie Harris cannot act to save herself.Berenice Marlohe is amazing an incredible actress and totally stunning. My one point out of ten is all for her!Another weird thing about this Bond.....nobody mentions 'Britain' only 'England'  is this a future proofed Bond ready for Scottish independence?! England is mentioned several time but not Britain anymore even though we saw union jacks but no George flag. A small point to some but a major puzzle to some what is this all about?Never ever did I have all these concerns watching a Bourne movie or even the brilliant TV series Homeland in these productions you never stop to think 'this isn't real' because it is all done so well that you just get wrapped up in it all. Not so this film for me so so many errors that I couldn't wait to get out of the cinema. Above all this film bored me and depressed me something I have never said about any Bond film before not even Q of Solace.The real puzzle for me is who likes it? My straw poll of 11 people has brought up 8 who disliked it and felt tricked with the rest not bothered either way so how come all the hype? How come all the glowing professional reviews? It's almost 'the king has no clothes' situation isn't it? Or maybe all the pro UK stuff in our Olympic year of celebration has made everyone lose their objectiveness.Either way I have yet to meet anyone who thought this was a great movie.".

It's a fantasy world of beautiful women gadgets real stunts and cheesy oneliners but this so called Real Bond doesn't work for me. Were Pierce Brosnan Roger Moore and Sean Connery cyborg robots? I must have missed something.Bond movies have their own style and special formula with the usual ingredients similar to a Big Mac. In fact others have made a very good living copying Bond from Austin Powers Johnny English Spy Hard Ispy and many more. But how do you copy this movie? It was like watching a straighttoDVD Steven Seagal movie. Dare I even say worse than a Seagal movie.Now most 'professional' film critics will say this is the 'best Bond movie ever' so that they can kiss butt to get more free tickets and invites to premieres none of them are going to be honest. So as an average movie goer who has to pay to see the film I expect my money's worth. This movie was like paying for a Big Mac but just getting the bun and nothing in the middle.Skyfall or as I notsocleverly renamed it Skyfail was boring from the beginning to the near end only part I enjoyed was Bond in the very end. The cold and bleak landscape of Scotland was perfect for Bond. Unfortunately the other characters at the end bored me. The baddie arrives in a military type helicopter with John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom blasted out from a speaker which was brilliant but where did he get it from? Surely they aren't available on ebay are they? Most people will say they enjoyed the opening scene which in time they will probably realise was pretty awful and rather boring. An Audi slides on its side a few yards and somehow rerights itself. With just a minor scratch on it this is the 'action scene'. My teenager son causes more damage to his car on a Friday night. The Bikes even drive pass the same place twice which is unforgivable in any movie.The Bond girls in Casino Royale Eva Green and Caterina Murino were gorgeous by anyone's standards but since then the Bond girls have been rather rough looking.You don't get your money's worth in this movie nor do you see anything new. All you get is a director who thinks he knows best how to make a Bond movie and that the tried and tested formula is somehow wrong. We live in a tech world the information age but somehow Bond who has always been ahead in the tech department has now been left behind. He seems more interested in drinking and gambling than saving the world with a toaster that can turn into a 'Little Nellie'Oh how i miss you 007!As a child growing up with Bond I had the toys The sleek silver DB5 with the ejector seat and the white Lotus that was a necessity come bath time. What do the kids now have from Bond I wonder? Gambling chips? Or some video game which is more violent than the movie?It would have been nice to see a Bond movie on its 50th anniversary going all out with major action sequences as you would expect in an action movie such as Mission Impossible Bourne or even a Terminator movie. Instead we are spoon fed a Downton Abbey version of Bond we definitely had the cast all that was missing were the costumes.The cast Daniel Craig and his potatofieldlike face looked more like Bond in this movie than the previous two. Javier Bardem was a let down and looked like a 70s porn director. Judi Dench gets to swear again somehow they think it's cool to have an acclaimed actor swearing. Ralph Fiennes thought this was a WWII movie all that was missing was his German SS costume Naomie Harris has no real input she's just chucked in to the grinder to appeal to a wider audience. Berenice Marlohe was somehow weaved into the story to let Bond order a drink and have sex Albert Finney plays a Scot as bad as I would Ola Rapace gets his part thanks to his real life wife and Ben Whishaw tries hard to play a geek with the usual geeky stereotype but ends up releasing the villain from his fish tank. Believe it or not but Q used to be intelligent... that's how he got a job at the Military Intelligence Department.In my opinion a Bond movie should look and feel like a... dare I say it... a Bond movie. This was sadly a poor scripted a poor acted and a poor attempt at making an action movie. In time this movie will go down as the worst Bond movie but right now the hype around it is causing a smoke screen. That's how Bond saves M. Somehow the baddie shoots a few rounds at M and then out of nowhere decides to leave after going to all that trouble in finding her!. Albert Broccoli and Ian Fleming must be turning in their graves. It took 50 years for some sorry excuse of a director who thinks he's an artist of some sort to ruin it. Very sad time for Bond fans. A disappointment as a Bond movie or even a stand alone movie.I give it a 1 for the helicopter scene and thank you Mr Hooker for waking me up.Don't try to reinvent the Big Mac by taking the meat out of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A James Bond film made for the modern era you'd be hard pressed to find any other film series able to stand the test of time and still feel relevant. When it looks like it's lagging behind the competition of the other spy action thrillers the makers have taken note and reinvented the mould making it more real and exciting.To me Bond had too much of a rigid formula the cars the chases the girls the gadgets the megalomaniac villain's and the spectacular set piecesstunts. After a while though the older films seem to suffer from a sense of deja vu. It's a case of been there done that. The structure of the films have become stale and repetitive. Same plot about a group of criminalsorganisation hell bent on world dominationdestruction with a beautiful bond girl in tow Bond and or Bond girl gets capture ridiculous car chase or stunts with a million of cheesy one liners. Frankly I had pretty much given up on the Bond films. They have become predictable and tedious with only the change of location to give the film any sort of distinction.The plot of Skyfall is unlike previous Bond films starts with the routine chase resulting in Bond being shot and wounded believed to be dead by MI6. When an attack on MI6 headquarters manifest through a cyber attack and a bombing at the headquarters Bond returns to uncover who is behind the assault. Struggling from his gun shot wound Bond has to prove his fitness mentally and physically through some rigorous tests. Sent back into action without being fully fit Bond embarks on the mission to expose the mastermind. What Bond discovers is a villain who happens to be exagent who has a vendetta against M and will stop at nothing to kill her.First thing you'll notice is the lack of gadgets and the usually bond girl there is one of sorts but you'll understand when you watch it. Also with a villain who is suave yet as equally menacing as Hannibal Lector we have a loose cannon who isn't after the world but revenge. It's spy vs spy and the story is more of a evolution of the characters that inhabit the world of Bond. Nods to older Bond films crop up from dialogue props and even the classic Austin Martin car makes an appearance. It's a homage as well as a resurrection of well known characters.What we are given here is a Bond with more layers to him and more emotions. Daniel Craig has moulded a Bond who is more relateable. Signs of physical and emotional weakness shows us a Bond who is no longer a super spy with little or no vulnerability. Other characters are given more screen time and provide an emotion gravitas We are also introduced to Q a young model who is still wet behind the ears.In the hands of Sam Mendes and Director of photography Roger Deakins there has never been a more beautiful shot Bond film. During Bond's fight with a criminal minion we see only their silhouettes but the eye is drawn to the beauty of the neon Shanghai backdrop. The reserve can be said for the grime dour and rainy streets of London which captures our the United Kingdom perfectly.It's a satisfying and enjoyable film with plenty of action and a surprising emotional core to the narrative. A great development in characters with seeds being sown to allow for a more relateable and mature story telling and for future characters to come to the fore. Skyfall has made me fall in love with Bond films again so here's hoping there's no more rigid formula and routine mundane narratives of past.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's the Bond film we've all been waiting for. After the stunning reinvention of Casino Royale and the misstep that followed with Quantum of Solace Skyfall feels like a true resurrection of the character and the Bond universe and an incredible addition to the storied franchise. From its spectacular opening scene in Istanbul to its sensational climax in the Scottish Highlands the film grabs hold of the audience and never lets go.With the great Sam Mendes at the helm Skyfall is propelled by a veritable narrative purpose. Mendes values story and character over anything and he gets Bond. His action sequences are thrilling artfully directed and a joy to watch. He directs with finesse and nuance the powerful characterdriven scenes. He understands the soul and essence of Bond and respects the spirit of the franchise but also breaks new ground with the treatment of the story.Speaking of which the script tells a moving thematically resonant and intelligent story and features superbly written scenes. It is more focused than Quantum of Solace which felt oddly disjointed at times. Writers Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan elegantly balance humorous moments with truly dramatic ones while never straying from the emotional heart of the film. Best of all they further develop Casino Royale's brilliant idea of delving into Bond's vulnerability and the result is a fascinating and flawed character. The human and moral stakes are high and much more personal this time around. The audience feels emotionally invested in the story. In the end the film is a reflection on aging and on not only why the world needs Bond but also why he must and will endure.Visually Skyfall is a true wonder. Roger Deakins' cinematography is aesthetically magnificent and serves the story well. Deakins shoots Istanbul London Macau Shanghai and the Scottish Highlands in a tasteful artistic and original manner. It is by far the most beautifully shot Bond I have ever seen. Thomas Newman's score is terrific and rich cleverly using the classic Bond theme in new and interesting ways and incorporating Adele's alreadyclassic theme to create a memorable piece of music.Finally the cast all deliver fine performances. Daniel Craig gives a thoughtful moving and nuanced performance which constitutes his strongest interpretation of the character to date. Judi Dench offers a much more intimate and personal take on M. Ralph Fiennes Albert Finney Ben Whishaw Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe are memorable. And what to say of Javier Bardem who steals every scene he appears in? He is funny unpredictable frightening and most interestingly tragic. A fantastic Bond villain.If you had any reservation about seeing this film after the lacklustre Quantum of Solace fear no more. Skyfall redeems faults of the past and is one of the best films of the year. It hits all the right notes. Sam Mendes has infused Bond with a deft sense of fun pathos and class.It's a great time at the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned oneliners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film effectively kills off the character we all know and love. The plot is shot full of holes the villain a camp idiot no Bond girls to speak of unless sex slaves are your thing truly vile of Craig not to have objected to that storyline pointless and seriously unfunny dialogue unriveting action scenes most of which we've seen done better elsewhere and telegraphing of practically every prop placement. Oh wait there's more an awful and forgettable Bond film song sung by that large breathy lady who fudges the top notes and has merely rehashed Goldfinger. And a limp ending. To be fair I liked the opening credits minus the song and I thought Brnice Marlohe acted well and Ralph Fiennes enunciates well. The shots of London were OK and the skyscraper neon dazzled  even if the plot at that point fell apart faster than the shot glass. I wanted to like this film. I wanted to give the mumbling Craig one last chance but he just isn't Bond so what do they do? They write a blancmange Bond so Craig will fit right in. Meanwhile we are left holding ticket stubs asking what was THAT all about? It was about a lot of things that had nothing to do with our James. Almost everything that kept the franchise going for 50 years has been interfered or radically dispensed with on purpose! No gadgets no credible Bond car they destroy the iconic one  unsubtle flagging of what they are doing to our Bond?. Moneypenny is now black and totes a gun I kid you not  how do they explain away her colour? But worse she is it's all so wrong! attractive and sob beds Bond  words fail. Dench's M is as usual flat and unconvincing but at least she's out of the next films  a good career move one that Craig should take. Q is a horrible little boy you can't possibly believe a hacker even if you accept the stupidity of casting Q as one...and with big black glasses? Come on...Maybe Bond should always stay in the 60s 70s. I mean you don't update Hercule Poirot and have him ponce about in the 21st century. I think they should just stop the Bond farce right now. It can and will only get worse.".

	schema:headline " Badly done!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been a James Bond fan for years but this movie was just badly bolted together. Why?1. How did Eve who was chasing the train in the truck and barely keeping up suddenly get two or three minutes ahead of the train in time to set up for when it emerged from the tunnel? The timing simply doesn't work. 2. M orders Eve to take the shot three times. Bond heard them and Eve's complaint that the shot wasn't clean. So why didn't Bond simply drop to the roof of the car and let her have the shot? If she missed he could easily resume his fight in the next tunnel. 3. Why didn't Eve take a second shot at the henchman on the roof of the train after she shot Bond? The henchman had enough time to turn to her and all but wave a 'thank you' yet she didn't bother. 4. Bond survives the fall from the train how exactly? He is on the roof of a train moving at approximately 40mph when he is shot catapulted backward and falls hundreds of feet into a river. Because he is unconscious he can not enter the water at a safe angle and should have been killed. As if this isn't bad enough the unconscious Bond is then swept over a high waterfall. The title sequences explain nothing of his escape and when they end Bond is in a hut on the beach bedding some girl. Not explaining his survival is a critical error which borders on ludicrous yet somehow the audience is meant to take it all seriously. 5. It is clear that Eve is a poor field agent. Later Bond suggests that she simply doesn't belong in the field. However this raises the question how did she acquire field agent status to begin with? 6. Bond always attempts to keep collateral damage amongst civilians to a minimum and protects the defenseless. However in this film he allows the villains to do their dirty work before he intervenes. 7. To this Bond as developed in the last two films women quickly became anything but 'disposable pleasures'. The death of Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale was a terrific trauma when Ms. Fields is killed in Quantum he is again visibly angry. However in Skyfall Bond not only makes no attempt to save Svrine not even attempting to fight the henchmen to provide a distraction until the backup he knows is en route arrives but he shows absolutely no glimmer of distress over her death. In fact his first response is a fast and badly delivered quip about it being a 'waste of good Scotch.' 8. Silva had tried to take his own life by a hydrogen cyanide pill. Instead of killing him he merely felt a burning sensation and had most of his teeth and jaw fell off. Such 'suicide pills' kill they do not merely give one a little heartburn and bad teeth. 9. What was the point of Silva setting up his own arrest? Ostensibly it is so that he can talk to M one last time. But why not just travel to London abduct M from the hearing and talk to her before doing her in? 10. If Q was good enough to have invented the security on Silva's computer how was it that he was unable to stop it from freeing Silva? 11. How did Silva know that within just a few seconds of the blast an empty train would be coming through to conveniently fall on and crush Bond allowing him to escape? 12. The 1964 Aston Martin made its triumphant return in this film but unfortunately it did so in a way that created continuity errors and glaring reboot issues. It is not a 'company car' so it must be the same Aston Martin that Bond won from Dimitrios playing cards in Casino Royale. However it has all of the Qbranch addons from Goldfinger If this had been Dimitrios' car why did it have the Goldfinger configuration from Q Branch? This thoroughly wrecked the film's continuity with the reboot. 13. What was the purpose of taking M to Skyfall? In the film it is openly suggested that the plan is a trap to catch Silva with M serving as the bait. However if it is a trap one would expect Bond to create a scenario where they would have a significant advantage. It is poorly explained why he doesn't want backup he depended on them for extraction from Silva's island he also takes no weaponry with them. Instead the unlikely trio is forced to create a Home Alone style defense of Skyfall which is doomed to failure before it even begins 14. Why did the monk's tunnel lead not all the way to the chapel but into the middle of the moor? A halftunnel is barely worth the effort to build. 15. When M and Kincade enter the tunnel to leave the house Kincade closes and locks the door from the other side. Yet when Bond decides to leave he has no difficulty simply opening the door. 16. Why would M and Kincade while secretly fleeing the attack through the moor in the middle of the night use a flashlight to illuminate their path? This could only be a dead giveaway of their position to Silva and his henchmen. Why not just pull out a Las Vegasstyle neon sign and have M cry out from the moor Oh Silva come and get us! 17. Silva's death scene was preposterous and very nearly Monty Pythonesque. Bond stabs Silva in midback with a blade it would have severed the spinal cord causing instant paralysis before death. Yet Silva bizarrely laughs and staggers toward Bond. 18. There were many continuity mistakes introduced into the film through sloppy editing such as M's handbag in Mallory's office.Very badly done film.".

Also there's a danger people will have decided they love the movie before they even see it and I think that's what's happened here. It's the Emperor's New Clothes. This is an average movie at best.There are so many reasons why this doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No Goldeneye or Casino Royale I'll just mention a fewRidiculous Villain with a ridiculous plan Are we expected to believe that this guy can put together a team of world class elite mercenaries set up the most advanced cyberterrorism organisation in the world and all he wants to use it for is to kill his ex boss? It's just a limp implausible plan.Major Plot Holes As already mentioned by other users here there's just so much that doesn't stack. Silva's whole plan is based around letting himself get caught knowing where he'll be imprisoned and knowing how to get from there to where M will be at that time? Surely if he can hack into any system in the world including triggering a gas explosion in M's office he could just arrange to break into her house at some point? Also he's managed to plant explosives in the tunnels below the Underground right at the point where Bond will be standing at exactly the moment a train is passing overhead and he did this years in advance? minor point that train was completely empty of people. Just lazy directionQuote approximately anyway This guy is a ghost. Nobody knows anything about him his real name or where he's from..... But we do know he'll be flying to shanghai in 2 days on flight 235 landing at 21.00. I mean come on.The Agents List Did Silva actually steal this? If so why? Just to get M and Bond's attention? And once he's started releasing the names does he stop? Clumsy plot line.Komodo Dragons. Enough said.I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's beautifully shot has some decent action sequences and explores new and interesting sides to a very well known character. But there's far too many problems with it up there with the best Bonds or to put it in IMDb's top 250.".

	schema:headline " Insults your intelligence then does it again.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is right up there with Mortal Kombat 2 and 2012 as the worst movies I've sat through in the theater. Nothing made sense and they insulted your intelligence time and time and time again.Spoilers Ahead.The first hour was actually pretty interesting  albeit bizarre. That Bond survived the fall without any explanation was odd but hey I can live with one miracle resurrection  it's a Bond movie. The sequence in Shanghai was also pretty well done and the silhouette fight was great cinematography  but again  Bond lets the bad guy shoot his target? But who's the target? And if he wanted to trail him to know who he was working for  why would he kill him? But OK he finds a clue and goes to Macau where he redeems a chip that obviously isn't for him. So instead of being interrogated by the Casino staffthugs  a woman comes up to him and more or less gives up her boss with her handlers a few feet away. What? OK so then there's an obligatory fight in a kimodo dragon pit which is short but fun and then off to Japan's battleship island to meet...possibly the most inconsistently motivated villain of all time.Silva's entrance is menacing the story about the rats in the barrel is sinister and he's flamboyant enough to say 'this guy creeps me out'. But he reveals nothing about his operation and this is the start of where his motivation just dissolves.The first part of the movie is about an agent list and hurting MI6. We learn on the island that he was somehow hurtbetrayed by MI6 and that he wants to share his revenge with Bond who also in a very roundabout way was also betrayed said he was up to field service when he failed all the tests. Bond of course rejects this offer and then after a brief fight has an army come rescue him  because of a radio transmitter. Really? No one searched him before getting on the island? It was in his coat pocket! But OK we're then learn that M gave Silva up to get some of her agents in return which really upset Silva. So Silva breaks out of prison in one of the most ludicrous scenes imaginable and this is where it all starts to go pear shaped.Silva reverse hacks MI6 and he wanted to get captured. Ultimately he breaks out with armed guards surrounding him with no explanation how that happened. Then he goes through the tunnels of London...to arrive at a tube station with some handguns and eventually crash a parliamentary meeting and shoot M in the face. But wait  he clearly had a bomb  he blew up a tube line. OK he wanted her death to be up close and personal. Why not back at MI6? He clearly didn't need to be captured by MI6 to get to the station and he'd proved earlier that he could hack their most secure networks and gain access. Why not walk right through the front door and put a bullet in her face? But then Bond saves the day and they go off to the Scottish highlands a nod to Connery being a Scot to hidelay a trap. Except  MI6 knows where he's going. Why isn't there an army waiting for Silva when he gets there? Oh but wait the motivation changes continue! During the house fight scene Silva's henchmen and there's NO explanation as to where these guys come from shoot at M even hitting her. So she's either not supposed to be taken alive or Silva's men are idiots. But it gets better! Silva then shows up IN A HELICOPTER. Why? To blow up the house with a 20mm cannon! So when Silva had ample opportunity to use a bomb he didn't  he wanted her to know it was him who killed her. Now he's spraying a house with cannon fire with no idea who or what he's shooting at. So now his motivation is he wants her dead at all costs. In that case why not bring a few RPGs? or a missile? After all they did just commandeer a MILITARY HELICOPTER! Of course Bond survives the house being turned into swiss cheese blows it up with two sticks of dynamite and compressed propane and then runs off into the wilderness to save M  but before he does he gets into one last night and plunges into FROZEN WATER has a fight underwater for what seemed like a few minutes then somehow gets out of the water shrugs off hypothermia with again NO EXPLANATION to find Silva confronting M.By now Silva wants M to help him commit suicide. WHAT? Since when did he have a death wish? Why? Cause he tried to kill himself when he was being tortured and it failed? What's his motivation? Didn't he just try to turn her into Ragu with a 20mm cannon not 10 minutes earlier? Now he wants to die by her hands? And we're supposed to believe this? No. Sorry but I can only have my intelligence insulted so often. Bond surviving death multiple times with no explanation is insulting. Having Silva's motivation change THREE TIMES is insulting. Having MI6 look like the Keystone Cops is insulting. Foreshadowing EVERY SINGLE TWISTELEMENT is insulting. Please if you don't want your intelligence insulted DO NOT see this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is right up there with Mortal Kombat 2 and 2012 as the worst movies I've sat through in the theater. Nothing made sense and they insulted your intelligence time and time and time again.Spoilers Ahead.The first hour was actually pretty interesting  albeit bizarre. That Bond survived the fall without any explanation was odd but hey I can live with one miracle resurrection  it's a Bond movie. The sequence in Shanghai was also pretty well done and the silhouette fight was great cinematography  but again  Bond lets the bad guy shoot his target? But who's the target? And if he wanted to trail him to know who he was working for  why would he kill him? But OK he finds a clue and goes to Macau where he redeems a chip that obviously isn't for him. So instead of being interrogated by the Casino staffthugs  a woman comes up to him and more or less gives up her boss with her handlers a few feet away. What? OK so then there's an obligatory fight in a kimodo dragon pit which is short but fun and then off to Japan's battleship island to meet...possibly the most inconsistently motivated villain of all time.Silva's entrance is menacing the story about the rats in the barrel is sinister and he's flamboyant enough to say 'this guy creeps me out'.

	schema:reviewBody "This contains spoilers.I have never before wrote a comment on IMDb.com. But after seeing the high rating of this complete insult of a classic character called James Bond i had to say something. Let me start by saying this movie have taken plots from like 10 different movies. Involving Bourne Batman Die Hard Swordfish Charlie's Angels Mission Impossible and more. Stolen agents list villains getting caught intentionally and a bunch of other stuff you seen in so many movies. Its Bond in a midlife crisis with everyone doubting him.The Bond chick dies rather quick and seems terrified of the bad guy in this movie. Why? who knows. Never really no explanation there is no explanation to the bad guy Silva at all. He is just a bad ass former agent from M's days in Hong Kong who she sold out and is know out to get M. He has these super hacking skills which are not explained neither. He is just hacking the hell out of MI6. And of course a very obvious Moneypenny made an entrance and she is black not that its a problem it's just that it screams affirmative action I'm half black by the way. Then you have a washed up Bond?? When was Bond ever washed up ever? Crying over M who gave the clearance to take a shot with Bonds life at stake she didn't seem to care very much. You have a young Q coming in and say we don't use gadgets no more. The gadgets are a part of James Bond it spiced the movies. The movie all trough was a disaster it was bad from beginning to end. This was even worse then Quantum Solace. You know i wouldn't have mind the bad plot if i had gotten some comic release or some proper James Bond moments. There were none. Where are the sarcastic comments the witty comebacks to women at cocktail parties?? James Bond is truly dead after this. i remember the golden ages of Connery and Moore. One scene when Bond was caught by a women i recall and she went i got you now mister Bond Connery responded well enjoy yourself. Comments like that made me love Bond. There was never no super effects or nasty close combats. He was a spy with a gun who dressed act and looked as a gentleman. Not like this brute who runs around beating people like a Van Damme movie is very emotional and don't seem to be very good with the women at all. Which makes me think why does he get these women?? And oh lets not forget running around half the movie with his shirt off. Don't know how many looking in the mirror without a shirt on scenes this movie had.Anyways i hope they stop making Bond or first get a new Bond and a better plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film can be approached from two angles as a comedy and as an important contemporary cultural text. As a comedy it succeeded beyond expectations. Part of the pleasure surely came from the spectacle of the event a sold out screening with cast and crew present along with regional cultural references that resonated infectiously with many in the audience but this can take nothing away from the many levels of comedy at work within this film. There were elements of overacted screwball comedy there were underplayed facial expressions and reactions that added a wealth of character and personality to the comedy further still there were elaborately constructed situational set pieces. All these elements along with explosively dynamic dialogue that was well delivered combined to send the audience into tears of laughter.In a separate issue to the comedy there was the cultural commentary which is always going to draw attention when it is such a taboo subject as Jihad a word that is often avoided at all costs. The film unapologetically offers a plethora of questions around motivation meaning and justification which it never falls into the trap of giving patronizing melodramatic answers to nor does it preach any solutions.The many characters were all utilised to give different points of views and different perspectives the main protagonist Omar Riz Ahmed was fully fleshed out with the other characters used to offer differing ideas and obviously the above mentioned comic relief. Omar's brother for instance had such a minor part but raises questions around what he considers a true following of Islam which he promotes as peaceful but is then exposed as intrinsically sexist due to the way he practically locks his wife in a cupboard. That being said Islam itself was to a large extent sidelined and the film much more overtly dealt with identification and senses of belonging for a demographic that has partial but not complete grips on the many angles of where its identity is created this includes Barry Nigel Lindsay the Caucasian convert amongst the group.Four Lions is easily funny enough to reach a very wide audience where viewers will be left without answers and therefore forced to discuss these issues which are too often brushed under the proverbial rug.twitter  destroyapathy".

This satirical black comedy vents its disgust at the pseudomorality of suicide bombing whilst managing to portray its terrorists with an affection that allows the audience an unexpected emotional attachment with these supposed figures of violence.The film follows a terrorist cell of blundering inept and impossibly stupid wouldbe suicide bombers on their quest towards martyrdom  we follow them failing miserably in a Pakistan training camp trying to run through sheep fields whilst carrying bags of explosives attaching bombs to crows all the time creating a chaotic 'blooper' reel of attempted martyrdom videos. These suicide bombers are not the feared assassins of popular imagination but absurd and easily led dupes who encourage laughter and ridicule  and significantly in the end pity.The comedy of 'Four Lions' lies in the power of its bathos the film reduces the dreaded spectre of suicide bombing to a ludicrous pageant of ineptitude. It's a film with fast laughs and dim wit in abundance an absurd 'How NotTo Guide' to martyrdom.However the audience cannot help but feel pity for the characters as their plot reaches its climax. There is a sad inevitability to the group's last moments together despite the horror of what the bombers are planning the audience has been lulled into sympathising with their situation. The sadness of the film comes with the audience's realisation that these characters are regular likable funny naive people  they are not monsters in themselves but made monstrous by their susceptibility to absurd immoral teachings.The lead character Omar's interactions with his wife and young son are painful in their twisted depiction of the ideal family unit. At one point Omar played by Riz Ahmed tells his son a bedtime story about 'Simba's Jihad'. It is a scene that is touching funny and uncomfortable all at once a reflection of our responses to the film as a whole.'Four Lions' is provocative in its comic parody of an emotional subject but there is never any sense that it wishes to be deliberately inflammatory.

Not the most jovial of subjects I hear you cry but how wrong could you be? For here we have not only a truly funny film but also a poignant one and one of the best British films of the last decade. Meticulous to detail Morris spent over five years researching the films central themes of terrorism and religion and a lifetime of studying human behaviour and it's only with this foundation that he along with co writers Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong Peep Show could have made such a brilliant film. You will laugh and hard then you will realise what it is you are laughing at take a breath and then laugh some more. In the same way that the recent American remake of Battlestar Galactica dealt in allegories of the war on terror politics and human nature but just happened to be set in space 'Four Lions' just happens to be set in a terrorist cell and in his own admission Morris admitted that he wanted to explore group dynamics that could be found either in a football team a club of sorts or the guys in this movie. It is so cleverly done that at no point is the film patronising or preachy it just makes you think about the absurd nature of how people think and what lengths they will go to for something they believe in. The film also contains some scenes of the gang spending normal time with their families even discussing their plans with the children and it's in these scenes that we given over to the idea that they are ordinary people about to do something extraordinary. The cast play their roles not only with great comic timing but with an understanding of the subject matter that reflects in their performances. The script is so sharp that not only will you miss stuff on first viewing you will be quoting it for months to come. It is well shot and perfectly paced but let's not forget that this is satire of the highest order and in that there will be elements that might not appeal to all. But if you think you can stomach it then let me assure you that you will see one of the funniest films from one of Britain's most underrated and genuinely talented comedians. Rubber dingy rapids.".

Rather than portray them as dark shadowy men they are really just everyday bumblers and naive men. The frightening aspect is that despite the humour they are aiming to mass murder which always is behind the scenes.The film uses humour to demystify the selfstyled jihadists and take away any sort of menacing notoriety and show them as the frightening bunglers that they are. The fear is when one group actually manages to carry out what they set out to do.This film is worth watching. You will be rolling with laughter but you will end the film with many thoughts on the questions raised also. It's simply another great bit of political satire and I recommend it highly.".

	schema:headline " Chris Morris strikes again";
	schema:reviewBody "Chris Morris has had his fair share of approaching controversial subjects such as the brilliant Brass Eye. I so wanted this to be an hilarious film as it was a long time since I had really good laugh in the cinema. Here is another social commentary this time on terrorism and I was optimistic that this was going to be the laugh I was looking for even if the subject is controversial. The actual terrorists though are inept and have no real grasp of what they are trying to do.We follow them making plans and deciding that they want to strike the London Marathon. The question being asked all the time is can a film about suicide bombers ever be funny? Well the answer to that question in my view is yes because it is more about characters being so bad at something and presenting themselves in a bizarre sense. They are delivered in such an amusing manner that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the sheer lunacy. In comedy itself being generally stupid and incompetent is something that in my view is extremely difficult to get right and can easily escalate to farce. In Four Lions though the acting is good enough and set up well enough that it doesn't feel like they are just dumping situations on screen and putting in random moments designed to gain comedic measure. One scene in particular when the group are forced to carry their bombing equipment on foot after their car breaks down. It has to be seen as it is just brilliant. In this the scenes are set up and the comedy is delivered very well. The humour can get quite dark and sick at times but not so much that it isn't funny nonetheless. I can understand why some people would shun this film and the humour is definitely not by all means universal but I would recommend it as it is a funny satire that you may enjoy. It is quite understandable if you don't though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Home grown Asian suicide bombers are not an obvious choice for Comedy. But Director Chris Morris makes a surprisingly good job of it in a work which is skilfully written and performed. The best humour has a ring of truth about it. And so it is true here. The plot moves from satire to slapstick to straight forwards storytelling and back at quite a pace leaving the audience to make its own mind up about whether certain bits are intended to be funny or just turn out that way. That ambiguity is probably the film's strongest suit.A strong cast of Jihadists struggle to get a team together struggle to get to a Training Camp in Pakistan from which they are sent home in disgrace indeed they struggle to complete any task successfully. Yet they are not portrayed as buffoons. Never before has Muslim culture been lampooned like this yet Morris shows it in such a way that they are Everyman jokes and should not cause offence to anyone.The fact that this is low budget works to its advantage. The script and acting win and the documentary style filming gives it an authenticity which is vital for the humour to prosper. Riz Ahmed stars as Chief Jihadist Omar but Nigel Lindsay steals the show as a Caucasian Muslim convert. Preeya Kalidas has a frustrating underwritten role as Omar's wife. A nurse and a mother we never really get her insight into the prospect of her husband and father of her son embracing martyrdom even though she pokes fun at an over zealous cleric when he visits their home.At 100 minutes the film ends when it needs to in dramatic and compelling style and does not out stay its welcome. For some this will not be funny enough for others it will simply be in poor taste. But we should be proud that this sort of comedy simply could not be made in America and is the first cinematic attempt to deal with a relatively new and disturbing social phenomena.".

	schema:reviewBody "4 Lions is an excellent well thought out film with a great pace very funny and very thoughtful.After watching the film I wondered at some of the choices Morris had made concerning the depth of the characters in the film and their motivation. On reflection I could see the extremely clever and thoughtful way that he had written the script. This film is a fantastic means of attacking the media's paniced frenzy regarding Muslim extremist's bomb attacks.I went to this film with no more knowledge then 'it's a black comedy about Muslim extremist bombers in Britain written and directed by Chris Morris'. Although I have followed Chris Morris' work throughout his television career. I didn't know what to expect at all  whether it would work or not. Some friends who said they had seen the trailer for it at the cinema said it didn't look that good. It proved to be very good.It entertains very well and holds your attention. But the depth of the film is that after it you have plenty of thoughts on the subject matter and they all encourage an open minded reexploring of thoughts on the Muslim communities in Britain and the media's frenzy around terrorism and Muslim communities in Britain.There are specific parts of the film which are so clever in how they raise questions that I'd love to talk about them but I'd spoil the film. I think that it's best to go see the film and enjoy it as great entertainment. On the way out of the cinema all the issues involved will be real food for thought.One of the thoughts I had after leaving was that Chris Morris had perhaps written this with the first audience in his mind as British Muslims and not in any patronising or preaching way but further thought made me believe the film was for all English people specifically. Undoubtedly this film can work internationally and is well worth watching if you are from some other country. But it was great that Morris had made no concessions to this so he could tell the story the way he wanted to.Other nationalities watching the film may well have trouble with some of the dialogue but you'll be OK. Watch this film it's undoubtedly the most important film to come out of the UK for a very long time and what's more it's bloody good entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Four Lions";
	schema:reviewBody "Four Lions may be a black comedy but the subject matter is anything but dealing with the real threat of self radicalized men who take it upon themselves to wage what they deem is a holy war against the infidels of their religion capitalism and Western ideals about the men who are frighteningly misguided in their beliefs which we may find absurd but they holding it very dearly to their hearts nevermind if it's actually the blind leading the blind.Cowritten and directed by Christopher Morris the film follows the journey of a few friends and acquaintances brought together by Barry Nigel Lindsay a selfstyled firebrand convert and Omar Riz Ahmed the unofficial leader who assemble like minded radicals to take on what they felt is a path of righteousness and a fast track to heaven nevermind if for narrative purposes his recruitment tactics is questionably risky at best not to mention funny I did say it was a comedy. It's almost like a satire on the 101 basics on how one transforms from all talk to all action going on trips to Pakistan to meet up with mujahedins or holy warriors in order to learn the ropes in becoming soldiers and tested in battle to the assembling of explosives deciding on a target and then executing it complete with the quintessential video recordings to explain the rationale behind the deeds.It parodies many of what you've seen and read in the news and while you may dismiss it as making light of dead serious situations here's where its brilliance emerged. From within the comedy that come fast and furious that you find yourself inevitably laughing at the clueless wannabes there are moments of poignancy especially when you realize that the wannabes have gone way past the point of no return and with the wheels of destruction set in motion there's no turning back really. In a way it reflects upon how detection of the clandestine activities may sometimes be stranger than fiction but it is usually missed opportunities especially with the countless of screw ups that go undetected that serve as the real threat to society with prejudices and discrimination at play.Ultimately those who truly suffer are friends and especially family and the story does not mince that impact even though most are centered around the closing credits in an epilogue. Family isn't far behind especially when time got devoted to focus on the ringleader's that here's a man willing to sacrifice what's worldly for a calling so perceived higher than self and for the greater good. Not only those on the other side of the law get put in a spotlight but how the authorities and politicians behave got their fair share of critique though in a fashion of less being more.Four Lions adopted the shaky cam throughout which in a way tried to mirror a documentary and to some this may be tiring to watch since the camera bounces around and doesn't stay still for the most parts. This is perhaps the only aspect of the film that I disliked though you'll soon find yourself tickled if you pay close attention to the dialogue which were thoroughly filled with wickedly funny lines. The trailer may have accidentally revealed the funnier slapstick aspects of the film but its wit was firmly found in the spoken words. Riz Ahmed is as charismatic a ringleader as he can be and Kayvan Novak plays Waj his less than intelligent friend and blind follower with a sense of sensitivity that will tug at your heart when Omar realizes what he had done and you'll definitely feel something for the Waj character when you ponder over how many real world counterparts who exist in the real world being all too trusting with their leaders in being lambs laid out for slaughter conned with an ideal of a promise. Adeel Akhtar's Faisal the bomb maker will nearly always make you laugh at his naivety and sheer stupidity being one of the characters that draw the most laughs besides Waj.It's easy to lapse into stereotypes and branding a message of hate but Four Lions is nothing of that sort. What it does is to make one sit up and take notice of the troubles that are plaguing our modern day society where there are those who do not feel inclusive and decide to take it upon themselves to address their grievances through the use of violence. It's seriousness hidden under the guise of comedy and I dare say you'll get more out of this film than from whatever else that's screening this week. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Four Lions may be a black comedy but the subject matter is anything but dealing with the real threat of self radicalized men who take it upon themselves to wage what they deem is a holy war against the infidels of their religion capitalism and Western ideals about the men who are frighteningly misguided in their beliefs which we may find absurd but they holding it very dearly to their hearts nevermind if it's actually the blind leading the blind.Cowritten and directed by Christopher Morris the film follows the journey of a few friends and acquaintances brought together by Barry Nigel Lindsay a selfstyled firebrand convert and Omar Riz Ahmed the unofficial leader who assemble like minded radicals to take on what they felt is a path of righteousness and a fast track to heaven nevermind if for narrative purposes his recruitment tactics is questionably risky at best not to mention funny I did say it was a comedy. It's almost like a satire on the 101 basics on how one transforms from all talk to all action going on trips to Pakistan to meet up with mujahedins or holy warriors in order to learn the ropes in becoming soldiers and tested in battle to the assembling of explosives deciding on a target and then executing it complete with the quintessential video recordings to explain the rationale behind the deeds.It parodies many of what you've seen and read in the news and while you may dismiss it as making light of dead serious situations here's where its brilliance emerged.

This fast paced comedy  drama is quite controversial in that it mixes the serious subject matter of a sleeper cell of suicide bomber terrorists with dialogue that sounds like it has come straight out of any episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is hilarious and silly but somehow it never once escapes reality like Spinal Tap does so that we actually believe such bungling misguided people like this might actually exist. It also portrays the jihadist as a human being with flaws which is something some people simply might not want to contemplate given the stereotypes that exist in the Fox News world. Each wacky scenario that is portrayed could actually happen making this satire highly engaging in a Slapshot fashion and allowing us to feel for the characters. The violent ending leaves us wondering exactly what we were laughing at and why were we laughing at it. Four Lions is one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen.".

Barry's master plan is to inflict jihad on a mosque to that Muslims will rise up because they will think Jews did it.This film is uncomfortably close to home and never mocks Islam although it does mock the way some people interpret Islam for their own ends. But it also mocks the police and the establishment. And with the exception of Omar who has a clear vision of what he wants to accomplish and why one may not agree with him but he is sincere and devout about his intentions all the others are deluded to a lesser or usually greater degree.What happens in this film isn't funny in the slightest but often the way it happens is very funny indeed.

Right from the hilarious first scene goofing on the wouldbe terrorists trying to make a jihad video you know you're watching a movie unlike any you've seen before. I guess it would be considered a dark comedy because you have lots of comedy but at the same time the terrorists are still committed to becoming martyrs and taking out the unbelievers. The movie if filled with hilarious scenes as the group travels to martyrdom  from making jihad videos arguing over bombing targets buying bomb ingredients without arousing suspicion attending a terrorist training camp etc... I kept wondering how they were going to keep the comedy going as the group finally set it's deadly serious plan into action but the film manages to not miss a beat. In fact some of the funniest scenes are during the group's attempt at terrorism at the end.The thick British accents and lingo made the movie funnier however this was also a problem at times causing me to miss jokes because I just couldn't understand the dialog lots of fast talking mumbling whispering etc.... If ever a movie needed closed captioning this is it. That's my only criticism.".

However this film is so funny it actually decreases the sometimes unfounded fear whipped up by the tabloid press that is instilled in the population. The acting is first rate.

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a perfect movie but it's a damn funny one  and it turns out an important one. In the US since 2001 our ethos is that Muslims hate freedom and hate America because of our freedom and that drives their hatred of us. Four Lions presents an alternative view  the bunch of guys view...You have a bunch of guys who want to be great who want to stand for something and they need only the thinnest of common purpose and outlet for doing it i.e. becoming 'martyrs to the cause'. And they don't have to be geniuses... by a long shot. In fact usually they're not.Omar works as a security guard and suffers sleepinducing monologues by his colleague through their shift. His wife is a nurse and they have a young son. I wish the film went further to explain why his wife is okay with the fact that he wants to kill people  and himself thus widowing her and leaving his beloved son behind. His brother is a strict Muslim who is ironically too conservative for Omar and his wife's taste. Thus falls the first assumption that terrorists must be fundamentalist Muslims. Omar and his 'simple' cousin are thrilled to be called to Pakistan for training  but once there are completely out of their element and in over their heads. Back home the group of misfit wouldbe terrorists clash over their purpose and disagree about the prerequisites for martyrdom... Thus falls a second assumption that terrorists are united in a single purpose and belief. The director explained that in his research time and time again he found laughinducing real examples of stupid or ignorant terrorists like the Koranquoting terrorist who got his quotes so wrong the interviewer corrected him or the guy filled with suppository explosives who got within handshake distance of a Saudi prince before detonating himself  and shooting 50 feet through the roof of the tent in which they were standing killing only himself. Four Lions echos this reality and breaks down the myth of the highlyskilled zealous fundamentalist who hates freedom.Instead we have groups of marginalized young men seeking a purpose and a voice who think they will find a greatness in martyring themselves they'd be unable to achieve in 'regular life' mislead  sometimes intentionally  by a skewed comprehension of their holy book. Four Lions will keep you laughing even if you find it hard to believe that you're watching a case of art imitating life. NOTE the accents are very thick in this one so those who have difficulty with Guy Ritchie movies or similar may wish to buy this off iTunes and watch with subtitles instead.".

Just to make things worse they are saddled with Barry a loud mouthed British man who has converted to jihadism.

Highlights include a crow suicide bomber and a very unlucky sheep.At the same time the film manages to humanize its characters particularly the lead conspirator Omar. Riz Ahmed gives a genuinely moving performance showing us the family man as well as the terrorist. Indeed at times the film strains credibility by depicting his equal relationship with his wife Sofia which one would not expect to find with a militant jihadist.Contrary to the accusations of some conservative critics that the film paints a glamorous picture of terrorism the ending emphasizes the waste of terrorism and the stupidity of the jihadis themselves.

It would've been very easy to fall into stereotypetraps and to get preachy..but this film manages to avoid that and with aplomb.For sheer blackness slapstickicity and hilarity this compares favourably with Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0085743..catch it if you can.Definitely in my personal alltime top 10 comic films..and even breaks into the alltime top 10.

	schema:reviewBody "I have wanted to see this one for some time the DVD has been lurking in the 'To Watch' pile too long and it's time has come today. I was intrigued by this one partly because I live in the north of England not too far from where it is set and I live in a town that has quite a large Muslim population. For the record I subscribe to no religion myself but can I understand how many people are drawn to them. It's a very remarkable film with an interesting mix of comedy and drama set in the Muslim community city of Sheffield. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary summary haters and those that don't wish to know about the plot please move the explosives to the safe house while I write the next paragraph.A bunch of radical Muslims are preparing to martyr themselves for their faith. They are Omar Barry Waj and Faisal. The only problem is they are quite stupid and don't seem to be able to get it together. To this end Omar and Waj go off to a training camp in Pakistan leaving Barry and Faisal to hold the fort back home. While they are away Barry who is very vocal about 'the cause' recruits another member of the team Hassan. On their return Omar and Waj tell the others they have the goahead. They make some explosives which prove quite effective in blowing up crows as Faisal finds out. After one of their number is killed in an accident and much debate they decide on a target . They now have to put their words into action but will things go according to plan? I'll leave my summary here don't want to give it all away.Although it was made on a small budget I thought this was a very well made film with an excellent script and some really good performances. Riz Ahmed was excellent as Omar as was Nigel Lindsay as Barry. I also thought Kayvan Novak played the part of the naive Waj very well and Adeel Akhtar as Faisal and Arsher Ali as Hassan were also very good. Also a mention for Preeya Kalidas as Sofia Omar's wife.There are many funny moments in this film and much of that is down to an excellent script by Christopher Morris Simon Blackwell Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong and the performances from the entire cast. I also found the film very touching there were moments of real tenderness between Omar and his wife and great friendship amongst the group. Over all it's a very funny film that deals with quite a tricky subject in a very interesting way. It makes the terrorists look like idiots while at the same time showing that they are only human. Would I watch it again? Yes! Recommended.My Score 7.810".

The issue explored through the characters of the eponymous Four Lions is of identity. They feel alien in the UK. They are treated as alien in Pakistan. One of the cell a white English convert seem only to have converted because of the lure of fanaticism it gives shape to his inchoate rage about the world around him. One member is weak and lead by the others. One is stupid and isn't sure what he's doing... SPOLIER... his last words admitting as much. One is simply a braggart out of his depth. The leader of the cell perversely supported in his suicidal ambition by his young son and nurse wife  in one grim scene the family gathers around him lovingly encouraging him in his demise  is also weak. And foolish. And angry. And like the others there is the feeling that if there were another way to resolve his frustrations he'd take it. Chris Morris based these characters on witnesses brought to trial on terrorism charges. The slapstick and buffoonery that we see on the screen is based on reallife idiocy. But if the cinema remains quieter than it should in a comedy it is only because these men are going to kill themselves and others. And that's no laughing matter. Morris made his name with outrageous provocation  and this is no exception  but where his past efforts were short TV bursts of biting satire this featurelength film gives him the room to create a picture of lost young men unsure of who they are and what they want caught in an inexorable tide with no option to escape. Their weakness stupidity anger pride and desperation forbids it. The first film of its kind to emerge from the UK it has refused to lampoon Islam or point the finger of blame at religion. Rather it shows us that our society has created people for whom obliteration is better than life. Catch it while you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a fan of the V for Vendetta graphic novel and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for  gripping chilling intense exciting heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words elements are slightly different subplots removed. But the idea  as V himself would be so proud to say  remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving must save a young woman Natalie Portman during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character.

Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis McTiegue doesn't show off and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slowmotion overtakes a late action sequence it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle the film is dedicated to his memory does an outstanding job Oscarnominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece and the visual effects are astonishing terrifying and deeply moving especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting great action and fantastic technical wizardry it sounds just like another Matrixstyle ripoff. But the biggest difference in V is that it is a story of real ideas  not a fantastic science fiction creation but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here  the fear of war of disease of famine. Fear is a basic human nature and has been exploited as a weapon  a method of control  for centuries. And for those who would use it a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. V for Vendetta is a mustsee.1010".

The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for  gripping chilling intense exciting heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words elements are slightly different subplots removed. But the idea  as V himself would be so proud to say  remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have.

Though it became a little weighty in the middle one part seemed to drag a little other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character V creating a poetic intelligent and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie.

Loosely based on the DC Comic the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNPlike government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was topnotch and along with the wellwritten script and apt soundtrack gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel for better or worse for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However above all it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression he exudes the pragmatism charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revengedriven madness.Entertainmentwise the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.".

	schema:headline " a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time";
	schema:reviewBody "V for Vendetta rating 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the nearfuture paired with an operatic comic book tale of love mystery and a GuyFawkesmasked rebellion. Our hero is V Hugo Weaving a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive a taste for the eloquent and a hand for knifewielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice or maybe hostage is Evey Natalie Portman a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler John Hurt whose persona is shown primarily through a fivestory tall projection of his everangry head. The exposition for this nearfuture lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middleeastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra England Prevails! Rest assured however this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps it's a world that's instead very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution with the evolution of Evey's politics the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. Remember remember the fifth of November. What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler the news media is heavily clouded our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of todaywhere the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of CommunismV for Vendetta's answer to that question is a surehanded yes.

	onyx:emotionText "V for Vendetta rating 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the nearfuture paired with an operatic comic book tale of love mystery and a GuyFawkesmasked rebellion. Our hero is V Hugo Weaving a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive a taste for the eloquent and a hand for knifewielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice or maybe hostage is Evey Natalie Portman a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler John Hurt whose persona is shown primarily through a fivestory tall projection of his everangry head. The exposition for this nearfuture lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middleeastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra England Prevails! Rest assured however this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps it's a world that's instead very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution with the evolution of Evey's politics the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. Remember remember the fifth of November. What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler the news media is heavily clouded our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of todaywhere the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of CommunismV for Vendetta's answer to that question is a surehanded yes. But V for Vendetta is no heavyhanded political allegory. At its heart V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty baldheaded scene of lust realize first that there also is a mastergrasshopper dynamic between Evey and V.

As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background she also discovers the truth about herselfand emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the MatrixJames McTeigue movies really has some talent and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an antihero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wronghe is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughoutnever once boringan apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points it has a strong script  impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movieI must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptationleaving a lot of details behindwhereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approachto which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 911 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and governmentregarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insanebut it's just an ideaa notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control usand inflict fear into our lives. Hidden behind the creepy mask Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excelswith a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an ideaa symbola metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an ideaan icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure  exciting action superb directing and writing and a SciFi film with a thoughtful messageand the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Actionthriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climaxespeciallywas uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off then this is a blast for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release because I was far under the age demographic at that time but I managed to catch up to the film at around 20112012. Not sure the exact year but I was a teenager at the time and I loved the Matrix still do and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media and it helped me immensely in establishing my more leftleaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes in comparison to other action films of its ilk opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development surprised me the first time I watched it but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium both of which have massive third act spectacles the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films ironic since Equilibrium is about emotion. While short the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V the titular anarchist vigilante Evey the young woman who is kidnapped and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast and there's Detective Finch a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said however about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is at least for the time being the most personally meaningful movie and the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie V for Vendetta promotes a government in which the people decide what is best for the country and their livelihoods. Throughout the film it becomes clear that a close to perfect form of society is when the government is scared of its people not the other way around. In addition the concept that love can overcome evil is evident. The hero of this film is a woman named Evey Hammond whose goal is to help a man called V to take down the over oppressive and corrupt government. However just like any hero Evey has a flaw and that flaw is fear to take action since her parents were killed for rebelling against the government. Evey was captured and tortured by the government to reveal the identity of V but she never did. After a long period of time and being constantly tortured all her options seemed exhausted but she rids fear within herself and accepts her fate. She would rather die then let the government stop the revolution. Luckily it was actually V who captured and tortured her to see if she was truly loyal. The final showdown results in the death of V however with her new found strength Evey completes the final step in the revolution in which the parliament building is blown up. Evey conquered her fear and she now knows she has the power and the courage to change the world. With the parliament building destroyed the people are now taking back their freedom and will most likely form a government in which their voice matters. The movie includes a few main scenes that when looked at together are important in proving the message of the story any injustice only takes a single person willing to risk everything to spark a world altering revolution. To reveal the corruption of the government the viewers witness the police's attempt to rape Evey. The very people who are supposed to protect the citizens are the ones causing the most damage. In addition a scandal in which the government purposely infected children with a deadly virus that only they could cure is shown. This proves the corruption of the government and now all there needs to be is the rebellion. V's single man invasion in a TV building allows him to be known throughout the country and this simple act gains him followers more fighters. The releasing of the mask hat and cape that he wears to every citizen might just be the most influential scene because this act gives the citizens something they never had before a choice. Lastly the final scene where thousands of citizens gathered dressed in V attire and push their way through the police to witness the destruction of parliament. I agree with the theme portrayed in this film because it shows how humans though extremely different form one another are able to come together when the time calls for it. I believe that this is a hopeful movie that lets the viewers know that they have more power than they think a government cannot function without the support of its people. In all honesty I would not have portrayed the movie any differently. The film was extremely intense graphically violent and painfully realistic however this intensity was needed to get the point across that there a corrupt government needs to be stopped. The redemption that is portrayed in the film coincides with biblical truth in that they both end with the sacrifice of one to free the many from the evil. In the same way V risks his life so that the rest of the country may live in freedom Jesus died on the cross so that the entire world could be saved and washed from their sins. Although the biblical truth is a much larger scale the concept is the same. However the movie departs from biblical truth in what actions V does in order to achieve freedom for the people. V takes on a more hateful and violent approach in which he assassinates corrupt government people and bombs the parliament building. On the other hand Jesus takes on a more humbling approach in which he basically shows kindness and unconditional love to all. Although V for Vendetta condemns evil it also allows the viewers to think that the only way to destroy evil is with more evil and violence. The intense violence in the film contradicts V's ultimate goal which is to rid of the violent and corrupt government. V is fighting fire with fire but he is doing what he feels is right and what he sees as the only way to achieve freedom. This connects to the worldview of post modernism because the idea of breaking from the traditional rules or the rules of the past and doing what you believe in or what you feel is right is promoted. The film does not directly explore this worldview rather it reveals this concept through V and his actions. V wants to create a world in which people have the choice to choose what to believe in. In addition he does whatever actions he deems necessary to achieve his goal. Similarly post modernists believe that people should have the right to believe what they want and do whatever they want and that what they do is their choice. Given this mentality I think that the writers are trying to say that humans should never be forced to believe in something. What we choose to believe in is our choice and each person should respect one other regardless of their beliefs. If one thing is for sure people typically do not like to be told what to do because for some reason we like choice and how we live reflects our beliefs. This obviously does not reflect the teachings of the Bible. The Bible is pretty clear that in order to get to heaven if you even believe in one is in summary to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. V for Vendetta neither denounces nor promotes the Bible or Christianity. V does not care what you believe in he cares that you were able to choose you beliefs without any pressure. This is however similar to the Bible in that people have the free will to choose what they believeyou can believe in Jesus or not there is no outside pressure at least there is not supposed to be any. The Bible lays out its case to all who are willing to listen and people can accept or deny its teachings V is fighting for exactly this the ability to choose. Christianity is not portrayed in this movie because this is not a movie about religion but it does indirectly comment on religion. It reveals the dangers of religions and how they can turn into corrupt political systems that take away a persons choice. Every religion is guilty of trying to pressure others into their belief or there will be consequences. The film calls out any guilty of this sort of pressure and it basically comments this people need to make their own decisions and if there is disagreement oh well it was their choice not yours.Overall V for Vendetta is not the most child friendly movie. It is extremely violent in more ways than one and the negative elements greatly out weight the positive. Some negative elements included an attempted rape multiple murdered lots of gun violence torture and encourages dangerous behavior. This movie definitely teaches that it is acceptable to do an measures necessary to fight for a cause even if people's well beings are at stake. On a more positive note the final message of the movie is inspiring. It teaches that it is ok to be different and that people should have the free will to decided who they want to be it inspires individuality. Even with a beautiful message at the very end this film should not be recommended to everyone because of the negative elements states earlier in this paragraph. In this day in age I think it would be acceptable that the minimum age to introduce this movie would be 13. At this age children are beginning to be introduced to the real world and they are just starting to figure out who they are. I think that this movie is a good introduction into teaching kids that it is okay to believe differently than others but most importantly that people should not be judged for believing in something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "Or V for Versatility? Indeed when it doesn't warn about the risk of totalitarianism pending over democracies through the Orwellian depiction of a Britain ruled by a Big Brotherlike figure yelling orders on a giant wallsize screen and played by John HurtV is a captivating catandmouse chase between the rebels and the armed hands of the Law characterized by two opposites Stephen Rea as the good cop Finch and Tim PiggotSmith as Creedy the overzealous fascist with an ugly mug.Of course the main attraction of the film is the titular V that justice warrior hiding behind the nowiconic Guy Fawkes' mask and signing like a modernday Zorro all his deeds with the mark V. As easy with words as he is with knives V is a really fascinating creation we owe to the genius of comicbook artist Alan Moore. He makes his entrance when a young woman coincidentally named Evey Natalie Portman breaks the curfew and is assaulted by two members of a local militia named 'Fingermen'. V doesn't believe in coincidences and sees in Evey the light of hope to shine on the future generations. Together they meet on the 5th of November and as a homage to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 when Catholics attempted to destroy the House of Parliament V orchestrates the destruction of the Old Prison.And with 1812 Tchaikovski Overture as an accompaniment orchestrates is the right word. The opening scene sums up what makes V for Vendetta a great entertainment it is both visually and intellectually captivating. It is the kind of experiences that urge you to go to Wikipedia so some extra knowledge can make the plot a little more understandable and sometimes plausible. For instance I live in France where recently the government revealed the existence of a big database containing 60 Millions of names which means the entire French population. This comes within the framework of the fight against terrorism but when you think deeper you realize that a government will always have a good reason. In V for Vendetta we discover the extents of the tyranny banning and killing homosexuals Muslims communist or atheists and it is revealed near the end that it started with a 'virus' plot.I don't see Illuminati everywhere I know that some conspiracy theories are absurd but they shouldn't be used as an alibi against those that make sense and can be proved. The merit of James McTeigue's film is not to denounce something that might happen but to tell us that it might happen. The film was made in 2005 after the September 11 attacks but the events prove them right I just love a part where Finch disillusioned know that things will go out of control starting with an incident that will give an excuse for the government to bring the army. That's how the Arab Springs begun and today it changed the map of the world for better and for worse the worse is that it planted the seed of terrorism and Islamophobia in European countries. If there ever is a Third World War it would be ignited by these two elements.I just read a complaint from a IMDb user about the positive way the Quran was depicted and I was wondering if that comment didn't prove that hatred was already marching in. It's very interesting that a character played in the film was killed because he had a Quran if you look at the perception of Islam today due to events that are certainly not caused by the vast majority but a fanatic minority manipulated by foreign groups and God knows who you'll see that we're not far from this reality. Ironically for all its positive portrayal of Muslims as victims or campcandidates a similitude shared with the other visionary Scifi movie Children of Men religion is painted in a negative light starting with the Bishop portrayed as a filthy pedophile.The standing the films seems to take is that the first victims will be minorities and the film even includes a poignant lesbian romance in the story. But who knows maybe the real dictatorship will come from hyper capitalism that would ban every form of spirituality. The fluidity of the plot sometimes derails in order to make a political statement and I wish the film took more time to be a political satire than a Manichean thriller. It is also ambiguous in the way it denounces a form of totalitarian violence while portraying violence as the means to an end. The most glorious moment of the film was the magnificent street marching with all London inhabitants wearing the Fawkes' mask and when the soldiers had surrendered V had virtually won.So did we need to see Big Ben destroyed? The people had seized the power it was a revolution per se and by inspiring them the figure of V has achieved more than any other terrorist attack. But it felt like the director needed to end the film in a blaze of glory and close the loop. It was spectacular but a tad predictable while something less flashy could have been more meaningful. V for Vendetta is never boring but it needlessly overplays the effects although it had everything to blow your mind even the last speech by Natalie Portman gives you the perfect idea about the character he's an idea precisely.And this is indeed an idea that prevailed as the Guy Fawkes mask became the inspiration for the Anonymous group creating a case where fiction preceded reality and underlined its own prophetic aspect. The film isn't flawless but it is a must see in our difficult times and I'm glad I could finally review it 11 years after its release and 11 years before the time these events will happen now in 2016 on the 5th of November.".

	schema:reviewBody "V for Vendetta is still after all these years one of my favorite movies to watch and I find it as relevant today as it was whenever it was released in 2005. It is a story about a freedom fighter whose goal is to take down a totalitarian government that uses fear and deceit to control its people. To do this he knows that one man is not enough to accomplish such a monumental feat and that he will need to use something that cant be silenced hurt or killed. he sets out with the goal of planting the idea of revolution in the people because as he says in the movie Ideas are bulletproof. One of my favorite things about this movie is that the main character is wearing a solid mask. It is a fantastic display of acting both voices acting as well as physical. I guess you could say that I found myself not liking the character as much as I loved the idea of the character. The writers and director did an amazing job of drawing me into the storyline by mirroring enough of the world we live in today that I felt that the world I was watching on the screen could very easily enough being the world I live in one day. I saw myself in many of the characters and identified with their blind devotion to their country their developing distrust of their government and their inner conflict of trying to rationalize the two. Hugo Weaving plays the leading role of V and delivers and an unbelievable performance from behind a mask. Natalie Portman plays the role of V's sidekick love and accomplice. Stephen Rea plays the detective that is hellbent on finding out the truth even if that means he must accept that all his life he has been on the wrong side. Many other great actors help director James McTeigue bring The Wachowski Brothers V for Vendetta to life. It is definitely worth your time. Please watch and enjoy this movie".

Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals Muslims freedom fighters media folk cops politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this.".

However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up she does hold her ground V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary see what I did there. One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing".

	schema:reviewBody "Pirates Stagnetti's Revenge is the long awaited sequel to Digital Playground's previous big budget pirate porn epic Pirates made in 2005. As with all sequels DP has spared no expense to make this film more bigger sexier and action packed than the previous film. There are more CGI effects in the sequel than in Pirates with demons seamonsters monstrous creatures and even the return of the skeleton warriors of the first movie this time with their own pirate ship. There are much more longer sex scenes here than in the first film which could be considered a bit of a minus for a couples sex film such as this since some but not all of the sex scenes tend to drag on a bitespecially the orgy scene in the middle of the film putting the film almost to a halt unlike the first film that had it's sex scenes evenly put out together with the non sex scenes. But there are two sex scenes that really stand out in the sequel which are the scene between Jesse Jane  Belladonna and the scene between Jesse Jane Katsumi and Tommy Gunn. The best performances in the film are Evan Stone Belladonna Katsumi  Steven St. Croix while Jesse Jane Tommy Gunn Shay Jordan and Jenna Haze are much better in their sex scenes than acting their roles in the movie. Also the film is 15 minutes longer135 minutes than the previous film120 minutes which also could possibly be a detriment in enjoying this film. But as a sequel to Pirates I find it just as good but not superior to the first one and the ending of the film leaves the door open to another sequel to Pirates where our heroes may encounter again the villainous Captain Stagnetti. I recommend this great sex film for couples as well as for Jesse Jane Katsumi and Belladonna fans.".

And Jonathan oughta know these guys don't fk around. Jonathan and his buddy Manolo Jsu Garcia take a trip to Europe during semester vacation. For Jonathan he'd like to spend times soaking up the local culture with beautiful girls but he's just too quiet for all of that unlike Manolo who's so brazen that his pick up lines are thinly disguised stories about him being a spy and needing an escort to help distract those who are following him. So of course Manolo gets the girl.But Jonathan soon get's lucky too meeting an elegant but secretive Russian woman named Sasha Linda Florentino who gives him some story about being an exchange student and all of that. He even ditches his friend Manolo they were supposed to go to Spain to go with his girlfriend to Germany which is not an ideal vacation destination in 1985. But Jonathan smitten with his new girlfriend finds out there is more going on and soon enough his little games of pretending to be a spy are going to help him get out a real jam or else he's going to wind up dead. It is actually a really enjoyable movie seeing this quirky guy stuck in a real life game of cat and mouse.".

Just as ironic as the Gotcha game becoming a minor plot point is that the Cold War spy subplot became hopelessly outdated when the Wall came down but the awkward love story set in that nowbygone era will still be relevant as long as there are 18 yearolds like Edwards who look like Bambi but still yearn for love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gotcha is one of those movies most people forgot but one they easily remember when you mention the title. It's a typical product of the Eighties corny as subtle as concrete lots of spies and plenty of sex especially in the dialogues. Jonathan Moore goes to Europe for the summer holidays and meets an intriguing woman who is actually can you guess it? a spy! She seduces him not that difficult and gets him to accompany her to EastBerlin which is EasternEurope and that means... oh my God the Russians!. Not good there go back to WestBerlin and the Freedom. The first thing Jonathan Moore does when he's back on the Good Side is visit Burger King where he orders a large American burger with large American fries and of course a tasty American cola. Well actually the first thing he does is raise his middle finger to EastBerlin an act that makes an American soldier whisper I wanted to do that for the last six months. But how could this movie know that five years later down would go the Berlin Wall? When Gotcha was made we were all in the middle of Star Wars not the epic plan by George Lucas but the bigbudget movie by Ronald Reagan. Yes it's dumb but still entertaining apart from the dull first half hour.Oh what happens there then? Well after five minutes of paintball and a hand full of jokes on sex Jonathan and roommate Manolo arrive in Paris where the notsotalentedinFrench Jonathan asks a woman out for dinner. He says Voulezvous coucher avec moi? We laugh and cry well certainly the latter and we wait for the spy. After all that's the hypertalented Linda Fiorentino in one of her first roles. As if director Jeff Kanew he who gave us a Revenge of the Nerds movie knows of her talent all the parts of the movie with Linda are decent or even good. The rest indeed is forgettable.This largely has to do with the character Manolo a true Mexican stud. You get the feeling they needed him to make the movie longer bad move. Later in the movie Jonathan asks him if he's still a homeboy. Of course Manolo replies. In the next scene the spies are stopped by big fiery Mexicans with big fiery guns. Exit Manolo.Gotcha is a movie like a bubblegum tasty but after a while you need to spit it out. Only to be seen once every decade.".

He arrives home only to find the game is still going on and a canister of film is in his backpack. Then Sasha reappears.This is one of those strange films from the 80's that has a certain charm to it. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed myself thoroughly but I was never bored somewhat entertained. One thing I really admired about this movie was the originality. I haven't seen anything like this movie and that is a good thing. This movie doesn't really know what it wants to fully be. Sometimes it takes itself very seriously others it is more for comedic effort. It manages to combine adventure action drama and comedy It just struggled to balance them all properly. Despite all of that it managed to keep my attention for the most part by surprising me with decent twists and turns. If you're a fan of 80's songs like I am you're going to love the soundtrack for this movie. It features Nik Kershaw Frankie Goes to Hollywood and more. The acting is decent. Anthony Edwards is fine in the lead role albeit a trifle bland at times. He was a bit too cool and blas for my liking at times and didn't show enough angst. Linda Fiorentino is very sexy with a decent enough accent for her part. She played her role well and had OK chemistry with Edwards. Jsu Garcia is fun as Edward's best buddy. Nightmare on Elm Street fans should have fun watching him Final Thoughts You'd never see a movie made like this today. This is pure 80's my friends. As long as you don't expect too much you'll have an OK time. It's a decent movie5.810".

Gotcha! starts off like your typical simple minded teen comedy before slowly setting the situation up dangerous spy games and then having the novelty our hero being a pro with a paint gun ending in an ironically smart manner. Director Jeff Kanew who was behind Revenge of the Nerds does a workable job blending its romantic shades which familiarly plays out its message with the lethal action in some amusingly funny exchanges like those scenes involving the worried parents You had to let him go to Europe! and thrilling ontherun scenarios. The script is sharply penned with its dialogues. A likable Edwards is perfectly cast in lead role as the nave hero who actually becomes a target for real and Linda Fiorentino is ravishingly mysterious as the lady who he falls for. Gotta love the title song too it has a catchy hook and also showing up in the cast is Alex Rocco. It's just a game.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Ben Burtt is not creating sound effects or editing films at Skywalker Ranch he makes Imax documentary's. After exploring the  known universe in Destiny in Space and Blue Planet Burtt decided the history of movie special effects was to be his next subject. Because of his Lucasfilm connection he asked uncle George if he could play around with some of the original Star Wars models. Since Lucas was dusting them off to update his famous trilogy to their 'Special Editions' anyway the Imax format proved to be a golden opportunity to include a sneak preview.Besides a whirlwind history of movie magic with some dazzling namethatmovie montages the best bits are a couple of original recreations of classic scenes to fit the Imax screen. Special Effects opens with the end of the 1933 King Kong once again filmed in stop motion. The shot of the big ape plummeting down old Empire State with the camera following him viewed on the over sized Imax screen is not easily forgotten. Reproductions of scenes from the original Star Wars are only slightly less impressive by comparison. The famous opening shot with the Star Destroyer and the Millennium Falcon jumping to lightspeed are recreated in the 70 millimeter15perforation format unique to Imax productions and therefore much  better looking than anything in the blown up pan and scan Imax 'Attack of the Clones'The biggest draw was obviously the first look at the Star Wars Special Edition'. We got to see Rick McCallum dress up as a Sandtrooper to shoot some new shots outside Yuma Arizona which were then sacrilegiously spliced into a scene completed 20 years earlier. This is followed by more Lucasfilm employees walking along a big blue screen on their own back lot to be placed into a new buckets and paint cans' model of Mos Eisley this time foolishly using ordinary Stormtrooper outfits instead of Sandtroopers. Finally we are treated to the complete collage of the model the extras and several 'Ronto' creatures reused from 'Jurassic Park'. This shot is proudly repeated about six times in a row in order to take in all the various special additions. In hindsight the digital composers may have been a bit too pleased with themselves in the finished film they crammed a record 7 Ronto's into a 1 min 30 second series of establishing shots. The rest of the film was padded out with featurettes on some other effects heavy classics being worked on at ILM around that time. There are chapters about 'Independence day' released at the same time as this documentary but on a slightly larger scale and 'Jumanji' which had already come and gone. Both had been the subject of several making offs of their own but it was still a thrill to see those enormous explosions and CGI animals at an even larger size. The best thing to say about the behind the scenes look at Paul Michael Glaser's epic 'Kazaam' is that it was good to see Starsky still working.Yes in many ways Special Effects is one of the last tributes to George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. From its inception in 1974 up until 'The Phantom Menace' in 1999 no other effect studio could match their work a good example being the decline in quality in 'Star Trek V' when Paramount had to hire another company. Only after the introduction of computer animation did other FX studio's start to catch up with them. Although the ILMers pioneered this technique in 'Willow' and  'Jurassic Park' eventually new companies surpassed them in popularity if not in quality. Especially with the disappointing prequels under their belt the Lucas boys are often criticized for shoddy animation while it is really the annoying characters that people despise not the animation itself.7 out of 10".

It was neat to see the types of tricks that had gotten used in the likes of King Kong and Jumanji but I didn't like the focus on Independence Day one of the worst movies ever made. And really did ANYONE see that Shaquille O'Neal movie about the genie? Overall it's a fun documentary. There's some impressive stuff to learn about what goes on behind the camera.".

Also good are the more slapstick like stereotypical villains Jasper and Horace played by Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. Another fun villain role is played by John Shrapnel who is perhaps best known for his role in Gladiator.The fun and perhaps also a bit underrated musical score is done by Michael Kamen.

If you ask me Cruella Glenn Close Horace Mark Williams and Jasper Hugh Laurie were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast the production design was beautiful the performances were topgrade the direction was flawless and Disney has done it again. In conclusion I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.".

From the opening of the film with Jeff Daniels being dragged through Trafalgar Square on his bike having tried to chase Joely Richardons character and Perdita on her traditional Pashley bike. The opening of the film grabs you and sets the tone and in my opinion never lets up. The whole film is enjoyable and you never get bored. Well i am biased  i did not get bored anyway.

	schema:reviewBody "101 Dalmatians the ultimate Disney animated classic about none other than PUPPIES! It was clever sharp witty and just a wonderful movie and created one of Disney's most memorable and classic villains Cruella DeVil. So when I had heard about the live action version I wasn't too interested this movie came out when I was 11 years old for goodness's sake but I just didn't want to see what was already a perfect movie being made into a live action one but my grandparents had bought it and we watched it together. I remember seeing it and really didn't like it but as I grew up it was on TV one day so I figured since I'm a little more grown up to give this another chance and still I'm not too thrilled with this new take on the tail lol get it? Eh my lame jokes gotta love them.Roger Dearly is an American computer game designer who shares his home in London with his pet dalmatian Pongo. One day Roger takes Pongo for a walk and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female Dalmatian named Perdy. After a frantic chase through the streets of London Roger and Pongo discover Perdy likes Pongo and Perdy's owner fashion designer Anita CampbellGreen is taken with Roger when they meet in St. James Park. Romance blossoms between both human and canine couples and Roger and Anita walk down the aisle. Anita works for Cruella DeVil a sexy fashion maven with a great love for cigarettes and fur. Anita becomes inspired by her dogs and designs a fur coat made with spotted fur causing Cruella to leap on the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians. When Cruella learns that Perdy has given birth to fifteen Dalmatian puppies she offers the couple a decent price for the newborn puppies but the couple refuses. Flying into a maniacal rage she fires Anita and vows to get even. She has her henchmen Jasper and Horace steal the puppies and deliver them to her ancient estate but the puppies escape and now must find their way home.So I absolutely adore Glenn Close she's one of my favorite actresses of all time and always delivers very on the key performances now she was a great choice for Cruella but I think it was just the whole idea of the movie that dragged her down the whole cast as a matter of a fact is too good for this movie. It's just not as fun as the original animated classic I think the reason the animated movie is so much better is because it was just more special and personal as it was hand drawn and a classic for so many kids who grew up with it. Maybe I am being stubborn where I'm just more for the original but honestly this movie is just kind of pointless and not really for the kids nore the adults. I'd say it's not like it's the most horrible movie in the world but it's just not worth it to go out of your way to watch it.410".

It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt.Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back.Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing.It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it it was good and still true to the original.Glenn close WOW what a perfect job she did here as Cruella great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie.Not as good as the cartoon a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times which made it hard to accept as an adult but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars".

Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s.Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points.The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace I think but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil.The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise.The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films the National Lampoon movies Pretty in Pink Breakfast Club and many more but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace Baby's Day Out Just Visiting the Miracle on 34th Street remake and Flubber. In here his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish.The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive.If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic be my guest but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor.410".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a cute movie. The original Disney classic set up the story and this live action version is just as fun and entertaining. Albeit some details were modified for the sake of live action but these story elements don't deter from the decency of the movie. Glenn Close is quite literally the perfect actress for the job of Cruella DeVil and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a wellcomposed couple with decent chemistry. It's always neat to see other actors you recognize in movies you didn't remember them from like Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams.

Albeit some details were modified for the sake of live action but these story elements don't deter from the decency of the movie. Glenn Close is quite literally the perfect actress for the job of Cruella DeVil and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a wellcomposed couple with decent chemistry. It's always neat to see other actors you recognize in movies you didn't remember them from like Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams.

She's an elegant and beautiful woman starring in a bad kid's movie so you know she's bound to get her face dragged through the mud. Literally. But Close returns for a bad sequel in which she winds up getting baked into a giant muffin I think so I guess Close was getting something out of it hundreds of thousands of of dollars? Oh me too please!!! Still. Watching someone get debased on screen is hard to watch. If only she was hideous like the guy playing Horace. Ooh. Then we'd want to see her burn.

I can understand that large corporations interested in maintaining power and money might be upset at the nationalization of the oil corporations  but those resources do belong to the folks that live there and should probably benefit them. As well I am often astounded that rich and middle class people everywhere seem to think the poor are lazy and want to do nothing to pull themselves out of the holes they are in. That being said I never saw any interviews or stories that specifically illustrated why the right was so opposed to helping the poor with medical clinics helping to build farms that are selfsufficient or any other social or financial issues that separated either side.When you see the abject poverty in the barrios in Caracas the poor make up more than half the population and nothing was done about it for decades you have to think that the American backed elites really didn't understand that people  the majority  had had enough. The film does indicate the steps of revolution historically all taken by the French the Americans and the Spanish and how it applies to the current situation.Love him or hate him.

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to share my son's review. He just turned 8 and dictated as his dad typed I just hate it so bad!!!I'm a HUGE fan of the the cartoons. I have the whole series including Water Earth and Fire. It was a HUGE disappointment because even by the time I saw the commercial I knew it would be completely crushing! I mean the characters! Iroh was the greatest disappointment. He was not kind and wise enough. And also he was not old enough. And why can't they say anyone's name right!???I thought it was completely disrespectful to put the characters skin colors the opposite. After the first twenty minutes of it I was bored already but I have to say the effects were decent. And the Avatar did not have enough happiness in him! I think it's important to the movie. Aang is the main character of the movie and he should at least get a little more happiness inside of him! When I got home that night I had to watch the cartoon series for some time to completely forget about the movie! And... actually I'm watching it right now! If anybody wanted to see this movie I would suggest they close their eyes and ears!!!Dad's two centsMy son became interested in Avatar the Last Air Bender the animated series at age 4.I bought him the entire series on DVD as soon as the episodes were available and he and I devoured every episode again and again. Compared to the magnificently crafted animated series I'd have to say the live action movie was an abysmal embarrassment a sophomoric and vapid display of ignorance. Go rent or buy the animated series instead. I think it's some of the best fiction ever written for children. It's incredible. It's an epic parable dealing with sophisticated philosophical cultural emotional and spiritual issues which have plagued human civilization since the emergence of reason. And it does it with lightheartedness and joy. The theme deals with no less than issues of greed power spirituality and the formation of identity and moral values. It grapples with the ideals of pacifism. It teaches teamwork compassion empathy and humility. It exemplifies wisdom and the appreciation of art nature and connectedness  connectedness to each other to nature to animals to the universe and emphasizes detachment from possession. The story line traverses goofy playfulness tween and young teen crushes and love family power dynamics friendship mental illness and gut wrenching loss. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. But these things can't be achieved effectively without superb craftsmanship. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy. The live action version is NONE of these things. No insight no depth of character only the most cursory references of some of the core thematic values of the animated series and those done so poorly as to come off as just... pathetically trite. The thing I find most upsetting regarding the failure of this movie to deliver is that the original animated series covers all of what I find to be the best of Eastern culture and we Westerners need to understand these things in this global community. Buddhist and Confucian ideals and philosophies are front and center and in my mind are the greatest gifts the East has to offer the world and the very things that are most clearly in danger of vanishing in the face of the West's insignificant obsession with material gain and conspicuous consumption.And another thing too. It's typical that this story was handled on the level it was  dismissively. Adults appear to be largely disinterested in the profound turmoil in which children are engaged as they enter their teens. They are forming their value systems they are trying to reconcile reality with fantasy and desire. They are trying to find the balance between selfishness and empathy. They are finding what it means to be themselves members of a community and a species on the planet. They are in agony grappling with issues we were happy to leave behind. But these struggles are never truly resolved and our ideas of who we are and how we fit in the world cannot remain fixed and yet when they are challenged we adults consider ourselves to be in a state of crisis when that is the perpetual state of being of a young teen. And I would argue it's a state of flux that we should never leave that we should always be questioning ourselves our figures of authority and our place in the world and in relation to those around us. I do not see these struggles as juvenile but human and the animated series brings all these struggles to mind. Sadly the movie did little to bring the richness of these struggles to life. In my most critical mood I would say this failure is deeply offensive to my sensibilities as a human being.But on the other hand not everyone has the depth of vision and creative genius to pull off what admittedly would be a very challenging feat. I just wish I could see what David Lean could have done with this story.".

The entire movie which covers the first Book of the series is rushed together and jumps around in a totally nonsensical manner. There is absolutely NO time spent on characterization. None of the characters had any depth at all and may as well have been cardboard cutouts. Major plot points are summarized through narration or montage and the film would leave any person not familiar with the story absolutely dumbfounded.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the movie knowing it would not be even a fraction as good as the real show. However I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous the only way to describe it is a 150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar The Last Airbender with extras almost religiously for the past month.The script in itself should have been tossed into the garbage and burnt and it's remains locked away so that no one would ever have to suffer looking at such garbage. That's why I'm not really sure if it's the actors or the script that's really to blame for the atrocious movie that's resulted. The long and I'm assuming this what they were going for inspirational speeches merely consisted of crudely strung together clichs and the language left much to be desired. I found myself almost twitching at the phrase something along the lines You guys are AWESOME people!...What I find the be so incredibly amazing is how someone could honestly fail to such a proportion when they literally have a blue print already created. The fans know how the characters look and sound and while I understand that no one fits the package perfectly one out of two would be better than nothing. As well suddenly deciding to change the pronunciation of the characters name is definitely not the best idea while I do understand that he wanted the names to sound like their Asian origin it didn't go over well and the whole time I was just cringing at the mere mention of Aang and Sokka's names.This movie does not hold a candle to the original show. Heck it should be retitled as it is hardly resembles the original in any way shape or form. While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused. I also loathed the way they worked the bending in like it took five minutes of moving ones hands around awkwardly before any actual bending occurred. Most of the fighting was like fifteen minutes of martial arts with like the occasional bit of air bending and a little water being splashed around.There was nothing to love in this movie not even the most adorable of characters such as Momo. Momo had literally what three minutes in the entire movie which I found extremely depressing as Momo was always one of the characters I just wanted to cuddle because of his adorable mannerisms but in the movie I had no love for the digitized Momo. Not even Appa was interesting.This movie leaves me hoping and praying that M. Night Shyamalan goes broke and is black listed so that he can't ruin the series even more so. This is definitely something you will spend some time just trying to forget.".

Believe the critics. The writing sucks the acting is stiff the pacing clumsy the 3D beyond bad the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.But really even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame.

	schema:reviewBody "M.Night.Shyamalan ought to be ashamed of himself. I went to the midnight premier of the Last Airbender as a hopeful long time fan of the wonderful animated series. Less than thirty minutes into the feature however I realized that my hopes would be dead on the ground by the time the movie ended.Over the past few months this film has been surrounded by controversy. The casting choices have caused accusations of racism to be leveled and many fans were left feeling disappointed months before the film even premiered. Now I don't think M.Night Shyamalan is a racist. I don't know him well enough to make such a slanderous claim. Would I have preferred that the characters in the movie had appeared as the fans had come to know them over the past five years? Of course. However at the heart of Avatar fans I don't think changing the appearances of certain nations was a racial issue. Simply put I think people just wanted the characters to look the way they were supposed to look. However had this movie been written well and had the acting been terrific changing the appearances of the nations wouldn't have mattered. Because at its heart the story of Avatar is a human story with strong themes of redemption and forgiveness. I think people would have been able to look past their disgruntlement and see the beauty of the story. That is if the movie had been well written. And I'm sorry to say it was not. Naturally it was always going to be difficult to condense over eight hours worth of animated material into twohours of movie. How do you choose what goes and what stays in a series where almost everything is interconnected? It was a daunting task indeed. But successful adaption of books television series and even video games have been done before. If the works of Tolkien the master of intricate detail could be adapted into a series that left a decent amount of his life long fans pleased surely Avatar The Last Airbender could be adapted with the same success. Unfortunately this adaption was far from successful. In fact I think this movie officially joins the list of the most atrocious film adaptions right along side of the horrendous Earthsea miniseries the painful Eragon flop and perhaps the even worse Dark is Rising catastrophe. So where did this movie go wrong? The better question would be where didn't it go wrong? The writing was horrendous. High school freshmen could probably manage to come up with a better screenplay. I'm not sure who gave Shyamalan permission to write this film but whoever it was needs to formally apologize to the fans and to the people who wasted their money hoping to see something worthwhile. The direction was choppycertain scenes made little sense the camera lingered on other similarly senseless scenes and at times the camera angles were difficult to follow. The lighting in the film was too dark throughout and when color was added it was in too much excess. Overall there was a lack of balance and cohesion in the way this movie was filmed. The plot was a mess. People who weren't familiar with the series would have been left lost and people who were familiar with the series were left confused. Certain characters that were supposed to do things didn't lines weren't said when they should have been said and elements of the plot were just erased entirely. There was no Avatar Roku only a dragon spirit that may have been an attempt at Fang but a very bad one. There was no Omashu no Kiyoshi warriors there were no refugees at the northern air temple and Aang never attempted to master fire bending. In fact in the movie he was too timid to learn water bending which fans know to be a fallacy. And the characters that were featured were not only acted and written poorly but many of them modeled new pronunciations of their names. I'm not sure of the reasoning behind this. Perhaps the changes in pronunciation were more accurate. Even if that was the case they never should have strayed from the pronunciations in the series. Fans grew accustomed to a certain way of a saying and hearing a name. To change the pronunciations only led to confusion and distastes. I heard many people in the theatre around me growling in frustration every time Aang was pronounced Ahng. I won't get into my dislike of the graphics in detail. Appa and Momo were fairly horrendous the bending was decent but done incorrectlyactors had to make a hell of a lot of movement for anything to happen whereas in the series each movement corresponds to the movement of the elements and the 3D was pointless.Overall I'd give this movie a 0 out of 10. Fans of the series don't waste your money. People who are not fans and areconsidering giving this film a chance use the money you would have spent on the ticket to rent the first season at the nearest video store.".

	schema:headline " The most inept filmmaking I have seen in years";
	schema:reviewBody "The only thing I can really say about The Last Airbender is this Epic  Fail. Just how epic? Paramount Pictures gave M. Night Shyamalan 150  million dollars to adapt the popular Nickolodeon cartoon for the big  screen. What they got is an absolute mess of a movie complete with  poor acting the most hackneyed script ever and a lastminute  conversion to 3D that only serves to destroys what was possibly some  lush cinematography.  The Last Airbender is perhaps the worst film of the summer a feat I  thought Jonah Hex had locked down. However Airbender makes a  determined effort. Let me put it this way as good as Toy Story 3 was  Airbender is just as bad. It was hard to find anything wrong with Toy  Story 3. It is nigh impossible to find anything right with Airbender.  The story is ridiculously complex. In a world where people can  manipulate bend the four elements of air earth fire and water  depending on their tribal affiliation there exists a being the  Avatar who can manipulate all four. This person is also the sole being  capable of communing the the spirit world which serves to keep things  in balance. This being went missing 100 years ago only to be found in  a giant ice sphere by two children of the water tribe. In the 100 years  the Avatar has been gone the Fire tribe has begun conquering the  others though we're never really told why. The disgraced Prince  ZukoDev Patel the Slumdog Millionaire himself of the Fire tribe  wants to the Avatar so he can return to his family. The Water children  need to save the Avatar to ensure the Fire people don't win. For this  point on it becomes to silly to try and summarize.  Shyamalan succumbs to his own hubris loading the film with long  boring exposition communicated through long boring speeches that I'm  sure were meant to be inspirational. Instead they are clichd  burdensome mounds of words that only slow down an already languidly  paced film. He heaps some unnecessary narration on top of the  exposition condescending to the audience as he does it. Perhaps the  narration was put in to help the film's target audience the  prepubescent b0ys and girls who watch the cartoon understand where  this convoluted story is going. Sadly it doesn't. The dialogue is so  corny it left me squirming a little. Also bothersome is the hamfisted  way Shyamalan expounded his themes which seem to be responsibility  responsibility and the horror of industry destroying nature lifted  with little change from the Lord of the Rings. Seriously the Fire  people sail their world's oceans in giant steel yachts that feature  gigantic smokestacks over visible flame. These stacks spew out a never  ending cloud of dark ashy smoke. The metaphor could not be more clear  had it just been printed as a subtitle across the screen.  The acting is bad across the board. The child cast as Aan the Avatar  Noah Ringer a wooden child actor if there ever was one. He speaks his  lines as if reciting them of a cue card just off screen. The two Water  tribe children Katara Nicola Peltz and Sokka Jackson Rathbone are  no better. A colleague of mine I saw the film with noted that Rathbone  seemed downright anxious every time he was on screen delivering his  lines tersely with little emotion. The older actors just phone it in.  The usually reliable Cliff Curtis looks bored stiff as the leader of  the Fire people while the main antagonist a Fire general played by  Aasif Mandvi is neither menacing nor scary. He comes off as a  schoolyard bully all bluster and no balls. The only actor I found  brought any sort of depth to his role was Shaun Toub Yinsen from Iron  Man. Playing Prince Zuko's Uncle Iroh he's conflicted between his  duty to the prince and his beliefs in the spirit world something the  Fire people have come to consider children's superstition.  Perhaps the most egregious error of the movie is the 3D conversion.  3D tends to suck all the light out of the images it portends to  display leaving viewers with a murky picture where shadow and light  blend together. There are no crisp lines in the film no real detail.  Which is a shame as the film's setting should've been its biggest  strength. The movie travels from an arctic campsite where the whites  should have popped against the bluish hues of the ice and water around  it. When it travels to warmer climates the greens and browns should  have been aweinspiring. It's not. It all looks faded. Much as with  Clash of the Titans the 3D is barely noticeable throughout the film  and contributes nothing. I fear that Hollywood has cynically latched  onto this fad for the high ticket price it commands rather than for any  real artistic merit. My only relief was the movie was short so I  didn't get the usual headache 3D movies tend to give me.  I didn't expect much going into The Last Airbender. However I didn't  expect it to be quite so bad. It's like watching a train wreck unfold  over 94 minutes. The problem is that 94 minutes feels like an  eternity. The end of the film hints at a sequel. I hope some divine  being takes mercy on us all and never lets that happen.".

If you are a big fan of Avatar the last air bender series then don't watch this You will be annoyed from the beginning.";

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING MANY SPOILERS!! I just returned from a midnight showing of The Last Airbender and it was by far the worst movie I've seen in some time. I'm a HUGE fan of the cartoon and even after reading poor reviews from other users decided to see it anyway. There are very few films that I can't stand and I thought that since I was a fan I would enjoy seeing it even though I was prepared to be disappointed. In short this film contains nothing that made the show great. There's no chemistry between Kitara Sokka and Aang. Appa and Momo had exactly no personality. The entire story seemed to be presented far too quickly and with no emphasis on any one particular aspect. It essentially goes from Aang being rescued from Zuko's ship to the Northern Water Tribe with a montage in between after Sokka suggests they hit a bunch of small towns and create rebellions against the Fire Nation. They briefly go into the concepts of bending. They briefly mention the spirit world. They don't mention the Avatar state although Aang uses it at the end. The characters are never developed. You never get the feeling of any bonds of friendship. Aang isn't lovable and playful. Sokka isn't funny. Kitara isn't motherly and caring. The bending is dumbed down. Only a few great firebenders can create their own fire. The rest of the bending seems like far too much work for hardly any payoff. For example at one point it takes 5 earthbenders about 7 seconds to throw one rock about the size of a dinner plate. I guess the best way to put it is that it looks as if the benders are dancing while the elements almost move themselves. It doesn't feel tight andor coordinated and all the elements move far too slow. The only characters that even remotely look like their cartoon counterparts are Aang Sokka Kitara and Yue. Zuko Ozai Zhao Ihro and Pakku look completely different. The dialogue made me cringe the entire time. Also many of the names are pronounced differently. Ihro is pronounced Eeroh Sokka is Soka like the word so Aang is more like Ung and the word Avatar is pronounced like Ahvatar. Many great characters are just not there like Bumi Jet Roku Kyoshi or any of the Kyoshi warriors. Not even the cabbage merchant. I don't understand how a film like this could be greenlighted. To conclude if you like the show you won't find anything you liked about it in this film other than a watereddown version of the main plot of Book 1 and some weak bending. If you didn't like or didn't see the show then you will most likely be confused and bored and possibly even angry you wasted your money. Or amused at how ridiculous this movie is. True fans will see this anyway and they can't be blamed but if you haven't been looking forward to this movie for awhile don't waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever an adaptation is mode it is hard to view said film in any other context than in comparison to the source material. While it is important to take things in context it is also important to view a film as what it is  that being the film medium. In the case of the critically acclaimed television series Avatar The Last Airbender it would be impossible to adequately recreate or adapt every single thing in the entire first season in to a movie. M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is an adaptation of the first season or Book 1 of the television series. I have watched Book 1 of the Nickelodeon series and quite enjoyed it but for the sake of the medium of film I try to take an objective stance on my review of the film on terms of how it stands by itself as opposed to how well it adapted the source material.First however in terms of the adaptation let me say that with such brilliant source material as Avatar The Last Airbender it'd be easy to take the script and scenes wordforword from the source material and simply plug in actors to say the lines. Unfortunately Shymalan's The Last Airbender fails at even the simplest of tasks such as this.Before the coming of sound to film the theater was silent and the pictures told the audience the story. When sound came along some criticized the addition to film as a bastardization of the art form. The talkies became quite popular with the masses however and as history will show us filmmakers adapted to new techniques and new ways of integrating pictures with sound and the silent film has almost completely gone the way of the dinosaur except for some notable arthouse exceptions.Movies like The Last Airbender almost make me wish that silent film still existed. From the delivery of the first line to the last word spoken every single line that is delivered is done so with such a forced agony that the film is almost unwatchable. The acting is stale what characterization there should be is absent and the whole film becomes more unbearable with every scene. It's almost as if the characters think they are in a radio drama as the plot is rehashed for us the audience almost every third minute as the characters catch us up to speed in a quick narration. The script is bloated and filled with all sorts of unnecessary dialogue which is delivered either so lazily that it's hard to care or with such overblown emotion that the lines become laughable. This excess dialogue serves as a catalyst to suck all depth out of who should be wellrounded characters that even a quick3D conversion process cannot rescue them.There are a few bright moments with the actors probably the two most notable being Dev Patel as Prince Zuko and Shaun Toub as Uncle Iroh. These two actually have some good moments among all the poorly written lines and end up being the best part about the film scriptwise.Watching The Last Airbender makes me wonder if anyone besides the special effects supervisors and the fight choreographers even cared about what they were doing. Shots seem wellcomposed enough though not even close to usual Shyamalan standards the special effects are simply incredible and the choreography is excellent. However everything else about the film is just terrible. Even the way the choreography is presented is so overdramatic that it takes all emotion out of what is happening. Every action scene is put in to slow motion. This highlights the spectacular of the choreography but makes me wonder what could have been done had at least a few of the fight scenes been left in realtime.Another quick note related to the adaptation most of the film is dedicated to the last episode of the first season. Over an hour of the movie in fact. Because of this the first hour of the film feels rushed trying to speed us to the big battle scene. I realize that a series adaptation is tough but to skimp out on important character details makes it near impossible to identify or even care about a single character.The Last Airbender is not only a terrible adaptation it's a pretty terrible movie on its own right and may even go down in history as Shyamalan's worst. A shame for the oncegreat writerdirector.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Airbender directed by M. Night Shyamalan is tortuously  lethargic uninvited abysmal and uniformly atrocious in every  aspect. And that's me being nice!  Based on Nickelodeon's beloved animated series to which I am only  vaguely familiar and thus can't compare is set i a world in which the  population is divided amid the four elements Earth Wind Water and  Fire and some skilled practitioners whom can bend these elements to  their will. Since the elements are naturally at odds with each other  an overall controller is needed to maintain order among the kingdom.  This role is played by the Avatar who can manipulate all the elements  and thus can keep balance and peace amongst the tribes. Only problem is  this Avatar has gone missing for 100 hundred years.  The Last Airbender follows a brother and sister from the Water Tribe  Sokka Jackson Rathbone and Katara Nicola Peltz who discover a  12yearold monkchild from the Air tribe frozen in a block of ice and  his gigantic furry steed that resembles the luck dragon in The Never  Ending Story.His name is Aang Noah Ringer and he of course is the  missing Avatar. Now freed he finds his home air tribe are all dead and  the rest of the world in turmoil. All at the hands of the tyranny of  the dreaded Fire Nation. Aang who never wanted to be the Avatar in the  first place thus why he ran away must step up lead a resistance and  bring peace back to the Kingdom. However he must first learn how to  control the elements other than air was imprisoned by an ice storm  before he could train. The Fire nation led by Lord Ozai Cliff Curtis  wants none of this of course and seeks to capture and subdue Aang they  would just kill him but he'd just get reincarnated. Rounding out the  plot is Ozai's son Prince Zuko Dev Patel living in exile with his  uncle Iroh Shaun Toub who also wants to capture Aang and bring him  back to his father to win his honor back.  Sound like a lot? It is but surprisingly not as convoluted as it  sounds. The scope of the plot which attempts at mysticism politics  religion and a whole obvious Jesus angle isn't the problem. Its how the  story is told that makes it unbearable. It throws a lot at you with no  effect. It fails definition and lacks resonance. Everything is rushed.  Characters and story elements are given no development. Take the Fire  Nation for example. We are told they are scourge of the once unified  kingdom but we arn't shown this. They travel the globe in their  ominous menacing iron ships and have a mightier than though attitude  but all in all nothing that establishes their evilness albeit a later  incident with a glowing pond guppy. Because of this we have nothing at  stake no reason to root for the good guys to triumph. Another example  would be a big part of Aang's journey. Which involves him letting go of  his anger towards the genocide of his people a scene depicting said  genocide would have helped sell the fire nation's doucheyness but we  never see him get angry enough to make letting go have meaning.  Voidness of emotional moments are what really plague this film. I  would blame this on the script but the performances are what make it  not work. Every actor in this film minus Shaun Toub delivers dialogue  as if they were reading it for the very first time. Not one thing  anyone says carries any weight none of it resonates emotionally. To  say the actors suffer from wooden acting would be insult an to wood.  It seem Shyamalan seemed much more interested in the visuals than the  narrative or the dialogue which is shoddy at best. M. Night manages  a few striking images most of them involving otherworldly landscapes  and ornate set design. There are strong special effects and action  sequences which are fluid and vivid. Particularly with the fights  involving element manipulation. Winds gusts slamming people around  like rag dolls earth barricades globs or walls of water and so on are  eye popping. The effects are top notch. The handtohand KungFu fight  sequences are well choreographed as well but a bit too extraneous.  Should also mention that this movie is available in 3D and lets just  say it's a wasted element pun intended an unnecessary afterthought.  It wrecks whatever visual grace that might have been and will give you  a massive headache.  Though relatively successful in cinematic aspects Shyamalan overall  fails to capture the sense of adventure. There is a signs of a  beautiful journey but it ultimately falls flat.  Underwhelming and joyless Avatar The Last Airbender is sure the be the  final nail in the coffin of M. Night Shymalans stunted career.  M. Night Shyamalan Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me four times?  The Sixth Sense was clearly a fluke.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember when i first saw previews for Avatar on Nickelodeon and my excitement was born. I remember watching the premiere and the excitement grew. I remember following the series and having loved every moment of it. I remember watching the series finale and believing it to be the most epic and beautiful ending I've ever seen TV movie or otherwise. Then came the announcement that they were making a live action movie and everything went downhill from there. I was skeptical that such perfection could be replicated or even if it needed to be attempted. When M. Night was announced as the director and writer the skepticism continued. It was great that he was a fan boy and I felt that he could give the rest of us fans what we were looking for but M. Night? Seriously he had never really done a movie like this before and not to mention his other movies aren't the greatest to begin with. Then the cast was announced and the set photos began to emerge. It all became clear that he was taking the story in a very different and dark atmosphere. Lost was the fun light hearted nature of the series. Gone were the goofiness of Sokka the incurable prankster persona of Aang the jovial wisdom of Iroh the confused soul of Zuko. Everything had become onedimensional and very serious. I didn't like the direction M Night had taken this. But when the first teaser came out and I bought into it. This could work I thought. He is trying to appeal to a wider audience and if that means forgetting the roots of this children's cartoon and transforming it into an all out epic trilogy about warfare in a fantasy world with magic so be it. This is no longer my beloved Avatar but it could still be visually striking and entertaining. With each successive trailer I gradually lost all expectations and prepared myself for a heartless reproduction of a timeless masterpiece. But it looked DAMN good that's what kept my hope alive. The bending looked spot on the fights were nicely choreographed the battles felt grand and the first time I saw Appa I was speechless. I honestly felt I could endure this movie just for the visuals. I was wrong. Fastforward to midnight June 30th the months of anticipation came to a close. I refused to check reviews because I did not want to come into the theater biased I had heard rumors of a very low rating but no real confirmation. Not even ten minutes in I handed down my verdict this movie is absolute garbage. First impression was the outdated photography did they hire the guy that made the Conan movies in the 80s? The movie looked like a high school project that abused an overblown budget. Costumes were second rate set pieces are generic locales are bland and computer graphics are no were near current standards to name a few faults. Secondly the acting was laughable. Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz are flat lifeless cadavers. Third and this was after I got over their horrendous delivery was the writing. Reading an essay between two people does not qualify as dialog. Every sentence and every line was a simple description of what was happening on screen there was nothing natural about any of it. And that leads to another fault there was no structure to the story. If M Night intended to merely condense 6 hours of season one into a 2 hour movie randomly choosing and cutting certain scenes is not a viable formula. He had already done enough to offend fans knowledgeable of the show there was no reason to alienate any newcomers with such a jumbled sequence of events. I bit my lip and drank from my flask just wait for the action that will be the savior of this movie I tried to convince myself. Needless to say when I saw a rock slowly float across the screen masquerading as a sorry excuse for earthbending I immediately got up out of my seat and left. I had never walked out of any movie before not even The Golden Compass but I could no longer stomach this travesty. I love Avatar The Last Airbender the series and I refuse to let this regurgitation from M Night's ego ruin it for me. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! DO NOT ENCOURAGE M NIGHT TO MAKE A SECOND AND GOD FORBID A THIRD!".

That's exactly what this name change thingy did for the story. Secondly the races of the characters. Why is the fire nation made of Indian people? Are those personal friends of Shyamalan? I call it rather coincidental that a big chunk of the cast is of the same ethnicity of the director. Eventho Zuko is incredibly pale in the series in this movie he is Indian. So is Iroh Firelord Ozai and commander Zhao. Even Azula is kinda Indian.Katara and Sokka were white... While in the series they have a darker complexion. And Monk Gyatso... Was black! Except from an Asian Earthbender there was no Asian to be found.Zuko even tho Dev Patel was one of the better actors was not at all as he should've been. His scar was not at all that visible. While it's like the most important part of his face. And you know he was Indian...Aang played by Noah Ringer looked a lot like a real life Aang... But his acting skills were practically none existent. Sokka played by Jackson Rathbone... Sucked! Not funny AT ALL and poor poor poor acting. At times I just felt embarrassed for HIM!In the end... It just seemed that Shyamalan lost interest in making the movie at the first scene. It seemed as if every scene is 'take 1' and that he just wanted to be done as quickly as possible.I don't have an evil personality but deep down inside I hope Nickelodeon and Paramount have punished Shyamalan for this injustice. I actually feel wronged... Robbed and cheated. Leaves me to question once again why this director has such a big name. Time and time again he messes up movies...

I could have done better casting from a high school and a shopping mall and I am halfblind. Also he deleted all kinds of material that could have easily been included at minimal cost Even the mention of the 'spirit world' at the beginning was betrayed at the end when Princess Yue ascended as a moon spirit. No he just let her drown in the spirit pond and let the others drag her now darkhaired body out for Sokka to weep over. Talk about totally missing the whole mystical point of the series.Additionally having Prince Zuko give up the chase and join the team in Book 1 as well as Fire Nation forces screws up a number of story lines. Where did the Avatar not being able to have a family come? The previous Avatar was Fire Nation and married. Mr. Shyamalan apparently just decided he wanted to rewrite Avatar  The Last Airbender and now fans do not recognize what is going on. I would recommend the original series trashing this movie and starting over with a more faithful director. In any event DO NOT let this man touch the sequel and yes there needs to be one just to get the taste of this one out of my mouth!!! I wonder if one of the South Park kids or Stewie from Family Guy will show up on Shyamalan's doorstep and punch him in the face?".

	schema:headline " The reason that I got into films in the first place!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "In film school it is not cool to say you like David Lynch. Film students claim he is just a poor mans version of Luis Bunuel. Yes I would say that Bunuel is more talented and is the king of surrealism. But Lynch is very good and his films do challenge the viewer. I actually have a deep affection for his films. When his films work they really work! However when they do not work for example Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me or Lost Highway then they quickly launch themselves into self parody. Many people claim his material is too inconsistent and indulgent to be really liked very much.  What I find strange is that one reviewer here states that he feel duped by Lynch. Duped? Why? The films all have a story. They just have a narrative that works differently to conventional film making. If you look hard at the film and try to understand the subtext then you will pick up  on what the film is about. I saw this when I was 16. I knew nothing about films or film making then. A friend and I were bored so we decided to see a movie at capitol cinema. Capitol cinema used to be a cinema that played arty or small independent films. They used to play midnight showings of eraserhead. There was always someone smoking a joint in that place. However you don't need drugs for this film. Lynch is drugs. This film just buzzes you out. I had no idea what Eraserhead was about. I had never heard of Lynch and knew nothing about surrealism. I went in and was just totally blown away! Before this I had only really seen commercial blockbuster movies. Lynch gave me a whole knew perspective on what cinema is capable of. Eraserhead is the stuff of dreams. Lynch believes that watching a film is entering a dream state. Both my friend and I did not know what the hell was going on. I was fascinated...    Later I would learn this is a film about Lynch's own obsessions. His hatred of Philadelphia. His fear and anxiety at being a father. The film is just full of a kind of a compulsive paranoid neurosis. It is a waking nightmare. He also seems to parody the nuclear family. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?' Meanwhile that weird blond woman in his radiator seems to represent his escape. A way to transcend from his grim world. What I also find bizarre is that people then accuse him of having no sense of humor! What? There are always funny moments in his films. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?'Jack Nance is also very good as the main character. He seems to be playing the director and he gives a performance that is distant spaced out and yet emotionally vulnerable. A really strange mix. The imagery is just brilliant. Black and white in an industrial wasteland. There is smoke here of course. It wouid not be a Lynch film without smoke! It also has a cool grating industrial soundtrack that sets your nerves on edge. This is perfectly effective for the bleak tone of the film. It is so visually striking that the viewer will not forget the imagery quickly. There is a reason that this is a cult film. The other distinctive feature of this film is the long lingering shots. This reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his movies like Dead Man and Ghost Dog. The length of the shots seems to have the effect of immersing the viewer in this strange industrial wasteland.I have my own copy that I lend to friends. They then normally give it back to me saying that they only got through the first half hour. They also normally tell me that I am a weirdo for liking it. I think what frustrates people most about Lynch is that he will not give any explanations of what the film is about. So any interpretation is as good as any other. People want the film to be explained so they can understand it. Who said films must be understood or comprehensible? Why can't a film be abstract piece of art like a painting? Lynch's films are like an acid trip. To quote the great gonzo Hunter S Thompson 'buy the ticket take the ride and if it gets a little heavier than what you  had in mind then put it down to forced consciousness expansion.'  So in other words relax stick it on and just run with it. Travel into someone else's nightmare for a change...".

	schema:headline " Ask six people exactly what Eraserhead is about and you will get six different answers";
	schema:reviewBody "I sometimes dream of waking to a completely dark world a world with no sunlight and minimal artificial light. My vision is blurred but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty and my friends and family are lifeless sitting standing or even walking but with nothing to do or say and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry Spencer the main character in Eraserhead who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream the only form of light is artificial the streets are virtually empty and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the fatherinlaw and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hellhole it is now. The city they live in is completely industrialized and the only plant life seen is dead and in a pile of soil on Henry's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Eraserhead before you see the film as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it firsthand.The first time I saw Eraserhead I was completely confused. It is possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it or not. On the other hand there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very openminded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories battling persistently against your previous conceptions but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Eraserhead several times and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Eraserhead is about you would get six different answers each equally correct in their own right and each equally confused.That being said this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Lynch film I have seen and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects for its time anyway. There will be those who don't like much to think about and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well Eraserhead is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude Where's My Car?' you probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it Eraserhead will stay with you for a very long time.".

	schema:headline " A dark dream of disturbing things...";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say that Eraserhead is not a film for everyone.  Many people will find themselves confused by the strange atmosphere surreal imagery and signature David Lynch sense of purposefully awkward pacing.That out of the way I would have to say that this is possibly one of my most personal favorite films.  It is dark tense atmospheric and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend but is quite a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally scare you so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal artfilm a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film along with the original black and white Night of the Living dead are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day. Side note Also I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel's movie Un Chien Andalou to see where strange artfilms like this originated from.Anyway the film's plot while initially incomprehensible to most can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer Jack Nance stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend Mary X. Charlotte Stewart  However he is consumed by his guilt and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent.However in order to better understand and appreciate the film one must figure out what each of the images mean.  Here's a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movieTHE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERSWorm  sin. These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide his little sin from Mary at one point only to have a nightmare where Mary is consumed by worms.  Henry's room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice which makes his room a breeding ground for worms.The Baby  The product of sin. You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm. Futhermore the baby is a part of Henry and later during the dream sequence we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby he kills himself.Eraser  Memories. Henry feels that his memories or his brain with his bad memories is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence he sees himself losing his head and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.The lady in the radiator  Death. Death looks grotesque yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for Henry promising to stamp out his sins worms and telling him that in heaven everything is fine.  At the end of the movie Henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls.The man in the planet  God. In addition to disposing of Henry's cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie the worm coming out of Henry's mouth the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence. He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice the bleeding tree though it is in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  the babyThe last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch moviesElectricity and electrical lighting  The presence of good. Darkness  The presence of evil.There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear Henry's apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen etc. Also there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your own.END OF SPOILERSAll in all the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you will either love or utterly hate.  For myself I managed to click with the movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before.  All in all I say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film.With that I give you some fun facts about the movieThe pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch and a friend of his.To this day Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature though he claims is was created with substanceobjects that anyone could find around the house.Jack Nance's hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright.In order to get a better sense of textures for the film possibly for the organs of the baby Lynch dissected a dead cat.When driving around town with the Henry hair Jack Nance would sit in the center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep his gravitydefying hair from being seen.".

It is dark tense atmospheric and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend but is quite a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally scare you so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal artfilm a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film along with the original black and white Night of the Living dead are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day. Side note Also I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel's movie Un Chien Andalou to see where strange artfilms like this originated from.Anyway the film's plot while initially incomprehensible to most can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer Jack Nance stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend Mary X. Charlotte Stewart  However he is consumed by his guilt and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent.However in order to better understand and appreciate the film one must figure out what each of the images mean.  Here's a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movieTHE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERSWorm  sin. These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide his little sin from Mary at one point only to have a nightmare where Mary is consumed by worms.  Henry's room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice which makes his room a breeding ground for worms.The Baby  The product of sin. You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm. Futhermore the baby is a part of Henry and later during the dream sequence we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby he kills himself.Eraser  Memories. Henry feels that his memories or his brain with his bad memories is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence he sees himself losing his head and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.The lady in the radiator  Death. Death looks grotesque yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for Henry promising to stamp out his sins worms and telling him that in heaven everything is fine.  At the end of the movie Henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls.The man in the planet  God. In addition to disposing of Henry's cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie the worm coming out of Henry's mouth the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence. He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice the bleeding tree though it is in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  the babyThe last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch moviesElectricity and electrical lighting  The presence of good. Darkness  The presence of evil.There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear Henry's apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen etc. Also there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your own.END OF SPOILERSAll in all the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you will either love or utterly hate.  For myself I managed to click with the movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before.  All in all I say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film.With that I give you some fun facts about the movieThe pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch and a friend of his.To this day Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature though he claims is was created with substanceobjects that anyone could find around the house.Jack Nance's hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright.In order to get a better sense of textures for the film possibly for the organs of the baby Lynch dissected a dead cat.When driving around town with the Henry hair Jack Nance would sit in the center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep his gravitydefying hair from being seen.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm always a bit worried when I'm about to express my love towards this movie by the genius director David Lynch... I figure it's the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts  But what the heck they're a lot of nutballs on this website so I can speak my mind freely. Indeed I love this movie...although 'love' may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie 'fascinates' me is a much better saying. Usually a movie is something in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it. Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions you don't know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you'll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre. In fact I would go so far to say you can't call yourself a cultfreak if you haven't seen it yet.David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on. Eraserhead isn't his best film at all  certainly not when it comes to storyline  but it's his most deep and personal tale. 25 years old and still the weirdest film ever. That's an achievement certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or at least they try to be...I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one but it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not recommended if you're depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down I think. The tagline of this movie  In heaven everything looks fine  could become a stimulus I'm afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet harmless baby  I really don't know how I should call it actually is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.You must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production. But it worked...hell even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed. Based on this film he decided to let Lynch direct The Elephant Man a few years later. By that David's career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally his highlights were the 80's with terrific movies like Blue Velvet Dune  very underrated in my opinion and Wild at Heart at the end of the decade. And let's not forget the best TVseries ever made Twin Peaks.Please watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour  or less  and yelled What the f is this ???. Real shame if you ask me. It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really don't see the magic of it at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character. I'm thinking of doing the same thing with mine...".

In spite of truly bizarre occurances Roast chickens start kicking and oozing blood at the dinner table while Mom has a seziure apparently unnoticed by everybody else grandma seems catatonic but mom still gets her to toss the salad etc. etc. etc...

The values that force Henry and Mary to marry are shown to be as much a part of the machine that has created the industrial hell in which they live as any other force.Their universe seems postappocalyptic in its desolation not a wisp of vegetation anywhere and almost no clues about time of day. I suspect a rational explanation for the setting of Eraserhead might include some alien takeover Henry and Mary's premature baby doesn't really look human and it's introduction to their lives is more than a little suspect. Not to mention the worms that keep appearing everywherelooking like dissected human central nerve chords.While I firmly believe there is no one way to interpret Eraserhead itdoes touch on a number themes that fall into the social commentary bin.

As such this film is guaranteed to alienate a large audience. Some of Lynch's more recent films Mulholland Drive for example are puzzleboxes that start the viewer out in this state of confusion but actually make a lot more sense once the puzzle is figured out. Eraserhead deliberately induces confusion and intentionally maintains confusion throughout with no resolution intended. As such it is typical student work untainted by the need to be palatable to large numbers of people unencumbered by the idea that many will lose interest because they do not see value in maintaining states of confusion it's called developing an attention span.

	schema:reviewBody "When I critique a film I usually begin with a synopsis. That is where my problems start with David Lynch's Eraserhead what with not having a conventional narrative it doesn't lend itself to being easily synopsised.So let me say that it appears to be about a strange man and matters and characters concerning his strange mutant offspring although any or all of it may be fantasy.I must say initially that I suspect that the movie is very close to showing on screen exactly what David Lynch intended I can't imagine these images or events being accidental or unintentional.I must then go on to say that I don't like it very much. Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me.

	onyx:emotionText "When I critique a film I usually begin with a synopsis. That is where my problems start with David Lynch's Eraserhead what with not having a conventional narrative it doesn't lend itself to being easily synopsised.So let me say that it appears to be about a strange man and matters and characters concerning his strange mutant offspring although any or all of it may be fantasy.I must say initially that I suspect that the movie is very close to showing on screen exactly what David Lynch intended I can't imagine these images or events being accidental or unintentional.I must then go on to say that I don't like it very much. Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me. The images are unpleasant and unappealing. The main character doesn't invite me to identify with him.

	schema:reviewBody "When on the hunt for cult films this one should not be overlooked. Filmed over the course of five years 19721977 this film is the very first fulllength masterpiece of artist David Lynch. I say artist because he began not as a director but an art student. Finding canvas too confining he moved on celluloid eventually moving on to AFI to fund his script 'Eraserhead'. According to Lynch the film was inspired largely by his stay in Philadelphia. To know how he views it the film must be seen.The script itself was only 21 pages long so it was assumed to be roughly a 21 minute movie most people wouldn't expect that the film would be a living breathing piece of art.The elements of the film cannot even be understood by film scholars. Lynch himself has said that in the 25 or more years it has been out that no critic or viewer has given an interpretation that is in line with his own. There appear to be prevalent themes of sexuality and conception not to mention claustrophobia and physical discomfort in simply living. The film is definitely very affecting on a visceral level in certain scenes where Lynch appears to deconstruct the simplicity of family life and bring to the surface the inherent disgusting nature of feeding. Near the end simple curiosity gets the best of the main character played extraordinarily wellreserved by Jack Nance and his mistake ends up causing his world to fall apart. Overall the film logic seems to be one of a nightmare an openended metaphor dealing with one man's fear of fatherhood.Put simply there is no other film like it. Not even Lynch's later work can compare. This is on the mustsee list for any film student however it may be annoying and make absolutely no sense to the casual viewer.".

	schema:headline " This is a movie that REALLY stands out. A little too much.";
	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't help but think one thing while watching this movie so... this is where Tim Burton got his influence. I've seen all kinds of movies some I thought were brilliant some overly pretentious. Eraserhead though brilliantly directed lacks a lot of support and relevance and overtly attempts to be deeply symbolic. I remember when I enjoyed creepy characters and random disturbing scenes but this film seemingly dumbs down the audience in an almost conscious manner.The story centers around Henry Spencer Jack Nence who lives in a world that either resembles a nightmare or a different dimension. His days revolve around walking around his industrial town and sitting in his small quiet apartment suspiciously observing every angle as if he's never been there. He's told that his girlfriend ? awaits him at her house for dinner and with hesitation he joins her again in an awkward suspicious way. The girlfriend named Mary X Charlotte Stewart lives with her parents and grandmother who follow lifestyles of some impulsive serial killers. After Henry finds out that he and girlfriend Mary X have a premature baby he falls head first into a world of mayhem delusion and sexual provisions. His girlfriend gives birth to a mutant baby and leaves him to take care of it by himself.Eraserhead is really unique but overstylized and pretentiously dangerous. In the world we live in today an audience will fall in love with any movie that has some level of cult status. While I'll agree that the directing is superb especially on such a low budget the story itself lacks any drive. Albeit the movie has a massive creepy feel to it from the subtle build up of bizarre sound effects to the sinisterlike score it leaves you empty and cold asking yourself what you had just seen. I've never been one to hold a good deep screenplay that leaves you thinking for hours against the movie but in this case there's just way too much false instinctiveness.The mutant baby is a motif that the movie attempts to force in order for us to feel scared and shocked. And in the center of it all the baby looks more like a dinosaur than a disfigured dreamlike figure. Then there's the creepy girl who sings a song about life in heaven which Henry listens to for comfort. Her presence is almost unnecessary and oblique making you tilt your head back more asking why? is this a film that observes the life of one man? Did he suffer from a traumatic experience? We don't know and directorwriter David Lynch seems to think we don't care. The movie opens up with a scene of what seems to be an asteroid and an overlapping image of Henry floating around. He then wakes up on the road and sets out in Chaplinlike posture passing and dismissing anything out of the ordinary. In one scene he invites his next door neighbor in and lets her seduce him into sleeping with her. They then end up in Henry's bed falling deep into what seems to be water. A pretentious goof might say it's an excellent way of showing sexual desire and an atmosphere that seems to give Henry the relaxing feeling he's always wanted. I say it's the first thing that popped into Lynch's head.Half way through I looked at my watch asking if it'll be over soon. Really you don't have to watch the rest to get the basic idea of the whole thing. However I stuck around for the beautiful cinematography and excellent underrated directing. Lynch uses his camera and works with it like an Axe murderer would with a good victim. He separates reality with nondiegetic sound that the main character can actually hear and really knows how to handle the framing in each shot.I watched the extra features and David Lynch put into words what I thought was a true representation of this film I have no idea how the idea came to me or when it came to me. How could you? It's completely random and spontaneous. It also suffers from a weak ending Henry gives up and murders his baby only to see the little asteroid  or his shell of life  burst and explode leaving him to go into heaven with the strange buttface girl who sings in his radiator. Well problem solved kill the itch and join peace for eternity. I think that's the idea the movie was conveying. As for the title itself it's really pretty interesting. Eraserhead refers to the term 'erase your head' which means to get rid of any awareness or consciousness of what you're doing. Something Lynch must have done when he was writing the script.".

For most part of the film centres in one room and on two things the main protagonist and a very unusual looking baby. There is little dialogue no plot or story or character development. My imagination was put into overdrive working out the scenes any metaphors whether the story took place in the past future some parallel universe or the warped mind of the protagonist of the film. Not a lot is given away. Eraserhead is abstract art in black  white. This may have worked in 1977 but now it feels very dated not the least bit frightening way too long and I am afraid boring.".

Especially when you or rather David Lynch refuses to even remotely explain the movie. I guess that sense of mystery and interpretation may have some appeal to others but to me this is hands down the worst film I have ever seen. I don't mean I dislike it. I mean it is LITERALLY at the bottom of the list of movies I've seen. To elaborate a bit I've looked up several interpretations of the film and not a single one of them made the movie any better for me.";

This uniquely unsettling film tells the bizarre story of Henry a man living in an industrial area who is left with a mutated child to look after.My interpretation of the film is that it is about the psychological struggle of raising a premature child and fear of parenthood. The plot itself doesn't particularly develop very much instead making way for unnervingly surreal moments that will leave first time viewers like myself scratching our heads.Some key wtf moments include the lady in the radiator the pencils made of human skull the dancing roast chicken that shts black liquid and literally every scene with the underdeveloped baby in it.The Audio for the film is enough to turn anyone insane. The sounds recorded are basically a collection of extremely unpleasant sounds from a babies never ending cries to that disgusting sound your eye some times makes when you rub it. This is great at further emphasising the grotesque nature of this film but it will drive many viewers crazy.The acting is weird Henry looks worried and his wife cries start to finish. I'm not sure if the acting is bad or intentionally robotic to create further unease and make every situation incredibly awkward. I'm going to assume the latter.I really do not know what to think of this film other than it disturbing but also so wtf its hilarious. This is definitely a film you will need to see more than once to understand. But what I do know is that is a unique film with an extremely niche audience all put together by one of cinemas most creative directors David Lynch".

His life takes a turn for the worse when his girlfriend gives birth to a mutant child. Unable to cope she leaves Henry with the baby where slowly his sanity starts to break down. While Eraserhead may have a plot the story is unimportant it's about the atmosphere and the feelings and emotions it conveys. Dialogue is sparse but expressionism is rife much like the old silent films. Moreover the line between reality and surrealism is blurred with the film often being punctuated with classic Lynchian dream sequences.It is important to realise that Eraserhead is not meant to be entertainment. In his debut Lynch creates a nightmare one that is disturbing eerie and haunting. Eccentricity pulses through it whether it be Henry's hairstyle or the fact that it is filmed in black and white detaching it from the real world even further. As a film in technical terms especially considering that it was made in the 70s over the course of five years Eraserhead is flawless. While one can argue that it has dated and that it may look cheap it hasn't at all retaining the same effect that it did thirty years ago. The mystique and horror does not fade and it remains as hardhitting as ever influencing later classics such as the Elephant Man also Lynch.A truly timeless film accomplished beautiful pure and horrific.

	schema:reviewBody "E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heartbreakingly sad yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heartwrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up and my memories are my own but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again when riding my bike was a pleasure Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year going to the movies was an adventure and looking up at the stars could be a mindblowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL.".

Only four or five movies have made me cry much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving.

The score was good the costumes were perfectly designed everyone was cast perfectly and the direction was flawless. In conclusion I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it.

The ability of this film to pull emotions out of you is unlike most films we see today.As many of the users have said this is a film made for children and it achieves this brilliantly.I do feel as well that it targets adults returnign them to their innocence. The time of our lives when mothing was impossible and everything had goodness in it.  In modern times it is all too often seen that children are desperate to become adults and lose their innocence far too quickly. This story in which S.S developed helps adults to return to that time.I would give this film 1110.

	schema:headline " One of the best films ever made and experienced";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone gets lost in nostalgia from time to time.  Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood Raiders of the Lost Ark Star Wars Ghostbusters The Goonies Back To The Future and of course E.T.Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however because it is an experience that just gets better with age.There was a theater in Windsor Ontario where I spent my youth called the Vanity located on Oullette Street right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which predated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.When the sequel to Star Wars arrived the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.When you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the ATeam and Conan the Barbarian with you you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the The Tripping Game therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.E.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its rerelease in 1985 bought the poster purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to snicker snicker Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this  along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws  had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.As the years passed I became a film lover a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an afterthought it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T. it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscarathon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change the more they stay the same.Seeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.I think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T. that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list E.T. would be number 2 right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK Halloween American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.If you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985 please I urge you go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.10 out of 10What more can be said?".

The brilliantly innovative shots mixed with John William's epic score makes for a masterpiece which E.T. certainly is. The underlying theme of science vs. religion is also what makes the film great. All of these things mesh together to form the film that touched millions of people around the world. Everything about this film is great. Steven Spielberg pulls off some legendary shots and the acting from the children is excellent. It makes the film truly real. Henry Thomas as Elliot is great. Drew Barrymoore is so cute throughout he whole film and she captures the audience every time she appears on screen. Peter Coyote does great with the minimal screen time they chose to give him. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time.

Possibly his finest film E.T. captures a piece of childhood and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past. It excites a story adults often forget and a powerful remembrance of a childhood friendship during difficult periods of development. Adult criticism of the movie loses its youthful bond and fails to appreciate growing up in the 80's. This is the pinnacle of Spielberg's childhood movies. Few other films capture as powerful a message of childhood emotion. Other films which attempt to do so dive so deep into childhood memories they lose their connection with adults and degrade to brief interludes of dumb comic relief to keep grown ups from falling asleep. The closest runner up is likely Goonies a film written by Spielberg. A very personal film for Spielberg as he explores atypical friendships after the separation of his father he should be commended for achieving such a remarkable success and for sharing it with the rest of us. I was five when I first saw the movie and although it frightened me at the time it still makes me cry. An unparalleled film in its class it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film adjusted for inflation third otherwise seventeen years after its release.

Next to The day the earth stood still ET ranks as my favorite scifi film of all time. The newly inhanced version is excellent too.  Henry Thomas is delightful and the middle child Elliott who find and befriends ET. He is not too cutebut gives a terrific performanceespecially when ET telepathically makes him drunk.The end of the movie still makes me crymaybe not a whole box of tissues worth by nowbut there is just something about ET and Elliott's good bye that tears me up.The two principle adults Dee WallaceStone and Peter Coyote are good too.  Coyote who is only known as Keys is in some respects almost as innocent as Elliott and you wish that he had been able to have more contact with ET.  Although the scenes where the house is being sealed off is frightening it still works. The scene where Elliot and his brother steal the van is priceless when older brother comes out with the memorable line I've never driven forward before! I am planning to buy this on DVD as soon as possible.  ETyou can phone my home or visit any time".

	schema:headline " Not as good as you've heard";
	schema:reviewBody "No it's not a poor movie but a 7.9 is a very generous rating likely helped by its massive box office and a fair amount of nostalgia. I watched this the other day for the first time since the 80's and was surprised at how trite it was. A 5 or 6 at best. A few things that stood out to me 1 Child actors  All I could think of was The Phantom Menace and how it's always a big risk to cast a young unproven kid as a main character. Henry Thomas as Elliott wasn't quite as painful as Jake Lloyd but he still wasn't that good. Far too many of his lines were delivered with a grating screech. Drew Barrymore wasn't too cloying as the cutsie li'l girl but the combination of she or the two boys being in each and every scene meant we never got a break from child actors. There wasn't anyone in this movie who gave an outstanding  or even above average  performance. 2 The connection between Elliott and E.T  What are the rules regarding this connection? How come sometimes Elliott is completely in synch with E.T. but other times they're feeling things separately? And why would E.T. do that to Elliott in the first place? What purpose did it serve to make a young boy who's trying to help him suffer? His brother later says that Elliott feels his E.T.'s feelings? To what end? And why does this empathy come and go? Had Elliott been heretofore unable to feel emotions? Is that what E.T. was trying to teach him? We're never given any insight on Elliott prior to E.T.'s arrival so anything about Elliott's background is just conjecture. 3 E.T.'s intelligence  Why does a member of a race that's conquered interstellar travel act like such a simp? He can build a MacGyverlike contraption to send signals into space but he still doesn't know better than to pop a metal toy in his mouth and start chewing it? He springs out of his body bag and starts babbling phone home phone home to the point that he has to be shushed by a 10 year old kid. That's a horrible inconsistency that can only be explained away with a huge leap of logic. 4 The sets and scenery  Fans of MST3K will remember episode 303 Pod People which was an early 80's E.T. knockoff. When I watched the original again it was almost like the makers of Pod People were intentionally taking the mick out of E.T. All the jokes about the fog machines from that episode of MST3K could apply to E.T. Southern California is an arid climate all of the day shots feature bright blue skies yet each night the pavement is soaked as if it stopped raining just a minute ago while the air is thick with moisture. There were frequent lapses in continuity when it came to cloud cover and daylight. The worst is when the boys are taking E.T. to the rendezvous with his space ship. As they break the police blockade it's broad daylight suddenly the sun is red and setting and what was likely a couple minutes later they're in the woods at night  although when the ship takes off it's dusk again. The ship rises into a beautifully clear evening with no breeze visible in the tree tops but back in the woods everyone's again shrouded in mist and what appears to be a stiff wind is blowing everyone's hair. Seriously Pod People wasn't half as ridiculous about these things. Then there's all the indoor shots at Elliott's house. You never see a shade covering the windows only Venetian blinds. Yet even in the middle of the sunniest day the inside of the house is dark as pitch necessitating the use of lamps. The deleted scene of E.T. in the bath tub is illustrative of this. Since you get no context for the shot I assumed it was supposed to be night time given how dark the house was yet Elliott's mom calls from work to see how he's feeling! Never does anyone mention that hiding E.T. from prying eyes is a concern. On Halloween Mary is coming down the hallway to take their picture and it's as dark as can be with candles lit. But then they go outside and it's still daylight. All the indoor shots were so obviously shot on a stage that it comes off like a cutrate soap opera. 5 A couple other random questions  How did E.T. know a ship was coming for him? Telepathically? If they were able to communicate that way then why did he have to rig up the phone and call them? Why did that one kid have a balaclava on him during a typically gorgeous SoCal afternoon? How come when E.T. first enters Elliott's room he is reaching over his head to touch the objects on the table yet the next morning he's tall enough to see what's on the table and no his neck wasn't extended.? Why was Mary wearing a satin bathrobe in front of teenage boys in the beginning of the movie like some sort of temptress? Then she's an anguished divorce. Then she's an independent career woman. Then she's ditzy and perhaps tipsy on Halloween. It just seems like there was never an agreed upon direction for her character. E.T. can make objects  including the bike he's riding on  levitate but the boys have to lift him into the bike's basket?? I don't dislike the movie. I was 11 when it came out and probably liked it a lot then. As I said there's still a nostalgia factor in its favor. I just can't buy into the idea that it's a well done film.".

I watched this the other day for the first time since the 80's and was surprised at how trite it was. A 5 or 6 at best. A few things that stood out to me 1 Child actors  All I could think of was The Phantom Menace and how it's always a big risk to cast a young unproven kid as a main character. Henry Thomas as Elliott wasn't quite as painful as Jake Lloyd but he still wasn't that good. Far too many of his lines were delivered with a grating screech. Drew Barrymore wasn't too cloying as the cutsie li'l girl but the combination of she or the two boys being in each and every scene meant we never got a break from child actors. There wasn't anyone in this movie who gave an outstanding  or even above average  performance. 2 The connection between Elliott and E.T  What are the rules regarding this connection? How come sometimes Elliott is completely in synch with E.T. but other times they're feeling things separately? And why would E.T. do that to Elliott in the first place? What purpose did it serve to make a young boy who's trying to help him suffer? His brother later says that Elliott feels his E.T.'s feelings? To what end? And why does this empathy come and go? Had Elliott been heretofore unable to feel emotions? Is that what E.T. was trying to teach him? We're never given any insight on Elliott prior to E.T.'s arrival so anything about Elliott's background is just conjecture. 3 E.T.'s intelligence  Why does a member of a race that's conquered interstellar travel act like such a simp? He can build a MacGyverlike contraption to send signals into space but he still doesn't know better than to pop a metal toy in his mouth and start chewing it? He springs out of his body bag and starts babbling phone home phone home to the point that he has to be shushed by a 10 year old kid. That's a horrible inconsistency that can only be explained away with a huge leap of logic. 4 The sets and scenery  Fans of MST3K will remember episode 303 Pod People which was an early 80's E.T. knockoff. When I watched the original again it was almost like the makers of Pod People were intentionally taking the mick out of E.T. All the jokes about the fog machines from that episode of MST3K could apply to E.T. Southern California is an arid climate all of the day shots feature bright blue skies yet each night the pavement is soaked as if it stopped raining just a minute ago while the air is thick with moisture. There were frequent lapses in continuity when it came to cloud cover and daylight. The worst is when the boys are taking E.T. to the rendezvous with his space ship. As they break the police blockade it's broad daylight suddenly the sun is red and setting and what was likely a couple minutes later they're in the woods at night  although when the ship takes off it's dusk again. The ship rises into a beautifully clear evening with no breeze visible in the tree tops but back in the woods everyone's again shrouded in mist and what appears to be a stiff wind is blowing everyone's hair. Seriously Pod People wasn't half as ridiculous about these things. Then there's all the indoor shots at Elliott's house. You never see a shade covering the windows only Venetian blinds. Yet even in the middle of the sunniest day the inside of the house is dark as pitch necessitating the use of lamps. The deleted scene of E.T. in the bath tub is illustrative of this. Since you get no context for the shot I assumed it was supposed to be night time given how dark the house was yet Elliott's mom calls from work to see how he's feeling! Never does anyone mention that hiding E.T. from prying eyes is a concern. On Halloween Mary is coming down the hallway to take their picture and it's as dark as can be with candles lit. But then they go outside and it's still daylight. All the indoor shots were so obviously shot on a stage that it comes off like a cutrate soap opera. 5 A couple other random questions  How did E.T. know a ship was coming for him? Telepathically? If they were able to communicate that way then why did he have to rig up the phone and call them? Why did that one kid have a balaclava on him during a typically gorgeous SoCal afternoon? How come when E.T. first enters Elliott's room he is reaching over his head to touch the objects on the table yet the next morning he's tall enough to see what's on the table and no his neck wasn't extended.? Why was Mary wearing a satin bathrobe in front of teenage boys in the beginning of the movie like some sort of temptress? Then she's an anguished divorce. Then she's an independent career woman. Then she's ditzy and perhaps tipsy on Halloween. It just seems like there was never an agreed upon direction for her character. E.T. can make objects  including the bike he's riding on  levitate but the boys have to lift him into the bike's basket?? I don't dislike the movie. I was 11 when it came out and probably liked it a lot then. As I said there's still a nostalgia factor in its favor. I just can't buy into the idea that it's a well done film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie made my heart glad.  Roger Ebert film critic and gourmet.They say that the path to a fat man's heart goes through his oversized belly but sometimes the digested waste product of one called Spielberg can achieve the same result.When I was a kid I wanted to take a whiff of Spielberg's brown monster as much as the next kid. And I wasn't disappointed. I was only a clueless little brat at the time what the hell did I know about cheesy Hollywood manipulation that makes you close your eyes and nose to the nonsense that surrounds the story of Spielberg's brown monster? However many years later and I discover that it's not all that it's CRACKed up to be. Plenty of stained holes in the script and near every hole there's SBM sitting like the badly choreographed creature that it always was. A dumb kid called Elliott discovers SBM and goes all gooey and sentimental in no time. I didn't get it this time around why would anyone in their right mind want to go anywhere near this film? It has a stench not unlike that of an overcrowded pigsty.The main culprit for the bad taste left in my mouth after taking a sample of Spielberg's brown monster was not the midgety dinosaur himself. It was the annoying kids and the retarded clichs. First we have Drew Barrymore whose facial asymmetry was apparent as early as 1982. Think about it. And then think about what it means to be nepotistic offspring in Hollywood it opens doors even for the least talented and least goodlooking among us. Spielberg who fathered the brown monster in one of his lessthaninspired bathroom moments is also Drew's godfather. Not to mention all those relatives of hers all infamous for their shoddy Bmovie starring roles. All in the family... But I'm sure that Drew will always look back at this movie with fondness knowing that it was E.T. that launched her nose into the seductive world of cocaine.So Elliott discovers SBM invites it to his home hides it from his parents instead of flushing it like any normal boy would and then the evil adults and the government's wicked knifehappy scientists kidnap SBM from right under his nose hoping to analprobe SBM as soon as possible. What exactly they'd hoped to find in SBM is beyond me. Clues to the director's digestive system? Judging from ET the maker of Jaws ate some rather strange foods in the early 80s...I will never understand the ageold movie clich of the sniphappy scientists raring to have a stab at the noble alien creature as if killing a oneofakind specimen made any sense to even the most deranged sociopath let alone an intelligent scientist.The other pathetic clich is all of the kids being wise and good the adults stupid and evil. Well if that's the case then why don't we put the little ones in charge of Wall Street and the economy? I think we should start by appointing Spielberg's own brood to run the White House... I do not doubt for a second that this would lead to a Utopic future society of almost Spielbergian proportions.The creature which looks a little like Snoopy...  Roger Ebert film critic and dog expert.I've read my share of Peanuts comics but struggle to find any character there that even vaguely resembles the monster. But then again Ebert also called this movie scary so why wonder...Yes and why wonder that Spielberg of all people should create such a brown monster. After all he once told Barbra Streisand that Yentl was the best movie he'd seen since Citizen Kane.".

It might have made even more if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of people including myself hadn't watched it on pirate video in 1983 . In truth I don't think it deserved to set the universe alight because of its premise ET starts with a spaceship landing in a desolate woodland one dark night . Now spaceships landing in desolate woodlands on a dark night mean only one thing  if you've seen an episode of THE OUTER LIMITS or DOCTOR WHO or UFO it means trouble for humanity with the human race losing some brave warriors at the very least . You see the problem ? The narrative has just started and already we know nothing horrible is going to happen . This is not what alien landings are about  there not about monsters with extendable necks being vulnarable  They're about carnage  gunfire  explosions and lines like  We can't hold them sir  If anyone thinks I'm missing the point let me say this Spielberg's first movie was a pseudo horror movie called DUEL a fairly effective thriller  Casting aside  about a man driving through desert wilderness . Spielberg then made SOMETHING EVIL a chilling horror film and then made JAWS another legendary quasi horror movie with a monster that exits in reality a great white shark . JURASSIC PARK is to all intents a horror movie  and I bet the upcoming WAR OF THE WORLDS will get a few pulses racing . In other words Spielberg despite his flaws can make an audiences heart leap out of their mouth but his main flaw is that he all too easily drowns an audience in gooey sentimentality . THE TERMINAL suffered from this and so did parts of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  and without doubt ET is the best example of Spielberg's sugary sentiment suffocating a story  not that there was much of a story to start with . And I haven't even mentioned the all American kids or the ridiculous flying bikes sequence or the terrible John Williams score . The only significance ET has in my life is that it introduced me to the words  Geek   Wimp  and  Doucebag  and that I had to watch nearly every scifi movie of the mid to late 1980s revolve around a plot of a cute alien being adopted by a child .

A much better film cinematographically is his previous one War of the Worlds. I like its dark grainy atmosphere. His films are all variations on the story of paternity rediscovered his big obsession. The tragedy of Spielberg is that he's much closer to what we call art when he's doing what he probably thinks are commercial projects.  Slavoj ZizekFilm is my drug and every few months I need a new fix.  Steven SpielbergDirected by Steven Spielberg ET the Extraterrestrial stars Henry Thomas as Elliot a kid living in suburban California. As his parents have separated Elliot's a bit depressed. Thankfully Elliot befriends a small alien creature whom he dubs 'ET'. Like Elliot ET's name starts with an E and ends with a T. More importantly ET's also been abandoned by his parents. This separation leads to ET's body becoming pale and sickly. ET eventually dies but is magically resurrected when his parents return. ET phone home! ET triumphantly says. The message is clear. For Spielberg himself the son of divorced parents the family unit has the power to heal and nourish.The motif running through all of Spielberg's key films is that of the recovery of the father figure. In ET both Elliot and the alien are abandoned by their fathers. Empire of the Sun Hook AI Minority Report Catch Me If You Can Indiana Jones and War of The Worlds likewise all focus on parental abandonment. Jurassic Park itself begins with child hating archaeologist Dr Alan Grant threatening kids with a raptor bone a symbol of the paternal superego. Only later in a very brief scene does Grant throw away this bone. At this point he suddenly becomes a father and reconciles with the children. As he nestles in a tree cradling the sleeping kids in his arms the predatory dinosaurs of the night slowly morph into benevolent herbivores the following morning.Philosopher Slavoj Zizek would himself call Schindler's List an ugly remake of Jurassic Park with the Nazis as the dinosaur monsters Schindler as the cynicalprofiteering and opportunistic parental figure and the infantilized ghetto Jews as threatened children. The story the film tells is not about the Holocaust but about Schindler's gradual rediscovery of his paternal duty towards the Jews. His transformation into a caring and responsible father echoes Sam Neil's character arc in Jurassic Park.The same story is repeated in Duel in which a weak and effeminate father must battle demon trucks in order to assert his masculinity and reclaim his marriage and again in The War of the Worlds in which Tom Cruise plays a divorced working class father who neglects his two children. The invasion of the aliens reawakens in him the proper paternal instincts resulting in him rediscovering himself as a caring father. In the final scene he finally gets recognition from his son who throughout the film despised him. So at their core Spielberg's films are all the story of a divorced or working class father who strives to regain the respect of his children. Sometimes this tale is told from the perspective of the child sometimes it is told from the perspective of the adult. In each case it's the same story.Mostly though Spielberg's cinema is a cinema of trauma avoidance. The reason's for Daddy or statenationleader being a jerk are suppressed and the crisis of masculinity is repaired or avoided via Daddy's battles with fantasy monsters nazis sharks dinosaurs trucks etc. In short power and patriarchy are rehabilitated via fantasy.One can see similar trauma avoidance in ET a film which posits fantasy as an imagined escape from pain. In the film Elliott's broken family is not in any real sense repaired or its brokenness even explored as a truly solvable emotional problem. Instead the film uses aliens to provide a false emotional closure. In ET the little alien becomes a mediator who provides a substitute father only to disappear and go home once Elliot's mother embraces the good scientist and new father? in the final shot. As Spielberg's art is always about avoidance and not confrontation daddy's absence is never resolved or investigated and so his creepy rehabilitation must be repeated over and over again from one film to the next. Whether it be young Elliot in ET or Chris Bale in Empire of the Sun Spielberg's fantasies palliate traumatic human experiences divorce war slavery terrorism Holocaust etc by offering viewers the film's imaginative plenitude as a compensation for its characters' emotional losses. But despite all this almost everything in ET works. The film oozes raw naked emotions and never pretends to offer anything other than a child's kneehigh perspective which Spielberg's shooting strategy reinforces. Autobiographical to the core the film perfectly reflects its author a man who has made a career of avoiding painful truths by indulging in fantasy. It's once these personality traits are married to external issues Munich Amistad Ryan etc that you get profoundly untruthful junk.810  Would spawn a whole genre of suburban kids' adventures.".

Everything you could want in a good family Spielberg movie is in E.T. There's great acting smart writing beautiful use of cinematography good lighting with Spielberg's famous shadow work an amazing musical score by John Williams and of course there is plenty of memorable moments and what is often referred to today as the Spielberg magic. The whole movie is a masterpiece but I did find a few flaws that I tried to overlook but couldn't because they just brought down my enjoyment of the film too much. The first few minutes of the movie are really slow. There isn't dialogue for at least about five minutes in the film. Many people would say that that's a certain style that benefits the film. I wanted the movie to get to the point a little bit quicker and I think the slightly longer exposition didn't help. There were a few other knitpicks here and there but I won't get too deep into that.".

	schema:reviewBody "E.T. The ExtraTerrestrial Steven Spielberg's timeless ode to all the loners of the world finds him at his most pure. The storyline of E.T. is a relatively simple one Tenyearold Elliott Henry Thomas who never resorts to that ohlookathowpreciousIam shtick but makes you root for him through his incredible performance who lives with his mom and two siblings meets a wizened little geezer who turns out to be a visitor from another planet. E.T. owing to his overtly curious streak is abandoned by his potbellied otherworldly pals as he misses his ride back home. He now has to cope on Earth until they can come back and rescue him. Being a friendly extraterrestrial ambassador Elliott and E.T. soon form a special bond and Elliott with help from his siblings helps E.T. find a way home. And soon the magic unfolds! Along the way there are moments of humor as E.T. makes discoveries about this world and the children learn things about him moments of sadness when E.T. becomes deathly ill and is captured by the scientists and a thrilling chase sequence that will have you cheering along. When Elliott and his friends soar on their bicycles against a gigantic moon it's as touching and noteperfect a moment as any in the movies. Spielberg's 'lovablespacecreatureslumsitinsuburbia' movie is one of the greatest achievements in imagination ever put on film. The simplicity of the narrative and the ingeniousness of the E.T. character create a powerful combination. The genius and wonder of E.T. is that Spielberg creates a character that is obviously not real. However he draws the audience in so well that you care for him as much as you do for the children. What the movie does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away. This is a wondrous evocation of that time in our lives when brothers and sisters were necessary coconspirators bikes were our ticket to freedom and we were willing to believe that a friendly little alien could really appear from the backyard shed. While doing so Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us never failing to strum the heartstrings. Many have hailed E.T. as a bonafide scifi classic. For me it is a heart and soul movie that just happens to have a scifi angle. And you know what? You're sure going to need a box of tissues!".

At its best it invokes Frank Capra's classic films on politics including Meet John Doe and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It never reaches their level though and that failure to hit the top is a bit frustrating.An older dumpier and shabbier Kevin Costner is the best part of the film. Costner is a star and that shows here. Even the grunge that is his costume in almost every scene can't disguise his charisma. Costner's voice has not aged and he uses it to great effect especially in a final speech.The film draws laughs by parodying our two major political parties with a Democratic presidential candidate starring in the funniest antiabortion TV commercial ever made no doubt its competition was slim but it is very funny and a Republican presidential candidate touting his party's tender concern for the environment.These excellent scenes make you wish that the movie had gone deeper. It doesn't though. It veers off into deadend soap opera subplots about Costner's daughter's boyfriend from school and her attempt to live with her estranged mother Mare Winningham in a role that should have ended up on the editing room floor as it contributes nothing to the film. The casting wasn't great. The two presidential candidates and their aids end up being cardboard cutout stereotypes of Machiavellian evil Stanley Tucci and compromise Nathan Lane. Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper as the candidates never transcend their Frasier and Easy Rider personas. Other actors perhaps unknowns should have been cast in these two key roles.Paula Patton the woman who played what would have been the Barbara Stanwyck role in the Frank Capra movie was pretty as a little doll and a complete bore. This is part of a pattern in today's Hollywood female leads must have the perfectly perky looks of a plastic doll there's no need for them to be talented. Male leads like Costner can be beatup and slovenly but must be talented. Patton's role that of the desperate sharp female reporter who gains inside knowledge of a national story is underwritten and she does nothing with it. It's a deadend and that's a shame. It makes me want to rewatch Meet John Doe in which Stanwyck worked so well as the female reporter.Overall though this movie is better than much else at the multiplex and it at least ventures into the world of ideas.".

The kidasparentparentaskid premise wouldn't have worked nearly as well if Costner's character Bud Johnson weren't so darn lovable. If you're looking for perfectly coiffed cleaned up Costner you won't find him here. He mostly looks like your husband first thing in the morning  you know the scruffy hair unshaven face and glazed over halfasleep look where you wonder what you ever saw in him? But inside is a heart of gold? He pulls this role off to perfection. He's the lovable underachiever always with a clueless grin.When the attorney general shows up at his door to tell him basically that he has the deciding vote Bud's only comment in a halfwhisper is Does this mean I'm going to have to do jury duty? The movie is good  in fact if you like Dave with Kevin Kline you'll like Swing Vote.However it tried to combine two movies. One was the comedy with Bud being the ONLY voting demographic needing to be catered to  hence personal appearances by Richard Petty and Willie Nelson  the other was a sometimes hardtowatch story of a daughter played by Madeline Carroll caring for her alcoholic father.Carroll is a wonderful actress and would be stellar in a drama. Her wistful knowing looks at her father's helplessness and her astute understanding of her mother's inability to be a mother were heartwrenching. That could have been an entire story in itself and often took away from the comic elements. Mare Winningham was fantastic as the mother who ran away. She Costner and Carroll really clicked on screen in their one scene together as a family torn apart by the selfish indulgence of the parents to the detriment of the child who deserves more. I marveled at that scene until I remembered that Winningham and Costner were in the movie The War as parents torn apart by Vietnam to the detriment of their son young Elijah Wood. Costner and Winningham should get together again in a more upbeat film. Their relationship is very natural.But in spite of the sad childhavingtobetheadult part of Swing Vote it was 80 comedy and Costner's antics made it laugh out loud funny at times. It didn't seem to be politically bent one way or the other. It was patriotic and commented on immigrants from Mexico taking away jobs from Americans. But it was also proenvironment and touched on lack of health care for the many. The end was pure feelgood. Everyone changed appropriately realizing the true Hollywood meaning of voting in America.".

	schema:reviewBody "My son tells me that I don't understand what young people think is funny. And he's right. I'm not into cringe comedies like Borat or teen sex comedies like Superbad. So when I give Swing Vote 9 out of 10 I guess I have to limit my recommendation to those over 50. If you're too young to remember Kevin Costner's last great movie I'm not so sure you'll like this one. You see no one gets humiliated and you don't hear any jokes about sex or bodily functions. It's an oldfashioned comedy that my wife my cousin and I all near 60 loved. If you are in that age range ignore the critics and the IMDb rating. We laughed all the way through. The editing is fast paced so that you never get bored. Some critics have criticized Swing Vote for being lightweight but it is really more dramedy than straight comedy. There are several serious themes including divorce and civic responsibility. This is Costner's best performance in many years. And Madeline Carroll who plays his daughter is amazing. Watch out Dakota Fanning and Abigail Breslin. This girl can play comedy and drama with equal aplomb. The scene where she cries in front of her class brought many to tears in our audience.".

So when I give Swing Vote 9 out of 10 I guess I have to limit my recommendation to those over 50. If you're too young to remember Kevin Costner's last great movie I'm not so sure you'll like this one. You see no one gets humiliated and you don't hear any jokes about sex or bodily functions.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes the whole concept is absurd and as a result the film will probably take a lot of criticism but I really enjoyed every minute of it at an early screening this evening. I enjoy Kevin Costner's work except when he tries to go action hero and he is thankfully getting too old for that unless he decides to buy growth hormone from Stallone or something. He was terrific in Mr. Brooks and he excels once again in a totally different role. It is the sort of character that he does best more akin to his Bull Durham role.The real find of the film was Madeline Carrol who played his daughter. She joins Abagail Breslin Dakota Fanning  and Anna Sophia Robb in a current crop of extremely talented tweeners.I enjoyed the entire cast and it was great to see Judge Reinhold for the first time in awhile.The whole concept of how Costner's vote becomes so important is one that is hard to swallow but if you go along for the ride I promise that you will have a great time.Late in the film Mare Winningham appears in perhaps the films most powerful though least appropriate scene. It is her only scene. I believe it was used to hammer in a serious message though the scene had little to do with the message of the film other than shift to a more sober mood. Sober may not have been the best choice of words to describe the scene though.One of the nicer aspects of the film is its terrific music. A mix of tunes from several decades centered around Marshall Tucker's Can't You See really makes for a nice soundtrack.Ultimately the film has a great message about the importance of one person one vote. And if it gets a lot more democratswhoops I mean Americans to vote this year then in my opinion it will have done a great public service in addition to being solidly entertaining. And no it does not have a liberal agenda so all you Rush fans need to hold judgment before slamming the film. Unlike this reviewer the film is really good at not taking a political stance. The film depicts all politicians as if they would stoop to anything to get elected and garners a lot of laughs with that premise.I want to add one last thing. I would call this a family movie except for the profanity. I took my 9 year old precocious daughter and she loved it but there was actually a running joke about Costner's character's love of swearing. So if a little swearing and some references to controversial issues abortion gay marriage legal pot are OK with you bring the kids. Like I said it does have a good message.".

But Swing Vote has a great time using that as a platform to tell a really cool tale.Besides the movie wants to move past that impossibility anyway suspension of disbelief right? and into the fun stuff. Swing Vote isn't necessarily about the likelihood of the abovementioned phenomenon occurring it's about bigger things things like the nature of freedom in America the right to vote politicians and their campaigns and various issues that unite and divide America as a nation.Ernest Bud Johnson Kevin Costner is a beerdrinking bluecollar simpleton whose wife left both him and his daughter Molly for a Nashville singing career. Molly Madeline Carroll a precocious little girl who is passionate about politics and the preservation of her country and unfortunately for her Bud couldn't care less even if her were sober. Molly seems to be the parent in the relationship taking care of Bud's daily hangovers and prodding him to get up for work.Molly is in constant frustration with her father's apathy toward life and her interests and is perturbed when Bud seemingly sets in motion an ironic historymaking turn of events where his vote actually ends up being the deciding factor in the election. This forces the Presidential candidates to campaign only to win Bud's vote. Along the way we are treated to a satirical look at the lengths campaign managers and the candidates will go simply to get a vote.How this plays out is both hilarious and sobering as well as inspiring and totally enjoyablethanks to some good storytelling and direction as well as an excellent cast of talented actors who make this movie shine. The brightest stars on the screen however are Kevin Costner and Madeline Carroll as Bud and Molly. Costner has found a perfect role in the dimwitted Bud and Carroll as Molly is a brilliant young actor whose performance almost brought me to tears at one point.Like I mentioned before though Swing Vote is not a simple voting is your civic duty story. While the importance of voting is emphasized as both a privilege and a blessing in a great country Swing Vote goes over the issues that affect daily life in America and through the story reminds us how we can take some sort of action to better that life.However Swing Vote is careful not to play too much on the emotional arguments regarding various issues like abortion immigration and gay marriage making the movie all the more charming. There are a few emotionally charged scenes in the movie that give weight to the hilarity throughout but within the context of the film the story never speaks in selfrighteousness.At one point Molly makes a simple yet convicting commentary about how much she appreciates her father at a Bring Your Father to School Day. Without giving too much away Molly's emotional message about her father is a hopeful and heartwrenching commentary about the beauty and freedom of America along with the tragic complacency and apathy of its people.And rather than going down the typical Hollywood route and picking a more liberal stance Swing Vote instead manages to poke fun at everyone on both sides of various issues. It carefully gives respect to all Americans while pointing out absurdities in America's political process. Although the mockery is at times absolutely hilarious the film's humor never ventures into the vile and meanspirited. There is purpose behind all the fun and it is carefully crafted into the story with the goal of giving a message of hope and focusing on the hopefully common goal of compassion care peace and freedom to all people to all Americans anyway.In that sense Swing Vote could almost be seen as patriotic even the movie's production design seems to have red white and blue hues throughout. There are many inspiring moments that make you think Wow America is a great country and Shame on me for taking my freedom for granted. Okay well that's a little simplistic but you'll understand what I mean Swing Vote is an American story with a clear and powerful message.It may be convicting in its truthful satire and simple wit but it is also encouraging in that it promotes the hope that we can make a better country by actively changing ourselves and our country and refusing to passively observe our nation's future unfold... not only for us but for generations to come.".

That's the scenario put forth by Swing Vote a political fantasy that will probably be remembered more for launching the career of a talented young actress than for any insight it might offer into the political process.Bud Johnson is a workingclass divorced dad who lives in a brokendown trailer with his bright twelveyearold daughter Molly  a youngster who is as astute and savvy about real world issues and politics as her father is ignorant and apathetic. Through a complicated fluke of fate Bud finds himself in the unenviable position of being the sole swing vote in an otherwise deadlocked presidential contest. Suddenly Bud is living in the glare of the media spotlight besieged by candidates campaign managers handlers celebrities and various special interest groups all vying for his vote.Political satire rarely works on screen for the simple reason that it is either so slanted usually towards the liberal side that it winds up preaching mainly to the converted or it's kept so inoffensive and generic that it loses any edge it might have had and becomes an exercise in watereddown selfcongratulatory Capraesque populism. Swing Vote oddly enough falls into both categories at once  with conservatives likely to view it as little more than a twohour commercial for the Democratic Party or at least the issues they stand for and move on. In strictly cinematic terms Swing Vote cowritten by Jason Richman and Joshua Michael Stern and directed by Stern is really two movies folded into one. The first is a sometimes touching story of a fatherdaughter relationship in which the child is parent to the father. Kevin Costner who pretty much financed the project himself pours on the charm as a boozy irresponsible slacker who's more interested in popping open a beer can and plopping down in front of the TV set than in actively rearing his daughter. Relative newcomer Madeline Carroll is a real find as the nononsense wisebeyondheryears Molly who takes care of her dad and isn't afraid to speak truth to power when the situation calls for it. Whenever the film is concentrating on the interplay between these two characters it hits a responsive chord in the viewer. In fact the scene in which Molly confronts the alcoholic mother who abandoned her wonderfully played by Mare Winningham makes for some genuinely powerful and gripping human drama.Unfortunately the second and much larger portion of the film that is to say the political part doesn't fare nearly so well. Its revelation that politics is a dirty business  i.e. that it often prizes empty platitudes and sound bites over exploring issues of substance and that it appeals to voters' greed fears ignorance and prejudices to win votes  is hardly an earthshattering one at this late stage of the game true though it may be. The film has lots of bigname stars  Kelsey Grammar Dennis Harper Nathan Lane Stanley Tucci George Lopez Judge Reinhold  and a number of actual TV pundits and commentators throwing themselves into their roles with admirable aplomb but the material isn't clever or sharp enough to really deliver the goods. Everyone except for the two main characters is quickly reduced to a type and the attempts at political parody are fairly obvious and lightweight compared to what we find in venues like The Daily Show or The Colbert Report. Swing Vote's clarion call for all individuals to take their responsibility as citizens seriously and to become actively involved in the political process can't help but be uplifting and inspiring especially in a presidential election year. The filmmakers just needed a bolder more sophisticated vehicle from which to sound that call.My advice is to look past all the political nonsense and concentrate on the beautiful performance by the young Ms. Carroll instead  and be present at the birth of a brand new star.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Costner was actually in another decent movie. His last movie I saw Mr. Brooks was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire that tries to be a little funny at times. However the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd but if you can get past that then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.The plot is struggling every day man Bud Johnson just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important.

The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason not told in the movie Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes. I mean how could the votes be even for each side and even if they were very close how many months would it take for all the recounts that would take place. But any way it's up to Bud whom doesn't care about politics. He becomes an instant celebrity and is courted by both candidates. By the end of the film Bud grows an appreciation for the political scene and realizes that it is important to care about social issues.FINAL VERDICT Funnier than I thought and provides a message.

	onyx:emotionText "Kevin Costner was actually in another decent movie. His last movie I saw Mr. Brooks was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire that tries to be a little funny at times. However the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd but if you can get past that then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.The plot is struggling every day man Bud Johnson just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important. But when he doesn't show Molly votes in his place but the power goes out and the vote didn't count. The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason not told in the movie Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes.

I also had a hard time buying his wholesome daughter and after watching her Mom and Dad it becomes impossible to understand how she could turn out that wonderful.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a little gem that absorbs so much of our zeitgeist and angst and turns it into a surprisingly entertaining picture. On the surface it sounds like it should be a stinker yet there are some interesting and touching twists to the plot especially toward the end. Costner plays a Homer Simpson dumbass yet Swing Vote avoids falling into the Dumb and Dumber genre thanks in part to his Lisa Simpson daughter played to perfection by Madeline Carroll and to the genuineness of Costner's performance. It also avoids falling into stereotypes of politicians and their operatives though it sometimes comes close. The candidates at least do have second thoughts and feelings. The screenplay builds characters deftly. The movie is a bit long and slow but to good effect. I am tired of hyper zipping movies. The scenes with Bud and Molly fishing with the President and Bud just sitting outside on chaises need the slow pace to convey atmosphere. And it says that Bud is the sort of guy who just likes to enjoy a quiet life. He isn't a bad guy and in an earlier decade with a better economy might have done just fine as such he represents millions of Americans. The basic premise is more that a little improbable of course of an election decided by one vote. And yet we see stories about this on the local level often enough. It is movie as fable much like the classic Dave a point alluded to by John Debney's score when it echoes the fairytale effects of James Newton Howard's score from Dave. Both are about an everyman who gets to call the shots when he becomes king for a day. We get to imagine ourselves in their shoes. Spoiler alert Swing Vote has a fantastic premise and as such we viewers are treated to the spectacle of seeing how far the writers and director can go out on a limb before it collapses. It never does. We wonder how it will end who Bud will vote for will he get a job will he get the girl? Wisely but sadly they don't take us that far leaving it to the viewer's imagination. It is nice to have an ending that leaves things to think about.There are so many echoes in this movie of life and art particularly the bizarre Dade County endless recounts of the 2000 BushGore election. That was a case of truth being stranger than fiction I still have trouble believing that a U.S. Presidential election was virtually stolen by someone who lost by more than a halfmillion votes.Swing Vote is sort of the Wag the Dog of electoral politics with the transmogrification of reality into PR media reality as every word Bud utters leads to a near instantaneous rewriting of the candidates' positions through television ads addressed to Dear Bud. It also brings to mind The Lathe of Heaven where the character's dreams and wishes instantaneously transform the world. Both Dave and Swing Vote are heirs to the Capra tradition of film populism  and both have a hefty list of reallife cameos.Swing Vote is a reductio ad absurdum of everyday polldriven swingvoter politics to their ultimate absurdity a single voter. It is amusing and frightening. But Molly and reporter Kate Madison save the day by rubbing Bud's nose in the reality of some of the thousands of letters he has received from people who are hurting who care passionately about the issues. Finally Bud takes his responsibility seriously ending the movie on a note of hope. If Bud is the Everyman then what it is saying is that if every voter were to take his responsibility to weigh the issues as seriously perhaps the candidates too would respond with substance. For they and their handlers care but under the imperative to win must cater to an electorate that does not think deeply who like Bud are probably in a beer haze while voting  if they do.Six years on Swing Vote has become a sleeper a potential classic that most viewers have overlooked. I highly recommend it. It's message is as timely as ever. Most of all it is a fun entertaining movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Swing Vote is one of the rarities of the summer season a comedy trying to reach an adult audience. How will it ever make money? There is an election coming up in November usually a dreary time filled with untrustworthy people and empty promises and I'm sure screenwriters Josh Michael Stern and Jason Richman are hoping people are still ready to believe one man can still shake up American politics. Personally I'd like to watch a political movie about a guy who shakes up Washington by coming in with a baseball bat like Morgan Freeman did with the school in Lean on Me but hey you take what you can get. So the question remains can an adult political comedy contend with all the superheroes mummies and teen comedies swirling around movie theaters now? Costner plays Bud a trailer park bum and single father who spends his days in an uninformed drunken stupor. Election day is coming up and he doesn't even know who's running but his daughter Molly Madeline Carroll is very keen on him voting even to the point of submitting the ballot for him herself. Only a problem occurs and Bud suddenly become the deciding vote in the election between republican President Andrew Boone Kelsey Grammar and incumbent democrat Donald Greenleaf Dennis Hopper. It doesn't take long before the small New Mexican town Bud lives in is swarming with reporters including one who actually has integrity and a gorgeous body Paula Patton and the candidates themselves trying to get Bud's vote.Every once in a while a movie comes along that is such a waste of time and talent that it should be put up on charges. Swing Vote is that movie. The circumstances that bring Bud to be the deciding vote are ridiculously contrived but the idea is actually fairly interesting. The execution is anything but though. Bud soon has both politicians changing their views in order to sway him. The conservative switches his view on gay people and the environment the liberal switches his view on deporting illegal immigrants. That's the closest the movie comes to smart political satire and it's really such a lazy simplistic view of politicians selling out that it's the farthest thing from being funny. Their political ads also look intentionally farcical and the whole wink wink vibe just makes them look stupid. The point the movie tries to make that every vote counts is also annoying considering its telling us that uninformed boobs should be voting just like the rest of us. The South Park election episode between the big fat turd and giant douche did a much better job of analyzing the responsibility and education involved in the role of the voters instead of just brow beating them into forced voting.Of course Bud gradually changes his tune by the end of the movie but we know that's the contrived Hollywood ending. The real message here is between the lines who cares if you're an idiot get out and vote. And the other problem with the movie is Bud is clearly an idiot an irresponsible selfish neglectful drunk of a father who is just unlikable in every way despite Costner's best efforts to give him some easygoing charm. Madeline Carroll is given the thankless task of playing a smartass 12 year old a role that usually leads to just a flatout annoying child. The father daughter relationship they create is phony and sentimental and reminded me of any episode of Full House. You would think with a comic cast like Kelsey Grammar Dennis Hopper Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane someone could find a laugh in this movie but this is how bad the script is even they can't find a way to make this funny.Swing Vote held itself out as being a smart political comedy but it doesn't take long to realize that it's actually one of the worst and laziest movies of the year. There isn't a laugh to be had in its entire 1 hour and 40 minutes and what it says about politics and voting are just halfassed clichs.".

Then again it might also have something to do with a critical decision that they made in how to end the movie which is sure to make every single solitary person who watches it throw up their arms in disgust. But the movie is not about who wins the presidency it's about the pure chaos of the American political system and its millions of weaknesses and faults. Sure the premise of a presidential election coming down to a single vote is as preposterous as they come but man if this movie doesn't get you thinking critically about the electoral process then it's safe to assume that probably nothing ever will. Kevin Costner plays Bud an American nobody from New Mexico who has never done anything with his life except have a daughter with a delusional drug addict who thinks she has a big singing career in her near future. He works as an egg inspector at an egg packaging plant and he and his coworkers mourn the loss of their friends' and soon their own jobs to insourcing the process of bringing Mexicans in to take their jobs rather than ship the factory and all those egglaying chickens to Mexico. Bud staggers through life in a drunken daze most of the time routinely letting down his daughter Molly Madeline Carroll who raises him like a child. She gets him out of bed in the morning criticizes his laziness and irresponsibility reminds him to vote because it's part of a school project that she has to do and through sighs of exasperation attempts to keep him at least a little bit in line. And of course it's the only thing in life that she fails at. When Bud gets drunk rather than show up to vote she manages to almost cast his vote herself due to the sleepy voting booth security of beautiful Texico New Mexico which Google Earth has just informed me is a real place. Population 1065.In a clever plot development it turns out that Bud's vote didn't go completely through but it appeared that he was there so he is given another opportunity to cast his vote. Not right away mind you even though he evidently already tried to vote and thus probably had his mind made up. No he is given ten days before he has to vote thus providing plenty of time for a movie to happen.Young Madeline Carroll steals most of the scenes that she's in as Bud's daughter so it's interesting that her character is one of the biggest weak points in the movie the other one being her dad. Bud is supposed to be a typical American but I just saw a drifting drunk who never did anything with his life and never would have had he not been forced to. It's true that the vast majority of Americans live lives that are closer to Bud's than President Boone's Kelsey Grammar but does he have to be a TOTAL loser? How about just making him be a likable regular guy? Like the guy he played in Field of Dreams? When I imagine the average American I imagine something like Ray Kinsella. Although maybe with a slightly smaller house and less whispering from the sky.The other problem is that the screenwriters overshot the character of Molly by about 160 IQ points. So much for the average American right? This girl writes a school essay that doesn't merit a special award from the principal to show her dad it grants her NATIONAL TELEVISED RECOGNITION. But to be honest I had more of a problem with the fact that not only does she wake her deadbeat dad up in the morning so he could take her to school she also treks to the bar and finding him passed out in his truck when he should have been voting she pushes him over and then drives him home herself. She's about 11 years old. But where the movie succeeds is as a scathing revelation about certain realities of the American electoral process such as the electoral college which simplifies the votecounting process even while massively distorting the actual numbers of who voted for who. The whole movie is about how one man's vote really does matter but it leaves you with the feeling that you are supposed to forget that once he votes every single vote in his state for the other candidate WON'T matter anymore because they'll be switched to the other candidate. Isn't it interesting how that works? Can't we just count every single vote and award each candidate one huge number of individual votes? Seems a little more accurate to me.Anyway I do appreciate the way the movie highlights the fact that both sides Republican and Democrat are equally willing to stoop to any level and do absolutely whatever it takes to win and that no one is above hitting below the belt and making hugely unethical decisions. There is a lot that needs to be changed in American politics and even while clearly being based on the Election of 2000 one of the most controversial in American history it calls those things to attention without ever even hinting that either side is right or wrong. The movie insists that America is the greatest country in the world but that in some ways we're doing it all wrong but the fact that a movie like this has the freedom to get made proves that even though we haven't reached a level of pure cohesive harmony underneath all of our imperfections is a clear desire to get there.".

The whole movie is about how one man's vote really does matter but it leaves you with the feeling that you are supposed to forget that once he votes every single vote in his state for the other candidate WON'T matter anymore because they'll be switched to the other candidate. Isn't it interesting how that works? Can't we just count every single vote and award each candidate one huge number of individual votes? Seems a little more accurate to me.Anyway I do appreciate the way the movie highlights the fact that both sides Republican and Democrat are equally willing to stoop to any level and do absolutely whatever it takes to win and that no one is above hitting below the belt and making hugely unethical decisions. There is a lot that needs to be changed in American politics and even while clearly being based on the Election of 2000 one of the most controversial in American history it calls those things to attention without ever even hinting that either side is right or wrong. The movie insists that America is the greatest country in the world but that in some ways we're doing it all wrong but the fact that a movie like this has the freedom to get made proves that even though we haven't reached a level of pure cohesive harmony underneath all of our imperfections is a clear desire to get there.";

I liked the movie already given it's realism. A few lazy guy jokes later it gets into the plot. The election is close. Not by distance it's election DAY. But both candidates are very much at 5050.The protagonist Bud doesn't want to vote. His daughter sneaks past a sleepy poll booth guy and votes for him. A malfunction occurs when the power is cut. She sneaks out with the stub. She WALKS to the bar and DRIVES a TRUCK home. She's like 11. But whatever she's semiintelligent. But the movie doesn't even try to explain how she manages it. The next day the error is detected and some officials are sent to Bud and give him 10 days to vote again.It's kind of hinted at Bud tells this officials Why can't I just... whisper it to you...? so he can get on with his life. No that would be TOO simple wouldn't it? So ten days it is.Cue presidential managers the driving force behind both platforms. The movie doesn't exactly fall flat from here but it's a bit predictable that it soon will. It's them that really make the presidents look like jackasses.On various occasions the presidents appeal to Bud's simplistic good nature to get his vote. It's a humorous process seeing a republican promising gay rights and a democrat giving a proLife campaign.Cue sad part. The daughter falls out with her father. She finds her boyfriend same age ALSO manages to drive a truck down a highway in what the movie made look like a rather long ride. No cops. No logic. It skips the explanation for a second time.So far this sounds pretty harsh and I DID like the movie for the first half. But as soon as the sad part started it didn't pick back up. The movie forgot it was a comedy and drifted into a drama. Introducing the drugaddict mother who shakes and jitters as she tries to explain to her daughter that she'll be famous any second now. Daughter learns truth goes back with dad.Bud by the end of the movie sees the error of his ways or whatever and hosts a special type of presidential debate.Bud smiles at his daughter as he pulls the curtain over the voting booth end movie. Angry at first but then I understood why it didn't show us who he voted for. I appreciated that the movie stayed neutral.But at the end I didn't appreciate how the movie just dropped it's comedic value.A 510 may be a bit harsh but I did not by any means hate the movie. I enjoyed it. But there are just as many holes of logic and explanation as there are in the political system.".

This is a movie that will have you laughing for the first hour and a half and then switches gears to a more serious note and leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling in the last half hour.Kevin Costner plays a lovable loser and is just so funny! Throughout most of the movie he didn't deliver a single line without leaving me giggling. I was watching his performance and thinking that he may just deserve an Oscar for this role. It could happen. Johnny Depp was nominated for Pirates. Besides Kevin Costner Kelsey Grammar Stanley Tucci Dennis Hopper and Nathan Lane will also have you rolling with laughter. Whoever came up with the idea to put all of these funny men into one movie was brilliant. And the two presidential candidates played by Grammar and Hopper seem very true to life and likable. But I think the 2nd best performance in the movie goes to Madeline Carroll who plays Kevin Costner's daughter Molly. She does a great job in this role and brings a lot of heart to the movie.The message in this movie is also very powerful. Yes it seems silly that one man could decide the next president. But it does strike a cord in that every person who votes can make a difference. Voting is our chance for our voice to be heard and to get the people in office that will speak for us.But that message aside if you go see a movie that will put a smile on your face for 2 hours go see Swing Vote.".

	schema:headline " An uncomfortable swing that glorifies felony voter fraud";
	schema:reviewBody "Voter Alert Do not commit felony voter fraud. It is not a nice thing o do and can land you behind large federal bars. Having seen the trailer several times I had high hopes for this film. In one respect Madeline Carroll's brilliant performance and memorable tear jerker scene it delivered big time.I read that Costner does not play 'dumb' very well and totally agree. More to the point and aside from the feather lite political angles there was for me a very low and uncomfortable road traveled. It was the polar opposite of comedic entertainment.Costner's Bud is uneducated not that there's anything wrong with that dull a fall down drunk a lousy parent who expects the next knock on the door to be social services rescuing his daughter selfish and self centered. He is father apparently in name only as his goal in life is to 'fail' his daughter at every turn. On top of Buds lack of formal education is his blissful ignorance of such as 'who is running for President.' Having lost his job and of course his child's health care Bud's solution is more BUD beer of course and hey....time to go fishing. Forget issues of the day. This Bud would not know an issue if he was standing on one. And all of this plods along for 90 of the film until the Hollywood 'resolution' team cranks up the volume so that Bud may for the first time in his life issue a sentence or two beyond gibberish. Aside from this is the stubborn fact that Bud remains to the end a dishonest man. Funny thing about 'humor.' It doesn't wash with a lost childhood that has Molly turned into and emotional train wreck. Even worse Bud's self centered parental neglect has left Molly with a moral compass that is so damaged she sees the commission of a felony as a GOOD thing to do. I did not find this relentless emotional abuse entertaining. Watching Costner play a drunk and buffoon also does not work. Imagine a 2008 version of Ralph Cramden with a daughter like Molly. A likable loser whose every scheme fails and whose neglect of Alice or rather Molly is always conquered by his good loving heart. Now imagine the world waiting for Ralph's vote as Ed Norton jumps in to help him brush up on issues of the day. Now that is the swing vote I wanted to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "In every election year the biggest topic of discussion comes over who is the most responsible to hold the position the President of the United States. Should the CommanderinChief be the aging war veteran or the new fellow pleading for change? Swing Vote does not try to answer this question and it certainly will not change who the public will vote for in the upcoming election. That is part of what makes the film almost work as it tries to not tag on a political statement and in a rarity for a Hollywood film about a presidential election both candidates are portrayed equally. In Swing Vote it is not about the political party but rather the man who wants to run the country. In its heart the film is simply a comedy about a beerdrinking New Mexican chap who is given the chance to actually make his vote count and not just be one in a million ballots. The film only start to falter when it forgets this and begins to take itself much too seriously.Bud Johnson Kevin Costner lives alone with his clever daughter Molly Madeline Carroll in a small New Mexican town and trying to make ends meet despite his major drinking problem and tendency to go fishing rather than work. When he falls asleep drunk in his car on election day his daughter goes to the booth and votes for him. However after a computer error the vote is not counted and Bud is given ten days to revote the catch being that his one vote which choose the American President for the next four years. Suddenly the media starts to invade his small town and the two competing Presidents played by Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper along with their campaign managers Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane respectively arrive to get Bud to vote their party. This causes much confusion as Bud becomes mediaobsessed the two candidates start changing their stances on issues to please Bud and Molly must get her father to make the right choice and not blow this oneinalifetime opportunity.Swing Vote is a flawed film but the film definitely succeeds in getting some good performances out of its cast of talented actors. Kevin Costner is his usual charming self while also going for a more gruff and slightly headintheclouds approach than previously shown in work like Bull Durham. While another actor might have made Bud too unsympathetic Costner succeeds in making us care for the character. Madeline Carroll is the starlet of the film allowing Molly to be more charming than annoying as often plagues young actresses who play smartaleck characters. She also manages to deliver the one truly emotional scene in which she stands up for her father. Nathan Lane is also a standout providing his usual perfect comedic timing and one particular dramatic moment that proves even moreso than he is one of the most talented actors of stage and screen. As for the rest of the cast Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper both appear to be having fun in their roles while Stanley Tucci and Judge Reinhold are both criminally underused.Along with the actors one of the best aspect of the film comes in how it does not lean politically all the way to the right or to the left providing a more neutral approach while still managing to satirise both sides. In the end it is the campaign managers who are squandered the most rather than the candidates who are portrayed in a fair manner. The Republican and Democratic labels are also not hammered into the ground as the film shows that Bud is voting for the person rather than the political party. The way the film takes a look at the media's spin doctor approach as well as presidential candidates flipflopping to win votes is done in a funny way as well. When Swing Vote stays firmly in the comedy arena it proves to be a genuine winner. However there is a shift in the second act where it starts to take itself too seriously and begins to forget that it is a comedic Frank Capraesquire fantasy and it certainly lacks the subtlety of Capra's finest. In addition subplots are added that do not add much to the story and questions are left unanswered. Where are the vicepresidential candidates and why are they never mentioned? Why spend so much money on television advertisements for only one person? Ultimately Swing Vote is a fantasy and while it starts to drag in the final act it still manages to at least provide a great cast with some topical material.".

But it was better.You should know though it's not really a comedy. There are some really funny parts but it's not a comedy. Madeline Carroll was fantastic. She has a very promising career ahead of her.The way the candidates pandered to Bud Kevin Costner may seem silly but it's really what they do in real life. It's just not as obvious when they do it based on polls instead of the opinion of one man.The premise that drives the movie is a little weak but honestly I got over it. Let the loose and unlikely plot point in the beginning go and you will enjoy this film.Finally as an audience you really felt connected to Molly Bud's Daughter and as she begins to lose faith in him you feel like giving up on him too.The cast was phenomenal from Kelsey Grammar to Nathan Lane. All of them were amazing.810 See it before November".

	schema:headline " Meet John DUH... Annoying lead character's drunken narcissism was ugly and profoundly offensive";
	schema:reviewBody "I like Kevin Costrner as a human and have admired many of his movies. But this one was painfully stupid to me. He played a selfabsorbed drunk who trivialised everything and everyone around him. He spoilt everything he touched. He made the world a mean and nasty place. And he committed all those offenses whilst caring for an innocent daughter. CreepY!How is that kind of personality disorder even remotely funny? To tell it straight the guy was a complete  and depending on what continent you're on  jerk twt ahole he was destructive and passively cruel. Please forgive my strong language but that's how sleazy and despicable that character was. What he stood for even in a fantasy an entertainment was SOOOO unworthy of any us the filmmakers should feel ashamed.It reminded me in an uglier sense of course of the wooden and artificial 1941 movie with Gary Cooper Meet John Doe. I liked that as a child but when I saw it a year or so ago on telly I cringed it was so fake and contrived. And that's the definition of what's NOT a classic when it is applauded when new but looks like crap a few years later.This movie Swing Vote does not fail because it is illogical or silly. It is. But so are many wonderfully entertaining films. This fails because it displays a destructive and callous personality type that poops on everything like a harpy.Despite the real stretch it would take to accept the plot and hey I was willing! underneath the camera work and the brilliant newcomer young actress who played his daughter and Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper etc. underneath it all was a vile cesspit of pure ugliness.If you watch this be prepared to feel like bathing right after. BTW there are plenty of goofy and implausible political movies that are pretty good in their own right. Eddie Murphy played a US Congressman in one Michael Douglas the President in another. James Garner Lauren Bacall and Jack Lemon in another those were all silly too but they also had some charm and some beauty and they entertained. Even Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo was at least funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "The supremely improbable notion that one middleaged slacker might hold the supreme say in who will become the next president of the United States is basic premise of this film. Yet once you accept this farfetched situation Swing Vote becomes a comedy that has its poignant moments and contains a message. Kevin Costner turns a great performance as Bud a single father who has trouble getting up in the morning let alone keep a job or take care of his young daughter. Madeline Carroll plays his daughter Molly who has been forced to grow up to take care of herself and her dad. She's idealistic engaged yet fragile due to the insecurity of having a difficult home situation.What makes Swing Vote work is that much like a modern day Fairy Tale it is at time funny at times intensely dramatic. The situation is implausible but the problems are real. Bud shows signs of alcoholism and we clearly sense that Molly doesn't always get even the basics of three healthy meals and a minimum of parental supervision. The swing vote situation serves as the catalyst for Bud to be confronted with himself and his ways. He has 10 days before voting and deciding singlehandedly who will be the next President. The two candidates fly in with an army of advisors security and transform the small southern town Bud lives in into a circus under heavy media presence. There are scenes in Swing vote that are rather sad. The film doesn't hold anything when it comes to Molly's difficult situation with her parents for instance. Yet the film contains a few laughout loud moment when both republicans and democrats are willing to turn their traditional platforms totally upside down to please Bud and get his vote. It's just hilarious seeing the republican president putting the environment as a priority and watching the democrat candidate turn prolife. Many social issues are mentioned but always brushed over. The writing and direction making sure not to take too much of a stance on the issues and simply recognizing they are meaningful and relevant. If Swing Vote has a fault it is perhaps to push too far and make us believe everybody involved not just Bud is transformed by this experience. On top of bud several politicians and journalists also begin to act in ways that demand you suspend disbelief and it all wraps up a little too nicely.At its heart Swing Vote is about looking beyond your selfish needs and caring. Caring for others around you caring about issues and recognizing that although you may only be one person you can make a difference. The movie is certainly not meant to be taken literally but the metaphor is valid.This is an enjoyable film and young actress Madeline Carroll is somewhat of a revelation. She probably has a bright future in Hollywood should she improve on that. As for Costner after the amazing Mr. Brooks this is a second film that may signal a genuine comeback for this actor who was once synonymous with quality projects.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frederico Fellini's masterwork 8  is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand and this is likely to intimidate many viewers. But in truth and in spite of its surrealistic flourishes 8  is more straightforward than its reputation might lead you to believe.The storyline itself is very simple. A famous director is preparing a new film but finds himself suffering from creative block he is obsessed by loves and feels unending frustration with both art and women and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the filminformation that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.What makes the film interesting is the way in which Fellini ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity art midlife crisis and the battle of the sexes. Throughout the film the director dreams dreams has fantasies and recalls his childhoodand this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself. The staging of the various shots is unique one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream fantasy or memory until one is well into the scene and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred with Fellini giving as much if not more importance to fantasy as to fact.The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success. Even when the film becomes surrealistic fantastic the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships. At the same time however the film has a remarkably poetic quality a visual fluidity and beauty that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dreamlike quality. Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale Anouk Aimee and a host of other notables.I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation for its content can be quickly grasped. When critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing each time it is seen one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate. Even so I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8  a great deal. For all others strongly strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale Anouk Aimee and a host of other notables.I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation for its content can be quickly grasped. When critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing each time it is seen one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate. Even so I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8  a great deal. For all others strongly strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

	schema:reviewBody "It's been said before Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi a fictitious 43yearold film director with a personal crisis that stunts his creative flow and his inability to get on with his new film after the enormous success of his previous one. The character is iconically brought to life by the immortal Mastroianni with artificially greyed hair and is universally identified as an alter ego of Fellini himself.The first time I saw 8 I was in my teens and hated it. I then rewatched it only a few years later in my early 20s and something miraculous happened. It was probably a pivotal moment in my filmviewing experience it suddenly gave me new parametres by which to judge movies and even art in general. I suddenly learnt this new language so much more beautiful and sophisticated than anything I had heard before. What was most amazing was that after the first negative experience I had somehow tapped into this language's secret and it wasn't in the least bit hermetic or difficult though more complex and sophisticated than other languages I already knew. Many of the movies I'd considered greats became amateurish or dwarfish in comparison.To me this was no longer simply a movie but Art in a more universal sense of the word Art that just IS and has nothing to strive for or prove. Which is why I find it so nonsensical and contradictory to call something like 8 pretentious  to me pretentious is when an insecure auteur is trying consciously and hard to be profound difficult original groundbreaking and you can see their intent clearly and detect the effort behind the artifice. Nothing of any of this is anywhere to be perceived in 8 which makes creating masterpieces look easy. I admit that 8 is not an easy movie nor one for everyone. Visually fewer movies are as iconic memorable original poetic funny inventive allegorical exhilarating. The scenes I love are too many to mention but here are just a few The steam bath scene when in an odd processionritual the patients are being led into what must be a Turkish bath. All the steam surrounding them the men wearing sheets that look like shrouds or togas all looking like mockancient Roman dignitaries... Then through a loudspeaker MastroianniAnselmi is told the driedup turkeylike Cardinal will now condescend to meeting him. Before Guido rushes off to meet the Cardinal all his friends and colleagues beg him to put in a good word for them. This is such a gleeful stab at Italy's grovelling nepotistic culture of ingratiating oneself to the powersthatbe by paying them lipservice even for the most petty personal advantages. Then Guido stands before the embodiment of Catholic paternalism and his obsequious minions. And everything is at its most pompous and lifeless  this dusty mummified institution is less in touch with the humanity it's supposed to comfort and advise than it is possible to believe.I also love the character of Guido's mistress Carla played by Sandra Milo at her gaudiest and most voluptuous. Though initially it's difficult to understand what Guido would have seen in her eventually it become more apparent. Meeting his wife Luisa you see how well the two women's ways of being complement one another. See for example how she reacts in a simple goodhumoured selfdeprecating way when in the caf scene Guido's elegant neurotic wife played by Anouk Aime at her most androgynously attractive  mockingly compliments Carla's tacky outfit for its elegance. In such instances one gets a sense that though Fellini is parodying his subjects he also has a fundamental love and human compassion for them.The prostitute La Saraghina is probably one of the most memorable female characters put to film ever. She is probably somewhere in her 50s and rougher than sandpaper overweight yet strangely fit and voluptuous with lots of scary wild dark hair overdone raccoon eye makeup caked onto her aggressive striking sardonic face as she sits and dances on the lonely beach in Rimini next to her war bunkerhome. Guido is fascinated by what is young and yet ancient eternal meaning what is muselike archetypically like the divinely beautiful Claudia character perfectly embodied by Claudia Cardinale the ultimate director's muse rather than a real woman or mistress. La Saraghina may not be a young woman like Claudia she may not represent spontaneity and fresh uncluttered artistic inspiration like she does but she is also a muse of sorts  the muse of guiltfree pleasure and nonselfconscious free unidealised earthy femininity. All this is La Saraghina  the town's young boys respond to this in her including Guido as a child and are bewitched by her and pay to her to see her demonic yet liberating visceral dance.I have so much more to say about this movie for instance about Nino Rota's memorable score or how the movie's nonlinear structure and juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated scenes emulates the rhythm and mood of dreams to perfection. Also the scenes featuring Guido's parents and their embodiment of the emotional blackmail that eternal sense of guilt and the stunting of individuality that the paternalistic institution of family at its most traditional represents in Italy. Or of Guido's touching childhood memories of the wonderful way in which the movie ends in a merrygoround of what really matters in life when all else has been swiped aside and all that remains is the desire to cherish with all their imperfections all those who have really mattered most in our lives...".

	schema:reviewBody "Fellini's 8 12 opens with a stunning dream sequence in which a man is trapped in his car in the middle of a traffic jam. The doors and windows are locked and there is no escape. Other drivers simply sit and stare at him passively. The driver starts to panic as smoke begins to build up within the car. Propelling himself outside a window he floats over the other cars and soars above the world until he is pulled down a rope attached to a tether on his ankle. The driver is Guido Anselmi Marcello Mastroianni a film director at odds with himself. Shot in black and white 8 12 is an exhilarating confusing irritating and inspired journey into a man's consciousness. It is not just a look at the inner turmoil of one person but also a commentary on each person's struggle to make sense of their life. The film's combination of kaleidoscopic images evocative score by Nino Rota and amazing performances ensure its place as one of the greatest films of the century.Guido is preparing to shoot a new film with an expensive budget. He constructs a huge spaceship launch pad that costs 80 million but he is unsure of what he wants to say. Guido's dishonesty in dealing with his marriage his career and the fact that he really does not want to make the film forces him to falsely mislead people as to his true intentions. He feels like a failure and is physically spent. He checks into a spa to restore his health and well being but the contingent of producers actors writers and hangers on undermine his strength. His feeling of being overwhelmed by personal and professional obligations provides the catalyst for dreams and fantasies that take him back to his childhood.Fellini shows his encounter with the prostitute Saraghina Eddra Gale and the guilt he has to deal with in a confrontation with the Catholic Church. Guido invites his intellectual wife Luisa Anouk Aime to the set but their relationship has turned cold and passionless and sparks fly when she has to confront Carla Sandra Milo his buxom mistress. Guido is misguided but he has an innocence and charm that allows us to overlook his indulgences. He enjoys his pleasures but has a conscience and feels guilty about cheating on Luisa whom he loves and is afraid of losing. He fantasizes that all of the women in his life are together in a harem where they all dote on his every whim. When they finally recognize how little he cares about them he is forced to suppress their revolt. As image piles on image and the fantasy becomes indistinguishable from the reality the viewer may get lost in a maze of dazzling incoherence. Fellini however always returns to solid ground and the film offers not only a satire on the frenzy the uncertainty and the clash of egos involved with making a film but also a serious commentary on the importance of honesty in a relationship. If 8 12 is occasionally exhausting the ending is invigorating letting us know that life is a game in which each of us is on the stage performing our roles and the only sane response to its turmoil is to join hands in love and celebrate the moment.".

	schema:reviewBody "excuse me for my bad EnglishThoughts on Fellini's carrier can be divided on people who think his peak was early neorealist phase Vitelloni La Strada Nights of Cabiria do you remember the guy in the line from Woody Allen's Annie Hall? and on the ones that praised his fantasy phase starting with La Dolce Vita and followed by 8 12 Roma etc.They are both wrong. Both periods and its films are very important cinematically rich and skillful in directing. The fact that there are many followers of both periods and equal artistic success shows that the only real difference is among their aesthetics. And isn't that what makes a great director?This film is considered one of the best movies of all time among critics and directors. Many people have complaints of how this movie is difficult to understand. It is. When I first saw it it was a rather very frustrating experience. But once you capture it fully its amazing. In fact I fully captured it after the third viewing and after that every time I see it I can find something new or different. That's because this movie works differently. It works out of standard movie patterns and conventions we use to see in everyday cinema. Above and most important of all it speaks with the different movie language. And that is a real cinematic language because 8 12 uses specific movie instruments to transmit it's content. It cannot be transferred in any other form including literal. That's why it is so hard to put the plot into the words and that's the major merit of this film.After the tremendous commercial and artistic success in 1960. with his previous film La Dolce Vita Fellini decided to make a film 8 12 about the movie director played by Marcello Mastroianni as Guido fresh from recent success who is not sure what to film next! And this egocentric director under the pressure of his producer actors friends fans and journalists is escaping into the memories of his childhood wishful fantasies and dreams. At the beginning of the film there's a stunning famous dream sequence. Guido is trapped in a traffic jam. He loses his breath while unsuccessfully trying to escape from his car. People around in their vehicles are starring at him. The whole scene is mute except the constant monotonous sound and from time to time it freezes. Suddenly he is free and flying towards sky. Then one of his assistants pulls him down to earth. And he is awake. I think it's unnecessary to explain the meaning of this brilliant scene.There is also a scene where he is persuaded to ask a catholic priest for an advice about the content of his next film since his films are widely released there is a moral issue. But he apparently has an aversion towards Church. And then during a conversation with this priest Guido suddenly associates his early childhood event watching a dance of a prostitute Saraghina and the subsequent punishment by one priest. So the current event forces its cause to come out of his subconsciousness.Then there is a scene  quarrel between Guido and his wife played by Anuk Aimee while sitting outdoors. She is complaining about his mistresses and he is denying everything. Then his mistress Sandra Milo suddenly arrives and after she saw Guido with his wife sits to one table not so close. Guido's wife noticed that and realized that woman is his mistress. So she is continuing her quarrel with him. And then comes one of the most visceral and fascinating scenes in the Movie History. Suddenly wishful fantasy starts Guido's wife stands up coming towards mistress. They are kissing each other like longtime friends and making a nice conversation. Then Guido enters his house from the childhood which is shown before with some presents in his hands. And there are like 20 women around him fighting for his attention. He is whipping them dominate them. And there is his wife  peaceful calm conservative loving So under the pressure of allaroundhim messes he is fantasying. This is psychologically known as the regression to the pleasure principle and is very common. This scene is known as The Harem Scene and like others is followed by brilliant very suitable music score.From time to time Guido is fantasying a beautiful young woman Claudia Cardinale. She is another projection of his narcissism  an ideal woman to please all of his wishes not making a single complaint.Rosella represents symbolizes his superego. Pay attention to their phone conversation. Also in Harem scene harem is actually his Id fulfilling all his infantile fantasies she is ABOVE him making complaints.His producer is paternal figure. All his father's wishes demands to Guido are now reactivated with producer. Pay attention to very interesting first fantasy scene in the movie on the grave. Father asks a man something like How is my boy doing? and the man makes face like Well.... Later we discover that the man is his producer.Guido's wife and his mother the same thing. And we discover this in the same scene when his mother turns into his wife.Critical writer may represent his raw intellect but also artistic vanity while Conocchia is his neglected emotional aspect.At the end of the movie he eventually becomes aware of the causes of his confusion and selfdeceptions this sudden awareness is symbolized by shooting himself shooting his confusion that is and having a final monologue ...Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other...".

Along the way he struggles with his screenwriter producer wife and mistress.  Each presents a different problem and obstacle.  More and more difficulties arise not just in his attempts to complete the movie but in his own mind.Guido although flawed is completely fleshed out and draws sympathy from the audience.  Yes he is an adulterer but he loves his wife.  We see all of his personal desires and agony.  We see how he suffers when he struggles with his desire to create the ultimate piece of art one that offers something to everybody.The movie is technically wonderful.  The movement of the camera the lighting and the direction in general is top notch.  The movie mixes in dreams with reality to create a dreamlike world and put us closer into Guido's own mind.Somebody who is looking for a movie as a two hour piece of entertainment will not enjoy this.  But if you enjoy a movie that truly satisfies when it is finished this is for you.  It is quite long and somewhat loose but that is part of the interest.

But if you enjoy a movie that truly satisfies when it is finished this is for you.  It is quite long and somewhat loose but that is part of the interest.  Moviemakers or artists in general will find that this film has a great deal to offer.";

This time it was different. I knew it from the opening scene from the first sounds of Nino Rota's music. I wanted to know how Guido would balance the demands of his producers and the insecurities of his love life. I sometimes barely could tell the difference between the reality and Guido's surfing the waves of his memory or building the Utopias in his mind where things were exactly the way he wanted them to be  and I really did not want to tell the difference. I just was there following Guido on his journey where Fellini sent us. Then that scene came La Saraghina's lurid dance on the beach. There was something in that scene that made me return to it over and over again. What was it? The dancing woman was not young pretty or graceful. On the contrary she was fat and ugly but there was something about her  that smile resilience the promise of joy that attracted eager schoolboys. It was a last time the young Guido felt happy without guilt and shame that inevitably came after the encounter and stayed with him forever he learned that joy and punishment are inseparable There have been fewer than a handful of films that affected me as profoundly as 8  didTarkovsky's Zerkalo  when the master holds the mirror in front of you that reflects his soul and mind open you eyes and heart don't say a word just watch closely.Tarkovsky's Andrey Rublev  What is talent? Is it a God's gift or Devil's curse? Is an Artist free in choosing what to do with that gift?Bergman's Persona  How far can one individual go in opening his soul to the other without losing identity and sanity?Fellini's Nights of Cabiria  Dum Spiro  Spero  While there's life there's hope.In 8  Fellini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen all what left behind is a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor. The last that we hear is the magic music of Rota bringing affirmation hope and love.Simply wonderful. Perhaps one of five greatest films ever made.".

The camera gives us a claustrophobic sense and within the first few minutes I am on the edge of my seat. Needless to say our protagonist survives but the outcome of this scene reveals so much. Fellini's 8 12 is a brilliantly executed tale of a mans life crashing down around him. It is a semi autobiographical tale Guido is a director who is in a bit of a creative slump. He is giving both the press and executives the run around in order to buy timehoping to find inspiration. His marriage is shaky and his relationship with his mistress is complicated. Guido tries to escape by going to a spa but his escape is not so easy... This film portrays inner conflict through dream sequences and fantasies as opposed to Expressionism. It is these sequences that enlighten the viewer and add dimension to the tale. To me 8 12 is the greatest film in ever eclipsing Citizen Kane of course AFI's top 100 list is limited to American movies... and proving to be enjoyable and insightful.".

One of the beauties of cinema is to merge the artist's memory and fantasy Fellini certainly utilized this magic to present his story and characters that embody both humanity and mystery. This film is an autobiographical piece of Fellini himself about a movie director named Guido how his life is consumed by his increasing obsession with work. He avoids questions and problems as if they will go away somehow only to experience more questions and problems. Ultimately Guido realizes the only way to solve his problems is to face them rather than escaping accepting himself instead of wishing he was someone else.The opening sequenceone of the most deftly craftedis taken from Guido's movie or his dream  can't remember for sure. The sequence brilliantly captures Guido's problems which are dealt with in the rest of the picture and exposes them metaphorically him STUCK in traffic TRAPPED in smoke SUFFOCATING wanting to escape and pulled back down by his peers. Guido wants to make a movie about his and Fellini's MEMORIES how once upon a time he learned about a chant that moves pictures and the time he danced with the fat feminine prostitute figure. The other main component of his movie involves launching into space a FANTASY that reflects Guido's and Fellini's desire to escape from worldly matters. In real life Guido is having problems with everything from his wife to his movie. So he thinks a beautiful actress whom he fantasizes but knows little to nothing about will be the solution to all his problems. When Guido meets the actress he realizes she can't solve his problems only he himself has the choice. This realization leads to the film's closure with Guido having learned what's important to him and the inevitability of taking responsibility.One of the film's powerful features is ambiguously blending Guido's world with his imaginations. Thus the audience is constantly deciphering the context of what's on the screen. This invitation to participate in the film is welcome and if we think about it a person like Guido who lives in his office might not be able to tell at times whether an event happened in his life or inside his mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Intellectuals have written volumes on this strange film by Italian New Wave director Federico Fellini. I am not an intellectual so my review will be brief. At its most basic 8 12 a.k.a. Otto e mezzo concerns Guido a film director supposedly a surrogate for Fellini himself who is having what amounts to a midlife crisis. Guido is frustrated in his filmmaking and by his relations with other people in his life. But the film's story does not proceed in a traditional linear fashion. Fellini more or less abandons logical narration in favor of open form narration wherein the story's causal chain of events is broken.Thus trying to figure out what is going on in this film can be hard. Guido's fantasies memories dreams and reality comingle in a kind of cinematic stew. Fellini presents viewers with a kaleidoscope of surreal BW images of ordinary objects and eccentric chattering characters which interact with Guido and with each other in ways that defy logic and give breathtaking meaning to the term symbolism. Followers of psychologist Carl Jung would have a field day. In style the film is flamboyant. In substance the film is maddeningly subliminal. And yet even the most metallic cynic Pauline Kael notwithstanding must surely appreciate the rareness of Fellini's probing introspection.Given the bizarre unstructured content of 8 12 I wonder about the issue of necessity. Suppose Fellini had added an extra ten minutes to the screenplay or deleted ten minutes. Would that have made any difference? Apart from Guido if this or that character had been deleted how would that have changed the story's significance? And if as some have suggested the film is a mirror image of Fellini's own confused psyche can the story be construed as an intuition of his future filmmaking?Otto e mezzo is not for everyone. Like a Zen koan 8 12 invites frustration. It is above all else a celebration of ambiguity and abstraction a cinematic experience to ponder especially on the heels of four or five martinis ... or 8 12 if you really want to induce immense intellectual insight.

	schema:reviewBody "There are films that the viewer can assimilate and enjoy in one viewing. There are others that demand a second view just to catch the missing clues or to relive the story for the first time. Still there are others much better who despite the plot revelations despite knowing what will happen produce the feeling of giddy anticipation taken to soaring heights.And then there are films by Directors  monsters of filmmaking who even at their worst create compelling works of art that are the stuff of film theory. To see Federico Fellini's film 8 12 is to see such a creation. It is the gates of a Dalinian fun house where the past and the present and even the future converge into one intricate tangled mess of a story  but one that is beyond analysis beyond interpretation and exists in its own universe.8 12 is the story of a film director Guido Anselmi Marcello Mastroianni doubling for Fellini who is unable to continue with the production of a sciencefiction movie due to his lack of interest in it. A tightening noose of people who demand of him is beginning to take shape and suffocate him. There is his mistress Carla Sandra Milo who throws her earthy neediness on him. A barrage of producers film critics and his insecure French actress Madeleine LeBeau increase the pressure. His wife Luisa a severe Anouk Aimee is estranged from him. Gloria Morin Barbara Steele is Gothicchic incarnate and only succeeds to annoy to hell out of her surroundings. The appearance of two nebulous women the muse Claudia Claudia Cardinale luminous and ethereal and the mysterious actress Caterina Boratto spark some mystery but neither manage to do more than that  throw a net of feminine mystique.Guido tries to throw himself into his own memories and see if he can come up with something his sexual awakening as a boy to the songs and the overpowering carnality of La Saraghina opera singer Eddra Gale a Rabelasian woman who lived by the sea the sanction of the priests and a fantasy in which he lives in a household of all of the women in his life who are at his feet ready to serve him with abandon. Despite all this it becomes clear that the film in itself will not be made  more so when his muse appears in the flesh and tells him he does not know how to love. Her statement becomes evident when he is given the chance to reconcile with Luisa but remains the Director  a control freak  even when he himself has lost all control.8 12 is one of those films that can be seen in multiple ways. An extended conscious dream fusing itself with reality Fellini plunges everything he can into a sensory overload where one event which happens in reality becomes framed with another which is a part of a memory or a fantasy. Many characters from his own reality are mirrored in other minor ones. Carla and la Saraghina both reflect themselves in the fleshandblood Claudia who tells Guido he does not know how to love Luisa sees herself in an actress onstage and recoils but she also shares a lot with Rossella Rossella Falk Guido's conscience Claudia the muse and the Mysterious Lady are two and one and on and on. They themselves are harbingers of a vicious relationship cycle where Guido finds himself at Stage One and unable to act or give in. This is a film that is not easy to review because it would require an indepth analysis which would take pages upon pages to write but in short it's the slow evolution of a film creating itself when its own directorcreator is on autopilot and a whirlwind of activity follows him like a swarm of bees. A masterpiece of filmmaking a study of obsessions and unexpurgated demons a collage of memories past and present and a wicked rollercoaster ride this is what 8 12 stands for and is alongside CITIZEN KANE a flawless black and white film and the womb for all other Proustian films which have come out most notable being Woody Allen's STARDUST MEMORIES. From its standout opening sequence in which suffocating traffic is the catalyst for Guido's escape into the skies only to be pulled back down by himself to the glorious moment when Jacqueline the showgirl and Saraghina initiate a revolt against his misogynistic behavior to the moving final sequence where Guido as a boy orchestrates the descent of every person in his adult life and reveals them dancing together in harmony in a congaline 8 12 is an unforgettable experience of iconoclastic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first Fellini piece I watch and it most definitely will not be the last. A lot of people call this boring. Let me make two things clear right off the bat This is not fastpaced and it is also not for everyone. There are a lot of characters and it is not easy to immediately distinguish between reality and fantasy in what we are presented with on the screen. Also this is a piece of metafiction Frederico whilst suffering from writer's block made a picture about a director attempting to yes put together a movie while experiencing that very same condition. Not knowing much about the artist's personality and life I can't tell how closely this depicts either but given that there is at least a resemblance this is in effect a film that the man behind it put some of himself directly into and its subject is indeed that very same thing. The cinematography and editing are excellent. Every acting performance is spoton. The surrealism is impeccable and marvelously implemented. This has undoubtedly inspired countless people who work in the medium. I understand that this gets bettersome say increasingly with successive viewings and that anyone should at the very least give it a second one. For now I take their word for that. I certainly intend to delve further into this. The DVD comes with a trailer and a feature entitled L'ultimate sequenza or The Lost Ending which I will review on its individual page. I recommend this to those who find themselves interested by reading either this review or any other information they learn about it. Just don't take that as a promise that you will enjoy it. 1010".

I find films with stagelike acting blatant morality and little bits ofexciting action like the American cinema of the 50's and 60's tobe uncompelling.  Personal stories are compelling.  Personalstories that are well done and make the viewer feel what thefilmmaker feels are even better. And 8 12 has two personal stories.  One story is the dilemma thelead faces  should he make another flashy hollywood typemovie or should he stay true to himself.    The other personal storyis from the director himself.  He's claustrophobic caught in ahorrid web of making films that aren't true to what he FEELS isright.  He must conform to producers' wishes he must appeaseimportant people in the industry he must make things flashy hemust give away what he KNOWS is truth to survive in this industry. It is in Fellini's 8 12 where he and the main character of the filmsay Stop! This personal story resonated with me.  It subtly and I can notstress any more the subtle quality of this film spoke to meinstructing me to not follow what THEY expect.  Do what you feelyou must do.  Do what you feel that will fulfill your soulnot yourpocketbook your sexual desires or other pleasures. You can read my writing and that's fine but you must see the filmbecause I am not doing Fellini's film any justice.

I know it's not posh to put down Italy's genius I seldom see any critics having the balls to do so but I cannot applaud a respected artist's piece of work simply on name value when for me it is meritless as entertainment does little to stimulate the mind other than to numb it or further the appreciation of film making.  Mindaltering drugs should not be an option for getting through a difficult movie.  As a result all 8 12 did for me was induce drowsiness.  Overlong laborious ostentatious and utterly selfindulgent this is the kind of movie to see if you are a chronic insomniac.  Folks put away those expensive and dangerous tablets and pills...try 8 12..for a nice safe and restful sleep.Supposedly this is one of Fellini's most intensely personal projects.  Big deal.  Marcello Mastroianni portrays an obsessed Fellinilike filmmaker in the midst of undertaking a new project enslaved by weird warped surreal visions and concepts that serve as motivators.  A number of foreign beauties Claudia Cardinale Anouk Aimee are entrapped in subplots that go virtually nowhere.  I remember Fellini Satyricon as being an equally difficult visuallyarresting piece but at least the director had the sense to make it forbiddenly erotic with its bizarre assortment of characters prancing about in panoramic perversity.Selfanalytical psychological mumbojumbo goes just so far.  You remember those inane Saturday Night Live skits with Gilda Radner that spoofed these heady overblown Italian movies?  They were pointing their finger at this baby not La Dolce Vita a far better film.If ambiguous esoteric highly pretentious art is your thing...go for it. If not but you feel you'd like to fit in and hold your own in a Felliniesque conversation may I suggest his more plotfriendly masterpieces  Nights of Cabiria La Strada or even the slim but delightful Ginger and Fred all showcasing the extraordinary talents of Fellini's legendary wife Giulietta Masina.

	schema:reviewBody "Fellini's films is one of the main reasons I came to love movies in the first place. I first saw 8 12 several years ago. I remember it quite clearly I went to see it with a small group of fellow students at a friend's house. It was at the beginning of a now already longsince destroyed relationship. It was a cold day in early January. As the film started a girl who was there who happened to be a makeup artist and hairdresser by profession remarked on the odd juxtaposition in the opening scenes of hairstyles and dresses from different eras the 30's and the 60's. Surely this was a strange anachrony?My friend calmly remarked Time doesn't exist.Heck I won't pretend to know just what he meant by that perhaps it wasn't as profound as it sounded. In any case after that no one spoke. For the next couple of hours I certainly lost track of place and time as I was hypnotized mesmerized and amazed by the images on the screen. Since then I've always kept a copy of it within reach even though I am one of those people who can usually never hang on to my possessions for any length of time and it has lost none of its power to continually amaze me. I've seen it more times than I can count and yet it must always be seen again. It's a movie about which everything seems to have been said and yet everything still remains to be said. Thanks to the wonders of DVDs and MPEG encoding I can keep it one mouseclick away whenever I'm working on my computer. I must admit that by now its already from the outset discontinuous and jumbled content has been spread all over the place for me. Unlike Woody Allen I'm not anal. I've never had a compulsion to have to watch movies straight from beginning to end without interruptions. Of course that's how I watched 8 12 the first few times but now it seems that I'm always chopping it up skipping at will between my favorite sections always moving around it and rearranging it in new and unexpected ways. I hope Fellini in his Heaven forgives me for it because it seems to me that I'm in a way just continuing what he began. 8 12 even in its purest state does of course blow the traditional temporal narrative with a defined beginning middle and end and a causal relationship between its parts to complete smithereens and in the jumbled landscape that is left behind nothing can ever be as it was before as what we are left with is a completely new world of new possibilities and new kinds of beauty. It's a story of dreamlogic held together by different kinds of connections that transcend temporal sequence and causal relationships. It's a film that never begins and still has always been there.It's a movie about the most glorious success that can only be brought around through complete failure. It's about how we can only find ourselves when we let go of ourselves  and discover that the only place we can fall is into ourselves our true selves. It's the ultimate selfreferential masterpiece and the ultimate piece of selfreference as it is of course about nothing except itself.It really is in my opinion the best movie in the world and by now I can't even imagine a world without it. That's really all I want to say.".

He even prep'd me for it by saying It's like a beautiful painting you just let it in which I thought was totally valid and cool. Until I saw the film. What is it about filmmakers that makes them so stupid. Is it the fact that their livelihood relies so directly upon winning approval and like the fashion industry the best way to do that is to appeal to people's basest most ignorant tendencies? Are they trying to make us feel comfortable like the awful abstract art that is kinda cool because is doesn't aim too high cos I could do that. It takes real courage and discipline to be honest to be vulnerable and to be willing to let people into that and be open to the risks that involves. This film is shallow hollow and amateur. It's no wonder that most filmmakers start off with horror. They don't generally start with philosophical reasoning and idealism. I told my friend if this was a book noone would bother with it if it was music we'd laugh at it but he told me it's film and you can't but I beg to differ. We are far too lenient with film we let it get away with anything.The most banal pathetic tripe is elevated to the level of art and the utter garbage of Hollywood is seen as serious and legitimate. This film is no different. It is safe selfindulgent and two dimensional. Even as a satire it doesn't work. Satire is difficult and requires intelligence and insight hence the few truly respected comedians. In summary obvious and amateur packed with awful tryhard symbolism and silly jokes terrible overacting I feel insulted and demeaned for having to put up with this poor excuse for a film it did nothing for me. If you want satire get Bob Roberts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fellini's 8  is about as close as you can get to making a musical without the characters actually breaking out into song which is perhaps why it was so easily adapted into an actual musical Nine. It's musical score by Nino Rota guides us through the protagonist's fantasies and memories as they blur into reality. The film centers around a famous film director Guido who is suffering from director's block. With time ticking away before production must begin on his latest film he is faced with a cast and crew pressing him to make decisions that he isn't prepared for. As a reality he is increasingly losing control over suffocates and swirls around him he retreats into his memories and fantasies as well as his habit of womanizing. As Guido attempts to balance and control the female influences on his life the film takes on a frantic pace until he eventually realizes that he's in over his head and must surrender. It's a brilliant film about the creative process but more importantly it's a film about human relationships. Guido is a misogynist and the film mocks his attempt to control the women in his life keeping them each in there own little box. The film makes it clear this is a harmful ideology with tongueincheek dream sequences and also shows how womanizing has genuine human consequences in reality. 8  is ultimately a film about a man who is accustomed to having all the power recognizing that he is lost and learning that he must give up control and the film depicts this with absolute beauty at the highest level of artistic achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hackers is a nonstop cheezefest. It's also one of my favourite films of all time. Which is not to say it's a perfect ten it isn't. But it's a great combination of good cheeze and pure fun. Suspend all disbelief it's not about realism. And try not to nitpick we all know graphics would not have been possible using Unix we all know that those archaic modems couldn't run that fast etc. etc. etc.That aside this film is really funny. It also laughs at itself on a regular basis...I mean just look at dade's wardrobe and then remind yourself that you know half a dozen people who dressed like that in 94. I know a people who mirror just about every character in this film which makes it even more enjoyable.The dialogue is often over the top and some of the acting is overdone but tis the nature of the beast. Jonny Lee Miller who never ceases to amaze me pulls off the American accent quite well though he tends to slip on occasion and Dade is certainly no Sickboy. But that's just an example of range he did it again in Dracula 2000...and almost saved it. Matthew Lillard though occasionally OVERLY annoying is perfect as Cereal Killer his best role ever though Scream comes close. Renoly Santiago is a funny and loud Phantom Phreak a role only second to his role in Con Air and his lines are always great and Laurence Mason as the ultracool Lord Nikon a very close tie with TinTin in The Crow for coolness and he's done some cool spots...Floyd D in True Romance not to be confused with Brad Pitt's character 'Floyd' and Roach in an awesome ep. of Law  Order... his character is by far the coolest of the Elite. Lorraine Bracco in a very early role...and speaking of early  Early Edition's Fishe Stevens is amusing as the arrogant swine Eugene 'The Plague' Belford. And how can one not like a film with Penn Jillette in it???But all that aside Angelina Jolie stole the show as she often does. Looking like a cyberelf straight out of ShadowRun she's sultry and sexy in a way most actresses these days can't manage. I can't think of any films I haven't liked her in...even if I didn't like the films themselves. She's simply awesome here she even takes bad dialogue and turns it into fun good lines. And her outfits are really nice save for that horrid dress she was stuck in at the end. And she has a Massive Attack startup on her puter!! with a 28.8 bps modem!! pOverall sure it's unrealistic. Sure half of it's impossible. Sure it's overacted and the dialogue needs work. But the cast are all underrated and most of them went on to better roles some to much fame. And the soundtracks are absolutely AMAZING!! I own them and listen regularly... This should probably rate a four or five but I can't help but ignore all critics and pronounce myself as one of the large cult following of adorers of this film. For fun value let alone the fact that it's entertaining as hell 810.".

Coming from a programmer and a computer enthusiast the movie was great despite all the false statements fake guis and totally bs methods of cracking. Quite frankly if you are one of my fellow computer geeks don't expect anything close to the real deal it would never make a good movie for the public. I think that the true movie here is behind the whole hacking front. It is the development of characters the build up of a plot and an exciting climax and satisfying denouement. In closing don't expect a command line prompt or a true UNIX client on any of the systems because it just doesn't happen in movies. Instead watch the movie because its exciting fun and a great throwback to the early 90's.".

I knew it wasn't accurate from the minute I saw it but then again it's not like it was posing itself as some movie that depicted the real life of cyberpunks. It's just fun little movie. Though some of the dialogue is a bit cheesed up it is quotable.I especially enjoyed the performance by Matthew Lillard. It made me look forward to seeing him in Scream later on. He is so funny. I enjoyed Angelina Jolie though this is hardly one of her best performances.The only person who really didn't belong in this movie was Lorraine Bracco. She just looked strange in her role. Other than that this movie was a good movie and it shouldn't be bashed because it depicts people technology and life inaccurately. What movie ever does? I'm from Iowa and do you think movies depict  Iowan's lives exactly the way they are? No. But I'm not out to fertilize the lawn with What's Eating Gilbert Grape?.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with any movie that focuses on technology particularly computers is that it will become dated nearly immediately. This isn't a new problem for filmmakers great films of the past from DESK SET to COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT from DEMON SEED to TRON and THE LAST STARFIGHTER have all featured 'cuttingedge' technology that seems quaint by today's standards. Even 'Hal' from the timeless classic 2001A SPACE ODYSSEY is a huge monstrosity that could be miniaturized to a fraction of it's size today. So when a film's whole theme involves computers like THE NET or HACKERS you can't take the technology end too seriously even if much of it is bogus as is the case of Iain Softley's paean to teenaged computer freaks. Hackers are of course not romantic adventurous daredevils who are trying to right wrongs by attacking evil conglomerates via an expertise in computer programming they are generally overeducated anarchists who create worms and viruses for the simple joy of seeing the disruption and destruction of EVERYONE'S computers just to know that they can do it.Having said this let me say that the true joy of HACKERS is seeing a group of young 'Stars in the Making' early in their careers. Of course the most recognizable and famous of these is Angelina Jolie who looks butch and adorable with short hair and 'an attitude' but the film also offers a dazzling performance by Matthew Lillard Shaggy in the liveaction SCOOBYDOO who has become one of the finest young comic actors around gifted British actor Jonny Lee Miller playing an American here who would go on to TRAINSPOTTING DRACULA 2000 and the title role in the TV production of BYRON Jesse Bradford star of last year's CLOCKSTOPPERS Laurence Mason BEHIND ENEMY LINES A.I. and Renoly Santiago CON AIR. Quite an impressive resume for a cast of 'unknowns' in 1995!Of course the established actors of the film haven't done badly either...While Fisher Stevens never became a 'major' star after the buildup television and the SHORT CIRCUIT films gave him he still remains active and of course Lorraine Bracco went on to THE SOPRANOS as the Mafia's favorite 'shrink' with the possible exception of Billy Crystal.So if you skip over the dated attempt to be 'cutting edge' and just sit back and enjoy the performances HACKERS is a fun movie that can be appreciated as a 'Preview of Coming Attractions' from a remarkable cast...".

And in the mean time a subplot which involves a girl and a guy that hate each other in the beginning and fall in love with each other throughout the movie. Nonetheless i still rated this movie very high. Why? because in my opinion it's still a great cult classic. It gives a very good image about how people thought about computers a few years ago when not everybody had one yet. The handlenames are mysterious acid burn the plaque but would be ridiculous in this age. People are overjoyed when they get to see a 28.8 BPS modem who needs T3 anyway?  PLUS they pretend as if you can see a program running like it's some sort of great graphic animation. Angelina Jolie and Jonny lee Miller from trainspotting are really great in this movie although you can see they're still pretty young and unexperienced. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Well here it is folks I think it's been long enough since hackers came out 6 years so I am going to offer what I think will be the definitive commentary on the film Hackers. Simply put Hackers is the finest movie ever. The music the costumes the dialog... if you could put FUN in a box not to mention Johnny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie the box would say Hackers on it. If this movie were a president it would Hackraham Lincoln. If it were a gum it would be Hackalicious... you get the picture.Anyhow the really important thing I have to say is thisA. Hackers is NOT a Bmovie the budget was large and the actors have major talent it's a slick production and it shows.B. Contrary to the belief of some cyberdorks out there who mainly get their jollies by pretending they know more than other people about computers it doesn't matter if the computer interface is somewhat unrealistic. Obviously there are some classic movie style computer screens a la 1995's other horrible computer flick The Net of crap but lest I seem like a broken record I will repeat for the entertainmentally challenged THIS IS A MOVIE!C. Are you kidding me? This stuff is great! I can watch this movie forever and believe me I have and NEVER EVER get tired of it. C'mon this stuff is just classic listen here to some dialoguespoken with much gusto Yeah it's got a killer refresh rate.Risc is good.Never fear I is here.IT'S SO CLASSIC IT HURTS!Bottom line if you wanna be a nerd go program something. If you want to be entertained get this movie NOW!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I went in to watch Hackers I was worried because some ofthe reviews here.I don't think we saw the same movie. From scene one I wassurprised the characters were teenagers. I knew Angelina wasonly 19 or 20 when she did this movie but I hadn't realized thatuntil I saw it.The romance and interaction between Angelina's character andJonny's is classic. Really. It's great. When they're arguing orfighting or dreaming about each other spitefully it's fun to watchtheir little denying their attraction and criticizing one another. BeforeAngelina Jolie I did not have a favorite actress. I knew actresses Iliked several films of but hated others. Angelina Jolie is different. She's my favorite actress now. It's notbecause she's pretty although she is. It's because she has amagnetism charisma and draw that I've never before seen in anactress of the 90's. This shows through in her portrayal of KateAcid Burn Libby. She's cocky and difficult with a rebel charmwe've seen in many of this star's movies. If you love Angelina Joliefor reasons OTHER than how large her chest is or nudity pleasesee this. The performance may not have been academy awardwinning but it's a great performance. Very fun to see where shestarted out.The rest of the performances are also very good. Jonny's Dadehas a puppy dog charm in that you feel sorry for him and can't helpbut laugh when things don't go his way. He is in no way Mr. Deepbut he's smart with a funny exterior. Matthew Lillard never fails to make me laugh and he's prominentwith his pigtailed braids and goofing off. I must give kudos to the villain. Sure nothing unpredictable or new.But he's positively funny. Never fear I is here. And arrogant andquirky. I loved the special effects. I loved the plot. I loved the premise. Iloved the romantic relationship between Kate and Dade.This is not an academy award winning movie. It's not extremelydramatic or epic. But it sure is a GOOD movie. It's fun it's acomedy it's a drama and it's just great to watch. I very muchenjoyed the technology used and the entire movie as a wholemade me smile.If you are looking for an epic movie of high proportions with bigname actors and a holeless plot stay away.But if you're looking for a movie that will make you smile at theantics of the multidimensional characters and their escapadesand problems set in a technological world and featuring a cuteteenage romance go see it. And if you love Angelina's acting appeal charisma and gorgeoussmile don't see it. BUY IT.  I know I will.".

I think Sandra Bullock in the movie The Net did a better job pretending to know a lot about computers then these actors. I don't know if the director intended to give more of a comedy like feeling but that just made everyone sound stupid... I hacked into the FBI! I hacked the bank! We're elite hackers o'kay!... Then there's also the bad guy riding a skateboard and these hackers on roller skates? You got to be kidding me... This movie was very corny and the feeling was much like a TV movie.The Net with Sandra Bullock which also happened to be released in 1995 was a lot better and actually had thrilling moments unlike this movie.I would of probably skipped the movie KPAX if I saw Hackers back in 1995 knowing Iain Softley directed them both. Yes KPAX was bad also. I'm definitely gonna skip his next directing movie.The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Other then that skip it.

Orbital  Halcyon  On  On is a nice song.110";

	schema:headline " Clichd illogical unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened";
	schema:reviewBody "After years of warning about global warning Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to well survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations how many times has New York been destroyed now?. However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm blood infections creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichs are all present and correct the politicians the upright scientists the sacrifice the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please! however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration could the VP look any more like Cheney?. Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour countless millions are dead for goodness sake!. The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role despite looking too old to be in school. The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but as with the genre they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level but it blows it's wad too early don't ya hate it when that happens?! and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script no characters and lots of clichs? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Day After Tomorrow is a disaster movie but it isn't a disastrous one. But if Roland Emmerich really thought he was making a movie with a message he didn't quite succeed  to be honest Emmerich is to serious filmmaking as Naomi Wolf is to recommending Voluptuous magazine. The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.Wellintentioned it may be but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery  the opening credits over an icy landscape the massive weather systems over the planet colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo snowstorms over India tidal waves  and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple kudos to Industrial Light and Magic Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved. So on that level it works the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies.And then there's the script  it has a whole load of characters but doesn't do much with any of them. Example Climatologist Dennis Quaid's relationship with son Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't seem to be as estranged as it's intended to be and similarly the friendship Quaid has with a longtime colleague gets about as much emphasis as the crush his younger colleague has on fellow scientist Tamlyn Tomita and the movie pays for it later on in a sequence shamelessly ripped off from Vertical Limit which has little of the emotional resonance it should. In fact all the human elements  Gyllenhaal's repressed feelings for classmate Emmy Rossum his doctor mother Sela Ward's problems with a young patient etc  all of them are underdeveloped or just plain undeveloped and some moments practically scream Contrived Climax Ahoy! Those moments are there because The Day After Tomorrow doesn't have an enemy as a natural outgrowth of its story the elements aren't really villainous as they have no concept of right or wrong and the closest thing to a villain here is the current administration in the White House so Emmerich and cowriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff have to impose a tangible enemy why else are those wolves there? on the proceedings. This does help things from getting totally boring in the second half though it's still pretty watchable even then  but if some more thought had been put into the screenplay like exploring the characters or developing the promising ideas therein like Americans fleeing to Mexico or further looks at the Government side it would have carried more weight and made the movie into more than an improvement on Godzilla. As it is it's a competently done if implausible attentionholder that wants to be more that it actually had the potential to be more makes it a bit of a disappointment but at least it's a watchable one.".

The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.Wellintentioned it may be but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery  the opening credits over an icy landscape the massive weather systems over the planet colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo snowstorms over India tidal waves  and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple kudos to Industrial Light and Magic Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved. So on that level it works the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies.And then there's the script  it has a whole load of characters but doesn't do much with any of them. Example Climatologist Dennis Quaid's relationship with son Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't seem to be as estranged as it's intended to be and similarly the friendship Quaid has with a longtime colleague gets about as much emphasis as the crush his younger colleague has on fellow scientist Tamlyn Tomita and the movie pays for it later on in a sequence shamelessly ripped off from Vertical Limit which has little of the emotional resonance it should. In fact all the human elements  Gyllenhaal's repressed feelings for classmate Emmy Rossum his doctor mother Sela Ward's problems with a young patient etc  all of them are underdeveloped or just plain undeveloped and some moments practically scream Contrived Climax Ahoy! Those moments are there because The Day After Tomorrow doesn't have an enemy as a natural outgrowth of its story the elements aren't really villainous as they have no concept of right or wrong and the closest thing to a villain here is the current administration in the White House so Emmerich and cowriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff have to impose a tangible enemy why else are those wolves there? on the proceedings. This does help things from getting totally boring in the second half though it's still pretty watchable even then  but if some more thought had been put into the screenplay like exploring the characters or developing the promising ideas therein like Americans fleeing to Mexico or further looks at the Government side it would have carried more weight and made the movie into more than an improvement on Godzilla. As it is it's a competently done if implausible attentionholder that wants to be more that it actually had the potential to be more makes it a bit of a disappointment but at least it's a watchable one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fastpaced exciting suspenseful film filled with wonderful images great CGI effects plausible acting and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of hisher seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are and I for one enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted this is a great popcorn movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is TYPICAL Hollywood. And by that I mean it's all glitz and glamour without any substance. Don't get me wrong the special effects are great although weather effects are easy to pull off at this point. But the movie has no point what so ever!!! Whatever little plot there is is terrible. Spoilers OK basically it goes like this Big storm comes and spreads around the world in a matter of days threatening humanity with the 2nd ice age. Storms destroy all the big cities blah blah blah Since the movie follows Sam Hall Jake Gyllenhaal most of it is set in New York. So NY gets hit with tidal waves and then it all freezes over and then you have everyone stuck in the NY public library. Not bad so far but that's it. Jack Hall Sam's father is some kind of weather expert specializing in Alaska and global warming so he predicts this whole storm. So when he finds out that his son is trapped in NY he WALKS drives to Philadelphia and then walks the rest of the way from Washington D.C. to NY in like two days All during this 2nd ICE AGE!!!!. No trying to stop the storm or anything he just WALKS. He's not even trying to save his son because he can't he just walks hundreds of miles to meet his son. That's it. Oh yeah and during the middle of the movie the kids trapped in the library in NY must venture out in the 'STORM' for medicine and as luck would have it or Hollywood overkill they're attacked by a pack of wolves that escaped from the zoo. And the wolves look TERRIBLE. The special effects for the weather are easy so that all looks great but these wolves looked horrible. Like these kids were being attacked by cartoon rejects from 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'They just made this movie cause they could make the effects... there was no thought put into anything else other than the effects. I've seen porno's with better story lines.".

The early disaster effects are typically top notch although I felt a huge chunk of ice falling on someone's head would have made them bleed!

They also seem quick to remove their facial protection without a care in the World.The other thing that makes you go uhmmm is that the temperature at one point is supposedly dropping at a rate of 10 degrees every SECOND yet it clearly takes the hero and his son and friends for that matter well over 10 seconds to get to safety. This despite earlier in the film someone in similar circumstances freezing on the spot in less than 3 seconds! oh and it was also cold enough to freeze aviation fuel but obviously American film stars have more in their veins than everyone else!? The temperature drops so fast that all the windows shatter uhmm except of course on the building where the stars are! either that or their room would have literally been snowed under like the rest of New York!. Added to the fact that their chimney seems to work despite being blocked by snow and ice surely if they hadn't frozen to death due to having no windows they'd have choked to death on the smoke flooding their room since it had nowhere to escape to this can be seen near the end because the hero can't even tell that he's reached his destination and you certainly can't see any smoke coming from where the chimney should be!.Oh and to cap it all once the hero finds his son bet you never thought he'd do it..YAWN! the sun miraculously appears as do hundreds of survivors! can anyone tell me how they'd survived in skyscrapers that had no windows and had been ravaged by tsunamis earlier int he film!??!All in all I found myself wishing that it had been an English film for then some reality may have been preserved.Sadly this film completely loses the plot half way through and all credibility goes out of the window.".

Yes it's very very farfetched  the whole thing  but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless.

This is bad enough like saying that setting fire to your house will help to keep your beer cold but in this movie the Ice Age takes only fifteen or twenty minutes to get started. You no sooner set a match to the gasolinesoaked drapes than the entire house is encased in ice. Oh yes and you are being hunted by wolves who escaped from the city zoo. These are the only animals that escaped from the zoo and as the snow got deeper and the temperatures lower they didn't have the sense to head South while they could.I really doubt that there could be such a thing as the snow superhurricanes as depicted in the movie but these were the chosen specialeffectsexmachina to jump start the glaciers. A hurricane is a heat engine driven by the accumulated warmth of the sun on tropical waters. What drives a supersnowcane? The answer to that one is easy A bad writer's overheated imagination. We get not one but three of these things all appearing overnight and sweeping down from the North Pole simultaneously. The one that hits New York also generates a storm surge.A real hurricane's storm surge is a dome of water under the eye of the storm. It's there because the air pressure in the eye is much lower than anywhere else. A storm surge might go eight to ten feet for a big hurricane. The supersnowcane generates a surge high enough to slap the face of the Statue of Liberty and submerge Manhattan. It comes in from the east The supercane winds would be pushing all the water the other way and arrives several minutes...sorry hours...or maybe days...before the eye of the storm does. The pacing in this movie is astonishing whenever it isn't simply unbelievable. I think the passage of time was sped up in order to cram as many really cool nay chillin' special effects into two hours as possible.The storm surge then does not leave. No it stays in Manhattan enjoying Times Square the Guggenheim and all the other cultural attractions for a while. Gravity cannot pull it away or perhaps the ecology is so unsettled that water can no longer flow downhill. A Russian supertanker joins in as another sightseer and then it all freezes solid. Sea water can apparently freeze in minutes.The New York supercane is monitored from space. The other two ravaging Europe and Siberia are apparently less interesting. At one point we are told that the temperatures at the eye of the supercane are dropping by ten degrees per second. Now it doesn't matter if the degrees are Fahrenheit or Centigrade. In less than a minute this storm will be freezing the air itself solid but this doesn't happen. Apparently the CGI budget could only go so far.This unprecedented disaster forces the evacuation of the entire US. No mention is made of what happened to the Canadians. In fact I don't think any mention at all is made of the Canadians. Maybe to them it was just a chilly Spring eh? Mexico on the other hand is mentioned a couple of times since all 300 million Americans seem to be trying to get there. Just how they get there is as unmentioned as the Canadians since early on we are told that neither planes nor trains can operate in the weather.

There's also a humble obesiance to all the Third World countries who so charitably took us all in. Got that? The US has been destroyed by its own arrogance and maybe now we'll appreciate subsistence farming and outdoor plumbing a lot more. The special effects were impressive but they followed each other so quickly and bewilderingly that it was a lot like being punched repeatedly in the head by Mike Tyson.

Buildings freezing and crumbling yet the people outside don't seem to be affected so much. The walk from Philadelphia to New York? And in record time no less. I do like the fact that they had the foresight to have Antarctic weather gear handy for just these occasions. What of the tent that was able to withstand the chill but not the Empire State building? Call your local Army Navy store....they really need to stock these tents. I also found it amazing that any lines of communications were not really affected including the under freezing water pay phone. The only ones who had communications losses were of course the main characters.....ah drama!! I know they were in a library but you think they could have possibly tried to burn all the wooden tables and chairs around them? Seems that they would burn warmer and for longer than books. The acting was horrific the directing was terrible the script was unbelievably bad and the special effects were anything but special. It certainly rates up there with Godzilla 2000 and Armageddon......it actually makes Independence Day look like one of the all time greats!".

In a scene involving the President we see the Seal of the President of the United States displayed prominently behind him in a random room  so the target audience would know who he was just in case the plot got too deep for them.Then another plot device is delivered as a Russian ship ends up right in front of the library where Sam and his cohorts are hiding out. Usually with a plot device you at least try to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than a plot device. Nope not in this movie! So someone has an infection and we need medicine. Well what do you know  THERE HAS TO BE MEDICINE IN THAT SHIP! clearly. And what do you know the bottle they need is the only one designated in English. These guys are very lucky. But wait some wolves that escaped a holding cell earlier happen to find the ship many miles away just as the kids are attempting to retrieve the medicine!!

	schema:reviewBody "The music during the opening credits is beautiful and the movie is full of great CGI but sadly that is all you can enjoy. Unfortunately there are so many flaws in the film from start to end that make it very implausible.1 Three scientists appeared working in Antarctica and they had an accident with an ice crack. One of them is stupid enough to jump 2 times crossing the crack just to get some stuff. It is impossible to walk on ice without hooks on your feet and even more impossible to jump!2 Dennis Quaid the main character predicts a kind of ice age during a global warming conference. It is too much coincidence that this cooling happens one day after.3 The weather changes are all over the north but all you can see about north is some places in US and a storm in Tokyo nothing else. What about the rest of Asia Europe and Canada!4 Dennis Quaid and his son Jake Gyllenhaal have an estranged relationship but this is not plausible. There is no character development. Jake Gyllenhaal is in love with his mate Emmy Rossum but there is not one bit of emotion in their eyes nothing.5 During tornadoes in L.A. and during all the movie people prefer to stare at the sky than to run and hide. There is a chopper flying over there! Helicopters cannot fly in those conditions!6 In this movie the vice president is more powerful than the president himself! The president almost does not exist.7 The young guys go to stay in a penthouse. Suddenly one of them wants to go and pick up his brother. ALL of them leave the penthouse. Why all of them? Then when the girl says Maybe we should just stay here Jake Gyllenhall answers No. We need to get home... HOME? I thought they were going to pick up the guy's brother!8 There is a kind of zoo scene. What kind of zoo is that where wolves can destroy the cages and escape?9 The cop needs a translator to save people who are trapped inside a car? No kidding!10 Laura was getting a bag for the French woman and the tsunami was going to beat. How brave was Jake Gyllenhall for running and telling Laura Hurry up!. He saved her life! Give me a break.11 Cell phones do not work but the pay phones underwater do?12 Jake Gyllenhall and the girl went to use the pay phone. He stays under water several seconds. The girl just waits for him to come back. If you were there you would probably dive and go for him!13 The girl finds a big wardrobe with many dry clothes. How can she find that place so quickly and in a library???14 In the library most people decide to go out and walk. The policeman encourages everybody to go out. It is OBVIOUS everybody will get frozen outside and where do they go walking?15 The people who stay in the library go to a fireplace to burn books and get warm... This is crazy! OK... Paper is combustible but not a good one! Paper only works to start the fire but not to keep it! In a library there are many chairs tables and bookshelves lots of furniture made in wood and still they prefer to burn books! These guys are supposed to be intelligent.16 This enormous library has just a lounge room for employees but not cafeteria? Can you believe that? They only have a couple of vending machines. They have a Gutenberg bible but not a cafeteria?17 More about intelligent nerds! The girl cut a leg very bad and she does not pay attention to that. She knows how to take care of her mate's body temperature but she just forgets her own hurt leg?18 They burn books to stay warm in the library. What about the smoke and oxygen? They stay in a place with all windows closed! How can they breath there? Writers forgot that fire consumes oxygen too? The chimney is blocked with tons of snow. Where does the smoke go?19 Dennis Quaid WALKS from Philadelphia to Manhattan in record time in the middle of a snowstorm with two coworkers. There is a risk scene about a rope that is clearly taken from another movie Vertical Limit. But here the scene is very unrealistic. They are walking on a glass roof the sled crashed the glass and the 3 people start falling then Dennis Quaid sticks a pick in the snow and stops the fall but the pick does not crash the glass!20 When the guys discovered the girl has a cut and she is in shock they diagnosed her health status and everything reading a book! Anyone can be a doctor!21 Why do these guys are so sure that there are medicines in the ship? And how do they find them so quickly?22 At the end Dennis Quaid character finally made it. But if you think for a while... what was the point of this? Just to keep his promise?23 Finally it seems the storm has gone but what about all the massive floods you are supposed to expect once the sun melt all those tons of snow?All in all it was entertaining but writers DO have to learn a little more before writing.".

Characters have a whole lot of potential if you completely ignore Dennis Quaid and there are some humorous moments in there. It's visually engaging and not too taxing on the ole noggin. I enjoyed the ending especially the fact that the so called first world now rely on the third world. So petty much an entertaining film HOWEVER.......The Bad Great plot story lines sht script. I mean REALLY! With some of the lines in that film I would sit there and just cringe. I understand that Emmerich or whoever worked on the script had less money to spend on writers and obviously more to spend on CGI but Oh.My.God! There also seems to be an obsession with the word 'cataclysmic'in this film again blame humiliating script. I mean why not try OTHER WORDS but I suppose the usage of the word cataclysmic over and over again was to attempt to make the plot 'seem' smarter. Somehow they failed that. But wait there's more crap...the science! Or lack thereof! What the hell are they talking about?! Some serious research should have been done into this and then maybe we wouldn't all be dying in the cinema aisles of shame.Plus the characters aren't given enough of a chance to develop and you get the feeling that Sam Hall doesn't really care for his mother and there is no explanation for why Jack Hall's character doesn't freeze to death. Does he only live through his magical powers as a lacklustre climatologist?The Ugly I guess the wolves?.....oh no Dennis Quaid's facial expressions. He has all of three expressions annoyed really annoyed and constipated. All in all it's good to watch if you ignore the stale script and even staler acting. Some characters are interesting but of course since the world of Roland Emmerich revolves around the Hall family we don't find out much about the other folk in the film like the billions that died instead there is more attention paid again to the Hall family and extra girl played by Rossum. God forbid Emmy Rossum should get septicaemia and almost die screw those others out there literally freezing to death and let's just focus on her and her weird American accent. Sigh Despite this there ARE some memorable moments and it has truly excellent CGI. I would still recommend watching it because despite it's many failings it is an entertaining movie. I gave it a rating of 8 purely because of Jake Gyllenhaal and the CGI. There I've said it. Watch it with suspended disbelief or when drunk. That way you can ignore certain Rhode Island wide plot holes. Enjoy.".

This movie not only was the most implausible film I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing but it redefines the phrase political agenda. Global Warming and climate change are the hot issues of the last few years so naturally the movie industry lends itself to spitting out irrelevant garbage about the subject. The main idea of the movie is that man is destroying the planet neglecting the environment and abusing nature....... SO MOTHER NATURE RETALIATES!!!!!! New York is flooded hit by massive tsunamis and frozen LA is decimated by tornadoes and three gigantic freezing land hurricane blizzards obliterate everything north of the equator. All because we have hit a critical desalinization point which is a fancy madeup Hollywood word for not enough salt in the ocean. You may be thinking wow this movie sounds pretty implausible but it gets better.... much better. All of these cataclysms happen in a number of days instead of the rather consistent million year cycles the earth generally operates on. In addition during the freezing of New York the buildings freeze from top to bottom which blatantly disregards the fact that heat rises. One may say you are taking this movie way too seriously but I think that movies like this are genuine problems for society. The political overtones in this movie are anything but subtle and now we're going to have a bunch of global warming activists running around that think bs like this could actually happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you like a good oldfashioned actionpacked Summer movie with a good story and scientific accuracy? Welp you best keep on looking because you won't find those ingredients in The Day After Tomorrow.This is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me Stephanie Mr. Shade and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I'll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they're used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1 Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head you see. That's just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he's jealous. Um when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here but it's easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam so wouldn't this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn't have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully the movie didn't get quite that extreme.2 This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3 You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue Looks like a hurricane. dramatic pause Only hurricanes DON'T FORM OVER LAND!4 The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5 Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in subzero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they're able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on but I think you get it. Ohhh and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library and he didn't show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said If I ever promise you that I'll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over then don't expect me to be there. Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story but it did nothing for me. Quaid should've just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would've been better than risking his and his partners' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie but I won't bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered so you better believe they'd be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called Communion in which he claims he was told of the Earth's upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that's who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you'll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch Dawn of the Dead to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I'd say they're on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There's so much more to make fun of but I'm gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie so there's a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You've been warned.The Day After Tomorrow is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey if you like movies with overwrought dialogue a lame attempt at a love story a severe lack of tension no emotional pull other than laughter less believability than Independence Day and one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a Summer blockbuster then this is the movie for you.Now if y'all will excuse me I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.".

Welp you best keep on looking because you won't find those ingredients in The Day After Tomorrow.This is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me Stephanie Mr. Shade and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I'll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they're used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1 Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head you see. That's just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he's jealous. Um when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here but it's easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam so wouldn't this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn't have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully the movie didn't get quite that extreme.2 This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3 You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue Looks like a hurricane. dramatic pause Only hurricanes DON'T FORM OVER LAND!4 The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5 Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in subzero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they're able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on but I think you get it. Ohhh and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library and he didn't show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said If I ever promise you that I'll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over then don't expect me to be there. Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story but it did nothing for me. Quaid should've just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would've been better than risking his and his partners' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie but I won't bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered so you better believe they'd be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called Communion in which he claims he was told of the Earth's upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that's who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you'll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch Dawn of the Dead to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I'd say they're on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There's so much more to make fun of but I'm gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie so there's a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You've been warned.The Day After Tomorrow is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey if you like movies with overwrought dialogue a lame attempt at a love story a severe lack of tension no emotional pull other than laughter less believability than Independence Day and one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a Summer blockbuster then this is the movie for you.Now if y'all will excuse me I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.";

Instead with TDAT I found a much darker more interesting film with real heart and a terrific if frightening message. The cast all excelled and characters that seemed destined to provide the film's mandatory cardboard cynics actually were given a chance to develop into something with a bit more depth and much more unexpected realisation. The story had sufficient pace as to keep me interested from the very atmospheric opening credits through to the dark if hopeful finale. It dealt with the epic scale of events wonderfully placing an orbiting space station into the story with helpless astronaut witnesses was a brilliant move but never lost sight of the characters and as much as the effects were on par if not better than anything I have ever seen it is some of the more character based moments that have stayed with me.Yet the effects! The tornado sequence in particular using a mixture of sweeping camera work on the ground point of view and news broadcast footage really gave me a sense that something wild and horrifying was happening. The scenes showing the icecovered aftermath were almost beautiful if not for the fact of what they meant. I felt an explanation for why the wall of water appeared and targeted New York went begging unless I missed something but aside from that I really lost sight of these images as artificial effects.I hate to say it but I wonder if the noninvolvement of Emmerich's long time producing partner Dean Devlin may have contributed to the fact that TDAT is a significantly higher quality film than ID4 Godzilla and Stargate.True this movie is not going to rewrite film lore or win consistent praise for its originality or artistic freshness but I really think that it is an extremely well made entry into the disasteraction thriller genre put together by a team who felt they had a great story to tell and top quality skills at hand to do it with. I understand it has not done as well in the US compared to its international success which I think is unfortunate. Among my friends and family who have seen it here is Australia all have come out buzzing with excitement. Even a few friends who normally avoid the genre have agreed that TDAT is fantastic.Mr Emmerich wherever you may be...you're on to something good here!".

She pulls off the cop with more than just problems. She beautiful tough and confused. Throughout a lot of the film she's in tears. She can act and be tough. Get her some scripts I wanna see this girl more often. The supporting cast is also great and each brings realism to their performances. Even though this film has dark characters and a dark subject matter the film is very light looking. The brightness of the film will grab from the start. The colors stand out and are hardly missed. The film has a action flick look but it's a thriller. It's a different mix that works extremely well. Oxygen is an well acted thriller that will drain you.

	schema:reviewBody "Good performances especially from Adrien Brody as a psychotic sadistic killer with a Houdini obsession and Maura Tierney as a cop make this film stand out.  The story is good but would have suffered in the hands of a less competent director and cast.  This is a movie that depends a lot on performance to deliver and it does.  Some of the supporting cast could have been played by better actors but they are serviceable and are mostly meant to occasionally prod the story along another notch.  On the whole the cast stays out of the way of Brody and Tierney who are the whole show.  It's definitely worth seeing and another one of those films that seemingly came out of nowhere as I never heard of it before.  I like solid B movies and this stands out as one of the best.  Its obscurity helps to conceal its surprises and it helps to be surprised with this movie.  I gave it an 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This made for TV psychological crime thriller exceeded my expectations.  The story begins with the abduction of a rich wife for ransom.  She is buried alive and her abductor sets about collecting the ransom for the location of her grave.  However this is really not the story but only the set up.  The real story is about what happens after he is caught as the police and the FBI race against time to get him to reveal where she's buried.Our sociopathic villain known to us only as Harry after his idol Harry Houdini is well prepared for the psychological cat and mouse game that follows as he had planned what he would do if he were caught.  The result is an effective though often superficial contest of psychological one upsmanship between Harry Adrien Brody and our heroine police detective Madeline Maura Tierney.The story has some noticeable plot flaws for a film that is attempting to be a serious crime drama.  Certain elements of Harry's escape attempts are implausible.  Much of the dialogue between the police officers and FBI agents was inane drivel that made them look like idiots.  There are other problems later in the story involving the buried wife that are also troubling.  These are not enough however to mar an otherwise well crafted plot.I was most impressed by the photography not just the look of the film but the way the images presented themselves.  Director Richard Shepard used the camera very creatively using objects in foreground and background to dramatize certain images.  There was an excellent shot of Madeline's reflection seen in extreme closeup in Harry's eye.  The handheld chase scenes made you feel like you were running behind the action.  This is a level of directing that is not normally seen on TV.  The whole film had a very raw real look.  Things were dirty and disorganized just like in real life rather than being carefully and symmetrically placed.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  The cops and the husband were generally pretty mediocre with moments of nausea.  Maura Tierney was good but didn't have the range to play Madeline effectively.  Madeline's character required a combination of tormented pathetic self abuser and case hardened cop.  Tierney was outstanding at the tormented side but came across as tentative and flaccid as the cop which was the greater part of the role.The best performance comes from Adrian Brody as Harry.  He was wry and unsophisticated while being just close enough to the edge to keep you guessing if he was cunning or just a psychopath.  He played the part with sarcastic disdain as if the character thought he was smarter than he really was which indeed was the case.Terry Kinney's character Madeline's cop husband Tim didn't give him much to work with.  He was a wimpy whining loser.  Kinney did an adequate job at this portrayal.I rated this movie 710.  For those who enjoy a psychological crime thriller it won't disappoint.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roaming around Hollywood Video's New Releases passing through theatre hits and theatre flops and the the unending list of directtovideo releases I found this. The story seemed like a good one and I was in a hurry for something so I decided to give it a whirl.The story is interesting. A middleaged woman Frances is walking her dog when she is approached by what seems like a mildmannered man. Before she knows it he flashes a gun dazes her by hitting her on the temple with it and smuggles her into a car with a friend. They drive out to the woods somewhere where she is terrified at the realization that they plan to bury her alive holding her hostage for her rich husband's money. They put her in the box the man's accomplice mercifully slipping her the flashlight and bury her leaving her to scream in terror.Move to New York City where a cop Madeline is made aware of the predicament. After witnessing a horrifying tape of Frances begging for help in the woods the police must plot to catch the kidnappers and find the woman all in twentyfour hours or Frances will run out of oxygen and die.I won't elaborate any more on the plot only that this movie was surprisingly good. When I noticed it was from APix I groaned and figured I was in for an hour and a half of trash. But then I saw the breathtaking first few minutes and I was shocked. If anything those first three to five minutes are terrifying. As Frances is being buried she is screaming and begging struggling to survive lying in that wooden box as the cover is being slipped on with only a flashlight to depend upon. And even though the copspursuingtheantagonist plotline is overused it was quite tense especially when you realize that there are only twentyfour hours to solve the mystery of where Frances is and the kidnapper is not interested in talking while his accomplice is nowhere to be found. Yes there are flaws. The script is quite bad with some lines that I can't believe they wrote in. For some reason I liked the FBI agent's monologue on the death penalty a la lethal injection but a lot was pretty bad. Maura Tierney was somewhat convincing as the main cop playing a Bmovie's Clarice Starling. The actor who played Francis's husband was a bit campy. Adrian Brody the kidnapper was pretty good if not a little tough to believe. The one who outacted them all was Laila Robins who played Francis. Her role is quite small only because there's a lot of restrictions with laying in a box underground for the most of the movie. But she was so convincing. My favorite scene is when the flashlight is dying and she is screaming and begging for it to live a little longer because as we learn early on she is afraid of the dark. I swear I felt like I was her and I couldn't believe how empathetic I was of her. Her acting reminded me of Marylin Burn's stellar performance as Sally in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. She conveyed the emotions of the situation very well. I think that's why I felt so bad for her.Overall I recommend finding this. No it's not the best thing ever made but it is very good and quite intense. Check it out!".

A thriller that offers great performances from a lesser known cast chases twists and turns and an overall satisfying story.Director Richard Shepard had offers of a larger budget but it would have meant having it done the way the higherups in suits would have wanted it done.  By managing to get several producers on the project he was allowed to do the film the way he wanted and actually pulled off a fun thriller on a little over a million dollars for the budget. A wealthy sociallite is kidnapped buried alive and a ransom is demanded to reveal her locationbut she has less than 24 hours that is if the air in her makeshift coffin lasts that long.  There's a lot of talking going on in the process of saving her but hey figure how it would happen in real life and for those looking for some thinking material as well as thrills this plot works just fine.  Besides to me the most terrifying thing I can imagine is suffocating or drowning and the idea of being buried alive like in this film is genuinely creepy.Maura Tierney plays the cop role with much seriousness Adrien Brody is so off kilter you forget he's actually a decent guy in real life as revealed on the DVD's audio commentary but big points go to Laila Robins as the woman buried aliveher character is so convincing she makes you feel uneasy to the point of squirming in your seat.  There's a stunning car chase as well to satisfy action enthusiasts but it's within context and not just another cheap thrill to fill up time.  And just when you think things are about to finish a really big wrench is thrown in to twist the story even more and have you thinking Wait just a darn minute....I found viewing the DVD a much more satisfying experience as you get the widescreen version and better quality picture.  The audio commentary is quite informative and even informal as the director points out a tiny judgment mishap in which a scene was shot early with the actors wearing jackets but the rest of the film surrounding that scene everyone is made to look like they're sweating from the hot weather.  Considering I was originally enthralled with the story I really didn't notice that until listening to the commentary.  The DVD also has an interesting storyboard sequence for the car chase scene with commentary.  For a lesser known film with a small budget there was quite a bit of care put in this release.Give yourself a treat and check this film out.  Consider this  Sometimes it's more fun to try a film that's not a big market blockbuster instead of having to only go with a top 10 title.  Just because a film has big stars and is pushed as a hot new release in a video store doesn't mean anything goodness haven't you learned that by now folks?.  Oxygen is one of those great little surprises that will have you saying Gee why didn't I give this one a try earlier?".

	schema:headline " Tell me does your purple little husband lend you some of his tampons? Nice enough thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Oxygen starts one sunny afternoon in New York City as Frances Hannon Laila Robins is walking her pet dog around the block a man Adrien Brody approaches her a begins to chat to her at first he seems a pleasant  charming young man but he soon changes as he becomes aggressive he threatens her  makes her get into a nearby car. He  his accomplice Michael Henderson drive off to a wood where they bury Frances alive in a wooden coffin she has about 24 hours worth of air left  the clock is ticking... Detective Madeline Foster Maura Tierney  her partner Jesse Paul Calderon are called onto the task force to find Frances  apprehend her kidnappers. They are both briefed Frances rich husband Clarke James Naughton has received a videotape that demands he pay a 1000000 ransom or Frances will be left to suffocate  die an agonising  terrifying death. The money drop off goes OK until the kidnapper figures out the police are watching him Foster has no choice but to arrest him without the knowledge of where Frances is  once in custody he refuses to say anything will Frances be found in time before she runs out of air  why does her young kidnapper seem so clam almost as if he is enjoying himself or maybe there are other less clear motives behind the events of the previous day...Written coproduced  directed by Richard Shepard I thought Oxygen was a nice tight taut little thriller that isn't the sort of thing I usually like but it has a certain something about it. The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping  absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police  FBI although I have to say once Harry is arrested  stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably. I would say that what Oxygen deals with is what many would consider their worst nightmare being buried alive  slowly running out of air  perhaps more could have been done with this concept as it concentrates a little too much on the games played by Harry with the authorities. One more thing Harry's precise  exact plans rely far too much on luck  things he simply has no control over to make me convinced that he could have come up with such an elaborate  implausible scheme. I mean his whole plan is based on the fact that he would be placed in one room in that they would handcuff him in a certain way  that he would definitely be able to pick the locks that they would agree with his demands to the absolute letter  that there is a air conditioning vent in the room just big enough to crawl through  that he could actually reach it as well as being able to keep total control over a hostage so they don't raise the alarm. That's an awful lot of coincidences  a whole lot of luck as well. The character's are well developed  fleshed out they have a little bit more depth than usual I loved the monologue about the lethal injection from the FBI agent who was meant to be intimidating.Director Shepard does an OK job without being particularly outstanding as a whole Oxygen is a little bland  forgettable but the solid story should paper over the lacklustre visuals. The film lacks any real tension or excitement but it does retain ones interest throughout again thanks to the story. There isn't any violence to speak of except a gory gunshot wound at the end.Technically Oxygen is OK it's competently made there are a few nice New York shots  a couple of minor car chases although there isn't much action as it's a dialogue  storyline driven film. The acting is good especially from the two leads Tierney as the cop  the effective Brody as the cold calculating villain.Oxygen is a good thriller it's short on action or violence but it has a good strong story to compensate. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.".

The film starts out entertaining and actionpacked but then there is strange character development between the two leads that doesn't make much sense.

After viewing this film you may need oxygen and a shower.The plot is not that original either it was done much better on TV shows like Top Cops and CSI The complete script is totally unrealistic and has very little to do with either the criminal intent to make money or psychological need to show how smart and clever one could be.

First I'd Like to point out that the performances by Tierney and Brody are not why this movie does not work for me. Two fine actors to say the least. The biggest problem among others is that in order to make many of the scenes work they had to make the cops really REALLY stupid. Morons in fact! About midway through the movie and I did watch it to the end unfortunately an old sitcom called Hogans Heroes came to mind. You remember they had to make the Germans incredibly dumb in order to give we Americans a few laughs. Well I guess the directors andor writers forgot that this DOES NOT WORK IN A SERIOUS MOVIE! Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time. Watch only if you have nothing else to do OR possibly while your doing something else LOL. I would have given this flick a BIG FAT ZERO if they'd let me. So I had to give it 1 star. sigh".

First I'd Like to point out that the performances by Tierney and Brody are not why this movie does not work for me. Two fine actors to say the least. The biggest problem among others is that in order to make many of the scenes work they had to make the cops really REALLY stupid. Morons in fact! About midway through the movie and I did watch it to the end unfortunately an old sitcom called Hogans Heroes came to mind. You remember they had to make the Germans incredibly dumb in order to give we Americans a few laughs. Well I guess the directors andor writers forgot that this DOES NOT WORK IN A SERIOUS MOVIE! Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time. Watch only if you have nothing else to do OR possibly while your doing something else LOL. I would have given this flick a BIG FAT ZERO if they'd let me. So I had to give it 1 star. sigh";

	schema:reviewBody "I was impressed when I first saw this. Not only is the story packed with suspense  a kidnapped woman has been buried with a day's worth of air and it's the cops' job to find out where she is before she suffocates  but the performances are better than what we've come to expect from yarns about the police. Furthermore not ONCE is detective Maura Tierney asked to hand over her badge and gun! In fact Maura Tierney is quite alright. She's a decent actress and she's right for the part of a policewoman so guiltridden that she has a secret lover who burns her with cigarettes and otherwise torments her. She's not a glamor puss either and I liked that too. Julia Roberts would have spoiled it not through any lack of talent but simply because of her refulgent beauty.Adrian Brody was a big surprise too. He's the character who buried the young woman alive killed his accomplice for no particular reason and now sits in the interrogation room being alternately bullied and cosseted by the police and the FBI in order to get him to squeal about the victim's burial place. He has the face of a Dead End Kid and the whining contemptuous demeanor of a spoiled brat. It's a hoot when the FBI takes over the case the menacing agent enters the room surveys the ironbound Brody and goes into this detailed spiel about how horrible it is to die from a lethal injection. Brody listens impassively for a few minutes then looks up with a twisted smile and remarks What a stupid monologue. It's all so taut that you get caught up in the story but it doesn't hold up well on a second viewing. First you can't help noticing that there is a formulaic car chase through the streets of Manhattan and that it's lifted straight out of The French Connection. The two drivers glare at each other and try to bump each other's car off the street while angrily yanking at the wheel.Then you notice that as a matter of fact the whole film is modeled on The Silence of the Lambs. Brody is a proletarian Hannibal Lecter  smart savvy able to scan others for their weaknesses and then exploit them an escape artist of a high degree. He teases the hell out of the cops especially Maura Tierney. He promises to give her some hints if she'll tell him how she came by those cigarette burns on her arms.The problem is that Hannibal Lecter had a genuine reason for probing Jody Foster's psyche. He'd been penned up in solitary for years. And his curiosity was boundless. I mean you MUST have curiosity as well as brains to endure the grueling routine of medical school then psych internship then years of private practice. But Brody's villain has no such motivation. He's as clever as a sewer rat but what does he get out of Maura Tierney's confession? Unlike Jody Foster's Big Reveal about the slaughter of the lambs Tierney's isn't even particularly interesting. It's written flatly and Tierney doesn't bring it off.There's another thing that impressed me as slightly off on a second viewing. Maura Tierney commits homicide. She holds a gun on Brody lying helpless in a pit and she decides to bury him alive so she starts kicking dirt into the hole. But in the face of Brody's feculent mocking  Oh yeah bury me gimme more MORE!  she shoots him in the chest and kills him. That's not acting as an agent of justice. That's revenging yourself on someone for reasons of personal hatred and it's usually called murder.".

One of the best aspects of this flick is the character each represents  two of the most weirdly fascinating this side of Dennis Hopper and his companions Blue Velvet or the cult classic Rory Calhoun opus Motel Hell. Brody as the youthful sort of nerdyyetwicked braceswearing nefarious villain and Tierney as the competent dedicated tough detective with her strange compulsive secretive nocturnal predilections sort of a masochistic savant. Perhaps not great and with some contrasting moments. Sometimes the cops here were more realistic and lowkey than in most of this type of movie fare and at others were the types of doophuses we see regularly enforcing the law in these flicks.Allinall a good 7 presentation and not a bad way to spend the two hours' viewing.As a sort of imaginary subplot I couldn't help visualizing from earlyon I was hoping that Brody and Tierney might meetup at some point  the confrontation between the quintessential sadist and masochist respectively. I thought of dialog between them replicating a joke I once heard the masochist says to the sadist Hit me! or alternatively Hurt me!. The sadist replies NO!! When they finally met in the interrogation room there were a couple of occasions when I thought this just might occur.".

The animated links specially created for the movie are funny and well puttogether and new versions of Killer Cars and the story of the Spot are excellent.

It was nothing but their best and most silliest skits from their first two seasons of their British TV sketch show Monty Python's Flying Circus from BBC television. By that there's no real systematic narrative here unlike in their later efforts in 'The Holy Grail' and 'Life of Brian'. It's made up of a selection of individual skits which were mostly hilarious even though two or three fall short but it moves along swiftly that you get caught up in the comically cheeky and downright nonsensical humour that had me mostly in stitches. There appealing ludicrousness bellows stupidity but its done in a straight face which makes it more the merrier. A lot of it makes fun at its own expense but also mocks that of political correctness and Americanism. They were so clever in the way structured it and it stills stands up rather well today. But a quick warning their humour is an acquired taste that's for sure.Some of these ambitious skits and segments are real ball ranging from the lumberjack song The dead parrot The upper class twit of the year Killer cars Blackmail Hungarian in the cigarette shop the lion tamer and so much more. My favourite of the lot would be the Mountaineer expedition sign up. Going on throughout the film is Terry Gilliam's stunning and ultimately inventive cartoons which catch the eye and imagination. The animation is that of high standards and adds a whole new dimension to the silliness! You could see this eye for detail when he directed such flicks like 'Brazil' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. The boys involved John Cleese Terry Jones Eric Idle Graham Chapman Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam are nothing but entertaining in whatever they decide to come up with by giving us a real good laugh.This landmark comedy team is always a delight to behold. A must see for any fan though I doubt they haven't seen it already.".

But it was not. For one thing it was badly promoted  John Cleese remembers seeing a strange poster of a grinning snake with a hat on. Just the sort of thing calculated to set boxoffice tills ringing of course  and anyway the Americans were hardly likely to go and see a film based on a show which  at that point  they had not seen.'And Now' is an anthology of sketches from the first two 'Monty Python' series. Unlike 'The Best Of Benny Hill'  which reused original television material  these were remakes. They included 'Crunchy Frog' 'Upper Class Twit Of The Year Show' 'Marriage Guidance Councillor' 'The Lumberjack Song' 'Sir George Head' 'Hungarian Phrase Book' 'Blackmail' 'SelfDefence Class' 'Nudge Nudge' and 'Hell's Grannies'.Some of the items benefited from the move to film such as 'Funniest Joke In The World' while others fell flat most notably 'The Parrot Sketch'. Michael Palin was to have reprised his role as the disgusting 'Ken Shabby' but Lownes insisted that the sequence be dropped.Terry Jones' Nude Organist is seen for the first time he went on to become a regular feature of the series.The Pythons came to regard the film as an embarrassment as it was basically a rehash of old material but it was successful in establishing that Python humour could work on the big screen. When they made 'Holy Grail' three years later they were much more confidant and selfassured.In the days before the availability of Python on video and D.V.D. this film was the only reminder of the group's genius. Now its somewhat redundant but still worth viewing.Funniest moment  tough one this. I'll go for Palin's rendition of 'The Lumberjack Song' mainly because I love the shocked looks on the faces of the mounties as the full meaning of the lyrics hits home. Oh and Connie Booth is sexy too! One complaint though  how on Earth did they manage to leave out the 'Ministry Of Silly Walks'?".

Just the sort of thing calculated to set boxoffice tills ringing of course  and anyway the Americans were hardly likely to go and see a film based on a show which  at that point  they had not seen.'And Now' is an anthology of sketches from the first two 'Monty Python' series. Unlike 'The Best Of Benny Hill'  which reused original television material  these were remakes. They included 'Crunchy Frog' 'Upper Class Twit Of The Year Show' 'Marriage Guidance Councillor' 'The Lumberjack Song' 'Sir George Head' 'Hungarian Phrase Book' 'Blackmail' 'SelfDefence Class' 'Nudge Nudge' and 'Hell's Grannies'.Some of the items benefited from the move to film such as 'Funniest Joke In The World' while others fell flat most notably 'The Parrot Sketch'. Michael Palin was to have reprised his role as the disgusting 'Ken Shabby' but Lownes insisted that the sequence be dropped.Terry Jones' Nude Organist is seen for the first time he went on to become a regular feature of the series.The Pythons came to regard the film as an embarrassment as it was basically a rehash of old material but it was successful in establishing that Python humour could work on the big screen. When they made 'Holy Grail' three years later they were much more confidant and selfassured.In the days before the availability of Python on video and D.V.D. this film was the only reminder of the group's genius. Now its somewhat redundant but still worth viewing.Funniest moment  tough one this. I'll go for Palin's rendition of 'The Lumberjack Song' mainly because I love the shocked looks on the faces of the mounties as the full meaning of the lyrics hits home. Oh and Connie Booth is sexy too! One complaint though  how on Earth did they manage to leave out the 'Ministry Of Silly Walks'?";

The Funniest Joke in the World is a great laugh unless you're German in which case view with caution.

Come to think of it everyone likes a laugh more than I do. The best Highlights of the movie have to be The mountaineering expedtion sketch the 'How to defend yourself against fresh fruit sketch' and 'How Not To Be Seen!' The sketches they should have included are Spot The Loony and Mr Gumby's Brain consultaion with the supposed surgery. But as it stands its funny. A bit silly but funny. And Now For Something Completely Different a man with three buttocks!";

Several isolated times a stern and sober British Army officer is interpolated and announces to the viewers that this isn't worth watching because it's silly  just silly. I ruefully found myself often agreeing.I don't suppose there's any point in trying to outline a plot because there is none. It's a series of sketches evidently gotten from their TV show. I first heard the dead parrot sketch on the radio and thought it was hilarious. Now seeing it on the screen it seems to have lost much of its voltage. Nor did I find it so amusing when a despondent man leaves a building stops to think for a moment and a huge iron weight falls on him and he splats under it.It's possible that this particular material is already familiar so that watching the film is like hearing a joke for the second or third time. It's also likely that it doesn't seem so fresh or amusing because some of it is dated. The movie was put together in 1971 when much of Western society was in turmoil  race riots in the streets an unpopular war in a country no one could identify on a blank map gays screaming out of the closet widespread sexual indulgence bloodshed in Northern Ireland pop tunes encouraging revolution that sort of thing. But it's all gone or at least abated today. So the Granny gangs don't resonate the way they did at the time. At the same time the upperclass twit sketch still gets laughs. I mean hunting live rabbits that are staked out and spreadeagled on the ground! Trying to commit suicide by shooting one's self  and missing. I'm laughing now just rerunning it in my mind.Each of their four features were to improve monotonically with The Meaning of Life nearing perfection of the style. That last one is mature. Well mature for Monty Python. And it's both engaging and carries a covert theme of the utmost seriousness. The Granny Gangs are long gone but questions about the meaning of life or the absence of meaning still plague us.".

It would ruin the whole idea to have some of the jokes rewritten to appeal to a wider audience. The Pythons have always had the attitude that either you get them or you don't.Both Carol Cleveland and the former Mrs. Cleese Connie Booth make appearances as in the TVseries and Terry Gilliam's animation is only slightly remodeled from the originals. So what can you say? Was it a bad idea to reproduce the skits  maybe. But to see the Pythons in full swing is always a pleasure so who cares? Maybe there will be a new Python reunion movie minus the late Graham Chapman of course and that would probably be a lot worse. It is better to remember them when they were in top form and here they certainly are.".

The funny thing is that I haven't seen that many episodes of Monty Python. There are just so many online clips I've seen. There's actually a funny story behind that.The creators of Monty Python were aware that people were putting their sketches on YouTube and tried an experiment. They decided that for awhile they would allow people to post sketches and see if it would hurt their DVD sales. The sales actually went up and you can see them on YouTube! My favorite year would probably be the self defense against fruit. The show still did it better though. Hard to not like anything with these guys. 12".
