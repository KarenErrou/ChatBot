	schema:headline " Clearing Up The Confusing Plot Line";
	schema:reviewBody "Many viewers of The Seventh Victim find the plot confusing.  My comment may explain why and help clear up the matter.The Seventh Victim was intended as an A film but four scenes that had been photographed were edited out as Victim was cut to a B film's running time of 71 minutes.  This was a result of Lewton insisting that Mark Robson who'd never directed a film before direct this one.  The studio brass didn't want Robson and gave Lewton a choice get rid of Robson or lose the Apicture budget.  Lewton chose Robson.Following are the four scenes that were cut.  Were they still in the film the film's plot would make more sense than it now does.Scene 1  Gregory Ward visits Mary at the day care center where she works. In this scene Mary admits It would be easier if Jacqueline were dead. At the beginning of the scene which remains in the pictureof Judd visiting MaryMary's supervisor says to her Aren't you the popular one?  You've a visitor again the last word making it clear she'd had an earlier visitor Ward whom we don't see because of the cut.Scene 2  Trying to discover what the Palladists have as a hold on Mary Judd visits Mrs. Cortez pretending to be interested in joining the group. Two points are made in this conversation between Judd and Mrs. Cortez a That if good exists evil exists and one is free to choose.  b Mrs. Cortez became a Palladist because Life has betrayed us.  We've found that there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evil's sake.Scene 3  Judd makes a second longer visit to Mrs. Cortez indicating that he is ready to join the Palladists.  In this conversation Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming house.  This lets us know how the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room in order to kidnap her.  In the truncated print viewers haven't a clue as to how the Palladists found Jacqueline.Scene 4  A final scene which followed Jacqueline's suicide.  Mary Gregory and Jason meet at the Dante restaurant.  Gregory and Mary go off together leaving Jason standing before the restaurant's mural of Dante and Beatrice making clear his failure as an artist and lover he says I am alive yet every hope I had is dead.  Death can be good.  Death can be happy.  If I could speak like Cyrano...then perhaps you might understand.In the British release print Jason recites the entire Lord's Prayer to the Palladists while only two lines of the Prayer remain in the American print which is the one usually shown.I run to death and death meets me as fastAnd all my pleasures are like yesterday are from Donne's Holy Sonnet 1 lines 3 and 4.  I believe the film credits them to Donne's Holy Sonnet 7.Details about Lewton insisting on Robson as director and the cutting of these four scenes can be found in Fearing the Dark The Val Lewton Career by Edmund G. Bansak McFarland and Val Lewton The Reality of Terror by Joel E. Siegel Viking.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a longtime booster of The Cat People I tended to give the credit to its director Jacques Tourneur later to helm Out of the Past.  Seeing The Seventh Victim also from Val Lewton's Bmovie unit at RKO changed all that.  It seems Lewton was the resident genius cobbling together stylish horrorsuspense films on shoestring budgets.  The young Kim Hunter away at a private school learns that her tuition hasn't been paid because her sister owner of a beauty empire has disappeared.  She leaves school and starts scouring New York's Greenwich Village also the locale of much of The Cat People only to uncover a cult of devil worshipers.  Lewton's thrillers haven't dated the way James Whale's for instance have possibly because they depend so heavily on suggestion the literalness of today's horror films is completely alien to these suggestive truly chilling films.  The RKO Bmovie unit under Lewton was also probably a major influence on the look of film noir soon to become the cuttingedge aesthetic in American movies.  This is as tense and satisfying a 75 minutes as you'll find until the MannAlton team's seminal noirs of a few years later.".

Her demeanor was so melancholy... One minute I was frightened for her life and felt very sad for her. The next minute I was afraid of her! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has appreciation for black and white films.

Also Tom Conway was in this and two other top horror films of the 40sI Walked With A Zombie and Cat People.This is one of the very lowbudget horror films that producer Val Lewton made for RKO in the 1940s. He was given only B actors to work with and zero money but he turned in some true classics. He used darkness and shadow very effectively making some of the creepiestlooking sets on film. Also he NEVER showed anything explicitlyhe always kept the monsters or violence off screen and just suggested at it. It works beautifully. This movie is the least known of all of them probably because of the subject matter but it's probably the best one. The plot and themes are handled matteroffactly and the sets are truly eerie. The performances are all lowkey perfectly fitting the script. Even the obligatory love story shoehorned in works. There's also a VERY bizarre shower sequence and a grim ending.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Seventh Victim on TV when I was a highschool teenager in New Jersey in 1960.  I had no film knowledge no idea of who Val Lewton was. Our local station Channel 9 had the rights to the RKO film library and simply tossed The Seventh Victim into a 90minute timeslot a 71 minute movie interrupted every 10 minutes with a blast of commercials.  Even so seeing this movie under the worst possible circumstances I was nonetheless hypnotized by its eerie morbid downright shocking handling of a fairly typical thriller premise  A young girl the luminous Kim Hunter in her first film is informed by the staff of the Catholic girls' school she attends that her sister who lives in New York City and owns a thriving women's fragrance emporium has not paid her tuition bills for several months and has apparently vanished. Ms. Hunter goes to Manhattan to find her sister whom she traces to the West Village where the rest of the story is set.  A trustful kindhearted innocent girl suddenly thrust into a series of increasingly frightening situations populated by a huge cast of supporting characters and nobody is quite what meets the eye Ms. Hunter and the viewer are sent down a series of dark alleys that eventually culminate in the most terrifying nerveneedling shocking ending of any film I have ever seen. The Seventh Victim has stayed in my mind and haunted my dreams ever since I first saw it.  I now live in New York and have scoured the West Village for the locations of the scenes in The Seventh Victim which of course was shot on the RKO Greenwich Village backlotbut is a perfect replica of the deceptively beautiful West Village as it appears even today cobblestoned streets majestic townhouses converted into brownstone apartments cozy familyrun Italian restaurants and the most colorful fascinating complex and entrancing people you'll neet anywhere in the entire world. This mis en scene is captured perfectly in The Seventh Victim which another reviewer on this website so perfectly described as a series of Edward Hopper paintings brought to sinisteryet alluring blackandwhite life. I won't go into plot details since they have been wellcovered by other IMDB reviewers.  Hitchcock obviously saw this film and used its terrifying shower scene for the centerpiece of Psycho. To this day this modest unpretentious offbeat chiller remains relatively unknown except for filmbuffs yet when I showed it to my guests at a dinner party a few years ago they gradually fell under its creepily hypnotic spell and towards the end when Ms. Hunter's sister is stalked by an unknown killer on the darkened Village streets a quick camera shot of the stalker reaching into his pocket and pulling out a switchblade made three of my guests scream How The Seventh Victim ever got past the censors in 1943 I'll never know I've read that the film had a strong lesbian undertone that drove the members of the Hays Office into cardiac arrest. Whether this is true or not I have no idea nor do I care. The artists who made The Seventh Victim created a true work of arta poetic chilling ravishing masterpiecea pretentious word I've never applied to any other movie but will without hesitation apply to the most intelligent audacious and spellbinding movie I have ever seen.".

	schema:headline " Nice movie shame about the script";
	schema:reviewBody "This is sometimes cited as Lewton's best movie. It has some of his best scenes and is his darkest and most despairing work. It is undoubtedly haunting but exemplifies his one slight weakness his poor story sense. He doesn't always tell a story coherently and doesn't always tell a coherent story.I appreciate that scenes have been cut and that the screenplay makes slightly more sense than the movie but it is still poorly constructed and needed a complete rewrite to realise its full potential. There are a number of problems.Firstly whose story is this supposed to be? Initially there is no doubt. It is Mary's story.It starts with her trying to trace her missing sister Jacqueline. We follow her from school to New York. She meets her sister's business parter whose assistant directs Mary to a restaurant where Jacqueline has been seen. Mary goes there and learns that Jacqueline took a room but has never lived in it. She enters the room and sees the noose. She goes to the missing persons bureau where she is accosted by a private detective August who offers to help. She declines but his suggestions lead her to check the morgue. There she learns that Gregory Ward has already asked after Jacqueline. This leads her to his office and their first meeting. Next August turns up again and takes Mary to the perfume factory where he is killed. She runs off but sees August's body being carried away on a subway train.At this point we have followed Mary for about twenty five minutes and the movie has been told almost entirely from her viewpoint. We only know what she knows. However we then cut to Louis Judd in Ward's office who says that Jacqueline is alive and under his protection. The perspective has abruptly changed and for the first time the audience is getting ahead of Mary.Mary has a couple more important scenes but has less and less to do as the investigation proceeds. Increasingly the detective work is done by the men. It is almost like a relay race Mary passes the baton to Ward who passes it to Jason Hoag who passes it to Judd. Mary becomes ever more marginal to her own story.Later the perspective abruptly switches again  from the pursuers to the cultists and we suddenly have a scene in which none of the protagonists is present and the audience gets information that they do not have. The baton has been passed again. Finally when Jacqueline has been reunited with her sister she takes over the story and the perspective switches to that of a character to whom we have only just been introduced.These transitions are so illprepared that the movie just doesn't seem to flow properly. This is exacerbated by a related problem. Individual scenes do not follow through on what has gone before and the dialogue frequently good often misses the point. For example why does Ward not immediately tell Mary he and Jacqueline are married. There is no plot reason for this. Why do they talk so little about Jacqueline? Why doesn't Mary ask any of the obvious questions? Again after Mary has witnessed the death of August why does she not immediately go to the police? This has changed everything. It is no longer a matter of tracing a missing person  it is murder. But noone reacts as if there is now a real threat if they continue with their investigations.Part of the problem is that Lewton is so afraid of of clich that important points are barely hinted at. Hoag and Ward are both in love with Mary but the movie is so reticent that this never registers and we would scarcely have guessed it without being told. This doesn't need dialogue a simple look would have done but everyone is so subdued that there is little for the audience to pick up on. Similarly the cultists are treated so discreetly that we see nothing about them that might have attracted a sensationseeker like Jacqueline or that might remotely justify her having to die.I also feel that the screenplay is cluttered with surplus characters. Do we really need three private detectives? Couldn't the characters of Judd and Hoag have been combined in some way? What is the point of Hoag? Overall there are seven different characters searching for Jacqueline not to mention the cultists.The flow of the story is also disrupted by the two big scare scenes that seem to have been inserted simply to allow the movie to be marketed as a horrorthriller. The death of August comes too early in the story and creates problems of plausibility thereafter. The stalking of Jacqueline seems to be there only because these 'walk in the dark' scenes had become a trademark of the RKO horror film. In context it makes no sense. She refuses to commit suicide runs away from her assassin meets Mimi and decides to commit suicide after all.Finally what the hell has been going on in Jacqueline's life? When did she go missing? Where has she been all the time? How many times did the cultists capture her? It is pointless going on. The screenplay is a hopeless muddle.This is frustrating because a rewrite could have fixed these problems and there is more than enough in the movie to show it could easily have been the masterpiece that some already think it is.".

	schema:headline " Dreary Atmospheric Nihilistic  Ahead of Its Time.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Seventh Victim follows Mary Gibson Kim Hunter who would later win an Oscar for her performance in A Streetcar Name Desire with Marlon Brando a naive and kind orphaned young woman who receives notice that her older sister Jacqueline Jean Brooks has vanished. In a search for her missing sister Mary heads to Manhattan where Jacqueline was last seen. But during her investigation she winds up witnessing a murder and uncovers some dark secrets about her sister like the Satanworshipping cult that she belonged to which may have something to do with her random disappearance. As time begins to race Mary must find her sister and save her from whatever impending doom awaits her.Truly ahead of its time The Seventh Victim is a littleknownof horror film that emerged from RKO Radio Pictures in the 1940s and was horror filmmaker Val Lewton's first production. What I find surprising about this film is how it still stands as a fairly original story even to this day  over sixty years after it was originally made. Sure the Sataniccult scenario has been dealt with again and again but I think it's safe to say that this was probably one of the first if not the first film to deal with the subject and it does so in a fairly unique manner. Surprisingly the audience is even able to sympathize with the cult members despite their nihilistic cold belief system and insistence on a person's suicide to compensate for a 'betrayl' against them because they seem so human. All the relationships in the film feel genuine and that is likely part of the script working well as well as the acting.A handful of great scenes stick out from the film probably the most famous being the chilling scene in the latenight subway ride where Mary witnesses something extremely scary. Also wellnoted would be the scare scene in the hallway with Mary and the investigator as well as the bizarre shower discussion that has been noted for preceding Hitchcock's Psycho. Director Mark Robson makes use of shadows corners and dark alleyways all effective pieces in the oldtime urban Manhattan setting. Kim Hunter is extremely likable as Mary and Jean Brooks is stunning as her mysterious missing sister Jacqueline. Tom Conway is also notable for his performance which he plays quite well. Now I do have a few small problems with the script  I felt it needed a bit of touchingup in areas to clarify things a little better because I had to watch the film twice to catch onto certain elements that I should have noticed in the first viewing. Then again this movie is notorious for having many cuts made to it resulting in its modest 71 minute running time. You also have to keep your eye out for the ending too because the film ends fairly quickly but its final implications are shuddering.But besides the small script problems I have no complaints here. The Seventh Victim is a classic oldtime chiller that still holds up well today. While the scare factor may be diminished by time I still personally found the movie to be scary because of it's bleak and unsettling atmosphere and it's main subject being that of an underground Satanic cult. There's something about this movie that draws you in and doesn't let you go. Wellbuilt characters sufficiently dark and moody atmosphere an interesting subject matter scary as well and a handful of spooky scenes make this a classic horror film. If you are a fan of horror films from the golden age The Seventh Victim is not one you will want to pass up. 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Seventh Victim follows Mary Gibson Kim Hunter who would later win an Oscar for her performance in A Streetcar Name Desire with Marlon Brando a naive and kind orphaned young woman who receives notice that her older sister Jacqueline Jean Brooks has vanished. In a search for her missing sister Mary heads to Manhattan where Jacqueline was last seen. But during her investigation she winds up witnessing a murder and uncovers some dark secrets about her sister like the Satanworshipping cult that she belonged to which may have something to do with her random disappearance. As time begins to race Mary must find her sister and save her from whatever impending doom awaits her.Truly ahead of its time The Seventh Victim is a littleknownof horror film that emerged from RKO Radio Pictures in the 1940s and was horror filmmaker Val Lewton's first production. What I find surprising about this film is how it still stands as a fairly original story even to this day  over sixty years after it was originally made. Sure the Sataniccult scenario has been dealt with again and again but I think it's safe to say that this was probably one of the first if not the first film to deal with the subject and it does so in a fairly unique manner. Surprisingly the audience is even able to sympathize with the cult members despite their nihilistic cold belief system and insistence on a person's suicide to compensate for a 'betrayl' against them because they seem so human. All the relationships in the film feel genuine and that is likely part of the script working well as well as the acting.A handful of great scenes stick out from the film probably the most famous being the chilling scene in the latenight subway ride where Mary witnesses something extremely scary. Also wellnoted would be the scare scene in the hallway with Mary and the investigator as well as the bizarre shower discussion that has been noted for preceding Hitchcock's Psycho. Director Mark Robson makes use of shadows corners and dark alleyways all effective pieces in the oldtime urban Manhattan setting. Kim Hunter is extremely likable as Mary and Jean Brooks is stunning as her mysterious missing sister Jacqueline. Tom Conway is also notable for his performance which he plays quite well. Now I do have a few small problems with the script  I felt it needed a bit of touchingup in areas to clarify things a little better because I had to watch the film twice to catch onto certain elements that I should have noticed in the first viewing. Then again this movie is notorious for having many cuts made to it resulting in its modest 71 minute running time. You also have to keep your eye out for the ending too because the film ends fairly quickly but its final implications are shuddering.But besides the small script problems I have no complaints here. The Seventh Victim is a classic oldtime chiller that still holds up well today. While the scare factor may be diminished by time I still personally found the movie to be scary because of it's bleak and unsettling atmosphere and it's main subject being that of an underground Satanic cult. There's something about this movie that draws you in and doesn't let you go. Wellbuilt characters sufficiently dark and moody atmosphere an interesting subject matter scary as well and a handful of spooky scenes make this a classic horror film. If you are a fan of horror films from the golden age The Seventh Victim is not one you will want to pass up. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "'The Seventh Victim 1943' was produced by Val Lewton who developed a string of wellrespected horror pictures for RKO between 1942 and 1946 this particular title being the first that I've seen. Had I been judging the film based only on its visuals my appraisal would be decidedly glowing. Nicholas Musuraca much surely have been among the most proficient cinematographers of the 1940s a master of the shadowy film noir as his wonderful work in 'The Stranger on the Third Floor 1940' and 'Out of the Past 1947' can attest. In this twisted thriller every city alleyway is a looming blanket of darkness from which scarred sinister faces emerge to exact their revenge on our helpless heroine. The photography is so meticulously and deliberately staged that the overall mood is not one of realism but more closely resembles the theatre it's all so impeccablystylised that one can't help but be drawn into director Mark Robson's shady world of mystery murder and deceit  and how about that shower scene!But alas for every time Musuraca's superb cinematography managed to draw me into the film I was jarringly yanked backwards by a ridiculous plot twist a laughable line of dialogue or a dubious piece of acting. Firstrate production values are used to complement a plot that would hardly suffice a Bmovie and so it's an unfortunate waste of talent. The screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen and Charles O'Neal seems so preoccupied with approaching taboo material that it flits around in circles unable to settle on any solid theme or idea. The villains of the picture are ostensibly a secret society of Satanworshippers  whose duties it seems fail to stretch beyond discussions of their secret society and certainly don't appear to include anything even close to devilworship. If their weekly meetings merely consist of rich people lounging around and drinking wine then I'm not sure that the society's secrecy is really worth killing for and indeed the members are such ordinary folk that they can't bear to kill anyone in any case.You can usually expect the acting in such lowbudget horror films to be atrocious at best but here the cast is quite adequate. Kim Hunter as a young and vulnerable woman searching for her missing sister seems outofherdepth not just characterwise but also as an actress. This being her first film role in a long and prolific career Hunter is simply following the script unwilling to invest any extra emotion into her dialogue. Jean Brooks after a tremendous buildup of Harry Lime proportions fails to fulfill the screenplay's bloated expectations she's hardly the most beautiful woman who ever lived as described and even her younger sister has a prettier face. The men  Tom Conway Erford Gage and Hugh Beaumont  are sufficient to carry along the story. Before you get the impression that I disliked 'The Seventh Victim' I'll add that its Bmovie status allowed it to get away with some nice plot twists and the abrupt cunninglyunderstated ending  the sound of a chair collapsing in another room  was a stroke of genius.".

Kim Hunter is sufficient as a young woman searching the city for her missing sister eventually discovering her sibling was involved with a devilworshiping cult. Mark Robson directed and while he's careful setting up this plot he isn't very nimble and his pacing drags. Hunter isn't a colorful actressshe's not saucy or salty nor does she crack wiseand getting involved in her plight may prove taxing for some viewers looking for a brash scareflick. The premise and execution are certainly curious however the film is simply the precursor to the spate of devil films which followed and is not equal to the best of them.  from ";

It certainly is unlike any film from that era that I remember seeing.This is one of those films that it helps to know nothing about before viewing. To read any sort of capsule about the flick would definitely take away from the enjoyment of the film.Having said that I am not totally satisfied with the payoffs the movie provides. There are too many gaps in logic combined with a bit too much moralizing. Some people find themselves in situations in this film that just simply seem to lack any credibility.For some fascinating sequences most notably one that takes place in a shower and seems to have been seen by Alfred Hitchcock this film is definitely worth a looksee.For me the individual elements of the film was far more interesting than the sum of its parts.".

When these films were made the women in horror films were often onedimensional either serving as a love interest or as a frail character in jeopardy. The women in Lewton's films all have multilayered personalities they are thoughtful and mysterious people we really care about and sympathize with.The main female roles in this film are no exception. The story begins somewhat like The Lady Vanishes in that a young woman is searching for another woman in this film her sister and she keeps hitting dead ends all the while feeling like there's something more sinister going on. The similarities end at this point but there are definitely elements that seem very much like Hitchcock's earlier films. The film raises many questions and tackles many issuesthe will to live the will to die the meaning of love and what true courage is. If you don't pay close attention you may not even notice these issues because the atmosphere and plot development of the film are equally engrossing. The film keeps you guessing and there are many scenes that are genuinely eerie. When it first came out I'm sure that the subject matter would have been especially unsettling.The Seventh Victim is difficult to classify. It's probably closest to being a thriller but there are enough macabre elements to push it toward the horror genre. However you view it it's a great film.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine how the producer Val Lewton managed to pull off these spooky understated little films at RKO. The studio envious of Universal's monster series kept throwing these ludicrous titles at him. The Cat People. Did The Cat People make money? Okay then The CURSE of the Cat People. If Universal had The Wolf Man they threw The Leopard Man at Lewton. Yet he kept constructing miniature gems on these fragile foundations.This is one of them from 1943. It won't scare the kids as much as The Cat People did because there are fewer unexpected shocks buses Lewton called them. But adults will find it about as interesting as any of Lewton's other fantasies especially if they're at all familiar with Hitchcock's Psycho or Rosemary's Baby and are able to connect dots with any facility.Here's the opening in which the tenor of the film to follow is fully laid out. I'll use it as an example and then pretty much quit.Mary Kim Hunter in her first role is a student at some academy outside New York. Mrs. Lowood the headmistress calls her into the office and explains that Mary's sister Jacqueline has stopped payments for Mary's tuition without explanation. Mrs. Lowood has been unable to contact Jacqueline. Mary says she intends to go to New York and look into her sister's incommunicado. Mrs. Lowood offers to help pay Mary's tuition and adds that if Mary is unable to find Jacqueline she is always welcome to return to the school as a teacher.In the hallway Mary is stopped by a young teacher Mrs. Gilchrest who pleads with her not to come back to the school. She herself was once in Mary's position and has regretted her return ever since. At this point we hear Mrs. Lowood's commanding call from inside  Gilchrest? Mary leaves the school after a fond look at a grandfather clock in the hallways.From the beginning everything is askew not what we expect from a cheap B movie not quite normal. The apparent disappearance of Mary's sister Jacqueline is only the most obvious part of the puzzle. Mrs. Lowood seems to be treating Mary with sympathy yet her demeanor is strangely ominous giving us a sense of something going on that we aren't aware of.Gilchrest's anguished warning in the hallway suggests that our unease is justified. I mean  what the hell HAPPENED to Gilchrest when she came back to the school? Or is she frankly nuts? Lowood's demanding call leads us to believe that Gilchrest knows whereof she speaks. Neither Lowood nor Gilchrest is ever seen in the film again.And the grandfather clock? What's that about? If anything.Some of these apparent dead links may be due to hasty editing attempts to trim the film down to a Bmovie slot in the local theaters. But then why do Lewton's movies leave behind this sense of languorous dread when other completely forgettable B movies show plot holes because the actors are rushing through the film so that instead of mysterious digressions we wind up with plot holes? Mary's investigation takes her to Greenwich Village and puts her through a maze with odd characters as guides or red herrings. In the most clearly violent scene one of her acquaintances a creepy detective prowls through a dark and deserted building with her. Hearing a noise in the hallway ahead he steps into the shadows while Mary waits trembling and after a few moments staggers back wordlessly with a fatal wound.I think I'll let it go at that. Don't bother watching this if you expect a slasher movie or even a horror movie. Watch it some night when you feel ready to let its sluggish current take you along on a ride through a phantasmagorical setting that is anything but Disneyland.".

	schema:headline " The Best Film That You Probably Won't See This Summer";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow! I really got lucky with this one! A Jean Claude Van Damme film released in theaters for the first time in the United States since 1998 if memory serves right! A very limited release mind you but he's finally made it back to the big screen! It hasn't been advertised here at all which is a shame because Assassination Games is an excellent film! So where do I begin? Well the film was shot for 4000000 dollars in some Eastern Block country which would normally scare me but it actually ends up looking a lot better than the above stated price tag. Say around the 15 to 20000000 dollar range. The camera and editing work was very well done and the musical score is excellent non pervasive and flows with the movie in a non intrusive way that adds to the dramatic effect instead of taking away from it. The story is pretty well done. I'd give the dialog a solid B for an action movie and there were no detectable plot holes that I could find.The best actor in the film in my opinion was probably Andrew French who plays Nalbandian who plays Devil's Advocate to Van Damme fallowed by Maria Kaijan Jean Claude Scott Adkins and Ivan Kaye. In fact the acting was pretty much all the way around solid except for the interpol agents who's dialog and delivery was extremely weak.The film goes about 50 50 on the action to drama ratio. It drags a bit after the first 5 minutes or so but the fight scenes are interspersed throughout the film well and are also followable which is more than I could say for some larger budget films like the Transformers franchise and I would definitely have to say that Jean and Scott make an excellent action duo as they have the whole fire and ice thing going.If you happen to be within an hours drive of any of the theaters listed on the movie website go and check the film out. It isn't as good as JCVD or the new Universal Soldier but it's a very close third. So go check it out or just wait for the DVD. It'll be worth it! Thank you Jean Claude! I never thought I'd see you on the big screen again!".

	schema:reviewBody "Script and financial limitations can hinder the most precious of stories. For once Scott Adkins played a character and not himself in his movies. I didn't like that to be honest but as an actor that is what Scott needs. I mean in this movie Scott gets taken down by so many guys who in reality he could kill with his bare hands. Van Damme is stuck with the monotonous monologue affected robotic hitman which seemed tacky. But that is due to lack of histrionic skill. Kurt Russell did it slightly better in soldier. Arnie did it really good in Terminator. But that was aided by the requirements of the character. Adkins has improved as an actor since the awful Ninja. He has some variety now in his resume. In this movie AG Scott plays a really vulnerable man. Quite the opposite of the invulnerable Yuri Boyka Scott's best role so far.The movie synopsis given here is tardy and seems to indicate the crazed stereotypical view of Americans that everything revolves around them. There is no DEA nonsense here. It is the Interpol whose dirty cops provide cannon fodder for the lead actors while the main villain is a despicable criminal leader played well by the actor.This movie had a lot of positives going for it in terms of potential. It was a lot better than the DTV releases the 2 lead actors have been used to recently. Van Damme's face looks drawn and destroyed beyond the skills of the most talented makeup artistes in the world. He could go the Charles Bronson reloaded route with that face.The key here is that while both the lead actors combined could compile the most complex and comprehensive columns of a martial arts encyclopedia this movie has stayed away from capitalising on the copious martial arts talents possessed by Adkins and Van Damme. It was fresh and new of course but nevertheless it just added to a long list of things this movie lacked.While this movie is worth watching once especially if you are a JCVDmartial arts fan it is only an average action film that didn't maximize its potential. The remote controlled machine gun was a nice touch but it is just one of the momentary shades of quality in a film that can never be anything above underrated. The crew just tried too much in the name of freshness and as a result the final product ended up in the doldrums neither here nor there.Scott would do good to get some serious acting lessons as would JCVD. A lot of people including me cannot keep watching KickboxerBloodsportUniversal SoldierHard TargetUndisputed 23 again and again.Interestingly JCVD's kids play roles in the film. His daughter Biancaa super stunner plays Adkins' wife. His son Kristopher plays one of the villains I believe.".

They played off each other really well but I was left wanting to see more of them sharing the screen. There were a few aspects I didn't care for but I don't want to spoil anything. Production wise the movie looks pretty good considering the budget. It's well directed and shot. Good music score too. However I actually feel like it would have made for a better at home experience than a theatrical one. The sepia tone actually looked a little blurred on the big screen during some of the wide shots...and I did find myself craving a little color. Close ups looked good though. All in all it was a pretty good movie. This gives me hope for The Butcher. If Ernie Barbarash had a little more money to work with he'd do a hell of a job. 35".

He shows here that folks like Van Damme and Seagal should pass the action crown to him now.It hurts me to say this because I am a huge fan of the two action stars.Van Dammes last few movies have been very very dark and this continues the trend. Van Dammes Brazil is a loner who lives in an apartment which has a secret luxury room and a corridor that looks like it belongs in a hospital.Adkins plays a guy who is married to Van Dammes daughter but she is comatose because the fat tramp from Layer Cake and his gang abused her.Both men get info on where to find him Van Damme for Money Adkins for revenge..And at the same time Van Dammes son and Andy Hunter from eastenders are tring to double cross everybody for some reason or another.The film is fantastically edited and for the budgetand looks really good too. But again it's miles away from his early movies this is more in the vain of Until Death and even JCVD.It's very murky and cold feeling and the violence is rife throughout. Limited martial arts action may deter the fans of Kickboxer but it's a step up from the last Universal Soldier film and The two leads have great chemistry.My only gripe is the tagged on revenge ending and the silly subplot involving Brazil and his neighbour.".

A corrupt Interpol officer makes that observation about Roland Flint the character played by Scott Adkins in the riveting Assassination Games. It's an accolade that truly applies to the film's star JeanClaude Van Damme who has translated his experience as a global superstar into becoming one of the globe's best actors. JCVD is Vincent Brazil a professional assassin and loner whose profession has intensified his selfisolation. Flint and Brazil become reluctant partners in a catandmouse game against both Interpol and the European mob. Along the way an unlikely girl next door named October invades Brazil's carefully protected personal space and forces him to provide her refuge from a vengeful pimp depicted with effective menace by actor Attila Arpa. When October thanks Vincent with a kiss to the cheek Van Damme displays the hitman's resistance to affection with an emotion that is both telling and heartbreaking. It is a rare moment for an action film and a testament to the brilliance of Van Damme the actor. The relationship of October and Vincent becomes an effective dramatic anchor for the movie's unrelenting mix of tragedy and revenge. Increasingly as his films showcase his dramatic talents Van Damme creates movies that are both character driven and visually stylish without resorting to CGI tricks or action clichs. Experience and talent have enabled the original Muscles from Brussels to evolve into one of the most creative and uniquely effective forces in film making today. Assassination Games is another great chapter in the career of a triumphant and supremely talented JeanClaude Van Damme.".

I believe it was some time in the last quarter of 2011. I happen to watch this movie on Netflix. I don't think this movie came out in the movie theater. When I saw the previews for it and saw that Van Damme was in the movie I was eager to see it. Judging from the previews it looked like the makings of a descent film.This movie is about two of the world's greatest assassins that don't know each other but work together to achieve both of their personal goals.This was very good film to me. This film had a good plot. This film had a good story and the execution was on point with the film. The action was good and it was enough to fit this type of film. I felt like that was important. Lots of movies that are consider action movies have a problem with not putting enough or the right amount of action in the film. This film doesn't have that problem. The fight scenes were very good and believable. There's this one scene in the movie were the assassins are trying to kill the same guy and they bump heads. didn't know each other at time I thought that was pretty cool. Their mistakes on both of their behalf's were do to the fact that they were both excellent at what they did. You have to keep in mind while watching the film that this is an assassination movie not transformers. All in all this was a descent film.A can't really say anything bad about this film. Don't expect Oscars acting performances either. As a fan of Van Damme it was nice to see him in a movie again.My final rating for this film is going to be an 8 out of 10. Solid film very good execution and is well deserving of it high score. If you have a couple of hours to burn and you like these kinds of movies you have blessing to see this one. You won't be disappointed. Currently this film is on Netflix so watch it on there of course but if I see this film in the movie store for fewer than ten dollars. I'm going to purchase it.".

This movie however Is not a JCVD movie! I love the classic Van Damme action movies that I grew up. Direct to video movies he made that I like are The Order Replicant In Hell Wake of Death 6 Bullets Pound of Flash and Until Death. This movie however sucks ass! This one is horrible. Boring almost pathetic. It seems that action stars who aren't successful anymore like Van Damme or Wesley Snipes are making movies in Romania mostly cheap action movies which apparently want to cash in on the old reputation of these action stars. Pathetic. Again This movie is no fun at all save your money.I'll never understand the praise for this film. I'm sure someone will try to explain it to me...please feel free. Cinematography that has a PoorYellow Color on everything Van Damme in 'Zombie Mode' an ending that is just 'a RemoteControlled Gun in a Lame Way' lack of excitementthrillsaction zero chemistry between its' leads and a boring as hell storyline. The dialogue is horrible not watchable the color is yellow. JeanClaude Van Damme and Scott Adkins gave the worst performances of their life's! The action is terrible the martial arts are not in this movie at all. All the time I kept seeing yellow color thank god I did not pre order this movie on Bluray cause it so suck.I don't get why anyone likes this movie? Why is 62 on IMDb? I don't get it. This movie is a poor movie not a Van Damme I remember. I don't care for this crappy movie. It is boring and doesn't deserve the high rating on IMDb. I will never watch it again! What a waste of 2 great on screen martial artists! Scott Adkins also was the king in The Legend of Hercules and he sucked in that too. His acting is rough around the edges and it does bother me.This movie is just terrible awful and I don't get it. I would rather watch The Killer 1989 with Chow Yun Fat and director John Woo than this poor lame Ernie Barbarash crappy movie. No martial arts in here no epic fights really nothing! Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning 2012 at least had an epic fights between Van Damme and Adkins this movie has nothing pat poor lines from two stars.

	schema:headline " Very slick film shilling for a US invasion of eastern Africa";
	schema:reviewBody "Having heard about this 30minute feature going viral across Youtube and various social networking sites I determined to watch this film championed by mysterious US charity Invisible Children for myself. I found it a very slick and manipulative piece of propaganda aimed at young people and families with children. The film starts with director Jason Russell and his family and zooms in on his young son from birth on to his preschool years before branching out to the lost children of Uganda children like Jacob who have lost their families and have been forced to join the Lord's Resistance Army as soldiers if they're boys or sex slaves if they're girls under the sinister charismatic leadership of one Joseph Kony. Russell dwells for a little time on Jacob and his experiences before delving into a drive for support and donations to help other young people like Jacob and suggesting ways in which people can bring the issue of child soldiers and finding Kony to be brought to justice to the attention of others.Russell adopts a deliberate personal style to make very subjective appeals to people's emotions. His use of his son as willing collaborator is creepy as well as exploitative to say the least. The filming methods used are so slick as to raise my hackles the editing and the images even the sloganeering and strategies suggested to raise other people's awareness all look as if they'd been cooked up in an advertising agency that's done work for past TV current affairs programs. The themes pushed by Kony 2012 are so familiar as to be banal and devoid of genuine feeling let's change the world for the better let's be proactive let's protect innocent and vulnerable children from exploitation speak for yourselves! let's bond in solidarity with other aware young people and fight this monster Joseph Kony and triumph where older people can't or won't.No historical context is given which is extremely suspicious the film never explains who Joseph Kony is why he is such a bogeyman and who his Lord's Resistance Army is fighting against. What is his background how and why is he a rebel what political  social  economic conditions existed in Uganda in the 1990s that enabled him to rise to his current position as Uganda's Public Enemy No 1 and why should we get rid of him now when we could have got rid of him ages ago? Is the Ugandan government under President Yoweri Museveni so helpless that it must appeal to the outside world? Is Kony fighting the Ugandan government? Given that Museveni has just been elected to a 4th term and has been in power for 25 years with a blemished record in violating human rights invading parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and holding elections that yield suspect results that support his continued rule perhaps Kony is doing the right thing in resisting the Ugandan government! The film's suggested solutions are pathetic and laughable let's make Kony famous by plastering posters of him across cities around the world on 20 April 2012! Support celebrities like Angelina Jolie George Clooney and Bono against Kony! Buy the Action Kit package! Wear the Kony 2012 bracelets! Donate money to the cause! The Kony 2012 awareness campaign looks too much like an election campaign to ring true. And why should the public be asked to cough up money when famous Hollywood celebrities and other stars in politics and the commercial music industry have more than enough money among themselves to capture and bring Kony to justice and rehabilitate the child soldiers and sex slaves he has abused? And now that all is said and done one suspicion remains the recent announcement of the discovery of at least 2.5 billion and maybe as many as 6 billion barrels of oil in Uganda couldn't have anything to do with the release of the Kony 2012 film? How cynical of me to think that a future invasion of Uganda by AFRICOM might need support from young people in the form of a humanitarian campaign! In the meantime hundreds of children in northern Uganda have fallen victim to a mysterious and fatal neurological disease known as Nodding disease spreading across the border from the newly independent Southern Sudan. It is arguable that this problem deserves more immediate attention and help than pursuing a shadowy warlord who may not even be in Uganda now or be alive still.".

	schema:headline " Save your money I know I did.";
	schema:reviewBody "So I was watching Kony 2012 the other day and I got all emotional. It's a sad 30 minute piece of propaganda that really does get to you. I opened up a new flick in Firefox ready to buy the 'Action Kit' and support this beautiful thing. But right before I did it I saw a related video called KONY 2012 is misleading. It was a random Ugandan girl who talked about the situation in Uganda. I watched it did some research and changed my opinion about Kony 2012 completely.I wasn't actually about to buy a 'KONY 2012 Action Kit' just wrote that for dramatic effect SO i found out that this company Invisible Children has made 10 videos in the past. KONY 2012 is their eleventh and they hit the jackpot with this one. 70 million viewers after a few days. Let's break it down though.A quick look on Invisible Children's finances show that last year they spent over 8 million USD and only 28 million USD actually went to 'Direct Services'. I'd say around half of these 28 mill' actually went to the children in Africa. The rest of the money went to a bunch of noncharity related things such as staff salaries travel and film production. That's right film production. 78 of the money you donate goes to salaries to the crew their travel not just to Africa but around the world and more films like Kony 2012.These guys refuse to have an external audit committee. That single fact says more about them than the film does.As if that wasn't enough the 32 that actually does go to Africa goes to the Ugandan army and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The Ugandan army has been accused of committing much worse crimes than Joseph Kony including things such as mass rape and torture and the SpLA is probably an even worse army to get hold of your money because THEY have been using child soldiers only 1015 years ago. Some people believe they still do have child soldiers.Invisible Children has a firm goal with this Kony business. They want Kony capturedkilled by the end of the year.See any problems here? Almost the entire population of Uganda is convinced Kony is dead nobody in Uganda considers him a threat. Another problem is the fact that Invisible Children is all about the children 30000 in Joseph Kony's army yet Invisible Children STILL wants to take out Kony with force meaning they'll have to kill his army of kids.Raising awareness does not solve anything. It's a cheap technique to use when you want people to think that they're making a difference. It's like when religious people think they can pray away global warming. It doesn't work.KONY 2012 is nothing but propaganda. Some people out there believe the American government is behind the film. I don't. I think one man realized how much money he could make off of today's pathetic lazy and dumb generation and took 11 shots at it. The latest one was a hit.Here's a quote from Jedidiah Jenkins Invisible Children's Director of IdeologyThirtyseven percent of our budget goes directly to central Africanrelated programs about 20 percent goes to salaries and overhead and the remaining 43 percent goes to our awareness programs.  But aside from that the truth about Invisible Children is that we are not an aid organization and we don't intend to be. I think people think we're over there delivering shoes or food. But we are an advocacy and awareness organization. People watch a video they make then buy an action kit so they can make a new video. For those of you who have been following the KONY 2012 film on Youtube can clearly see how the attitude of the film makers is changing. When it came out and the followers were hyping it like there was no tomorrow in the comments everything was fine. When people started asking questions they disabled the comment section. I'm going to predict that they'll disable the likedislike buttons in a few weeks too.Save your money folks I know I did.".

	onyx:emotionText "So I was watching Kony 2012 the other day and I got all emotional. It's a sad 30 minute piece of propaganda that really does get to you. I opened up a new flick in Firefox ready to buy the 'Action Kit' and support this beautiful thing. But right before I did it I saw a related video called KONY 2012 is misleading. It was a random Ugandan girl who talked about the situation in Uganda. I watched it did some research and changed my opinion about Kony 2012 completely.I wasn't actually about to buy a 'KONY 2012 Action Kit' just wrote that for dramatic effect SO i found out that this company Invisible Children has made 10 videos in the past. KONY 2012 is their eleventh and they hit the jackpot with this one. 70 million viewers after a few days. Let's break it down though.A quick look on Invisible Children's finances show that last year they spent over 8 million USD and only 28 million USD actually went to 'Direct Services'. I'd say around half of these 28 mill' actually went to the children in Africa. The rest of the money went to a bunch of noncharity related things such as staff salaries travel and film production. That's right film production. 78 of the money you donate goes to salaries to the crew their travel not just to Africa but around the world and more films like Kony 2012.These guys refuse to have an external audit committee. That single fact says more about them than the film does.As if that wasn't enough the 32 that actually does go to Africa goes to the Ugandan army and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The Ugandan army has been accused of committing much worse crimes than Joseph Kony including things such as mass rape and torture and the SpLA is probably an even worse army to get hold of your money because THEY have been using child soldiers only 1015 years ago. Some people believe they still do have child soldiers.Invisible Children has a firm goal with this Kony business. They want Kony capturedkilled by the end of the year.See any problems here? Almost the entire population of Uganda is convinced Kony is dead nobody in Uganda considers him a threat. Another problem is the fact that Invisible Children is all about the children 30000 in Joseph Kony's army yet Invisible Children STILL wants to take out Kony with force meaning they'll have to kill his army of kids.Raising awareness does not solve anything. It's a cheap technique to use when you want people to think that they're making a difference. It's like when religious people think they can pray away global warming. It doesn't work.KONY 2012 is nothing but propaganda. Some people out there believe the American government is behind the film. I don't. I think one man realized how much money he could make off of today's pathetic lazy and dumb generation and took 11 shots at it. The latest one was a hit.Here's a quote from Jedidiah Jenkins Invisible Children's Director of IdeologyThirtyseven percent of our budget goes directly to central Africanrelated programs about 20 percent goes to salaries and overhead and the remaining 43 percent goes to our awareness programs.  But aside from that the truth about Invisible Children is that we are not an aid organization and we don't intend to be. I think people think we're over there delivering shoes or food. But we are an advocacy and awareness organization. People watch a video they make then buy an action kit so they can make a new video. For those of you who have been following the KONY 2012 film on Youtube can clearly see how the attitude of the film makers is changing. When it came out and the followers were hyping it like there was no tomorrow in the comments everything was fine. When people started asking questions they disabled the comment section. I'm going to predict that they'll disable the likedislike buttons in a few weeks too.Save your money folks I know I did.";

	schema:headline " Kony 2012 is a very misinform slacktivism documentary. Not the best.";
	schema:reviewBody "At this point I'm guessing most people reading this have at least heard of the Kony 2012 campaign. For those unfamiliar Kony 2012 is a YouTube viral video crusade run by a child activist group called Invisible Children. The documentary appears to be taken aimed at making Ugandan war criminal  LRA The Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony famous so that the world governments can put pressure on local authorities to bring him to justice for crimes against humanity. The internet video become incredibly viral spreading all over Facebook Twitter and others social media sites within weeks after it came out. A lot of people indeed saw it but the reasons of the film being made had little impact on the issues besides making the viewers feel satisfied that they have contributed by watching it. One of the bigger problems of the film is how the movie asked viewers to send money to the filmmakers rather than the local African law enforcement. Four months after the movie was released Invisible Children the charity who created the film reported 31.9 million of gross receipts but in the end little of that money was donated to the cause. Instead it was later use to fund yet another movie 'Kony 2012 Part II  Beyond Famous'  staff salaries. It doesn't help that some of the money was used to free director Jason Russell from jail for public indecency in San Diego. In the end nearly nothing was done to stop Joseph Kony by the Invisible Children campaign. Another focus for criticism of the organization has been a photograph of the three founders holding weapons and posing with armed members of the SPLA Sudan People's Liberation Army. While they might now denied their support for the SPLA in truth Invisible Children has been helping armed the terrorist group for years in its fight against the LRA despite the fact that the group is known to commit similar atrocities to those blamed on the LRA. After all at one time the SPLA had between 2500 and 5000 child soldiers serving under its flag. Not only do they supported the SPLA but also the NRA National Resistance Army whom is also known to frequently use child soldiers to kill people. They even mention them in the film. Yes the NRA subsequently earned a reputation for respecting the rights of civilians but they also been known to forcibly cleared approximately 100000 people from their homes. Soldiers committed hundreds of extrajudicial executions as they forcibly moved people burning down homes and granaries. Yes these are supposedly the 'Good Guys' in the video. Another group that Invisible Children supported was the Uganda Government whom been known to exploitation their neighbor Congo by going with war with them in 1998 for lucrative resources. The government of Uganda were able to do this with the help of 25 loosely organized militia group like the LRA whom untrained and undisciplined forces have greatly contributed to the violence of the conflict by frequent looting rape ethic cleaning and yes even cannibalism to keep the Congo region under President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni's control. While yes Museveni has brought relative stability and economic growth to a country that has endured decades of rebel activity and civil war but the idea that this film would make him a hero is ludicrous. After all this was a guy who was willing to work with the enemy to plunder another country's resources and did nothing about the crimes he was doing under the government nose. It wasn't until the United States responded to the war by suspending all military aid to Uganda that Yoweri Kaguta Museveni cut ties with Joseph Kony's LRA in 2003. By the year 2006 with the war ended three years earlier and nowhere left to loot the LRA was driven off from Uganda for good by the Uganda Government. It's odd how the film largely ignored that big fact. Invisible Children really do manipulating the facts for strategic purposes exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders while whitewashing the atrocities of the groups. It's even more surprising that the documentary didn't do their research as they thought that was Joseph Kony was still in that country. Another thing the film fails to mention is Joseph Kony's extreme Christian beliefs. I guess by not putting this information in the video they didn't want to hurt Christians supported or offensive any Christian fanatics here in the US. However it should had been bought up since it's one of the reasons why Kony still has followers. Overall This campaign is completely emotional with little actual facts to back the message on how to realistically stop him what so ever. In my view the only feasible and proper way to stop Kony and protect the civilians he targets is to coordinate efforts with regional governments to rebuild the economy not sending US troops like this film makes it out to be. It's only then that the endless violence might stop. The way it's been going even if he get kill or dies the most likely thing to happen is that a new warlord will emerge shortly and replace him likewise. So in the end the conflict is more complex than this movie is making it out to be. While Kony 2012 is a popular viral video well shot  edited. It's not the best. Its feels too much like propaganda with its message. If you want a better documentary go see 2006's 'Invisible Children The Rough Cut'. It's far better than this moneyhungry film. So go see that movie instead. It's more informative.".

Then it hits the viewer with the evil Joseph Kony which ought to be pronounced like Ko but is Americanized in the video  kidnapper of a child soldier army and sexual enslaver of children.So far the video works.Where it goes off the rails is by first admitting that Kony is no longer in Uganda and then suggesting we help fight Kony  by supporting the army in Uganda. What? This disconnect is never explained. It's unlikely the Ugandan army will be welcome in foreign countries who have their own military. A last comment about the video is that the language used suggests a worldwide movement but in fact it's almost entirely focused on the US with slight mention of Canada. The website also lists Bono and Ban KiMoon as the only nonNorthAmerican names of note.Now is the part where I ramble about the subject.Have a closer look at the Ugandan army. It too has been reported to use hundreds of child soldiers despite Uganda being a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which bans this practice. They might not be as hardcore about it as the LRA but they are not the good guys here. They are the lesser evil. Probably.The Ugandan government is also rotten. For example they've been trying to pass a bill that would make it a capital offence not to report your own gay brother and his boyfriend to the police read the bill if you don't believe me  it's not just gay people who will die. If passed this bill could do as much damage to Ugandan teens and young adults and their families as Kony did to younger children and their families and it will have the power of government behind it.The video repeatedly refers to the LRA without focusing on the root cause. The LRA is the Lord's Resistance Army a Christian cult. It was even praised by Rush Limbaugh for this reason. Kony claims to be able to channel the Holy Spirit and that the Army's purpose is to promote the Ten Commandments. As with many Christians they don't believe killing the guilty nor killing in warfare are prohibited by the Commandments. This group could not exist without societal support for the idea of Christianity specifically and other religious nonsense e.g. channelling generally. People fear this man not just because he's a murdering fiend but because he's magic. He shouldn't have that power. If we treat the symptom but not the illness it will come back with a new name. Uganda is a place where to this very day witchdoctors tell adults to mutilate and kill children their own or others to sacrifice their remains to the spirits. And they do it.Yes stop Kony. Where he actually is. According to the video that's somewhere in the Central African Republic South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo.But this needs to be followed up by a serious education campaign. Uganda is a land of lies and nonsense. A free or nearlyfree education in science logic and critical thinking is needed to save that country from itself. Something like One Laptop Per Child not mentioned in the video and who might not align themselves with my comment is a good start but it's going to take a lot more than that.I will point out that the Commonwealth of Nations did not stop Kony in its member state Uganda. What good is it?Utlimately I give the video a 7 for drawing attention to one serious problem even if their solution is wrong. It does have people talking.".

The director and one of the many writers working on this project is Jason Russell and it is by far his most known work. And it may very well be his most personal too but there the problems start. The way in which he makes his family a vital part of his approach feels awkward to say the least right at the beginning but also even more when he asks the boy who the bad guy is and then he pulls out a photo of Kony and has his boy say that he needs to be stopped. This did feel highly scripted to be honest. And scenes like these let me agree with those saying it's propaganda. But that doesn't mean it has to be for the wrong side. I know that it is discussed controversially to which extent Kony is the bad guy or if this film is just trying to justify another war based on assumptions and conclusionjumping. Anyway I am not deep enough in the subject to comment on that in detail so I just rate and elaborate on this documentary in terms of what it presents and how it presents it and the biggest flaw I already mentioned earlier. On the good side it was nice that attention to the subject of Kony was brought with this film as Russell is basically very correct in saying nobody knows who Joseph Kony is and that needs to be changed and it was through this film which is among the key reasons why I am not giving it an even lower rating. But that doesn't mean you should believe everything you see in here. A critical approach is always appreciated. I personally give Kony 2012 a thumbsdown and don't recommend checking it out. I'm somewhat glad it only ran for 30 minutes as it was really very cringeworthy at times and clearly aimed at simple minds that it admittedly managed to impress in great numbers.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first several minutes of this film consist of a syrupy song performed by Roger Miller's orchestra and Singers while blurry 60's visual effects light the screen. Remaining viewers then spy Sharif a Spanish prince taming a wild white stallion as his mother screams at him that it's time to get married. When he thinks he's broken the horse he takes off riding but soon discovers that his job wasn't fully completed. He stumbles upon a flying monk perhaps an ancestor of Sally Field? who gives him a sack of flour telling him that whichever woman bakes seven dumplings out of it that Sharif is unable to fully eat will be the correct wife for him. When Sharif finds his horse it has been commandeered by curvy peasant Loren who is persuaded to bake him the dumplings. What follows is a lengthy game of giveandtake hitandmiss and misunderstanding as this couple attempts to discover if they are in fact meant to be together. Some of it including a notably vivid dishwashing scene is rather captivating. Some of it like the endless segues into various locales and with various townsfolk is pretty dull sometimes even annoying as with the ancient witch and her coven who aligns herself with Loren. One highly remarkable scene however is one in which thousands of eggs are simultaneously hatched revealing an army of little yellow chicks. This impressive scene alone makes the film worth a glance. Others may check in to see Sharif at his peak and Loren close to hers. Unfortunately the couple's love seems to come from a mandate in the script versus any organic chemistry between the two. It remains to be seen why Loren would have such a yen for a man who would soundly strike a woman hard across the face but maybe times were different then. Del Rio makes one of her very last appearances as Sharif's mother and adds the touch of authoritative glamour needed for the part. Many other parts are ably acted but intrusively dubbed into English. Witch Liotti's voice is actually painful to listen to. One of the chief assets is the roaming countryside and the use of rich and authentic looking locations. There are also some eyepopping costumes displayed by a bevy of eligible princesses who long to be chosen by Sharif. It's a fractured fairy tale that may appeal to fans of the stars but otherwise comes off as disjointed and even a little humiliating.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an admirer of the Italian neorealist film director Francesco Rosi I was delighted when a friend mentioned that he'd obtained a copy of Rosi's long forgotten film More Than A Miracle. Released in 1967 it only lasted for a couple of weeks which explains why I missed seeing it back then before quickly disappearing from sight. Now fortyfive years later I finally sat down to watch it. I knew that More Than A Miracle was a fairy tale set in 17th. Century Spain. And that it starred Omar Sharif as Prince Ramon and Sophia Loren as the peasant girl Isabella who the Prince falls in love with. I'm not a huge fan of fairy tales. However as this was a Francesco Rosi film I figured it would be a cut above films tackling similar subject matter. Prince Ramon has refused to choose a bride from the seven marriageable princesses whom his mother has selected as most deserving of becoming his wife. Out on his horse he comes across a monastery and meets friar Brother Joseph who amuses the local children by leaping into the air and flying about the countryside. The friar presents the Prince with a donkey and a bag of flour and instructs him to search for a woman who will make him seven dumplings. Despite trying to remain 'engaged' with the film I soon found myself checking how long still had to run. Seeing a peasant girl picking vegetables he orders her to make seven dumplings from the bag of flour he gives her. Which she dutifully does but overcome by hunger she eats the seventh dumpling. To punish her for her disobedience the Prince feigns death and then disappears. While I understood that it was after all just a fairy tale my attention was beginning to wander. I must have dozed off as I was woken up by a sharp poke in the ribs from my wife. On the TV Isabella was being rescued from a wooden barrel by a group of street urchins. By then Francesco Rosi or no Francesco Rosi I'd had enough and went to bed. Next morning my wife insisted on telling me how it all ended. Apparently Isabella ended up marrying the Prince and they both lived happily ever after. Born in 1922 Francesco Rosi directed some of the finest neorealist films to come out of Italy. Such classics as Hands Over The City Salvatore Guiliano Moment of Truth and The Mattei Affair Those alone elevate him to the Pantheon of Italian film directors. To me More Than A Miracle was just a glitch and in no way detracts from his reputation as a great film director.".

It was a little lighter fare than his normal leading man role and he seemed to enjoy the banter with Loren. Of course what man wouldn't? I am buying a copy of this movie for my collection and am having a girl night with my 8year old niece and her friends very soon.

Too bad the movie is not available on VHS or DVD because I sure would love to own this one.  Considering that I am not familiar of Sophia Loren and her movies she peaked before my time it is amazing to see how ravishing she looked!  She joins the ranks of Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe for me as the most beautiful women on the silver screen.".

WriterDirector John Wells understands the grave aspects of losing a job as corporations and businesses downsize in response to the current economic disaster  depression humiliation loss of selfworth and pride fear of failure in finding new employment the effects of job loss on marriages and families loss of hope  it is all here in this very well made film. If the first part of the film causes a reactive tachycardia and an urge to simply stop watching the story then the closing moments of the film bring at least a little redemption in the faith that man can actually survive and reassess and stop being a victim of a situation over which few of us have any control. GTX is a shipbuilding empire in Boston the brainchild of Gene McClary Tommy Lee Jones who brought a simple ship building business to a wealthy corporation now run by CEO James Salinger Craig T. Nelson McClary is a billionaire with a wife concerned with shopping sprees using the corporate jet and a lover Sally Wilcox Maria Bello the HR director of the corporation. The year is 2008 and the stock market and the economy in general have dipped to a new low and terrifying point. The result downsizing and one of the first to go is sales manager Bobby Walker Ben Affleck who is shocked and then hurt and then overcome with a feeling of failure and humiliation. Bobby's wife Maggie Rosemarie DeWitt at first responds with desperation but adjusts by taking on work as an ER nurse coaxing their son to not lose hope in Bobby. Bobby tries to find work but is the victim of the joblessness of the country he finally accepts Maggie's brother Jack's Kevin Costner offer to to work as a simple carpenter. Meanwhile the downsizing includes Gene and longterm employee Phil Chris Cooper who is overcome with anger and humiliation at being unemployable because of his advanced age. The manner in which each of these three men cope with the loss of job and income weaves a story that is complete with tragedy as well as a demonstration of the indomitability of the human spirit. THE COMPANY MEN contains many messages about coping with change preparing for a realistic financial future and the delicate line that separates each day's stance on the tightrope of existence. While the story is difficult to watch the performances by this exceptional cast are excellent not only among the Oscar winning stars but by the finely wrought cameos by Anthony O'Leary as Bobby's son Drew Cady Huffman and Eamonn Walker so well remember from the TV series OZ among many others. This is tough medicine but necessary views on contemporary society. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "THE COMPANY MEN is very difficult to watch if you are among the millions of people who have been laid off by the current economic recessionmeltdown in this country. WriterDirector John Wells understands the grave aspects of losing a job as corporations and businesses downsize in response to the current economic disaster  depression humiliation loss of selfworth and pride fear of failure in finding new employment the effects of job loss on marriages and families loss of hope  it is all here in this very well made film. If the first part of the film causes a reactive tachycardia and an urge to simply stop watching the story then the closing moments of the film bring at least a little redemption in the faith that man can actually survive and reassess and stop being a victim of a situation over which few of us have any control. GTX is a shipbuilding empire in Boston the brainchild of Gene McClary Tommy Lee Jones who brought a simple ship building business to a wealthy corporation now run by CEO James Salinger Craig T.

Losing a job not only means loss of income and the uncertainty and worry that accompanies such a loss but also loss of selfesteem and loss of confidence in the future. These themes are effectively dramatized in this movie. The main character a young wellpaid white collar worker loses his job and it changes his life and not necessarily for the better. The movie shows how all of us are subject to economic forces way beyond our ability to control. As the movie shows nobody is immune to the effects of these economic forces. Huge companies can be downsized bought up dismantled and disappear. Sometimes it's easy to believe that these corporate entities will go on forever but it's an illusion. There is no security there is no reward for loyalty. And while thousands of workers lose their jobs corporate executives that is those who actually own these companies pay themselves millions of dollars. Yet as the movie shows these huge salaries do not guarantee economic security either as one's company can be put up for sale. When the movie tries to get moralistic the story gets a little mushy but for the most part the story stays on track and avoid that pitfall. Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper give strong performances as the company men the rest of the cast which includes Craig T. Nelson and Maria Bello are excellent too. This movie is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Wells well known for being the showrunner behind long running hits The West Wing and ER writes and directs this fantastic film about corporate downsizing and how affects the lives of three men. Set in Boston Massachusetts a fictional company GTX is reeling from the economic crisis and is cutting jobs left and right to appease shareholders in an attempt to drive up their stock price. The scene to open the movie is quite powerful in the way it captures the feeling of this sort of thing can happen to anybody when you least expect it. The movie stars Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper. Each actor plays the role of an employee at GTX with Jones' character being someone in executive management Cooper's a notch or so below him and Affleck as a highly paid salesman. These characters don't have too much interaction on screen the film examines more the relationships between themselves and their families neighbors and communities. The three actors turn in pretty incredible performances and its a wonder that the film wasn't released earlier in 2010 to be eligible for awards consideration. Kevin Costner Maria Bello and Rosemarie DeWitt also play pivotal roles in the film and do superior jobs at being enrapturing and authentic.The film reminds me a lot of Up in the Air and perhaps that's the reason it wasn't released for awards consideration but instead for commercial ambitions because Reitman's already did that. But it's very different than the prior film in how it depicts the lives of those higher up the corporate ladder and the descent that occurs when one's income disappears. Critics can take shots at Wells pacing of the movie but it's no easy feat to write and direct a major motion picture and I believe he does an excellent job at showing and challenging several aspects of American culture and lifestyle. Definitely worth a watch.httpreelpopcorn.blogspot.com".

Really it's a time to ponder and rediscover as it proves for both Bobby and Gene it's never late to start over even if it is less still it's a change and rediscovery of happiness.

It is not only timely in fact but it also had the potential to be very smart in regards the characters and the commentary on the challenges that start with money problems but go much deeper. To a certain extent the film manages to do this because it is at its best when it allows the characters to simply be on the screen and struggling with their situations but there is a generalness to it that prevents it being consistently engaging and smart.The nature of the characters is a big part of it  perhaps not for everyone but for most viewers the problems of laid off executives may not be the easiest subject to care too much about. I know ultimately they are all people but the problems of those having to give up Ferraris or no longer being able to maintain the lavish lifestyle they once had is not the most accessible of things and it is a problem that it never quite shakes off because again of this general approach. The characters are interesting still though and it is a decent stab at seeing the struggle of becoming unemployed after many years working it just doesn't do it well enough. The main character comes over as arrogant and ungrateful for too long  it is necessary at first but later on it becomes grating as it combines with his own decision to live to the maximum of his means rather than being a little more modest and saving some of his large income. The older characters get away with this a bit more since their stories tend to be more about the emotional impact rather than events and this does buy the film some good material but not enough to make up for the weaknesses in its central character.The cast help this a lot even though they are nearly too distracting by how many famous faces there are. Affleck has the most time but does the least with it as he never manages to make a person from his situation and only just stops being annoying in time for a sentimental conclusion. Jones and Cooper are much better in their roles and they have more of the heart to play. Bello Costner Nelson and others are good in support Walker is sadly only notable for how much weight he has put on since I first saw him in Oz.The Company Men had potential to explore the male characters in a way that minimizes the distraction of their previous incomes however it doesn't quite manage it.

The cast mostly do well but the central concept is too focused on events and too focused on an upbeat conclusion that the subject doesn't really merit.";

The company really doesn't care about their employees who have given many years of loyal and faithful service. To the company they are not faces but only numbers. Bobby learns the real life consequences of not having a job. Not only does he see a change in his family lifestyle and the loss of his home but also his feelings of selfworth.My Comment This is a story of what many workers in the U.S. are enduring during the present economic crisis. Many companies are cutting jobs by the thousands to placate their shareholders by reducing the company's employee overhead and hopefully driving up their stock price. Actually the movie shows the hardships and what can happen to anyone including people in management when they no longer have a job. It first affects them internally then their families and finally the communities they live in. Out of work people first resist changing their lifestyles then they go into denial and finally acceptance of the hand they have been dealt. Ben Affleck's outstanding performance of enduring disappointment of not finding a job and worry for not providing for his family proved this point. The moral of the story is that we should not take our jobs for granted. The Weinstein Company 149 Rated R 710".

We see anger denial acceptance etc. in the 3 main characters.There are several things that seem very wrong perhaps the main thing being the luxurious lifestyles of the families with only 1 wage earner who is making maybe about 175000 a year. You cannot drive a porsche and live in a 5000 square foot home on that income.The first time you see Chris Cooper you know what is going to happen with that character. Its just a matter of time.Kevin Costner is his always dependable self ... a truly awful actor. He speaks all his lines as if he is reading them aloud for the first time. A dreary monotone no inflection or emotion in any single syllable.Ben Affleck is a serviceable actor but not of star quality.Jones does his one dimensional schtick of the grumbly older man. He's the unfunny Walter Matthau. His affair with Bello made the audience groan out loud.The actresses who played the 3 wives were all good.Conclusion ... this is a better story than it is a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can an unforgettable film be made about redundancy? The simple answer is yes and no. With an almost exceptional cast and some truly great writing this is a memorable film. The Company Men falls short on a few regards it is predictable and regrettably contains Ben Affleck's face. The latter is a sin on par with adultery in my book. All that was needed was to substitute Ben for Casey and we'd have come up smelling of roses.I went into this drama with an air of caution assuming any film about the recession would be handled too conservatively and with all focus on the firms responsible. Thankfully this was not the case. Focusing on three men that have lost their jobs the direction brings a personal touch to the story and sucks you in more than it otherwise might. Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper are superb in their roles as the older men on the wrong end of the firing stick. Jones had skirted my radar of admiration for several years until his sensational casting in No Country For Old Men I swore I wouldn't mention the Coen Brothers sorry folks and Cooper's resume includes American Beauty and City of Hope 1991. Both are stellar actors and in the twilight of their career this type of film is a great move.Affleck's character goes through the predicted emotions denial optimism depression and acceptance through the duration of the film which is a breath of fresh air as you can authentically see how this affects his family and how the wife and child deal with the situation that Affleck takes upon his own shoulders.Writer and director John Wells made a promising choice to follow three strands of storyline that are interconnected however Jones and Cooper's stories are not able to hold attention and aren't fleshed out sufficiently rendering them ineffective. While necessary for the storyline these break up the flow of the movie slightly and make for a pinball style ride.I still heartily recommend watching The Company Men. It will never reach my repeat watching list reserved for the calibre of Leon The Professional and Grave of the Fireflies as it lacks that extra dimension. It is however enjoyable intriguing and emotional.".

He would groan and drysob over it telling me how unbelievably poor it was and even he admitted that the score matched nothing that happens in the film.Being a lover of truly bad cinema I gave this the old college try despite his warnings that it was intolerable and seemed to go on forever.  He was ohsoright.This heaving waste heap begins with a snail paced procession of Catholics making a pilgrimage through the Mexican desert bearing a cross and all. Mangione's 'accompanying' music is incredibly upbeat and fast sounding like it would be more appropriate during a car chase on 'CHiPs!'  It reminded me of an effect that Fellini goes after intentionally in '8 12' where you see very old slow and fragile people parade by a panning camera to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.The first true sign that this movie has serious trouble is the fact that 17 minutes into the show they are still giving you subtitles explaining who characters are!  There are so many people in this movie that it would be near impossible to know who they were in one viewing let alone with subtitles i.e. SOANDSO SANCHEZ son of Jesus or SOANDSO SANCHEZ daughter of Jesus.  This points to two things  the screenplay is weak beyond the shame of such a gimmick and trust me it is! andor the producers panicked when the film was done and realized they should've chopped half the characters from the book right out of the film.  The absolute most ludicrous moment comes when at the end of a long day at work late at night Sanchez comes up to a door in the city.  Where could he possibly be?  At home of course ready for food and bed.  Then the subtitle comes HOME OF SANCHEZ.  What did you think people were that STUPID?! This is like a gag out of 'Airplane!'The film's production values are that of low budget 70's tv the acting is terrible except Quinn he's just Quinn and the ending is not to be believed.  This thing never seems like it will end  I first checked to see how long it had been running hoping it was almost over at the 1 hr 7 min mark!   Absolutely 100 deplorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paramount's REAP THE WILD WIND 1942 is arguably Cecil B.DeMille's best picture! There is little of his usual bluster bombast and over the top special effects. Although his grip on actors was always somewhat slack the flamboyant jodhpurs clad producer  director managed here to elicit fine performances from an attractive cast and come up with a well structured screenplay by Alan LeMay Charles Bennett and Jesse Lasky Jr. which derived from a novel by Thelma Strabel. Richly photographed in glowing Technicolor by Victor Milner Dewey Wrigley and William V.Skall the movie at the time of its release was being touted as a sort of Gone With The Wind of the sea and not only because the leading lady Paulette Goddard and her costar Susan Hayward had both tested for the part of Scarlet O'Hara three years earlier. Impressive also is the Hans Dreier and Roland Anderson nominated Art Direction especially for a party and a well staged ball sequence in Charleston. Combined with opulent set designs lavish costumes and ravishing colour these scenes positively sparkle. REAP THE WILD WIND is about the pirate wreckers who prey on the shipping lanes along the coast of Key West in 1840's Florida and scuttle great ships on the jagged rocks so as to extract the rich booty on board. Then there's the honest salvage ships who's sole purpose is to save lives and the valuable cargo. One such ship helmed by Captain Philpot Lynne Overman and his feisty and impetuous niece Loxi Claiborne Goddard rescue Captain Jack Stuart John Wayne and nurse him back to health. But the shipping company headed by the smooth and foppish lawyer Steve Tolliver Ray Milland wants Stuart never to command another ship because of his recklessness. In the meantime Loxi has fallen for Stuart who now has to vie with Tolliver for her affections.The cast is quite wonderful! Top billed is Ray Milland who gives his usual convincing and engaging performance as the man trying to win the heart of the attractive and boisterous Loxi the film's pivotal role well played by Goddard. But a revelation is John Wayne who is excellent in what is his first big movie and only his second in Technicolor. Surprisingly too in the engaging love scenes with Loxi Wayne cuts an accomplished romantic figure Nights on watch I'll see like this Loxi with your hair catching fire in the sunset and that look in your eyes ten thousand fathoms deep. Then there's the young and really attractive Susan Hayward in one of her early appearances as Loxi's starcrossed cousin Drusilla. Also effective is Raymond Massey as a black hearted villain with the colourful name of King Cutler and Robert Preston as Hayward's dashing young lover. The highlight of the movie is of course the excellent set piece towards the end of the picture where divers Milland and Wayne battle it out inside a ship's wreck in the ocean depths with a giant squid. In these days of CGI it is amazing that this scene that was always considered quite stunning can still manage to look powerfully real and exciting. The film won the 1942 Acadamy Award for special effects.Complimenting the picture throughout is the splendid score by De MIlle's favourite and trusted composer the great Victor Young. His Main Title is a rollicking and bawdy sea shanty and his theme for the sea is a broad full orchestral piece with powerful horn figures against romantic strings. Then for the young lovers Hayward and Preston there is a tender and lyrical theme that gives their scenes together an engaging and heartfelt charm.REAP THE WILD WIND is another of old Hollywood's master strokes. A timeless romantic sea adventure with a memorable cast that has been enjoyed by past generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many generations to come.".

But for me it is far easier to side with folks who like Reap the Wild Wind as a prime example of rousing oldfashioned screen storytelling at its best.Made just at the outbreak of World War II Paramount spared no expense to mount this superlavish yarn about romance treachery maritime adventure shipwrecks salvage risks involving dead ships and the spectacle of rivals searching for evidence in the deepwhere diving to find it involves less danger than the chance encounter with a giant squid lurking in a sunken hull.John Wayne appears in an uncharacteristic rolea flawed antihero long before that term was ever coined who is likable weak not too swift but yet charming and easy to root for. Ray Milland also does an unusual turn here. He is both a man of intellect and actionclever funny and brave. Paulette Goddard is a revelation to those who are unfamiliar with her screen work. Remember this was 1942. The superindependent feisty woman she plays with such enthusiasmwhile a role model for today's feministsalso shows an understandable human vulnerability. She has never appeared in another film that allowed her to be strong sexy and appealing all at the same time.The extraordinary supporting cast is an absolute delight. They carry off some of the most outrageously cornball dialogue ever spoken with such conviction that it becomes enjoyable. Raymond Massey's slimy overthetop villain is uniqueand so is Robert Preston's pathetic character as Massey's far less crafty brother. Preston is given the task of uttering one of the film's most unforgettable lines when arriving at a prearranged meeting with his girl friend a very young Susan Hayward that may never EVER have been topped as a groaner..Special mention should be made of the beautiful Technicolor employed in Reap the Wild Wind the engrossing special effects outstanding for their time and the exciting musical score written by Victor Young.Altogether this is a film that holds your interest from the start and never lets it down. It is grand entertainment from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Almost 65 years old it is still fun to watch. Lots of fun!".

	schema:headline " The Closest that DeMille Gets to a Shakespearean Tragedy Conclusion";
	schema:reviewBody "After the financial flopping of THE CRUSADES Cecil B. DeMille concentrated on films dealing with different aspects of American history from 1760 to 1942. THE PLAINSMAN dealt with Wild Bill Hickok Buffalo Bill Calamity Jane and even Custer. THE BUCCANEER dealt with the Battle of New Orleans Jean Lafitte and General Andy Jackson. UNION PACIFIC dealt with the transcontinental railroad no really historic figure dominated the story here. Then came an exception to this trend when DeMille turned to the Mounties v. Louis Riel in Manitoba in NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE. But he returned to the American History with REAP THE WILD WIND. The final two films were THE STORY OF DOCTOR WADDELL DeMille's only World War II film oddly enough and THE UNCONQUERED his only pre  19th Century American history film.REAP THE WILD WIND at first sight does not quite seem as understandable as the others. THE PLAINSMAN is about the threat to the frontier of the Indians getting modern weapons via villainous Charles Bickford. THE BUCCANEER does deal with how Jackson and Lafitte won the defining victory of the War of 1812 and saved the Mississippi Valley. UNION PACIFIC was how despite crooks like Brian Donleavy the great railroad united the U.S. with a backbone of steel. Even NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE explained why there were two nations going west to the Pacific not three the third made of Frenchmen and Metis and Indians. But REAP THE WILD WIND did not deal with westward expansion or with land. It dealt with the America's other 19th Century frontier the seas.We don't think of it outside perhaps of New England but from 1800 to 1865 our merchant marine was quite vigorous. Confederate raiders like C.S.S. Alabama destroyed much of it but until that we were giving Great Britain serious competition. But the background of REAP THE WILD WIND is actually a little out of date in the film. The story takes place in 1840 or so. It should be in the 1820s to early 1830s. When Great Britain ceased being our rulers our merchant ships suddenly were targeted by various predators. The best known was the Barbary Pirates with whom we had two wars in 1804 and 1815. But in the Caribbean a number of freebooters and pirates sprung up to ravage our struggling merchant ships. Indeed Jean Lafitte and his brother were suspected possibly unfairly of being among these  more likely the Lafittes were simply smugglers. In the late 1820s Captain David Porter was sent with a small flotilla to clean out the worst pirate stations in the Caribbean. He did a good job. Actually by 1840 our navy was doing a fine job protecting our ships.But for some reason DeMille moved the story into the 1840s. It does not hurt the film but it weakens it's historical accuracy.Ray Milland represents a wealthy ship owner Walter Hampden whose ships are being lost to wreckers in a gang headed by Raymond Massey.

	onyx:emotionText "After the financial flopping of THE CRUSADES Cecil B. DeMille concentrated on films dealing with different aspects of American history from 1760 to 1942. THE PLAINSMAN dealt with Wild Bill Hickok Buffalo Bill Calamity Jane and even Custer. THE BUCCANEER dealt with the Battle of New Orleans Jean Lafitte and General Andy Jackson. UNION PACIFIC dealt with the transcontinental railroad no really historic figure dominated the story here. Then came an exception to this trend when DeMille turned to the Mounties v. Louis Riel in Manitoba in NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE. But he returned to the American History with REAP THE WILD WIND. The final two films were THE STORY OF DOCTOR WADDELL DeMille's only World War II film oddly enough and THE UNCONQUERED his only pre  19th Century American history film.REAP THE WILD WIND at first sight does not quite seem as understandable as the others. THE PLAINSMAN is about the threat to the frontier of the Indians getting modern weapons via villainous Charles Bickford. THE BUCCANEER does deal with how Jackson and Lafitte won the defining victory of the War of 1812 and saved the Mississippi Valley. UNION PACIFIC was how despite crooks like Brian Donleavy the great railroad united the U.S. with a backbone of steel. Even NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE explained why there were two nations going west to the Pacific not three the third made of Frenchmen and Metis and Indians. But REAP THE WILD WIND did not deal with westward expansion or with land. It dealt with the America's other 19th Century frontier the seas.We don't think of it outside perhaps of New England but from 1800 to 1865 our merchant marine was quite vigorous. Confederate raiders like C.S.S. Alabama destroyed much of it but until that we were giving Great Britain serious competition. But the background of REAP THE WILD WIND is actually a little out of date in the film. The story takes place in 1840 or so. It should be in the 1820s to early 1830s. When Great Britain ceased being our rulers our merchant ships suddenly were targeted by various predators. The best known was the Barbary Pirates with whom we had two wars in 1804 and 1815. But in the Caribbean a number of freebooters and pirates sprung up to ravage our struggling merchant ships. Indeed Jean Lafitte and his brother were suspected possibly unfairly of being among these  more likely the Lafittes were simply smugglers. In the late 1820s Captain David Porter was sent with a small flotilla to clean out the worst pirate stations in the Caribbean. He did a good job. Actually by 1840 our navy was doing a fine job protecting our ships.But for some reason DeMille moved the story into the 1840s. It does not hurt the film but it weakens it's historical accuracy.Ray Milland represents a wealthy ship owner Walter Hampden whose ships are being lost to wreckers in a gang headed by Raymond Massey. Hampden's chief ship captain is John Wayne. As the film progresses he and Milland become rivals for Paulette Goddard. Her sister Susan Hayward becomes enamored with Massey's younger brother Robert Preston. Massey is not too keen on this except if it gets him additional information of the movement of Hampden's ships. On the other hand he uses the Wayne  Milland rivalry to get control of a sort over Wayne.A shipwreck of the flagship of Hampden's line results and this leads to Milland's attempts to bring Massey to book in court. But the latter is extremely clever and he suggests that Milland's behavior may have led to the disaster. The court decides they need further evidence  and this leads to testing the testimony of a slave who claims the ship was haunted and there was a noisy ghost in the hold.

It involves shipwrecks deepsea diving and giant squids among other things.  It's that rare kind of movie that's genuinely fun to watch where you find yourself smiling because you're so engrossed in the story and the characters often in spite of yourself.  It's of the Saturdayafternoonatthemovies genre where you leave plausibility at the door and put yourself in the hands of people who know how to entertain.Reap the Wild Wind' is the story of a sea captain John Wayne whose cargo ships are repeatedly sunk and plundered by a vicious crew of salvagers. When one of his ships is struck down Wayne is rescued by a spirited southern belle Paulette Goddard with whom he falls in love.  In order to help Wayne get the command he dreams of Goddard becomes friendly with an influential lawyer Ray Milland and a love triangle develops.  Through various turns of events the two men find themselves on opposite sides of the fight against the raiders with Goddard caught in between them.  The story builds up to a spectacular battle with the squid which singlehandedly won the film an Oscar for its special effects.The movie is well acted straight across the board.  Wayne having just achieved stardom has the least colorful role but still registers strongly. Goddard plays her tempestuous role to the hilt and is a joy to behold throughout.  Her character is a welcome variation from the frail straitlaced heroines of her time  she enjoys salty sea ballads throws frequent tantrums and is not afraid to get her hands dirty  something of a toneddown Scarlett O'Hara.  Raymond Massey is rightly villainous as the chief pillager.  The highest acting honors go to Milland however.  His performance as the shrewd but foppish attorney is delightful stealing scene after scene and providing priceless moments of comic relief then turning noble toward the end.In addition the movie is beautiful to look at.  At the time the film was made color photography was still relatively new and quite costly so it was generally reserved for epics.  You can see every penny of it on the screen here.  The direction is brisk and vigorous and the visual effects are fantastic for that era or any other.".

The plot is typical DeMille obscure historical incident blown up for the big screen. Romance triangle punctuated by action sequences leading to a rousing conclusion. The film is well cast with Paramount Stars Paulette Goddard and Ray Milland. Not able to get Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power CB obtained John Wayne who turned in a credible and sincere performance. Milland stood up well to the 'Duke' and Ms. Goddard was a radiant love interest. A young Susan Hayward also showed her stuff with Robert Preston. Over shadowing all was Raymond Massey as the head villain with stooge Victor Kilian. Not to be forgotten was the CB stock company from players who were with him during the silent era to Akim Tamiroff in a voice over for the 'Lamb'. Paramounts special visual effects wizard Gordon Jennings led that team and garnered a Oscar and Victor Young provide the score. Music being very important in carrying some of the fantastic goings on. Especially the Giant Squid scene that was directed underwater by CB himself.The one 1 thing we never understood about CB is that he left many BETTER projects go fallow after investing money and time developing them. A few were THE WAR OF THE WORLDS TITANIC and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. Two 2 were done by George Pal with CB as uncredited producer. It would have been very interesting to see how these would have turned out if made in the 1930s.

	schema:reviewBody "Reap the Wild Wind 1942  out of 4 Cecil B. DeMille's overthetop but fun adventure takes place in the 1840s as ships try to reach the Atlantic ocean but often end up wrecked on the shoals of Florida. Southern belle Loxi Claiborne Paulette Goddard has Captain Jack Stuart John Wayne and Stephen Tolliver Ray Milland battling for her before the men end up battling a giant squid. REAP THE WILD WIND is a pretty fun movie although there's no question that it doesn't rank among the director's best work and there are some fairly big flaws scattered throughout the picture. I love Milland but I thought he just wasn't right for this role. In later years John Wayne would say that he was cast in the movie to make Milland seem more like a man and perhaps that's true. There just wasn't a single second where I bought Milland and Wayne battling each other for this woman and their fight scenes aren't very believable either. Milland gives a good performance don't get me wrong but he just wasn't right for the part. Wayne still not a star does a nice job in his role although there's a scene early on where he gets knocked out and the way Wayne does this is somewhat laughable. Goddard is her usual good self and we get nice support from villain Raymond Massey Robert Preston Charles Bickford and Susan Hayward. The visual effects ended up winning an Oscar when this was originally released and I'm sure people only used to CGI effects are going to think these here are awful. For 1942 they're actually pretty good and this includes the scenes with the ships on the sea. I'm not exactly sure what DeMille put into the pool that they were shooting these scenes but the water looks beautiful. As for the giant squid at the end it's certainly very fake looking and I was a little surprised that they didn't do more with it as the fight is pretty small. REAP THE WILD WIND isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "A common thread running through Cecil B. DeMille films is the leading lady having two men getting their hormones in an uproar over the leading lady. You've got Joel McCrea and Robert Preston rivals for Barbara Stanwyck in Union Pacific Gary Cooper and Preston Foster over Madeline Carroll in Northwest Mounted Police Charlton Heston and Cornel Wilde flipping for Betty Hutton in The Greatest Show On Earth etc. But DeMille never did this theme better than in Reap The Wild Wind. Without Paulette Goddard coquetting both John Wayne and Ray Milland you wouldn't have a plot for this film.Additionally John Wayne for what maybe the only time in his film career plays a knave. After appearing to lose Paulette Goddard to Milland Wayne goes over to Raymond Massey and Massey plays him like a piccolo and wins him over to his nefarious schemes.Massey gives the best performance in the movie. There is a long trial sequence and Massey being an extremely shrewd lawyer almost turns the whole trial around and has court convinced that it's Ray Milland behind all the pirate wrecks in the Florida Keys. This after playing John Wayne for a fool. Massey is done in of course but by something he really couldn't take into account.The action takes place in the Florida Keys where Paulette Goddard owns a salvage company. Yet she lives in grand plantation style that would put Tara to shame. Now Florida was a Confederate state but the only part of Florida that had the plantation culture was the panhandle. You didn't have Tara style mansions in the Keys.But because the movie is set in the South you also have some really bad black stereotypes. DeMille was hardly the only director to use them though. But one incredible error slips through. One of the characters during the trial was a black actor named Oscar Polk who plays Saltmeat who is a crew member of John Wayne's ship and gives a key piece of testimony that ultimately proves to be Raymond Massey's downfall. Saltmeat is identified as a Barbadoes free Negro in the film. But Saltmeat doesn't talk like Harry Belafonte. He sounds like any ordinary black actor who would be playing a field hand on the old plantation. I can't believe DeMille didn't realize this error. But I guess it was easier to bow to the racial stereotypes than show a black character realistically in context.The movie made a lot of money in 1942. It was filmed in great technicolor and it did win an Oscar for Special Effects because of the climatic fight with a giant squid that Milland and Wayne engage in. The effects look cheesy now but back in 1942 they were something else.I think a lot of black people would be terribly offended if they watched this dated epic.".

Many of his films were romantic sexual comedies  as he is supposed to have believed that Americans were curious only about money and sex . His bestknown were biblical epics that further established him as the symbol of Hollywood such as King of Kings 1927 The ten Commandments 1923  The Crusades 1935 and  of course  Charlton Heston's Ten commandments 1956 and he made two versions about The Buccaneer  1938 and 1958 that was ended by Anthony Quinn and Arthur Rosson .".

I have always found that although his films are impressive visually the dialog and acting is purely secondary at best. However the acting here is a little better than usual for DeMilleRaymond Massey John Wayne and Ray Milland are all fine. The only acting that really seemed poor was that of Paulette Goddard but this isn't surprising because histrionic and overthetop performances of leading ladies is a DeMille trademark see Anne Baxter's performance in The Ten Commandments if you don't believe me.Generally this movie had a wellwritten plot and it was both unusual and compelling. So because of a decent plot and better than expected acting this is already a pretty good DeMille film.However when it comes to the action some things leave a bit to be desired. While to today's audiences the ship scenes will no doubt look pretty fake for 1942 they were pretty good AND you could not see the sides of the pool in the underwater shots something all too common in underwater scenes of the day. So my BIG argument about the movie visually is the terrible action scene at the end involving the most fakelooking giant squid ever seen on film. I can't imagine even in 1942 that people would have seen and believed this segment at all. In fact I would think they probably would have laughed themselves silly! So the overall product is a mixed bag. It is definitely entertaining reasonably wellacted apart from some histrionics here and there and has fair special effect. It certainly is far from great but is worth your time.".

At a fancy tea party Goddard sings a song badly. This doesn't bother the third part of the film's love triangle seafaring ventriloquist and lawyer Ray Milland as Stephen 'Steve' Tolliver...Getting cozy Goddard and Mr. Milland exchange come hither looks and talk about marriage. As you might expect the men clash over Goddard. Mr. De Mille gets some good costumes and color photography by Victor Milner and William V. Skall for his effort but fails to make this an artful epic. Apparently something approaching Gone with the Wind 1939 was intended. While nicely decorated many of the ship set scenes seem directed to look small. The relationships between the three leads  Goddard Wayne and Milland  is confused and juvenile. Better acting honors go to the squirrelly monkey the talking dog and the giant squid although Robert Preston as Dan Cutler somehow finds his character and makes it work. Still the film was a success at the box office and won an Academy Award for special effects. Reap the Wild Wind 31842 Cecil B. DeMille  Paulette Goddard John Wayne Ray Milland Raymond Massey".

At a fancy tea party Goddard sings a song badly. This doesn't bother the third part of the film's love triangle seafaring ventriloquist and lawyer Ray Milland as Stephen 'Steve' Tolliver...Getting cozy Goddard and Mr. Milland exchange come hither looks and talk about marriage. As you might expect the men clash over Goddard. Mr. De Mille gets some good costumes and color photography by Victor Milner and William V. Skall for his effort but fails to make this an artful epic. Apparently something approaching Gone with the Wind 1939 was intended. While nicely decorated many of the ship set scenes seem directed to look small. The relationships between the three leads  Goddard Wayne and Milland  is confused and juvenile. Better acting honors go to the squirrelly monkey the talking dog and the giant squid although Robert Preston as Dan Cutler somehow finds his character and makes it work. Still the film was a success at the box office and won an Academy Award for special effects. Reap the Wild Wind 31842 Cecil B. DeMille  Paulette Goddard John Wayne Ray Milland Raymond Massey";

I've proved that with a disparate group. There was a pretty wide range assembled and a good time was had by all. I personally don't usually care for seafaring tales but with the cast in this I had to take a look. Really got caught up in it. There are no doubt errors omissions failed nuances wrong person wrong role but really like any movie what it is  it is. What's the point of picking at it? So much to like here.There are a number of pictures that reveal a young John Wayne in a different genre from where he settled but this is about the last of them. He was very close to stepping into his real boot prints where he basically settled in to become the Duke. However he was there to enjoy anyway if not yet in all his glory. Sadly here his character's turnout was something to cause angst and ultimately much chagrin. But Pilgrim he never does that to us again! It is odd to see Ray Milland billed above John Wayne and some of the other actors who were also yet on their rise. He was cool in this which actually was his thing in varied ways. At first it looks like he's going to be just another fashionable young man and a bit of an eccentric. During this period the frills were part of the well dressed gentry or nobleman and not a mark of a sissy. Instead it was that he had nothing to prove so he relaxed and did as he liked. Also it was more a matter of being the cagey fox awaiting his moment. During that phase you begin to get kind of irritated with him but steady as she goes he ends up being the manly hero earning even the grudging admiration. And he gets the girl. Suppose you were to say that some character actors are entirely better actors than many stars it's obvious  please and having swallowed that you can mention Raymond Massey in the former camp. You are going to get the good the bad or the ugly according to what the script required regardless of which it was. Here it was dastardly well done. And there were a lot of worthy seagoing thugs tars and salts including Charles Bickford surprisingly. Hedda Hopper is in one of her few roles here before she moved over to spilling the scoop. Oh and the good Captain Philpott. Wasn't he a delight.Robert Preston did his chores adequately. I liked Susan Hayward in this because she was somewhat subdued. Never cared for the full blown SH myself but many did. Paulette Goddard stops a lot of clocks but others are still running. However I acknowledge her strengths and very strong contribution to this movie. She actually fills it up for most of the running. She flowed very naturally in this part especially in the adventure stages. Her Southern belle doesn't quite ring true with me but her tomboy gungho does. Have liked her in a lot of things.And with your crosssection of viewers if you happen to have anyone seeing impaired along they won't have any trouble with the giant squid encounter. Whatever its characteristics it is huge. You'll get at least a couple of impressed responses from a group. I endured to the spasmodic end on first viewing but now at the beginning of the segment I'm working my fast forward. But it is quite a todo.If you liked certain elements of this you might like The Wreck of the Mary Deare which has a variation of the salvage and mysteriously wrecked vessel thing going along with the strong inquiry.".

He plays the down on his luck sea captain. She plays a lovely young woman secretly in love with the wrong man. Next the color and costuming are brilliantly filmed. Money was obviously spent with the anticipation of money being made. It is no Gone With the Wind but the two ultimately don't compare plot wise. The story is a clever one and has plenty of action at sea and in the courtroom. What looks quite hokey today would have looked pretty spectacular to a moviegoer in 1942.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know of any other Wayne film before the forgettable '47 Tycoon that was filmed in color. After his epic BW western Union Pacific DeMille had the clout to insist all his future works be filmed in Technicolor a rare luxury treatment in the early and mid'40s. Color films didn't become dominate until competition from TV forced Hollywood to provide more reasons for people to watch films in theaters instead of on TV as color TVs didn't become common until the '60s. This film is perhaps my favorite Wayne flickif we can consider it a Wayne film as he didn't get top billing. I've seen it several times. The Technicolor treatment is certainly one reason but I'm also hooked on DeMille's better filmsIn spite of several other fine '39 westerns Union Pacific is my clear favorite for that year. The general style of the present film apes that of Gone with the Wind to which it is often disparagingly compared. I've never been a big fan of the latter. If given a choice I would see DeMille's film again. It is also commonly compared to Wayne's latter filmThe Wake of the Red Witch which I have not seen but is said to be largely a reworked version of the present film.Considering the age of this film I thought the DVD transfer quality excellent with vivid colors. From the included background extras we learn that much of the shooting took place on location in Charleston and the Key West area. However the under water scenes were done in a huge tank. Both Paulette Goddard and Susan Hayward tried out for the role of Scarlett in Gone with the Wind. It is speculated that Ms. Goddard lost out partly because of her uncertain official relationship with her lover of recent years Charlie Chaplin. By the time the present film was begun this relationship was over.There are many complexities to this film and so many interesting if sometimes stock characters. I thought all the main characters and most of the supporting characters were well cast. Captain Jack and Steve Tolliver seemed destined to be at each other's throats throughout the story. Yet occasionally they fought together against a common enemy and helped the other in a desperate situation. Captain Jack is a tragic character sometimes in hot water through no fault of his own yet performing a dastardly deed to help win his love that precipitates the demise of many of the main characters. Raymond Massey sheds his Lincoln and John Brown images to become an engaging masterful villain. I found his performance in the courtroom as Captain Jack's lawyer riveting. In fact the whole courtroom scene was masterfully done. In one of the many convoluted relationships Susan Hayward's character falls for Massey's handsome younger brother who lives in his brother's shadow as a marginal villain. This romance on the sneak will become central to the tragic and redemptive events near the end of the story. I thought the talking dog and mischievous pet capuchin served well to provide some comic relief. I also enjoyed Lynne Overman's portrayal of Captain Phil a classic old salt and grandfatherly figure. My main gripe is I didn't like the ending the parting scene specifically. It just didn't ring plausible or just.".

I must admit that the DVD print was quite shoddy. I might have enjoyed this film a lot more if I saw it on Bluray or something. Though I doubt it.I found it hard to sit through this one. The film is about the rivalry between two sailors  Wayne and Milland over a woman  Pauline Goddard who has inherited a marine salvage business even as the three of them try to stave off and defeat pirates in the Key West. Wayne's character is saved by Goddard at the beginning of the film and even gets beaten up at one point by Milland's competing character when he is about to get married to Goddard on a ship. Wayne switches sides at least twice and him and Milland are constantly at odds with each other. Goddard has a soft corner for Wayne though. Wayne's character dies in the end and Goddard goes back with Milland. The climax involves a prolonged underwater scene where Wayne and Milland wear underwater suits to search for the body of a woman. An octopussquid attacks Miland. Wayne looks on for a while. Then he decides to intervene and he gets killed by the creature. It is pathetic. As I said earlier Miland and Pauline Godard decides to unite in the end. Zzzzzz! The film did boast of some fine shots of monstrous waves and underwater sequences. But I could tell that the scenes on the ship were all shot on a set. The film did win an Oscar for visual effects.John Wayne was a lot thinner compared to his later films and looked quite dashing. A word you would not associate with his more beefy avatar in the prime of his career. The film was quite talky and overtly dramatic.It was directed by Cecille.B.Demille. I would not recommend this. But I am from another era. Some of the reviewers seem to be quite fond of this film which explains the respectable 6.8 rating on IMDb. I did not like it. Even though I enjoyed Mutiny on the Bounty  the version that came 20 years after this one.".

As others have pointed out you get an idea of what kind of Scarlett O'Hara Paulette Goddard would have made.  This is definitely one of John Wayne's best roles.The bad news here is  Cecil B. DeMille was a great director but he was definitely of another era even in the 1940s.  Cecil B. DeMille was clearly jealous of Victor Fleming and David O. Selznick and their success with GWTW.  Paulette Goddard would have made a poor Scarlett O'Hara unless all you wanted was a Scarlett who couldn't decide whether she was supposed to be a simpering and nauseating little fool or a female swashbuckler.  While Ray Milland does a good job here it seems like an odd role for him.The underwater diving scenes toward the climax of the film while primitive by today's standards of special effects are imaginative and stunning. Kudos!There are quite a few great character actors in this film although with the exception of Raymond Massey as the ultimate bad guy few have very big parts  Robert Preston Susan Hayward Charles Bickford and Louise Beavers who is delightful. Milburn Stone of Gunsmoke is there too although I missed him entirely. You'll also recognize Oscar Polk when you hear his voice  one of the memorable slaves in GWTW.This is a difficult film for me to rate. It is certainly not a great film such as GWTW or BenHur or even DeMille's The Ten Commandments but it is entertaining. Recommended to be seen at least once.".

DeMille was a great director but he was definitely of another era even in the 1940s.  Cecil B. DeMille was clearly jealous of Victor Fleming and David O. Selznick and their success with GWTW.  Paulette Goddard would have made a poor Scarlett O'Hara unless all you wanted was a Scarlett who couldn't decide whether she was supposed to be a simpering and nauseating little fool or a female swashbuckler.  While Ray Milland does a good job here it seems like an odd role for him.The underwater diving scenes toward the climax of the film while primitive by today's standards of special effects are imaginative and stunning. Kudos!There are quite a few great character actors in this film although with the exception of Raymond Massey as the ultimate bad guy few have very big parts  Robert Preston Susan Hayward Charles Bickford and Louise Beavers who is delightful. Milburn Stone of Gunsmoke is there too although I missed him entirely. You'll also recognize Oscar Polk when you hear his voice  one of the memorable slaves in GWTW.This is a difficult film for me to rate. It is certainly not a great film such as GWTW or BenHur or even DeMille's The Ten Commandments but it is entertaining. Recommended to be seen at least once.";

	schema:reviewBody "On the Town is one great fast moving musical one in which the dance is supreme. Not surprising because this is the first film that Gene Kelly had total creative control over. On the Town ran for 462 performances on Broadway from December 1944 to February 1946 and it's score was composed by Leonard Bernstein with lyrics by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Naturally the book included some topical war time references for 1944 which were eliminated in 1949. So was about half of Bernstein's score but Comden and Green wrote the lyrics for the new songs also with Roger Edens. That certainly helped keep the continuity.Of course the signature song of the Broadway score New York New York was kept. The rest of the score is really not all that great in terms of marketability. But Kelly was interested in giving the dance center stage in this film and he succeeded admirably. Of course of the six principals in the cast he had both Ann Miller and VeraEllen a pair of very good dancers to help. The plot of On the Town is threadbare. Three sailors Kelly Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin get 24 hour shore leave and they are determined to experience as much New York as they can. That opening number with the men pouring out of the ship on the Brooklyn Navy Yard dock is unforgettable and then Kelly Sinatra and Munshin singing and dancing New York New York. Munshin attracts the attention of Ann Miller who finds his resemblance to a caveman recreation astounding. Her big moment on the screen is tap dancing to Primitive Man ending with Munshin destroying one of the dinosaur skeletons in the Museum of Natural History.This was Munshin's third film after MGM signed him up for a small role in Easter Parade. He was a borscht belt comedian who got his big break on Broadway in Call Me Mister. With Sinatra and Kelly in Take Me Out to the Ballgame before On the Town he was a pretty funny fellow. He spent his career equally between the stage screen and later television. Perhaps it's why he's not really remembered today by film fans that much.Sinatra catches the eye of cabdriver Betty Garrett. One big reason for rewriting the score was in the original play there was no ballad for Sinatra's character. Besides the ensemble numbers Sinatra and Garrett sing Come Up to My Place from the original score and You're Awful Awful Nice to be with. Nothing terribly memorable in fact Frank never recorded any of the material from On the Town. But to have in the film and not give him one ballad would have been ridiculous.It's the dance numbers that make On the Town. Besides the ones previously mentioned Kelly and VeraEllen do a salute to their common small town in Main Street and there is the lengthy A Day in New York ballet. The year before Kelly had shown what he was really capable of creating in the Slaughter on Tenth Avenue ballet in Words and Music. Now that he had complete creative control and he made maximum use of it. Of course this was nothing compared to what he was to create in later films.VeraEllen probably is best known for being Rosemary Clooney's sister in White Christmas. But she's shown to far better advantage here. I'm surprised Kelly did not team with her more often. On the Town is really helped a lot by the location shooting in New York. Director Stanley Donen very skillfully blended his shots of well known New York landmarks like the Brooklyn Navy Yard the Brooklyn Bridge Wall Street Columbus Circle with the later interiors done on the MGM soundstage. Really great job of editing.To see New York in 1949 you couldn't ask for three better guides than those sailors on a 24 hour pass.".

This is pure uplifting and satisfying Entertainment beautifully crafted and delivered and guaranteed to make your day a little brighter.

Nowhere in the history of filmed musicals will you find such barnstorming talent and exuberant fun packed into one simple little tune.

	schema:headline " Hard to resist going out 'On The Town' with this cast!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've rewatched both these movie musicals in the space of a week and ON THE TOWN is no SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. I mean what is? By 1952 the sheer technical mastery of Gene Kelly had melded perfectly with an entire soundtrack of classics and a clever satirical plotline with some of the best film characters ever created Lina Lamont anybody?.Having got that out of the way however there is simply no denying that ON THE TOWN is essential viewing in the Kelly oeuvre. It tells the story of three lonely sailors who finally get shore leave in New York for 24 hours. Of course they're on the prowl to paint the town red preferably with girls on their arms. Though for a brief while Sinatra does charmingly play a skinny little geek bent on seeing the sights of New York flinging facts from his guide book and appearing unaffected by Betty Garrett's streetwise cabbie flinging herself at him. Gabey Gene Kelly falls for 'Miss Turnstiles' or Ivy Smith VeraEllen and spends the day trying to track her down from information on the poster. Chip Frank Sinatra meets cabbie Hildy Garrett who teaches him how to have a little fun while they romp gaily through two great duets together 'Come Up To My Place' and 'You're Awful'. Ozzie Jules Munshin in the meantime gets entangled with the Claire Huddesen an absolutely delightful Ann Miller who likes how much he resembles her ideal 'Prehistoric Man'. They dance and sing their way through a series of misunderstandings between Gabey and Ivy but all comes right in the end as the girls bid their fellows farewell from the dock.So what's so good about ON THE TOWN you ask? Well first of all it's brilliant fun and very amusingfrom the dancing to the singing to the snappy dialogue. It takes a while to get used to the very forward New York women played with marvellous wit and charm by Garrett and Miller but once you get over their throwing themselves at Chip and 'Specimen' respectively you really appreciate ON THE TOWN for what it is pure unadulterated and unpretentious entertainment. Granted The songs aren't as catchy as in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But there are definitely some minor classics to be heard here'You're Awful' Frankie's serenading of Betty and 'Count On Me' being among them. I thought it was a really nice touch to have Bern Hoffman singing a lazymorning song 'I'm Feeling Like I'm Not Out Of Bed' to bookend the film beginning and end to give the sense of a full day having passed.It should probably also be granted that there isn't quite enough dancing especially not from Gene Kelly who is always a delight to watch even when mostly playing the bystander as he was in the 'Count On Me' number and Ann Miller who got the chance to show off her amazing tapdancing skills and gorgeous gams in the wildly energetic 'Prehistoric Man'. It only whetted my appetite to see more of her dancing and singing! I'd have liked it if Miller's role was expanded period. She gave her character an indescribable life and vivacity in the limited screen time she had and overshadowed VeraEllen easily.. I'd have loved it if Kelly had danced properly with Miller too the latter being one of the best female tapdancers in the business. All the same the sweet ballad 'Main Street' that Gabey sings to Ivy is accompanied by a beautiful dance routine that shades naturally and easily from dancing to walking and back againa perfect example of Gene Kelly's ability as both dancer and choreographer to present and capture movie magic with no special effects. I actually much prefer the 'New York Ballet' in this film to the one in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS mostly because it fits the plot beautifully and is smaller and more intimate and more focused on Gene Kelly the dancer rather than Gene Kelly the choreographer. It gives Kelly the opportunity to shine as both dancer and actor the scenes when he dances with the Miss Turnstiles poster are achingly believable in the way they could only be if Kelly were dancing in them. The shadow sequence at the ballet barre with VeraEllen is also something incredible to behold and perfectlystaged.ON THE TOWN is a great night at the movies and is time wellspent with a few characters you really get to know an excellent cast Alice Pearce practically steals the entire show as Lucy Schmeeler for examplenot an easy task considering who she was playing against! and a great soundtrack. It's probably one of the best precursors you could have to Kelly's much more ambitious musical undertakings in the form of AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But on its merits it is definitely worth watching. Perhaps again and again. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a very simple plot. Three sailors have 24 hours shore leave in New York. They met three attractive girls and three romances blossom. And that's about it. The characterisation is really no more advanced than the plot development. The sailors and their sweethearts are each given their own idiosyncrasies but none of them really emerges as a rounded individual. Fortunately however a complex plot and welldeveloped characters are not always essential to the musical genre and On the Town manages to succeed reasonably well without these elements.The film's most important quality is the energy and vivacity of its songanddance numbers. It was shot on location in New York itself and the city is portrayed as a vibrant exciting place a new world as far as the sailors who are all country boys are concerned. There is also plenty of humour such as the scene where Frank Sinatra wants to go sightseeing unlike his newfound girlfriend a manhungry female cab driver who would rather take him back to my place Gene Kelly's search for Miss Turnstiles whom he imagines to be a glamorous and famous beauty queen and the scene where the three men manage to demolish a dinosaur skeleton in the city's Museum of Anthropology. Jules Munshin's girlfriend is described as a lady anthropologist although the scriptwriters seem to have blurred the difference between anthropology and palaeontology. The songs are tuneful although with the possible exception of New York New York none of them are particularly memorable. Some have criticised the more formal balletic sequence near the end but as far as I was concerned this was one of the best parts of the movie. After all if you are going to make a film starring a dancer as talented as Gene Kelly you might as well use his talents to the full.This is not really my favourite musical. It lacks for example the indefinable magic of Singin' in the Rain which also starred Kelly or the depth and social comment of West Side Story Leonard Bernstein's other New York musical made twelve years later. The contrast between these two films shows just how far the genre had progressed in just over a decade. Nevertheless it is enjoyable enough for anyone in the mood for softcentred escapist entertainment. 710".

Although it may not be as good as Singin' In The Rain it's truly a masterpiece that no home should be with out!Jules Munshin is energetic in the role of Ozzie!  Gene Kelly plays the part of the lovesick Gabey absolutely perfect!  And although I am a die hard Kelly fan I must say that the best male performance given in this film was from Ol' Blue Eyes himself Mr. Frank Sinatra!  In the role of Chip he brings a certain innocence as well as that sailor spunk and vitality!  And the three of them crooning songs such as New York New York Let's Go To My Place and On The Town is absolutely wonderful especially Kelly and Sinatra!Ann Miller is fantastic as the leggy anthropologist Claire!  She brings a lot of zest to her role!  It's hilarious to hear her refer to Ozzie as Specimen!  VeraEllen also is WONDERFUL in the role of Ivy or Miss Turnstiles!  She is a highly underrated actress... and her dancing is truly DIVINE!  However another highly underated actress is Betty Garrett who portrays the female cabbie Hildie!  She makes the role zippy and sassy... and she and Chip singing Let's Go To My Place is an absolute kneeslapper that will have you laughing and singing with it every time!  Alice Pearce is also rather funny as Hildie's roomate Lucy Shmeeler.I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of musicals especially the older ones such as An American In Paris Singin' In The Rain and Take Me Out To The Ballgame.  This carefree frolic of a film will leave you laughing and singing for days!".

	schema:reviewBody "because it's just a big silly MGM confection with no okay very few pretenses towards art. Three sailors on shore leave in New York meet three girls. That's the entire plot. However two of those sailors are a couple of the 20th century's greatest entertainers Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra so MGM builds an extravaganza around them complete with ballet sequences love duets and thencurrent digs at popular culture you might have to explain the dinosaurDinah Shore joke to younger children. Along for the ride are some venerable MGM contract players like VeraEllen and Ann Miller not to mention a couple of future TV sitcom wacky neighbors Alice Pearce the paranoid Gladys Kravitz from Bewitched and Betty Garrett the liberated Irene Lorenzo from All in the Family. How can you lose? It's easy to loathe Gene Kelly. He's smarmy and egotistical those massive closeups in Singin' in the Rain remain scorched onto my retinas but he's also a great dancer and a brilliant choreographer and here codirector Stanely Donen manages to keep his personality flaws in check. In On the Town he plays Gabey an Iowa hick and his unusual willingness to not be the smartest guy in the room makes him much more tolerable. Kelly spends a big chunk of his shore leave tracking down VeraEllen whose image on a subway poster inspires a comic fantasy sequence. When he finally meets her the rest of the cast spends a lot of time and money protecting him from the truth which is that she's a twobit hoofer and not a celebrity. Sinatra plays Gabey's buddy Chip another wideeyed yokel in the big city. Frankie doesn't create much of a character but he looks pretty and sounds great so it doesn't really matter. Ol' Blue Eyes hooks up with Garrett a lady cab driver scandal! with average looks but great comic timing. She's also blessed with a decent singing voice and a hysterically frumpy roommate played by Pearce. The third singing sailor is Jules Munshin as lovable big lug Ozzie who provides adequate but unnecessary comic relief and is mightily upstaged by his romantic interest the very funny sexy and graceful Ann Miller as manic rich girl Claire. Miller was such a megatalent that she was impossible to classify  she could sing dance act and tell jokes  and that very versatility might have kept her from becoming a bigger star. But she's magnificent here outshining her betterknown costars with bits like the hysterical Prehistoric Man number Bearskin! Bearskin! I love bearskin!.So that's the plot which is of course tertiary to the song and dance. Leonard Bernstein composed the score and some of the songs are magnificent  here Sinatra takes on a New York New York with a rousing chorus and silky verse that's far superior to the plodding nursery rhyme he would popularize in the 70s. Frankie's love duet with Garrett You're Awful is a riot and the title song is nice and lively. Kelly warbles a couple of dirges but they're blessedly short. The dancing when it's integrated with the plot is loads of fun but Kelly stops the action cold for a ballet sequence called Three Sailors and a Girl which is dull but to its credit nowhere near as disruptive or selfindulgent as the Broadway Melody number from Singin' in the Rain. To its debit it doesn't have Cyd Charisse and those sixfoot legs of hers. So pop this one in the DVD player and enjoy.".

When 3 sailors have a leave in NYC and their main objective is to pick up girls you know that you are in for some laughs.  From the dinosaur to the cab drivers this movie is a score on my list.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really great musical and that is an odd thing to admit. Because for a great musical it has little in the way of great music.The reputation of Leonard Bernstein as a composer is one of the stickiest points about his career to discuss among lovers of American music and musicals. Bernstein was a great conductor. He was also a great teacher of music appreciation as his series of Young People's Concerts on television showed. But was he a great composer? He tried to be composing serious music that was for the concert hall most of which has never caught on with the public.As for his music for the theater the results are mixed. On The Town based on the music for his ballet about sailors in New York Fancy Free Trouble In Tahiti Candide Wonderful Town and best of allWest Side Story were popular hits of the 1940s and 1950s. But how successful do they remain. Forgetting West Side Story  which has his best truly memorable score Candide manages to get revived but there are problems with the book will they use Lillian Hellman's version or Hugh Wheeler's. Come and be Gay is a semistandard but how frequently does one hear This is the best of all possible worlds. Same problem happens with Trouble In Tahiti which is revived even less than Candide. On The Town had a successful revival in New York four years back but it's sole semistandard hardly sung by singers in concert or nightclubs is It's a Wonderful Town. Wonderful Town has a good book based on My Sister Eileen but the tunes like That's the Way to Lose a Man and Ohio are serviceable but not permanent repertory. Those are the memorable musicals. His last one about the Presidency 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was a flop from the first day care to hear The Thomas Jefferson March?.The music in On The Town is again serviceable. Some of it is sprightly  like the duet between Sinatra and Betty Garrett Come to My Place. But it is basically music that was written for the purpose of dance numbers which it serves quite well  especially for Kelly and VeraEllen. Note the number about Miss Turnstyles wherein Kelly is reading VeraEllen's biographical information and we see her dancing in matching sequences to the descriptions. Or the ballet where Kelly finds himself abandoned by her when she fails to show up for a date which I suspect influenced him and maybe Vincent Minnelli in the better ballet at the end of An American In Paris where Kelly dreams of the loss of Leslie Caron.The story of three sailors on shore leave in New York City for twenty four hours and how they each meet the woman of their dreams is quite enchanting if impossible to watch. The parings are fascinating Kelly and VeraEllen both dancing into each other's life. Garrett as Brunhilde Esterhazy as a man hunting cab driver pursuing and winning a frightened Sinatra still in that annoying naive dimwit series of roles  though less annoying than in Anchors Aweigh. Miller as an anthropology student attracted to the Neanderthal looking Munshin is quite funny. Yet there is a missing element here from the musical not found in the film.Miller has a boyfriend mentioned once or twice but never seen in the film. He is financing her education. In the musical he does appear  a judge named Pitkin. Pitkin is a sweet nebbish who lets Miller's character Claire twist him around his finger for much of the musical. They are supposed to be going out to dinner that night and she keeps putting him off telling him to meet her later she is busy with Ozzie Munshin's character at a variety of nightclubs. At the same time in the musical Alice Pearce's character Lucy Shmeeler is being pulled around by Gabey Gene Kelly's character while he is trying to romance Ivy Smith VeraEllen's character.But after the fourth time Pitkin gets tired of this mistreatment. He sings a song cut with his character in the movie showing that the hidden lion in his personality has been aroused in anger at Claire's selfishness. He has been always too docile with his mother his brother Claire and he has suffered for too long as a result. But the only person who hears this is Lucy the other six have gone off together. Grabbing Lucy Pitkin chases the sailors and the three girls and is there at the conclusion  to help humiliate Claire and to renounce her. The lion has arrived. And there is a hint as he leaves with Lucy that possibly they might become a fourth couple. Pity this was not in the movie version as Alice Pearce's character is treated by Kelly and the others as a good sport but sent home alone.My comment may seem a trifle harsh but in fact the musical is terrific as an entertainment for all the flaws I point out. But rarely has a great movie musical had so little reason to have been so successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "On The Town is a unique beast of movie musical as MGM never followed up on it in one of the most noteworthy uses of location filming in a Hollywood movie up until that point. On the Town captures New York City circa 1949 in beautiful Technicolor as three sailors on leave spend 24 hours tearing up the town. When three men on board a ship without female interaction have leave then dames become the ultimate aim. On the Town is also another example of Old Hollywood's idealisation of the navy particularly in musicals. Did movies like this affect recruitment? They sure make the navy look fun and even explicitly state it during the On the Town number Travel! Adventure! See the world!. Likewise MGM musicals really aren't given the credit of just how funny they are especially those penned by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. It's 930 already. The day's gone and we haven't seen a thing yet.  Just right after that montage of you exploring the entire city?Many shots in On the Town particularly in the opening montage have an unstaged feel to them which give an insight into the world at the time full of regular people getting on with their lives. The sets here are more on the realistic side and less artificial compared to other MGM musicals allowing for the transitions between locations and sets to go by largely unnoticed.Vera Ellen couldn't be more girl next door very pure and innocent as reflected in the number Main Street. Ann Miller and Betty Garret on the other are the opposite to this which gives the movie characters of both the innocent and then the sexcrazed variety. Betty Garret's nymphomaniac tendencies are on full display as soon as we meet her character of Hidly Esterhazy she really wants to get Sinatra back up to her place really badly.Ann Miller however plays by far my favourite character is the film as the most unlikely of scientists Claire Huddesen a sex goddess with the personality of a weird girl  ah the best kinds of contradictions. In her own words she states she was running around with too much of all kinds of young men and just couldn't settle down. Her guardian suggested that she take up anthropology and make a scientific study of man thus becoming more objective and getting them out of her system and being able to control herself I love this character! Yet this has caused her to have a thing for prehistoric males over modern men. I can relate to being attracted to those alive decades ago but Ann Miller takes this further to hundreds of thousands of years.Prehistoric Man is one of the odder musical numbers in the film history both in terms of lyrical contentthemes as well as the number itself. As the caveman dancing bongo bashing Ann Miller being pulled along the floor by the hair madness proceeds you have to ask yourself what the hell am I watching?. The soundtrack of On the Town is one of the finest in the MGM library you know a musical soundtrack succeeds when you're humming multiple tunes from it for a week after watching. The only track which falls flat for me is You're Awful with the absence any hook it's not awful but mediocre.The first ballet sequence in On the Town which introduces Vera Ellen's Miss Turnstiles has a similar concept to Leslie Caron's introductory sequence in An American In Paris full of contradictory statements to describe her character. The two ballet's in On the Town are much more humble than what would come in the MGM musicals over the next few years nor do they have the eyepopping colour and appear more washed out. The A Day In New York ballet for example is bound to only two modest sets but these still serve as a nice warmup for the magnificence of what was to come.".

Only four of the original numbers were retained. The replacement music credited in the titles to Roger Edens is serviceable enough but simpler and decidedly more brash and as such it detracts somewhat from the character of the original. In particular the absence of such numbers as 'What's more I can cook' and 'Some other time' is highly regrettable. It seems odd to me that that having done the maestro such a disservice the film was still awarded a music Oscar in 1950. Nevertheless it remains a highly entertaining romp  how could it fail with a cast that includes Gene Kelly Frank Sinatra Betty Garrett Ann Miller and VeraEllen. It's just that it could have been even better.For anyone who wants to find out what Bernstein's original score was like there is a live recording of a semistaged performance of the musical made in London in 1992 with the London Symphony Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas and a magnificent cast of singers including Thomas Hampson and Frederica von Stade. The only thing you don't get is the dancing! It is available on CD and hopefully a few copies of the video may be knocking around. Unfortunately it seems that no DVD was ever released.".

I love watching it every year or so because it is so joyful and upbeat. I love the street scenes. The women's bright outfits against the men's whites are visually fun. The songs are funright now I'm remembering You Can Count on Me with a smile as the one I would leave the theater singing. My mind always drifts off during the ballet and I miss the variety of the women that enlivened the other numbers but then I don't care for long ballet sequences in most other musicals. Call me a lowbrow but there it is. To me generally speaking that's when the momentum of the musical screeches to a halt and we step into another movie for awhile.One of my favorite parts is the kindness that Kelly's brash character shows Alice Pearce's character when he takes her home. Aw shucks he's really a small town gentleman after all. His mother would have been proud of him.I wouldn't compare this to Singing in the Rain. I would compare it to New York New York which I also enjoy. The ballet sequence and the bracketing of the story with the morning hush and enthusiastic sailors makes this one seem more serious and philosophical in tone and in a way a little sad with the couples waving goodbye after just one day. It makes a person think about the next three guys and detaches us a little from our three. It's an interesting camera and plotting technique as if as soon as they get on the ship they have started to sail away. And it emphasizes that these are ordinary people. The next will have adventures too as can any ordinary person in the course of 24 hours in such a wonderful town.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the Town was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. It was the first film they directed. So which director can you thank for this spectacle New York musical? Both. As we know Gene Kelly today he's probably responsible for all the cheer spectacle dance scenes and Stanley Donen was most likely more intimate as a director. He makes the pauses in between of the dancing which are very important. They're the pauses to the actors and to the viewers. That's where the reality happens. So this was a great idea to combine two talented filmmakers because you need both of those elements for On the Town.The story reminded me of another musical starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra Anchors Aweigh 1945. In On the Town three sailors Chip Gabey  Ozzie get a oneday long break to spend in the city of New York. The three boys want to hook up with some good looking NYC girls even that Chip wants to go sightseeing he also understands the fine art of dating when he meets a woman taxidriver Brunhilde Esterhazy Betty Garrett. When Gabey Gene Kelly sees a poster of the Miss Turnstiles of the Month AKA Ivy Smith VeraEllen he gets a sudden urge to find her. Along the searching process Ozzie Jules Munshin also finds a girl of his own Claire Huddesen Ann Miller from the museum of anthropology.The three main characters Gene Kelly Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin are wonderfully created. They represent American men who lived in a world where WWII was over and whose minds hadn't yet been depressed by the Korean War a peaceful era. The three supporting female characters were great too Betty Garrett Ann Miller and VeraEllen maybe though a little oppressed by men. Men make them dance and through that forget their troubles. That's maybe the negative side of the film it shows women as people oppressed by men who are just waiting to be found and whose only job is to bring happiness to men. But all together great characters! The milieu of On the Town is amazing. The film was untypically for that time actually filmed in New York City. It's a great documentary of New York in the time between WWII and the Korean War. No movie before the year 1949 had given such a great view on the particular city. There are actually three layers of the city. The underground where Gabey finds the poster of the Miss Turnstiles the streets the museums and the sights where they try to find her and then there's the sky. Where they can get by going to the top of the Empire State Building. In my opinion the latter represents the illusion that's where everything they've hoped for happens. The streets are the reality but also because of the musical scenes maybe some sort of a modern fantasy. The underground has no illusion at all. It is the actual reality where Gabie sees Ivy Smith for the first time. The first time they meet is important but I'll let the enjoyment of that to you.So On the Town is a great reflection of the United States in a cheerful era. It's a good documentary of NYC it has great characters and the milieus of the film are fantastic. The basic themes that it deals up with are the relationships between men and women. Maybe the view on that subject could have had a little more depth though. On the Town also wonders one's attitude to life. But basically it's a survey of the people of that time and their thoughts. First film directed by Donen  Kelly and one of the finest if not that finest.56 is my usual rating for a decent enjoyable musical. So this clearly had something more. In addition to the fact that it's great entertainment it works on a higher level. 710".

It's still a great musical a musical with a great book of the quality of that of Oklahoma! that tracks the adventures romantic as well as touristic of three guys who cross the bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan and want to drink in the whole city at once.MGM takes an estimable amount of talent Gene Kelly Frank Sinatra Jules Munshin Vera Ellen the prosecution exhibit for Tap Thighs but lovely nonetheless Betty Garrett the least wellused comedienne of the era and Ann Miller exploited but never really employed and turns what could have been a landmark film into a dismal excursion that would leave the average guy wondering why anybody would want to live in NYNY. This is one of the supreme examples of why I hate MGM the outhouse of the movie musical.They dump the wonderful Carried Away number in favor of the inane Prehistoric Man number for Ann Miller to dance to. Gee thanks Roger Edens! They eliminate Hildy's great I Can Cook Too! not to mention Ya Got Me I Wish I Was Dead Imaginary Coney Island The Real Coney Island and the incredibly lovely Some Other Time with more Roger Edens crap.The stars that MGM hired to do this movie were capable of making a masterpiece but MGM in its infinite wisdom knew how to turn it into a colossal dump and they did. Part of the problem was the pretentious image it decided to project for Gene Kelly speaking of crap what about American in Paris? This is part of my prelude to Why MGM Musicals Suck essay You can see my top 10 movie musicals there are really 12 so far in my review for You Were Never Lovelier.Stanley Donen went on to make some wonderful movies Charade and Bedazzled which features Raquel Welch as one of the seven deadly sins guess which? among them. But MGM especially when adapting Broadway musicals showed an uncanny propensity for turning great theatre into execrable cinema piling Pelions of goo on Ossas of substance and doing no one any good in the process. MGM certainly didn't bring out Donen's best.In its Ferde Grofe orchestration the most perverted of George Gershwin's great worksbut that's for another discussion!".

This is delightful fantastic and inspired stuff total fun top to bottom. But it also has moments that are cringe inducing.And I like musicals.If you don't like musicals in particular you should start with specimens with wider appeal and higher standards Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story would work for me if we're talking classics. Throw in Swing Time or Top Hat if you want an Astaire classic too. Or a Garland singing musical.This one is from the amazing run of polished hits by producer Arthur Freed. The choreography varies from excellent to wonderful. If it's choreographed dancing you like check this out. Some of the format it is from the standard style of the Golden Age where the characters break into song or dance in the middle of their normal doingsin this case three sailors racing through Manhattan on 24 hour leave.Other parts have choreography probably by Gene Kelly that becomes abstract and cinematic a Hollywood innovation also seen famously in Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris. The scenes whether stylized or realistic are fabulous. The standards are highspace light and control of color Technicolor of course inside and out.What drags the movie down is some awful writing both in the dialog and even in some of the songs. I know lots of musical lovers who don't give a hoot if the lyrics make sense or are especially goodthey become secondary to the rest of it and the artifice is part of the game. But I know others who like me prefer the clever the lyric the original. And there are some real wincing moments.And in fact the movie as a whole is awkward a series of vignettes that do eventually string together into a chronology but they hardly have to. They survive or struggle independently. Some of the acting is forced and you may or may not like the sidekicks like the third sailor who's just too comic and goofy for my taste. Even the lead actresses Ann Miller and VeraEllen are no match for Debbie Reynolds let alone Judy Garland.Now let's finally addthe best of the songs and the dancing and photography are top notch. For all musical lovers. The great final pieces at about 117 into the movie is amazing stuff.Note Bernstein's music originated in a ballet Fancy Free which turned into the Broadway play On the Town in 1944. But when this film was made most of Bernstein's music was replaced with new stuffsome of which is the mediocre music that brings the production down a notch.At times the biggest star in the show is New York itself. Love it.".

Even the lead actresses Ann Miller and VeraEllen are no match for Debbie Reynolds let alone Judy Garland.Now let's finally addthe best of the songs and the dancing and photography are top notch. For all musical lovers. The great final pieces at about 117 into the movie is amazing stuff.Note Bernstein's music originated in a ballet Fancy Free which turned into the Broadway play On the Town in 1944. But when this film was made most of Bernstein's music was replaced with new stuffsome of which is the mediocre music that brings the production down a notch.At times the biggest star in the show is New York itself. Love it.";

Dudikoff puts in his usual good performance amidst the usual classic clichs such as the exploding guard towers. Imagine a Nam Angelstype situation with a bearded Dudikoff for part of the time. Add in some of The Walking Dead and there you have it. While this movie is a lowbudget actioner with a Z in Boyz instead of an S S's are just not cool. Z's are much cooler clearly this movie is actually wellmade. Tagawa is fitting as the ruthless evil leader something he's surely familiar with playing. You basically care about the characters  are they a youth group or prisoners  or a youth group of prisoners? Don't forget the donation of ten million dollars to their youth group is nonnegotiable! The movie is fast paced with some good action sequences. Tolliver has a bad attitude because his family was gunned down shown in flashback and never mentioned again. During the extensive training all the Soldier Boyz try to fight Tolliver and naturally they all lose. Probably because they're not as awesome.The ending is a bit abrupt but that's fairly common for these Direct To VideoCable outings.

He works with the worst of the worst offenders gang members potential serial killers and parent killers. When the daughter of an influential man is kidnapped while doing charity work in Vietnam Toliver is asked to get her back. Toliver was a bad ss special operations soldier who gave up the life after his wife and daughter were killed in a drive by shooting meant to kill gang members. Toliver accepts the position and is given the right to choose whomever he wishes from the pool of lowlifes and scumbags at his disposal. He picks several and off they go to Vietnam to get the girl with the rich daddy back from the evil American hating Vietnamese kidnappers.Yes the plot is totally preposterous and not at all plausible but the movie is actually well done considering this was a made for TV movie. The acting isn't great but it seems that most of these actors were new to the business and this was just a publicity showcase. There are the clichd underlying themes of evil turning good learning to put your differences aside to help others and working as a team. Toliver is the typical iron fisted ruler who wants his kids to do well but won't let emotion show.Overall not a bad way to spend a few hours time. It's actually one of his best movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Up till a few hours ago I was of the opinion that John Cena's debut movie 'The Marine' was the worse movie ever made. It was so godforsakingly awful that ever the memory of it brings a foul taste to my mouth.....I normally like Robert Patrick but he must have owed his dealer some megabucks to need money that badly to be part of that travesty.....But now I have a new champion a new movie that was so disgustingly awful that I am amazed and horrified that somebody actually ponied up the cash toa Buy such an atrocious script b Hire the worst 'actors' and I use the term in its loosest possible incantation to star in said film c Find any professional movie makers willing to risk their professional careers to be even associated with this d Thought it was a good idea to make this at allWhere do you start?The good points.....after thinking long and hard I decided that I wanted those 45 seconds back that a tried to find something positive to say. This waste of film deserves to have a star in its rating taken away for every single person associated with the making and distribution of it.The bad parts....well the plot was amazingly stupid....I mean...you're ripping off one of the greatest classic war movies ever made and they botched it so badly they made Attack of the Killer Tomatoes look like a work of Shakespeare. Whoever was responsible for writing this garbage should have any and all writing implements removed from them for eternity and never be able to write or dictate so much as a shopping list. The actors....you know a movie is going to suck when the best actor in it is Michael Dudikoff.....he makes Vin Diesel look like he has all the talent range and emotion of Sir Laurence Olivier. The rest of the cast was simply atrocious.....they don't even deserve to be struggling waiters....and the action!

It was so godforsakingly awful that ever the memory of it brings a foul taste to my mouth.....I normally like Robert Patrick but he must have owed his dealer some megabucks to need money that badly to be part of that travesty.....But now I have a new champion a new movie that was so disgustingly awful that I am amazed and horrified that somebody actually ponied up the cash toa Buy such an atrocious script b Hire the worst 'actors' and I use the term in its loosest possible incantation to star in said film c Find any professional movie makers willing to risk their professional careers to be even associated with this d Thought it was a good idea to make this at allWhere do you start?The good points.....after thinking long and hard I decided that I wanted those 45 seconds back that a tried to find something positive to say. This waste of film deserves to have a star in its rating taken away for every single person associated with the making and distribution of it.The bad parts....well the plot was amazingly stupid....I mean...you're ripping off one of the greatest classic war movies ever made and they botched it so badly they made Attack of the Killer Tomatoes look like a work of Shakespeare. Whoever was responsible for writing this garbage should have any and all writing implements removed from them for eternity and never be able to write or dictate so much as a shopping list. The actors....you know a movie is going to suck when the best actor in it is Michael Dudikoff.....he makes Vin Diesel look like he has all the talent range and emotion of Sir Laurence Olivier. The rest of the cast was simply atrocious.....they don't even deserve to be struggling waiters....and the action!

I'm not sure if the producers of this movie are aware of words like credibility never mind vermislitude As has been said if you've defeated countries like France  The United States and China in long lasting bloody conflicts how difficult is it to crack down on a bunch of gangsters who want to spoil a multi billion dollar trade agreement between America and Vietnam ? If you set up a premise of  VIP's daughter getting kidnapped by bad guy rebels in third world country  wouldn't Columbia be a more credible location ? Did I mention the word credible ? Just curious because SOLDIER BOYZ becomes more and more incredible as it goes along . Prison counselor Tolliver is visited in jail by VIP and a former 5 star general . So far so bad but the meeting takes place in a prison dining hall . Just the sort of place to arrange a meeting if you want the inmates to riot and take hostages . The only obvious reason the prisoners don't think of this is because they're too busy shanking one another and showing their karate moves . Just the sort of people you'd want to hire to save some VIP's daughter being held in a jungle Yes that's the plot  a bunch of really nasty violent prisoners are given an amnesty if they can rescue the hostage . Hey sounds like that movie from the late 60s with Lee Marvin but where as THE DIRTY DOZEN had an internal logic to it this movie doesn't . Seeing as there is a multi billion dollar trade agreement at stake why don't the Vietnamese use their own special forces unit to save the hostage ? Possibly there'd be an American audience having difficulty in empathizing with former enemies . So why not use a delta force unit  or battle hardened American mercs ? Wouldn't that be more sensible ? SOLDIER BOYZ continues to tell its story in this illogical  ridiculous  nonsensical manner . As soon as the unit reaches the 'Nam they decide to bump off Toliver by engaging in fisticuffs one by one . Couldn't they have rushed him all at once ? Couldn't they have shot him ? Even if they did kill him there'd be nowhere to escape to so why kill him . I promise you the only enjoyment in this film is watching each and every scene pointing out how ridiculous the scene is".

This one is a low budget updated version of THE DIRTY DOZEN with a youthful cast and a plot that heavily relies on RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART II for its thrills and spills. This is dumb even lunkheaded stuff never plausible for a second the film never explores how or why the prisoners are going on the mission or for what reason. They just kind of head off and do their stuff in a series of explosive setpieces that make fine use of bloody squib hits to up the ante of violence.Leading this shames is '80s action man Michael Dudikoff. He's pretty unnoticeable here in the ensemble cast and I kind of spotted that he looks a lot older than when I saw him last and that was it. The young cast is a mixedup group of Hispanics tough black guys and the token warrior woman thrown in for good measure. Character evolution is completely clichd with the bad guys turning good and you can predict pretty much everything that happens. Nevertheless I liked the drama they wrung out of the story with Channon Roe's NeoNazi character taking top honours as the most entertaining in the film. A subdued CaryHiroyuki Tagawa hangs around on the sidelines as the chief villain and does a little boohiss stuff.I didn't care much for the climax which over relies on tons of explosions to finish things off but there is a fun if obvious twist later on. Elsewhere the action is well delivered in a kind of '80s bombastic fashion but there's too much silliness in the way the guys fight. Not only do we have people shooting from the hip and using AK47s onehanded but one guy has watched too many John Woo films and runs around with his pistols tilted on their sides at all times. It just looks stupid. Aside from this and the inane title SOLDIER BOYZ is a passable Bthriller for those charitable enough to watch it.".

Despite the unbelievable gopoint the movie's pretty good and does a good job creating the feeling of a hostile and deadly war area with dire consequences for the people who go there. One interesting element of this movie was watching Dudikoff acting with a cast of younger actors and knowing his reallife passion for spending time with children it makes one feel that he really believes in these kids despite the screwups they had made in their lives. The action is violent and bloody but is needed and works in effectively creating a believable war zone. I like the fact the teens aren't all prettyfaced kids off the streets of Beverly Hills as would probably be the case if it was made today.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a stupid and cheesy 90's copy of classic Dirty Dozen. Unfortunately Michael Dudikoff American ninja is no Lee Marvin Delta force and Soldier boyz is one bad movie. Everything sucks here  story  acting  dialogues  action scenes The American youth here is nothing  but a bunch of stereotypes. The violence on streets  street gangs  violence in family  this are all serious problems  but I doubt that any viewer will take this movie seriously. I mean who would care for such one dimensional characters like white skinhead with a ridiculously fake swastika tattoo  tough Latino girl  black Monster that's his nickname ! rapist or Latino macho guy ? The story is not one bit believable. Dudikoff as experienced ex soldier wouldn't have any problem to find exsoldiers or at least mercenaries to do the job. Instead he risks the life of untrained and emotionally unstable bunch of psycho teenagers that don't like each other. It only gets dumber later  when he needs only 1 day to train them properly. After one day they are bad ass ! How cool is that ? I don't remember the last time when I saw such badly done shootouts. The actors don't know at all how to carry the guns ! I love the scene when somebody shoots from the right side and the whole group starts shooting on the left side ! There is also one scene that ripoffs Platoon. Do I have to mention that it's just as cheesy as the whole movie ? Michael Dudikoff is very wooden. He tries hard to be an experienced bad ass soldier  but he just isn't convincing in the role. He doesn't even look old ! Yes  they gave him grey hair  but that's too little to convince the audience. The best performance here comes from Cary Hirouki Tagawa Showdown in little Tokyo experienced actor who specializes in playing villains.The funniest thing here is that it could actually be a decent and fun Bclass movie if it was done right. Well  at least it's laughable. I give it 210.".

What's even more amazing than the absurd plot the cardboard characters the incredibly inept acting the racial stereotypes the lousy camera work the nonsensical editing the cheap production values is the fact that this many IMDBers took the time to write a 10 line review of this movie! Definitely not worth the time! Very sad Dirty Dozen ripoff. Thank God I had my timer set for thirty minutes and it clicked off after the first scene. Don't think I could have taken much more!. Good for some belly laughs  though! Kept waiting for Chuck Norris to show up....";

	schema:reviewBody "On the Nutty Professor DVD extras Jerry Lewis says that he had been enthralled with Jekyll and Hyde since he was a kid. So it's only logical that he'd long to create this Jekyll and Hyde comedymusical. Oddly The Nutty Professor tends to be read as only a comedy in the modern colloquial sense of that genre term as a film that's supposed to make you laugh but there's much more to it than that and more intended than that. Which is probably a good thing because even though I didn't laugh out loud very frequently while watching The Nutty Professor I did enjoy it quite a bit despite the flaws.Lewiswho also directsplays Professor Julius Kelp a bizarrely nerdybutstupid chemistry professor. He has a knack for conducting dangerous unauthorized experiments in the presence of students. At the beginning of the film he blows up his classroom yet again. On a later day a football student who was denied permission to leave class early for football practice responds by stuffing Kelp into a shelf. Beautiful student Stella Purdy Stella Stevens feels sorry for Kelp and helps him unstuff himself. Stevens skillfully has the slightest gleam in her eye while doing this so that we can tell that Purdy has an attraction to the strangelooking professor.Spurred on by the incidentwith both the physical abuse and the physical attraction as motivators Kelp decides to give himself a make over. He first tries his luck at the local gym. When that doesn't work out so well he puts his chemistry knowledge to use and hits upon a potion that produces a Jekyll  Hyde transformation. The Nutty Professor has Kelp trying to balance the two personalities with the expected calamitous but humorous results.Although Lewis' Hyde character Buddy Love is often said to be a skewering of his early comedy partner and pal Dean Martin Lewis claims this wasn't the case. Both the nerd and the debonair but sublimely obnoxious hipster were supposedly amalgamations of different people Lewis had encountered over the years. Still the similarities to Martin are difficult to deny perhaps the character was partially a subconscious parody of Martin.In any event Love is entertaining to watchhe's something like a glossy trainwreck. Or maybe like a suave Satan in a silk suit. Lewis makes both characters complex in their differences from their respective stereotypes. Kelp is the stereotypical absentminded professor only the absentminded professor is usually a wiz at his academic subject. Lewis paints Kelp as primarily a wiz at being a slightly sympathetic dork where his cockeyed chemistry successes are more accidental. Love is the stereotypical overbearing but attractivetothewomen brute yet Lewis is quick to imbue him with an odd combination of pathos and flair so that Love ends up being both more fragile and more talentedintelligent.Some of the material employing both characters is quite funny but Lewis dwells on humor no more than a whole gamut of modes and emotions from fairly serious horror material during the slightly overlong initial JekyllHyde transformation to poignantly sad touching scenes showing the crack in the Love armor. To an extent the JekyllHyde theme permeates the film in its shifting tones.One of those modes that works surprisingly well is the musical material. Lewis hired the superb Les Brown and other great jazz musicians to provide songs. Les Brown's Band of Renown even makes an on screen appearance performing a couple songs at a college dance. Lewis isn't the greatest singer but he does a passable job with an alluring rendition of That Old Black Magic. There's also a great version of Stella by Starlight in the background of a couple scenes.The performances are quite good. Both Stevens and Del Moore as Dr. Hamius R. Warfield the college dean easily hold their own next to Lewis who does a remarkable job with the transformations. He's helped a lot by W. Wallace Kelley's cinematography. Kelley had a more than respectable varied background including camera experience on a couple Alfred Hitchcock filmsTo Catch A Thief 1955 and Vertigo 1958and Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments 1956. Kelley uses very subtle angle changes to make Kelp seem small and insignificant aided by Lewis' physical contortions while making Love seem like a big macho guy.The production design is also gorgeous. Lewis directs his crew to fill the film with bold unusual color combinationsmost overtly in the rainbowcolored paints on the lab floor during the first JekyllHyde transformation the nice overlaying of purples and reds in The Purple Pit club and the great unusual coordinations of Love's suits.Whether you find The Nutty Professor hilarious or not it has certainly been influential. Lewis considers this his best film. The American Film Institute placed The Nutty Professor at number ninetynine on its list of the 100 Funniest American Films 100 Years100 Laughs. Both Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey have obviously been influenced by this film as they have been by Lewis in general. And Andy Kaufman's disparate characters Latka Gravas from 19781983's Taxi and Tony Clifton a regular part of his live act are direct parallels to Kelp and Love even if Kaufman had other influences for those characters as well.The Nutty Professor is also a message film. The dual morals of the story in addition to the less conspicuous subtexts dealing with personal identity are to not be afraid to be your true self and to accept others for their true selvesto look deeper than the surface level.Given such wideranging moods and aims it's probably best to watch the film without genre expectations. That's not likely to make those averse to Lewis' shtick enjoy it any more but for everyone else The Nutty Professor is worth a look. It will surprise you with its diversity.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most depressing symptoms of the phenomenon of dumbing down is the drastically diminished timeframe of people's imagination and empathy which function well enough microscopically and telescopically at a range of say two or three hundred years or the day before yesterday but which cannot make the small leap back thirty or forty years. It is surely on such grounds that Jerry Lewis's masterpiece The Nutty Professor might be dismissed as dated or be found unfunny. Ever since I saw this movie as a child back in the late 60s it has haunted my imagination and taken on a mythic existence that floats free of its actual content and context. On recently viewing it again on a borrowed videocassette I was startled by the internal organisation of the movie by its pacing and by the fact that Kelp's odious alterego Buddy Love who dominates the movie conceptually is actually on screen for so little of its longish runningtime. Since childhood I had cherished Buddy Love for his wit glamour and selfassurance which contrast so strongly and therapeutically with the painful gaucheness of Julius Kelp. Only now as a mature adult do I fully appreciate just how fundamentally unlikeable he is.It is interesting to note that his allure works better at a distance idolised by the hipster habitues of the Purple Pit he is viewed with deep suspicion by Stella Purdy even as he fascinates and intrigues her. The Nutty Professor is as firmly located in its milieu the United States of the early 60s as War And Peace is in its Tsarist Russia at the time of the Napoleonic Wars therefore talk of datedness is beside the point. As an exact picture of life in 2001 the film is hopeless but as a myth or parable with Kelp Buddy Love Stella et al. as archetypes its power is undiminished. Jerry Lewis has never been happy playing it straight and Buddy Love is as extreme and grotesque in his way as the hapless Kelp. He is also by no means entirely free of Kelp's flaws his clumsiness during the slow dance with Stella shows how aspects of Kelp's personality continue to permeate his and point to the incompleteness and volatility of the metamorphosis. Even his name opportunistically extemporised for Stella's benefit contains a deep irony since in spite of his superficial popularity and supreme sexual confidence he is essentially friendless and incapable of deep feeling. If kindly Kelp is crippled by involuted intelligence the sybaritic selfseeking Buddy Love is stunted by affectlessness. I am puzzled by the IMDb reviewer who found him insufficiently monstrous.Buddy Love's glittering lounge suits emit a satanic glow and Jennifer the caged mynahbird is a kind of familiar to Kelp whose Faustian alchemy effects his painfully achieved and alltoobrief transformations into this eerie nightclub singer who generally only appears after nightfall his one diurnal appearance being a spectacularly successful bid to persuade the otherwise pompous college Principal to sanction his headlining performance at the Senior Prom. In view of their acrimonious split it is tempting to view the Buddy Love persona as an acerbic commentary on Lewis's erstwhile partner Dean Martin but the character also contains generous helpings of Frank Sinatra and is perhaps best seen as a broad swipe at the Rat Pack. The wider message of the film is that kindness and intelligence which Kelp already possesses are far more important than the kind of shallow and flashy qualities that invest Buddy Love with his powerful but limited appeal the rapid wearingoff of Kelp's formula whose ingestion is attended by such agonising sideeffects shows that such a persona is literally unsustainable for any length of time.Kelp's final speech at the Prom when his appearance as Buddy Love has been cut catastrophically short is indeed heartwrenching but as both a summingup of the main themes of the movie and a token of Kelp's increased selfknowledge it is indispensable. This brilliant and disturbing film uses comedy as a vehicle to explore serious questions about the nature of identity. The Kelp who wins Stella's love is a betterintegrated personality than either his earlier self or the grotesque alterego of Buddy Love but a note of mild cynicism defusing any hint of sentimentality in Kelp's Prom speech is sounded when Stella pockets two phials of the formula put on sale by Kelp's formerly timid father to whom he had entrusted it. He had also entrusted it of course to his domineering mother but it is perhaps significant to observe that the formula presumably only works with men.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that people can be divided into two groups those that love Jerry Lewis movies and those that hate them. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.Having said that I am a confirmed hater of Jerry Lewis films. I find them sophomoric and excruciatingly bad and each one has the same basic plot Jerry Lewis' character is introduced then he proceeds to stumble through the rest of the movie.I'll make an exception for this film it is the one winner out of all of Lewis' losers.

Lewis' transformation from Dr. Kelp to ultracool lounge lizard Buddy Love manages to be both campy and fascinating.Great cinematography and good acting plus a warm message and the luscious Stella Stevens make for a fine movie experience.

There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.Having said that I am a confirmed hater of Jerry Lewis films. I find them sophomoric and excruciatingly bad and each one has the same basic plot Jerry Lewis' character is introduced then he proceeds to stumble through the rest of the movie.I'll make an exception for this film it is the one winner out of all of Lewis' losers.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me get this off my chest first I am not a Jerry Lewis fan. I've always found his comedic antics tiresome and stupid and his telethons for Muscular Dystrophy are nothing but daylong snooze fests. But at one point in his career he was able to bring it all together and create one of the great comedy films of all time The Nutty Professor. A comedic take on the familiar Jekyll and Hyde tale it's the story of bernerd Professor Julius Kelp played by Lewis and his search for love and a better selfimage thru chemistrywhich results in him changing into a creosotehaired obnoxious hard drinking sexually voracious yet musically talented Rat Pack swinger named Buddy Love also played by Lewis. While Professor Kelp loves his student Stella Purdy played by Stella Stevens from afar Buddy has absolutely no problem sweeping her off her reluctant feet  until that is Kelp's formula starts wearing off and Buddy's tenor singing voice suddenly starts squeaking like the Professor's nasal twang! It all comes to a head at the senior prom where all the kids want to swing to Buddy's music but the formula wears off and BuddyJulius in a touching and almostprofound moment has to face the reality of what he's done and that you'd better love yourself because you're stuck with you for your whole life. But Lewis shows that he could also direct and pretty well at that. From the opening shot of test tubes boiling away with candycolored chemicals this has to be one of the most colorful movies ever made  just look at the deep purples of the lettermen sweaters or the entire dcor of the Purple Pit or the violent primary splashes during the first transformation scene or Buddy's suits  especially his suits! Lewis has always denied that Buddy Love was based on his old partner Dean Martin but it's pretty obvious that Dino and Frank Sinatra the hard drinking arrogant and supremely confident King of the Rat Pack are the prime models for Buddy Love. But it's also interesting to see how traits from one character show up unexpectedly in the other like when Julius proclaims during class that hydrogen is a total gas or when Buddy sings That Ole Black Magic and his voice keeps slipping into Julius'. And there's all sorts of other touches like Buddy's intro into the movie after Julius drinks the formula writhes all over a chemicalsplattered floor and transforms into a hairy Beatlesesque gray monster the next scene shows the shocked reactions of people on the street as the monster walks from the University to the Purple Pit where the camera pulls a 360 turn and we seeBuddy Love in full swinger regalia ordering a drink called an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater that's got to be the most lethal combo I've ever seen served anywhere! This is the movie that shows why the French think this guy was a comedy genius  his particular brand of physical comedy is not only timeless but also totally independent of language. When you see Julius bopping to Les Brown's band at the prom it doesn't matter if you're sitting in a movie theater in San Francisco Paris Timbuktu or Outer Slobodia it's damn funny stuff even if you don't understand a word of what he's saying. A truly funny movie that's perfect for the whole family.".

If Lewis's movie fails as popular entertainment it is because it makes extraordinary intellectual demands on its audience requiring them to see beyond the surface glamour of Buddy Love to the moral rottenness and egotism within. Strangely enough however Buddy Love is not without pathos. There is enough of Kelp in him together with the shakiness of his chemicallyinduced persona to lend a faint suggestion of vulnerability.

Yet the two bottles of formula in her jeans' pockets implies an incredibly cynical doublestandard. Yes she prefers Kelp's sincerity his love his kindheartedness but she'd rather have Buddy Love in her bed.

	schema:reviewBody "My one line summary just about say it all. The remake did well due to the advancement of special effects stage makeup and prosthetics. This film did not have that luxury. Jerry Lewis is fabulous as the gawky quirky Professor. Both his natural comic acting talents and his natural straight acting talents shine through. When seen one after the other i.e the remake and then the original or viceversa you can do nothing but agree with me that the original is the far superior film of the two. Eddie Murphy does his best with the remake and the sequel but the remake just doesn't have the class that the original has. Now I know that there are going to be those that say the remake must be better because there was no sequel to the original but lets be honest now in todays day and age and as things currently are in the film world's state of affairs if a film is in the executive's and the board of director's eyessuccessful enough a sequel is always churned out. Back in the sixties when the original was made this very rarely happened if it happened at all. Those same people will also say that the remake made more money but that's because there are FAR more cinemas around now and it's effectively cheaper to go now even with a semibankable actor like Eddie Murphy. A bankable name for those that don't know is a name that guarantees the film being successful regardless of weather or not they can act. Will Smith has somehow become a bankable name and he has less ability to act than Pavarotti does to tap dance. The list of people like that is too big to put them all in and quite frankly I don't want to spend the time doing so. The same thing regarding the names that can act but an example of one that can is George Clooney..At the time when the original was made Jerry Lewis was the biggest box office draw of them all I don't think that has ever been able to be said of Eddie Murphy. It's because of this that when you take into account how much money was taken on the original due to how many were able to see it and how many went to see the remake you will realise that the original comparatively took more and was therefore a better no not better far superior film.".

Years later Lewis would boast to interviewers that he not only had the pleasure of making this film a success at the time but he made money a second time when he resold the rights to Eddie Murphy. Who used said rights to make a film of considerably lesser merit. But HEY if Jerry had a payday I'm happy for him. Frankly it is hard to discuss the contribution of the rest of the cast because of this there is no doubt Jerry steals the entire picture. In most of his other films he attempts to steal the picture but rarely succeeds. Here he nails it. Big difference. Stella Stevens is memorable even in a fairly understated performance. And the parrot does a good job too  playing a parrot. I believe the subthemes spinning around the way the Stevens character immediately goes for the bad boy in Buddy Love do have implications for the culture of the day but the film is oh so much more than that. It is about the difference between who you are and who you want to be. It is a mustsee a one of a kind. And as promised here is what may be the secret to Lewis' pitchperfect performance. In an interview given years later by Lewis' son the interviewer was told that Jerry did such a great job on Buddy because Jerry was buddy in real life. No acting required. Food for thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't help it. I find many parts of this movie hilarious. I know I know. I keep telling myself Self this is JERRY LEWIS  and you're not French but it does no good. It's a funny movie.The first half is especially good. Lewis who cowrote the movie and directed it is Professor Julius Kelp a chemist who is a hopeless nerd with buck teeth a squeaky nasal voice and a straggly Beatles haircut avant la lettre. Lewis has a crush on one of his students. Understandably. This is Stella Stevens at her succulent best. He's much too shy to express his feelings towards her and she in return is kindly but that's all. Stalemate.Then Lewis concocts a potion in the manner of Dr. Jeykll and finds himself turned into Mr. Hyde a new persona that takes the form of Buddy Love. The love character is identifiably Professor Kelp if you know the story. Otherwise Love is a strangely magnetic narcissistic playboy. Hey Sweetie take off and get your lips pressed he tells the lounge singer at the Purple Pit a local student hangout before he wows the crowd by playing and singing a jazzy version of That Old Black Magic. For the cognoscenti that's Shelly Manne on drums and Red Mitchell on bass. He singles out Stevens for his attentions and she's attracted to his selfconfidence and talent but repelled by his love of self. You deserve nothing but the best baby and I'm the best. The entire business leaves her confused.Lewis switches effectively back and forth a few times until the switches take on a life of their own as in Stevenson's original story and finally he loses Buddy Love altogether and turns into Professor Kelp while trying to perform at the Student Prom. His apology to the students and faculty could have come straight out of Dr. Phil or some Televangelist. If you don't like yourself how can you expect anyone else to like you? That's what I learned. No sense going on too long about the film but it's worth a brief comparison to Eddy Murphy's remake. Lewis's film is the more difficult of the two to pull off. For one thing in 1963 the technology was limited. There were no effective fat suits and no CGIs. For another Lewis's Professor Kelp's deficits are harder to define. He's shy nervous homely and an egghead. His scenes at the gym trying to build his muscles are outrageous. Murphy's film by contrast is equally funny but easier to build gags around. Murphy's Kelp is statistically deviant chiefly because he's terribly fat. And it's easier to make fun of and build gags around people who are obese. Murphy's film suffers from gigantism and Lewis's seems constrained by comparison. That's not in any way to criticize Murphy's acting. He makes the character touching in a way that Lewis doesn't. But Murphy invites a dislike of Kelp willy nilly. Nobody wants a fat person for a seat mate on the plane. And while the comedy in both movies is very broad indeed Murphy's is REALLY broad! I never thought I'd find myself saying that a Jerry Lewis movie was tasteful but next to Murphy's it is precisely that.In any case this is enjoyable and the whole family will probably find it amusing. I mean it's not challenging in any way not thought provoking. But it is a successful comedy and should be applauded for being funny without hitting the audience over the head with a loud and raunchy crowbar.".

It's a reworkinga parody of sortsof the familiar Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story which has had an interesting history in film and other media including comic books. The movies and I'm mostly referring to the 1920 1931 and 1941 Hollywood versions are a reworking of the original novella as well which is of course common in adaptations. The result is a shared heritage removed in many ways from Stevenson's original. Not unfortunate I think but interesting. The Nutty Professor fits right in with this progression.I didn't find it a remarkably funny experiencemuch of it falls flat and seems specifically aimed at an audience foreign to me campy 60s pop culture for example. Everyone other than Lewis seems in need of acting lessons a betterwritten role or something amusing to do but that doesn't matter. Lewis is delightful. His geek professor Julius Kelp is a wellhoned characterthe typical role that Lewis made his career out of. His Buddy Love is what's special about this vehicle it works because it really is the Hydea suave egocentricto Lewis's Jekyll who looks more like Hyde. Buddy Love may very well be closer to the real Jerry Lewis but it's the antithesis of the Jerry Lewis image or persona. This movie doesn't need to be always funny it's worth seeing just for Lewis's play on his own image.Furthermore the Eddy Murphy remake is void of this concept or any interesting reworking of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or this 1963 original.

The monster actually looks and sounds much more like the real Jerry Lewis than his overthetop caricature of a bucktoothed bumbling professor. Buddy Love is talented handsome and witty. He is also so thoroughly detestable that Jerry Lewis claims to have hated every minute of every scene in which he had to portray the character. Add to this the occasional flashes of comedic brilliance which Lewis brings to all of his films and we have a classic depiction of the social outcast trying much too hard to be something he isn't.Unfortunately unless you happen to be a big fan of the Jerry Lewis of the 1950s and 60s you will probably consider this movie to be only mediocre. I think most people like myself believe that his humor hasn't aged well and we simply cannot view his films in the same way as the audiences who made Lewis the top boxoffice attraction of his time. The humor is predictable and repetitious. Add to this a romance which makes absolutely no sense and completely overlooks one with Kathleen Freeman which could have and a closing speech that pounds the moral into your head just in case you missed it.

And the audience was crammed full of diehard Jerry Lewis fans who laughed uproariously throughout the screening. Plus Lewis made an appearance and talked at length about the film life and much moreand was marvelously animated and youthful for a man of 88!I would have to say that although I don't think I thought this film was the masterpiece many have proclaimed it to be I do think Lewis made some better films it is extremely enjoyable and a few of the gags were hilarious particularly in the gymnasium. I also appreciate how the film has hearta nice message and greater depth than the usual comedy. One of Lewis' best films certainly and one that has exceptionally good timing and subtletysomething you just don't see in a lot of his comedies.".

Eddie Murphy who changed the last name from Kelp to Klump did not do an imitation of Lewis. He created his own milquetoast professor who starts experimenting with life altering potions. In fact Murphy created a whole family of characters for his two films. Jerry did not have the computer graphics available to Murphy but his Julius Kelp who morphs into Buddy Love does quite all right with just Paramount's makeup wizardry and his own talent. When you think about it Jerry has joined some pretty distinguished company with John Barrymore Fredric March Spencer Tracy and Boris Karloff all who played Dr. Jekyll on the big screen.Those guys weren't playing it for laughs though Lewis did see the possibilities of humor in this deadly serious story. He also mined a lot of pathos from both Julius Kelp and Buddy Love.It's a simple story Jerry is the world's ultimate nerd in Professor Julius Kelp who gets bullied by all. After a bad session with the college football players he decides that Dupont had the right idea better living through chemistry. He does his Jekyll thing and from the ultimate nerd Lewis becomes a candidate for lounge lizard of the century a man auditioning for admittance to Sinatra's rat pack.One thing I have to say that college seem to be caught in time warp. In 1963 kids were no longer listening to Les Brown and his Band of Renown. Yet that is their musical entertainment for the spring prom. Personally I think it would have registered better if say The Beach Boys would have been the entertainment far more contemporary for 1963. But that would not have allowed Jerry a little chance to spoof the Rat Pack and his old partner Dean Martin.Jerry's Professor Kelp is someone you really care about and that's the secret of The Nutty Professor's enduring popularity.".

The appearance is just a conceit. What's really going on is a very clever nested mockumentary that is basically This is Spinal Tap 1984 meets The Blair Witch Project 1999 in attitude and tone with the twist that our protagonists are not fictional characters but real people playing spoofed version of themselves.Similar to some other recent faux documentaries Incident at Loch Ness plays with the difference between truth and falsehood fact and fiction cinematic illusions and reality while explicitly claiming to explore the same occasionally untruthfully in a cinematic equivalent to Epimenides' famous paradox where a Cretan is claiming that All Cretans are liars. It's sly enough to even make a committed postmodernist's head spin and unlike other attempts at similar material from other filmmakers Incident at Loch Ness has insightful things to say on many different levelsthe postmodern playfulness isn't just pretentious here.In fact this is the film minus the humor perhaps that The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast 1988 wanted to be. Unlike those films here documentary really seems like documentary. Firsttime director Zak Penn who is an experienced screenwriter is smart and knowledgeable enough to know that documentaries and even home movies do not tend to look like they were filmed by someone having a seizure both BWP and TLB and they do not tend to feature monotone extremely amateur comments from the faux interviewees which are then arbitrarily edited into frequently repeating snippets TLB. Penn's intelligent approach results in Incident at Loch Ness feeling real which is exactly what it needs to do. The verisimilitude is only belied by the very funny increasingly absurdest plot when we're firmly in This is Spinal Tap territory.Like This is Spinal Tap Incident at Loch Ness is as funny as it is because it is so close to the truth. It only slightly exaggerates what really happens in the world of film and televisionthe ridiculous moves by producers in the hope of creating a more profitable product the personality clashes and often political and subversive machinations in behindthescenes relationships the toying with the real in reality shows and documentariesgiving the satire a lot more weight. For Herzog fans there is a hilarious spoof overview of his past work near the beginning of the film and fans will also simply delight in Herzog being able to poke fun at himself so easily and naturalistically.But in trumping BWP and TLB Incident at Loch Ness is a very realistic horror film as well with horror coming not only in the climax when some characters end up dead but all throughout the film with various minor disastersproblems all threatening to send the feigned Herzog documentary to hell in a hand basket.Incident at Loch Ness wouldn't have worked without excellent performances making it even more notable in that the majority of the cast are not most well known or even very experienced in some cases as actors. The DVD is worth checking out as Penn and Herzog do the main commentary in character. There are ample deleted scenes and lots of Easter eggs as well including hidden serious commentary.".

But if you want to see some Hollywood vets hamming it up and making fun of themselves and the all too often selfserious documentary genre you are in for a treat.The iconic Herzog is fabulously game playing himself as the embattled director of a documentary about the legend of Loch Ness. Zak Penn plays the producer with devilish glee sending up many of the arrogant sycophants he's no doubt worked with. As Herzog tries to make a serious film examining myth and reality Penn hilariously decides that the dramatic tension would be enhanced by among other things making the sonar operator a bikiniclad sex bomb and filming a delightfully bad remote controlled fake Nessie. Herzog discovers he's been tricked and threatens to quit but ultimately decides to continue out of a misplaced sense of professional duty or is it that he's starting to believe in the monster?. Then things get really weird until the whole film happily disintegrates into a Blair Witchstyle horror spoof. Everybody else in the crew gets in on the fun and the laughs abound. It's great to see films folks satirize themselves nobody does it better and you'll have an enjoyable time going along with them.".

But if you want to see some Hollywood vets hamming it up and making fun of themselves and the all too often selfserious documentary genre you are in for a treat.The iconic Herzog is fabulously game playing himself as the embattled director of a documentary about the legend of Loch Ness. Zak Penn plays the producer with devilish glee sending up many of the arrogant sycophants he's no doubt worked with. As Herzog tries to make a serious film examining myth and reality Penn hilariously decides that the dramatic tension would be enhanced by among other things making the sonar operator a bikiniclad sex bomb and filming a delightfully bad remote controlled fake Nessie. Herzog discovers he's been tricked and threatens to quit but ultimately decides to continue out of a misplaced sense of professional duty or is it that he's starting to believe in the monster?. Then things get really weird until the whole film happily disintegrates into a Blair Witchstyle horror spoof. Everybody else in the crew gets in on the fun and the laughs abound. It's great to see films folks satirize themselves nobody does it better and you'll have an enjoyable time going along with them.";

What is left is a fascinating exploration of what a funny sense of humor Herzog has I mean who else could include a cameo by Jeff Goldblum the crew of a boat searching for a mythical fish ridiculous matching jumpsuits and clever references to Jacques Cousteau without incurring the wrath of Wes Anderson?

The famous director Werner Herzog is brought on by screenwriterturnedproducer Zak Penn to direct a documentary on the Loch Ness Monster entitled The Enigma of Loch Ness. Penn being the Hollywood type he is wants to add fictional realism and excitement such as with a bikiniclad sonar operator! to the production while Herzog simply wants to make an honest film. During this whole affair another small crew is following around Herzog making their own documentary about the director. Much humor arguing and even terror ensues. The beginning is a slow introduction to all the people including cameos from Crispin Glover and Jeff Goldblum. It also showed a few clips of Herzog's work which got me interested in seeing some of it. The middle is filled with dry humor as the annoying Penn goes behind people's backs to accomplish his absurd goals. He even goes so far as to have a little Nessie model made to add some action to their production. When Herzog calls it pathetic and refuses to shoot it Penn threatens him with an empty flair gun! The third act brings about the threat of a possibly real creature to which I'll refrain from giving details. I will say that the special effects work was quite believable and creepy though. All in all I enjoyed it. A few portions of the film brought to mind The Blair Witch Project but it had more in common with The Last Broadcast as you can tell from the documentary approach. Throughout the film the people involved give individual interviews on the different things that happened during the filming of The Enigma of Loch Ness. Anyway the pace was slow and the majority of the film relied on the characters but fortunately they were both interesting and amusing. Plus the final half hour offered up a nice dish of suspense and dare I say horror. Yeah this was a neat unique movie though not for everyone. The DVD comes fully strapped with three count 'em three! commentaries that were all good two of them humorous and one serious. There are also a couple featurettes and deleted scenes one of them quite revealing think supermodel sonar operator.".

Despite how irritating he was he did seem very natural so I guess he's just naturally that annoyingbut not as annoying as that bald guy! If you like unfunny comedies then this is the perfect film for you.";

It starts off as a documentary about the work of Werner Herzog here he tells us briefly about his past films and briefly talks about his new documentary Enigma Of Loch Ness. We are then introduced to the documentary crew and we go through about an hour of production problems and the occasional hint that sht will hit the fan eventually helped greatly by the quick sightings of something in the water. And funny enough you would actually believe that this really happened but then the acting slowly heads off into the cheese ball factor with some over the top acting yet still entertaining from Zak Penn. And not to mention the fact that a cgi hump keeps popping out of the water. The last 30 minutes of the film drifts from a freaky story about possibly something in the water to a monster flick. Which granted I have no problem with. Overall the film is still entertaining and a good watch it features some moments which are a little creepy and some of the special effects though cgi are still believable. If some of the People wouldn't act like that in that situation scenes were cut and the horror movie ending was taken out I would have easily given this film a 9. But sadly it seemed to suffer from a little Hollywood syndrome at least Zak Penn was smart in using the less is more technique which worked to the movies advantage in some scenes.".

Featured on this film team are Zak Penn he and others play themselves as the self serving sociopathic producer of the Nellie doc Michael Karnow an actor posing as a zany cryptozoologist  meaning that he studies unclassified mysterious life forms Kitana Baker a shapely young actress who is supposedly a sonar expert inspiring salacious thoughts about plumbing her depths and Herzog of course who by turns seems to be amused edgily tolerant or seriously irritated about the proceedings which degenerate outrageously. It is made clear that Penn intends to employ large fake models to suggest Nellie in the water.Things get out of hand when an apparently real monster shows up to the party sinks the boat the crew is using and wreaks other havoc resulting in the deaths of two of the crew by then we know this is all fakery though the actors keep up a mock seriousness about the disaster. Mr. Penn gets the final word in an interview with a reporter when he deadpans that the two who died surely made sacrifices but they hardly compare with the sense of guilt he must live with for placing them in peril.In a way this film is like a Farrelly Brothers comedy but made for Herzog groupies rather than 12 year olds it's silly without being very funny. In case the homage to Herzog is not apparent to somebody brief footage from his films Fitzcarraldo and My Best Fiend is shown. Now if only Herzog had tried to move Loch Ness to Romania for the shoot then we'd have something. Herzog and Penn cowrote and produced.Of course there's another possible take on this film and a serious one at that. Herzog has long been interested in the question of whether films do or even can tell the truth. He gets into that issue a bit in Loch Ness. He has coined the phrase ecstatic truth as opposed to factual truth or fact. By ecstatic truth he means that one can employee fictional devices  fakery if you will  in the service of larger more essential truth telling.What filmmaker would disagree? Fellini for one always referred to himself when making films as a liar. Yet I'm sure he would have felt misunderstood if one extrapolated from this self description the idea that he thought his films portrayed his personal history human nature or Italy untruthfully. By he meant simply that he used fictional contrivances and photographic sleight of hand to get at the essence of a story that at its core was truthful. For ecstatic one might substitute the term essential or existential depending upon the themes of a film.I think Herzog would agree that this issue pertains as much to documentary filmmaking as to fictional films. One is always selective in what to shoot how to shoot it and how to utilize the footage within the narrative and editing strategies chosen for the film. The seminal history of the documentary is steeped in sociopolitical propagandizing e.g. the films of John Grierson or Dziga Vertov and fictionalizing for that matter e.g. the work of Robert Flaherty.Herzog and Penn could easily be seen as toying with these notions of relativism and subjectivity in making truthful documentaries. Perhaps they captured in this kinky movie something of the essence or ethos of Nellie or Nellie seekers after all. My rating 610 B B for Herzog devotees. Seen on 121204.

Much of one's enjoyment will come from how familiar one is with Werner Herzog's career I suggest seeing Les Blank's Burden of Dreams to get a good range of this man's incredible persona then listen to his commentary on each of his movies. He's amazing. But that in itself is not enough. One also has to be a fan of mockumentaries which apparently many people don't 'get I love that one of the posts in the message board is IS THIS REAL?. And finally one has to have an inexorable ability to put up with the kind of caustic sense of humor that wears on one's nerves like the coarsest sandpaper think My Breakfast With Blassie meets Jaws. Zak Penn is Andy Kaufman incarnate. He's brilliant yet just even saying that makes me want to like Werner Herzog says in this film track him down and strangle him. He's brilliant because Hollywood is full of guys like these. BTW If you really appreciate sweet torture listen to Zak's commentary on the DVD!Anyway as well as being a great mockumentary with its layers of movies within movies within movies it also has some terrific moments of great filmmaking within one of its stories. I of course new it was all fake but it was so well done I found myself humming the theme to Jaws at the film's climax. I even wanted to shout out at Werner Herzog when he tried to shoot Nessie with his flair gun Are you crazy?? You want to kill this legend that's been hanging around for millions of years?? You're going to die someday anyway.. leave it alone!. But I held my tongue. Besides Nessie is a vegetarian isn't she? Truth Fiction Whatever this film illustrates Herzog's philosophy of ecstatic truth. No one really knows what is true. But the emotions we feel are very very palpable. That's really why we go to the cinema isn't it?".

And finally one has to have an inexorable ability to put up with the kind of caustic sense of humor that wears on one's nerves like the coarsest sandpaper think My Breakfast With Blassie meets Jaws. Zak Penn is Andy Kaufman incarnate. He's brilliant yet just even saying that makes me want to like Werner Herzog says in this film track him down and strangle him. He's brilliant because Hollywood is full of guys like these. BTW If you really appreciate sweet torture listen to Zak's commentary on the DVD!Anyway as well as being a great mockumentary with its layers of movies within movies within movies it also has some terrific moments of great filmmaking within one of its stories. I of course new it was all fake but it was so well done I found myself humming the theme to Jaws at the film's climax. I even wanted to shout out at Werner Herzog when he tried to shoot Nessie with his flair gun Are you crazy?? You want to kill this legend that's been hanging around for millions of years?? You're going to die someday anyway.. leave it alone!. But I held my tongue. Besides Nessie is a vegetarian isn't she? Truth Fiction Whatever this film illustrates Herzog's philosophy of ecstatic truth. No one really knows what is true. But the emotions we feel are very very palpable. That's really why we go to the cinema isn't it?";

No one gets it right every time and every director has their share of bombs. Unfortunately this movie was one of Herzog's. Yes it's a mockumentary and was supposed to be tongueincheek but did they view this thing before releasing it? I get that there were inside the industry nods and jokes and that the film had multiple layers etc. But it moves at a glacial pace and really feels like a half hour film that was stretched to 1 and a half hours. You have to watch the clips embedded in the credits to get a true sense of what they were going after. Unfortunately that also emphasizes how far they missed the mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary greats out there. Zak Penn isn't good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. Guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from the The Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created. It seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down you're watching fiction. In other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth. In fact many early audiences watching it at Sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real. Penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that. Documentary or mockumentary filmmaking and it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not. Penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a metadocumentary. Penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the getgo as he enters Herzog's house before the filming of Herzog's film Enigma of Loch Ness about the myth of the Loch Ness monster a film which apparently was never finished  probably because of Penn's interference. Even though Penn is apparently the director of the film we're watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying What is the film crew doing here? and starts shying away from them. He does this on a couple other occasions as well. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and Penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally. This leaves the audience scratching its head wondering Who is in charge here? If Penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. Penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world I think when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world Penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless. This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that Penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary. Penn's presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie. The Herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn't acting. We even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by Penn much the way the audience is but you're never sure of even that. Penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a Guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying. In a Guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you're never sure what Penn is about. As a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does. Aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that it's a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice. For that reason alone I think this would be a good film to show to film students  sort of a what not to do kind of movie. I have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it's done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance. This film is completely lacking in that.I'd like to call it a valiant effort at something but I'm not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. As a side note It seems like bad art always calls to mind good. This film made me think of the book Picture by Lillian Ross. Ross followed John Huston around during the filming of The Red Badge of Courage and brilliantly documented it for the New Yorker. It would make a great movie in fact. If you want a great example of metaart read it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hunt is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Cowritten with Tobias Lindholm this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas a smalltown kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice based on true incidents that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I'll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I'll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.This is essentially a oneman show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen's delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won't be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting memorable experience. Among the children Annika Wedderkopp's portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she's in.The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund's score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne sterud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes in the faces of Lucas the kids and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares not the product of a genre writer's imagination which chill to the bone.Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn't matter though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.The Hunt was easily the saddest film I've seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It's a gritty and hardhitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial rippedfromtheheadlines story repeated all too often in recent history that's both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others but The Hunt is one of the most affecting and emotional films I've ever seen and one of the best of 2012.".

The acting is first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint hearted but I think it's an important subject matter and very current. I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree I only have to look on my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of behaviour often far far more intense.I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " A film for those who stupidly believe there's no smoke without fire.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes children lie.  Sometimes good people give in to hysteria and lose all sense of  reason.  Sometimes they destroy innocent lives.  The Hunt aka Jagten is the latest offering from Denmark that will  knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing Borgen  and The Bridge Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking harrowing  experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind  for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a  film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the  darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable.  More than that it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no  smoke without fire.  Lucas Mads Mikkelsen is a lonely teacher divorced from his wife  kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care  at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who  has earned the respect of his peers the love of a new girlfriend and  the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be  chased around the playground by him.  Klara Annika Wedderkopp the daughter of his best friend Theo  Thomas Bo Larsen has an innocent childish crush on Lucas when two  situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an  explicit pornographic image and secondly Lucas gently chastises her  for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination  childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences Klara  makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes.  For only the fifth time so far this year I believe I have witnessed a  nearperfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay  the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from  principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and  frequently astounding.  Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His  performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle  as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's  George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A  Single Man so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that  accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional  wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of  which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him.  Equally both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents  carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their  young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at  the screen Don't be so stupid or to scream expletives at Grethe  Susse Wold the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and  reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas'  son Marcus Lasse Fogelstrm gives a heartfelt performance segueing  seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his  distress is a warning to those given over to rumours.  The surprise no the absolute shock with the casting is Wedderkopp.  In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be  a breathtaking performance that this is the debut of a young child is  staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid  imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by  overenthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion  alone.  The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external  tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists  because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather  than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a  Foreign Language for the Oscars I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg  will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals  of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark  Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't  sit in front of the screen expecting a light easy thought provoking  flick. I emerged numb angry helpless and terrified. But for one  careless or cruel comment it could happen to me.  Or you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Consider first the setting. It may be quiet and idyllic but merry laughter and droll humour open the scene. A group of middleaged manboys are clowning around by the lake. They are longtime friends of The Hunt's central character Lucas  bespectacled 42 year old exprofessor recently divorced and too old to be waddling in the water like a toddler at playtime.But the time is November in this unknown Danish village and everyone is having a good time in yet another gettogether. Friends have known each other for years people know people on a first name basis many have lived here for generations and Lucas is just another face in this jolly closeknit community  nondescript and mellow respected and wellliked.We are told that Lucas played with artful and refined precision by Mads Mikkelsen is not without the woes that come with modern adult life. Living alone and seeking custody of teenage son Marcus newcomer Lasse Fogelstrm he is an ordinary man trying to rebuild from ground up as a kindergarten teacher. Immediately you can see that he is kind and friendly because Lucas walks young Klara home and chats with her father also his best friend Theo. The two men share lasagne while fussing over pet dogs and hunting rifles. You acknowledge that Lucas has earned his place in this neighbourhood and relationships are in complete accord. Then the maiming of his middleclass existence begins.Klara develops a schoolgirl crush and puerile gestures are sensibly rebuffed. Nothing unpredictable or startling at this point. You've heard of such awkward incidents before. But Lucas is then accused of something he did not commit because Klara said something to avenge an earlier rejection.This is where The Hunt succeeds with penetrating insights into social phenomenon  soon after she causes harm Klara attempts to recant the accusation without success. Here writerdirector Thomas Vinterberg absolves Klara from absolute blame and sets the stage for unreasonable and sinister conclusions. Watching the film from here on out is an unforgettable and riveting experience.It is natural to assume The Hunt simply alludes to the concept of Witch Hunt and contents itself with being dramatized fiction about falsely accusing the innocent. But if that were so the brilliant scene where Klara was interviewed would not have alarmed with its disturbing methodology. The narrative's genius embeds observereffect with great accuracy and insight into expectations of Klara and her subsequent reaction. Vinterberg denies us simple solutions in which adults are perceptive enough to decipher the truth. For example Ole the counsellor ushered in from an unknown organization is scruffy and slightly unkempt. Characteristically unlikeable he wears an implicit stereotype on his face and contaminates Klara's testimony by coaxing with a few hints Do you remember if something white came out?She stares blankly yet revulsion grows and collective hysteria spreads  allowing The Hunt to unveil itself as a carefully executed masterpiece. The clues match only because suggestive prompts are pushing the limits of disturbing reality.The canvas is visually precise casting is pitchperfect especially that of Annika Wedderkopp in her excellent portrayal of Klara and the script is cautiously penned.Based on transcripts of police interrogations conducted on suspected paedophiles in Denmark the US and several European countries Vinterberg investigates causeeffect with chilling authenticity. There is no doubt that The Hunt is antithesis to Festen an earlier work depicting the same subject matter but don't be mistaken  this film does not involve itself with controversial material for the sake of obligatory endorsements. Relentless and intense plot is enriched by characters reacting with protective instincts that come naturally simply because they care for one another. We see the internal worlds of Lucas Theo Marcus and Klara and observe the impact of rotten dynamic unfolding before our very eyes. This forces us spectators with an omniscient view to situp and question judgement using rational exactitude.Short analysis of the ending  The Hunt is a superb penetrating study of human agency and in the end some mysteries remain unknowable. There are several narratives attempting to interpret the final scene and who the shooter really is. This person may very well be the same culprit who killed Fanny. Is it Klara's older brother who has demonstrated protectiveness over her? Perhaps a disgruntled retail assistant from the grocery store? Maybe a figment of Lucas's anxious imagination from knowing life can easily cast him from the status of a hunter to that of a prey?These questions continue to linger because The Hunt's technical finish is openform and resists finite closure. The image of an unknown rifleman indistinct and in hiding is a conveyor of figurative conclusions. By doing such Vinterberg employs artistic device to suggest that attitudes may be outwardly placid but remain violent and embittered covertly. Just as it is with real life some hostility can't be neutralized and a malevolent presence continues to loom over the horizon willing to perpetuate an abyss of moral panic.httpscinemainterruptus.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " Finding His Way In The Forest";
	schema:reviewBody "Here in the small town where I reside our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as I really can't tolerate judgemental people.Recently I saw another Danish movie The Hijacking and was so impressed with it that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did.

	onyx:emotionText "Here in the small town where I reside our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as I really can't tolerate judgemental people.Recently I saw another Danish movie The Hijacking and was so impressed with it that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another making the point that there isn't really any bad guys in the film just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot handheld giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself what would I do?".

Although Klara claims throughout she said a stupid thing and Lucas did nothing his parents are convinced she is just reacting to the gravity and changing her story.

Only too swift is their condemnation their righteous indignation blinded by Salemwitch like certainty that he is guilty. The town's vigilantelike attitude is reminiscent of Frankenstein's townsfolk hounding the monster without even trying to understand.Beyond the figurative display of crowd wrongheaded mentality is the disturbing suggestion that at any time a life can be turned upside down without even being responsible.

	schema:reviewBody "Just like he did 14 years ago in Festen Thomas Vinterberg once again shows us how a closelyknit community reacts to a shocking revelation. In Festen a family party was spoiled by the revelation of a secret scandal. In Jagten a group of friends and neighbours turn hostile when one of them is falsely accused of sexually abusing a young child the daughter of his best friend. With microscopic precision Vinterberg dissects the human nature. The accused Lucas baffled by the absurdity of the accusation doesn't even bother to deny clearly. He rejects everyone who shows even the least bit of doubt including his new girlfriend. His best friend Theo the father of the young girl clearly has doubts about Lucas's guilt but sticks with his wife and daughter. Theo's wife is thoroughly convinced of Lucas's guilt even when the child indicates he is innocent. The whole situation evolves into a nightmare for Lucas. He is not prosecuted after a police investigation fails to find any evidence but the villagers have already made up their minds he is a child molester. He loses his job is being rejected by the village community and becomes the victim of violence himself. The movie is full of extremely intense scenes that make you shift uneasily on your chair. The various confrontations between Lucas and the villagers are very powerful but so is the subplot about Lucas's son. A smart decision is that Vinterberg doesn't show anything about the investigation or the prosecution. It isn't important for the story because the audience knows Lucas is innocent. Instead the director only shows the way Lucas's friends react and cope with the situation. Jagten is filmed in a realistic style without many cinematographic effects. The emotionality of the story and the strong acting are enough to carry the movie. The approach is reminiscent of the Dogmastyle from Festen but the strict Dogmarules are a thing of the past. In some Christmas scenes Vinterberg clearly makes use of special lighting techniques to create a cozy atmosphere. The whole film is a very strong watching experience. The shocking and unexpected ending which is open for interpretation is the cherry on the cake.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to English Professor Jack Lynch Lies once they are accepted as true take on a life of their own one that lasts long after the original falsehoods have been exposed. The power of the continued acceptance of lies is reflected in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt the disturbing story of the false accusation of a kindergarten teacher of sexual abuse. It is an accusation that reveals the sordid underbelly of a small town hidden beneath the veneer of middleclass civility. Written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm The Hunt is a thoughtprovoking drama that makes us aware both of the vigilance needed to protect our children from predators and of the crucial importance of following the precept that an individual is innocent until proved guilty in a court of law.Mads Mikkelsen is Lucas is a caring kindergarten teacher who has been recently divorced and shares custody of his teenage son Marcus Lasse Fogelstrom. He has a good relationship with his students especially sixyearold Klara Annika Wedderkopp the daughter of his best friend Theo Thomas Bo Larsen and his wife Agnes Anne Louise Hassing. Lucas walks her home from school when her parents are late in picking her up and she obviously likes him very much. In class one day Klara kisses Lucas on the lips but is admonished by him that kissing on the lips is only for mum and dad. Sparked by seeing images on her bother's iPod she tells kindergarten head Grethe Susse Wold that she doesn't like Lucas anymore because he has a weenie. When Grethe tells her that this is normal because every man has one Klara tells her that his was straight and pointed. The incident is forgotten about for a few days until Grethe realizes that children never lie and begins questioning the little girl again coming to the decision that sexual abuse has occurred and that some action must be taken. Though Klara now says that she cannot remember her parents attribute her loss of memory to trying to forget what is uncomfortable. Calling a group of parents together Grethe accuses Lucas before the parents telling them the signs to watch out for in their own children. Slowly the word gets around of widespread abuse at the school though Lucas remains in the dark because Grethe refuses to give him any details about the accusations.Word spreads by hearsay gossip and innuendo as a child psychologist teachers parents and eventually the police are brought in but no through investigation is ever conducted. Klara is questioned again questions taken directly from the transcripts of actual police cases and it is obvious she is a confused little girl who tells the adults what they want to hear. Vinterberg ratchets up the tension and we sense the world closing in on the embattled teacher. Though Lucas' male friends in the community have a longlasting bond they break the ties of their closeknit group and turn against one of their own.Lucas and Marcus are denied the right to shop in the local market even to the point of threats and violence his best friend Theo rejects him and even his girlfriend Nadja Alkexandra Rapaport asks him if he's insane or sick. Lucas' only friend is Marcus' godfather Bruun Lars Ranthe who soothes his friend's psyche with black humor. After Lucas is arrested a preliminary hearing rules that there is not enough evidence to hold him and he is released but this does not stop the violence. A rock is tossed through his window and neighborhood thugs take out their aggression on his dog Fanny.The Hunt is a harrowing experience that is not an easy film to watch especially if the viewer has had past experience with the subject. The exceptional performances however make it easier to appreciate. They are not only from Mikkelson who won Best Actor at Cannes but also from Fogelstrom as Lucas' loving and supportive son Ranthe who keeps Lucas afloat and especially that of sevenyearold actress Annika Wedderkopp who is so angelic that we never turn against her even though we know she is lying. While some critics bemoan the fact that this kind of story has been told before it has never been told like this building with inexorable power from the warmth of smalltown conviviality to a shocking picture of injustice and paranoia that hits us right in the solar plexus.".

When Grethe tells her that this is normal because every man has one Klara tells her that his was straight and pointed. The incident is forgotten about for a few days until Grethe realizes that children never lie and begins questioning the little girl again coming to the decision that sexual abuse has occurred and that some action must be taken. Though Klara now says that she cannot remember her parents attribute her loss of memory to trying to forget what is uncomfortable. Calling a group of parents together Grethe accuses Lucas before the parents telling them the signs to watch out for in their own children. Slowly the word gets around of widespread abuse at the school though Lucas remains in the dark because Grethe refuses to give him any details about the accusations.Word spreads by hearsay gossip and innuendo as a child psychologist teachers parents and eventually the police are brought in but no through investigation is ever conducted. Klara is questioned again questions taken directly from the transcripts of actual police cases and it is obvious she is a confused little girl who tells the adults what they want to hear. Vinterberg ratchets up the tension and we sense the world closing in on the embattled teacher. Though Lucas' male friends in the community have a longlasting bond they break the ties of their closeknit group and turn against one of their own.Lucas and Marcus are denied the right to shop in the local market even to the point of threats and violence his best friend Theo rejects him and even his girlfriend Nadja Alkexandra Rapaport asks him if he's insane or sick. Lucas' only friend is Marcus' godfather Bruun Lars Ranthe who soothes his friend's psyche with black humor. After Lucas is arrested a preliminary hearing rules that there is not enough evidence to hold him and he is released but this does not stop the violence. A rock is tossed through his window and neighborhood thugs take out their aggression on his dog Fanny.The Hunt is a harrowing experience that is not an easy film to watch especially if the viewer has had past experience with the subject. The exceptional performances however make it easier to appreciate. They are not only from Mikkelson who won Best Actor at Cannes but also from Fogelstrom as Lucas' loving and supportive son Ranthe who keeps Lucas afloat and especially that of sevenyearold actress Annika Wedderkopp who is so angelic that we never turn against her even though we know she is lying. While some critics bemoan the fact that this kind of story has been told before it has never been told like this building with inexorable power from the warmth of smalltown conviviality to a shocking picture of injustice and paranoia that hits us right in the solar plexus.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the most powerful drama I had the fortune to experience this past year. It's up there with Michael Haneke's AMOUR but this definitely made me feel more. When near the ending of THE HUNT we have some hope for the protagonist a kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused of child molestation I actually thought something like I hope the movie ends right now! This because Thomas Vinterberg director of movies like FESTEN and DEAR WENDY makes us feel each and every moment of the great injustice that is shown in the screen. Yes we feel for the protagonist Lucas topnotch performance by Mads Mikkelsen but also for his family and friends especially for his teenage son. Obviously the really wished happy ending is highly unlikely as this is a realistic portrait of human nature. In the beginning of the film we have a group of Danish hunters Lucas included sharing good times drinking talking just having fun. Apparently they're a real family of friends. The little daughter of Lucas' best friend is the one who begins the sexual abuse rumor by telling the kindergarten director that Lucas showed her his penis. The parents of this girl didn't give her the enough attention finding more important to be arguing than taking her to school for instance. And Lucas was there to help the girl  it's a really ironic film. The way the families of the supposedly victims react how the behavior of a family affects their infants the general thought we have about children and also those subjects of violence and friendship. Everything is shown here in a very credible way. The violence really hurts you and I think if a film like THE HUNT doesn't provokes you rage well none will. Highly recommended and for sure one of my favorites of 2012. Watched it on 26 December 2012".

Instead it felt like a sensationalist TV movie and it was also dragging on. I didn't like the way the relationship between Lucas and Nadja was handled it felt like they were jumping their bones rather than developing a relationship  at times it felt like Nadja was almost stalking Lucas. And it's always problematic when a native actor or actress such as Alexandra Rapaport who  despite her Polish roots and exotic looks  is born in Denmark has to play a foreigner with little language skills. It would have been a much better movie with more understatement  especially if there had been some doubt in the community rather than everybody instantly buying the accusation for example the headmistress of the small Kindergarten says that children don't lie which seems ludicrous especially since she says previously that Klara  the girl making the accusation  is prone to telling fibs. The movie would have been much more involving if it had focused more on the ultimate impossibility of refuting such an accusation the creeping doubts rather than almost everyone taking the stance the little girl said it so it must be true and running a vendetta against Lucas.Only in the end does the movie capture this ambiguity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hunt the latest from Thomas Vinterberg takes a compelling premise but pushes its credibility and its audience's patience so far that any impact the film might have had is blunted under the weight of its preposterousness.Mads Mikkelsen plays a kindergarten teacher who is accused by a little girl of exposing himself to her. We know from the start he's not guilty and that the girl says what she does out of a combination of confusion and anger. But as soon as the idea is planted in the heads of the teachers and parents they use it to go on a witch hunt with one person as their target.Watching the film is sort of like watching a car accident in slow motion. We see one bad decision pile itself on top of another and a situation that could have easily or at least more efficiently been resolved instead turn into a spiraling nightmare. The problem is that the events in the film don't make any sense or at least didn't to this American viewer. The kindergarten teacher who first hears of the allegations decides to call in the mom of the little girl tell her that her daughter may have been molested and then says there isn't anything else to discuss at that moment in time!! And the mom accepts that!!! And then the teacher announces at that evening's parentteacher night that all of their children might also have been molested and hands out informational pamphlets!!!! And none of the parents ask any questions!!!!!! Maybe there's a cultural disconnect but I can't imagine parents in any country handling this situation in the way it's portrayed in this film.And the implausibilities just add up from there. A much more effective and interesting film would have found people following proper procedures and still not being able to shake their inherent kneejerk prejudices. But an incident like the one in this film or any incident for that matter is of course going to get out of control if everyone acts as crazy as they do in this movie. The film manipulates its characters into doing things that it doesn't seem plausible people would actually do just to make a point. That's called building up a straw man argument which are famous for being able to knock down.Perhaps Vinterberg means for his film to be morbidly funny a black comedy of the absurd. But if so he doesn't handle the material well enough to make that clear. He invites us to scratch our heads in disbelief at how poorly people can behave but doesn't make those people's behavior believable enough for us to care.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "A Little History  I have a wide range of actors that I love. Most of the time I like to backtrack through a couple of their previous films when I like them a lot and then I just get on with it. Not the case here. I decided to start watching Hannibal about 6 months after it aired and I got my first good look at a spectacular Danish actor named Mads Mikkelsen. He is extremely talented but judging by the fact that I love horror films have seen Silence Of The Lambs numerous times and figured the television show could never match the talents of the wonderful Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster I wrote it off. Until about three episodes in when this God of Danish cinema showed off his talents. After the show and because I adore foreign cinema I decided to binge on every single one of his movies. That my friends is how I came across The Hunt.The Basics  So after giving you the background of what I've been doing for the past couple of months this is the first of many Mads movies I chose. I have some background with Danish cinema and am an avid Von Trier fan so I know Danish films have amazing potential. The movie stars M.M. as a single father named Lucas who leads a lonely life teaching primary school and striving for custody of his son. He has a likable group of friends including his best friend Theo who has a wife and child Lucas is close with as well. Everything is going smooth until one day a small lie changes the course of Lucas's life.It Would Probably Be Better  For you to go in blind as I did...just beware this is a tough number to swallow. It is unrelenting and uncomfortable however don't let that scare you away...you should see it everyone should see it.Mad For Mads  My God is he exquisite in his craft...he practically carries the entire film and does so with a passion not many actors have. This film bumped him into my 'favorites' for sure. You can just feel every thought every ounce of pain and turmoil he is going through...it's harrowing and heartbreaking and I was crying at the end.Best Scenes  1. The scene in the convenience store is amazing. You are rooting for Lucas the entire time. 2. The scene when you realize that though everyone is against him...he still has a couple of people on his side. 3. The scene in the church which if you've seen the trailer you get a small glimpse of took my breath away and had me wiping tears.Overall  This movie is a tough watch but rewarding nonetheless due to its well told story and outstanding acting. It was the first of many Mads movies I've played  also the first of many that had me crying  and a firm step back into the world of heart wrenching Danish cinema. I strongly recommend the watch.Verdict  1010 Stars. You can view all of my reviews at httpdianalynn5287.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "A Little History  I have a wide range of actors that I love. Most of the time I like to backtrack through a couple of their previous films when I like them a lot and then I just get on with it. Not the case here. I decided to start watching Hannibal about 6 months after it aired and I got my first good look at a spectacular Danish actor named Mads Mikkelsen. He is extremely talented but judging by the fact that I love horror films have seen Silence Of The Lambs numerous times and figured the television show could never match the talents of the wonderful Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster I wrote it off. Until about three episodes in when this God of Danish cinema showed off his talents. After the show and because I adore foreign cinema I decided to binge on every single one of his movies. That my friends is how I came across The Hunt.The Basics  So after giving you the background of what I've been doing for the past couple of months this is the first of many Mads movies I chose. I have some background with Danish cinema and am an avid Von Trier fan so I know Danish films have amazing potential. The movie stars M.M. as a single father named Lucas who leads a lonely life teaching primary school and striving for custody of his son. He has a likable group of friends including his best friend Theo who has a wife and child Lucas is close with as well. Everything is going smooth until one day a small lie changes the course of Lucas's life.It Would Probably Be Better  For you to go in blind as I did...just beware this is a tough number to swallow.

But finally I sat down to watch it...and as intended I was outraged appalled and absolutely disappointed  but because of the terrible plot. This movie might have worked if it was set in the 1930's but this takes place in 2014 and it makes absolutely no sense what so ever. I get the idea of making a big deal of nothing Mob tendencies twisting everything to create drama joint discrimination and so on and so forth  all of that and again the movie could have worked for me if set in 1930 or something but all it really did was pss me off because none of this would never EVER happen in Denmark today!! To begin with there has been so much taboo in the 80's about male daycare workers molesting children that today everyone is extremely careful to make assumptions about it. It is handled with the utmost care. Second the first thing you would do in any such situation is contact the parents. This is something daycare workers are taught. You would never let a psychologist or anyone else talk to the child without the parents consent. They would have to be informed for this to take place. It would never happen without their knowledge. Third the way this psychologist put words in the child's mouth? WOULD NOT HAPPEN!!! This was the most horrible part  they tried so hard to make it disgusting and I was disgusted by the abysmal way this interview was happening. Nevermind the fact the parents always have to be present. But there are extremely clear guidelines to this kind of interview. None of which was used. And lastly I'll mention all the violence and assaults that nobody bothers to report to the police? Come on!! There are just so many errors in this movie that I had an extremely hard time watching it to the end. And this was our Oscar contribution? I'm embarrassed because we Danes make amazing movies. This wasn't one of them.".

That's what's really frightening about the scenario in The Hunt not that Lucas is accused or who accuses him but how easily forces are marshalled against him. It's the fearsome eagerness to hate punish and ostracize that is horrifying. The macho man's man scenes at the opening of the film and its closing bracket this theme with a sense of a culture quick to pull triggers and confident in its right to pull them.

Great story with great character designs and interesting plot twists to keep things moving. The only fault for me was that the running time at 85 minutes is a little short and I think more time to develop a few of the characters and the land they were in would be good as with all fantasy there is usually a lot of history and legends before the story making the world feel a little more real.

	schema:reviewBody "Did you ever feel you discovered something or somebody a real gem that none of your friends knew about? Well that's the way I feel about this film a real sleeper than few people have ever heard about. When they see it  at least the friends I've shown it to  they enjoy it too. This is an excellent romance story that's quite different quite touching and quite haunting. This is one of the few movies that actually cost me some sleep after I first saw it one evening.The two main characters are halfbreeds Avik or Holy Boy is an Eskimo white man and Albertine an IndianFrench female. Both are wellplayed as kids and as adults. The filmmakers did an amazing job finding two kids who really look like the two adults probably would have looked like when they were young and with the same voice inflections and accents.As adults Jason Scott Lee and Anne Parillaud are memorable. So is the cinematography particularly the Dresden bombing scene which is simply jaw dropping.Warning the movie is heartwrenching at times with not a happy ending but I think that helps make this film so memorable so haunting. Even the music is haunting.This is a strange mystical movie. Either it's going to mean very little to you or it's going to be something special you'll want to see a number of times.".

	schema:reviewBody "Map stars Jason Scott Lee as an Eskimo named Avik who is taken from his people as a boy by an explorer named Walter Patrick Bergen because he has tuberculosis. In the hospital where he is sent he meets up with a young halfbreed French Canadian girl named Albertine Anne Parillaud as the adult version and they become inseparable friends usually annoying the strict Catholic headmistress Jeanne Moreau with their pranks. In the course of time Albertine is healed and leaves eventually Avik is as well and he returns to his own people. But he is no longer wanted and eventually he reteams with Walter on a return expedition and signs up for the war. He's assigned to a bomber group and has pretty good luck over Germany. Near the end of his service time he chances to run into Albertine again who is working in bomber command and the two rekindle their friendship which has turned into something more for Avik at least.Map is a slowmoving film that lingers on its subject and the beautiful countryside that surrounds them. Whether it's the fields outside of a Montreal hospital the English countryside or the endless white snows of the Arctic we are continually treated to sumptuous visions of the earth  all the better to contrast with the characters who find themselves confined much of the time be it in a bomber a bunker or an igloo.The beauty is also starkly counterbalanced by the best scene in the film a final raid over Dresden that is a testament to the bizarre beauty that can be found in hellish destruction. The bombers seem to move in slow motion as we are treated to the fiery landscape a city consumed by flame made all the more vivid when Avik is shot down and must make his way through almost literally Hell.Map is also a sad story of longing between two people who will never be together and in that vein it's a very poignant film. But it's lovingly told and even though it may lack a happy ending or even a very coherent one a waking dream sequence merges with reality in a sometimes confusing way at the very end it's nonetheless a satisfying film for those with a little patience.Jason Scott Lee has never been better. Though Avik isn't given a wide emotional range Lee manages to convey the deep feelings that run within him gestures rendered almost in shorthand. And Parillaud although Albertine is somewhat flighty also gives a strong performance. Bergen is very good as well imbuing Walter with an adventurer's sense of wonder that turns darker as the man ages. All three of them play well off one another.Map isn't for everyone  it is long slow and a little depressing  but it's also a beautiful film and it certainly revels in the gentle unraveling of its subject matter. It's also not a movie you're likely to find many places  I had to join Netflix to get it  but I find it's worth looking for.".

	schema:headline " Holy Boy  Diverse Compelling Stunning Mapwork";
	schema:reviewBody "Map of the Human Heart is a rare film which is both haunting and beautiful as well as filled with the violence of man against man and nature. It's lead actors Jason Scott Lee Avik and Annie Parlliaud Albertine play aboriginals of Canada who are both outcasts by their mixedblood status in the respective communities Inuit and Cree providing insight to the ancient animosity between native groups that shatter the positive stereotype and myth of egalitarian indigenous tribes living in harmony before western contact. In fact the theme of conflict repeats throughout this fine little film and provides the backdrop for the love story of Avik and Albertine in WWII England.Discovered as a small boy by a military mapmaker on expedition to his community Avik aka Holy Boy is drawn to the officer who removes him from his village a typical action by intrusive wellintentioned outsiders. Removed to a Catholic run native hospital for treatment Avik meets the Cree Indian girl Albertine a patient with tuberculosis. Historically the two native groups are ancient enemies and the children inherited this longstanding animosity without knowing anything of the other until they realize a shared situation and experience. As Avik and Albertine's friendship blossoms their childhood devotion turns to first love. Avik steals Albertine's xray of her damaged lungs and heart which he carries with him into adulthood. The children attempt to run away from the hospital but are thwarted by adult authorities and their separation begins the second half of the film.When the adult Avik returns to his native village to care and provide for his elderly grandmother he is an unsuccessful as a provider something seen as a curse to others of the village as well as his grandmother. She realizes Avik must be set free from the ancient ways of native life and commits suicide a sacrifice of herself for Avik's future. Time and the setting jumps to WWII London where a grown up Albertine is now married to the same British officer who was Avik's liberator. She works with the security branch of the British Army and her unit is responsible to identify sites from the aerial maps for bombing runs turned in by bomber crews. While at work she reads the name of one of the planes the Holy Boy the childhood name for Avik and reunites with her childhood companion. Their love is rekindled in one of the most memorable settings  the Royal Albert Hall dome  where Avik and Albertine escape.The film revels in unlikely settings to situate it's stars adding to the visual and physical splendor of Albertine and Avik's love. From the Royal Albert Hall to an aerial blimp over the White Horse Vale where they consummate their passion the cinematography is stunning! Contrasted against this splendor is the reality of the war. The missions to destroy cities and ultimately humans is carnage in acts of violence that is the reality of war. Avik faced with Albertine's marriage to the man who changed his life confronts the mapmaker a jealous controlling man. Albertine's passionate love for Avik is unbearable and he orders Avik's unit back to the Holy Boy to take part in one last run that is the controversial bombing of Dresden Germany. A city acknowledged as a cultural treasure and not factory of Nazi ammunitions manufacture Dresden was offlimits to bombing runs by Allied troops. However the hatred for Avik and Albertine's love drives the mapmaker to order the firebombing of Dresden with the participation of the Holy Boy. Shot down during the offensive Avik parachutes into Dresden as the flame offensive engulfs the city. Trying to save a child from the flames Avik drops the xray of Albertine's heart a symbol of his constant devotion and love in the conflagration. The conclusion of the film is a heartwrenching resolution that remains true to the storyline and by the end the story comes fullcircle. The film remains little known but is a captivating romantic adventure which should have received more recognition for both originality and camerawork. It is worthy of attention and delivers with thoughtful commentary on the human heart loyalty and hatred.".

The ensemble performances are letter perfect the subtleties and inner thoughts of these characters are crystal clear to the viewer it's almost unnerving. The frantic energy of wartime life is captured beautifully without being a trite war movie. It's just another layer of these characters reality it doesn't overwhelm the story.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this to be one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. It tells the story of Avik a young Eskimo boy who meets Walter Russell Patrick Bergin when Walter comes to map his village. Avik discovers he has Tuberculosis and Walter takes the young boy to Montreal where he stays at a Catholic hospital. There he meets Albertine a young girl of mixed French Canadian and Indian blood. They grow attached to each other in spite of the meddling of one of the nuns played by Jeanne Moreau. Eventually Avik and Albertine are separated. Avik returns to his village and becomes a man. He finds he is ostracized by his fellow tribe because he has lived too long among the white people.Avik as an adult is played by Jason Scott Lee. By this time Canada is involved in World War II and Avik joins the Air Force and flies on bombing raids. He is reunited with Albertine Anne Parillaud in London who is also in the military. Unfortunately so is Walter Russell. And it seems that he and Albertine have met and become romantically involved. Avik does not want to interfere in the relationship because Walter saved his life.This is a story of two people who are truly in love but whom the fates keep apart. An old theme but with a new twist. I found it heart breaking and romantic. I loved the period portrayed. And the love scene atop the blimp is quite something! This film isn't for everyone but if you like a good romantic tear jerker this is for you.".

This is the tale of a good Inuit boy with nothing but good intentions and his love for his childhood sweetheart. He get's screwed over again and again by fate until finally he gets a chance to fulfil his wishes but fate intervenes yet again for the final time. This movie was very moving very sad. The acting in it was superb and makes me wonder why Lee isn't a bigger star than he is. Through out the movie you can't help but feel bad for Avik. Poor guy.

But back then as we know now people weren't prepared to sit in a cinema for that long but now with the advent of DVD and everyone basically wanting a cinema at home with large plasma and 5.1 sound its great that you are now getting the choice to see these gems as they were originally envisioned its a real shame as i personally feel that this was a highlight of everyone involved in this movie and is wards best movie you also can tell when watching it that there is a lot of stuff missing especially in the cuts from scene to scene. I don't think that a couple of deleted scenes was enough on the DVD and the score is totally amazingwhy no isolated track try and get a hold of it if you can it took me nearly 11 years to get my hands on it eventually gave up hope of ever finding it and by pure chance found it in a second hand store in a tiny village called Comrie in Scotland it was fate i thinkpaid 10p for it on cd its by Gabriel Yared and is amazing.Anyway buy it on DVD its worth it and i cant ever see them releasing it uncut unfortunately unless they ever release a vincent ward box set now that would be worth buying. Anyone know of any other version available then please post comment.".

The agony of the characters' situations was at times almost unbearable and the cruelty that life can show was never so clearly captured.I was drawn back to this film because of a recent article I read in one of the major weekly periodicals which discussed the changing role of the Asian male in popular American culture.  In it they discussed how typical Asian males are perceived as sexless and either as brainiac buffoons or as dangerous fighters but that in any event they never get the proverbial girl.  It was an interesting perspective that I had never consciously considered but in response I found it rather accurate.

The movie is very European in the sense that every event has to be symbolic everything has to be poetic lyrical or whatever. I mean just look at the pretentious title something Oprah Winfrey would say when addressing her band of dumb female viewers. The dialog suffers the most from this because everything has to be so absolutely grand most characters some of the time talk unlike real people do. Hence the dialog is occasionally awkward. Parillaud is charming and good whereas Lee is likable but average. The revisionist views regarding the bombing of Dresden weren't necessary. The ending though very much as grand as everything here is supposed to be is quite good. Even the scene of the first time Parillaud and Lee have sex has to be grand they do it on a huge airballoon. And one of their romantic meetings is on top of Albert Hall minutes before Germans start bombing the neighbourhood. So granditudionallly grandispliferous. Definitely watchable but not captivating.".

However the characters are so underdeveloped the script so disjointed and the motivations so vague that it is difficult to comprehend what they were trying to achieve in this film. Consequently I can't recommend it. I'm not sure what the other reviewer saw in this film but this is not a great love story it's not even a good attempt at a love story. As an attempt to present a slice of history it is also a disappointment so shallow and unrealistic in its portrayal of events like the Dresden bombing that you really don't understand the horror. It's almost as if the firebombing was done just because one British officer was dumped by a German girl before the war".

They don't have anything as cool as punching each other although having sex on a barrage balloon is very different. The most emotional moments have to be the grandmother when Avik leaves her twice. Her's is a devastating heartbreak. There is a lot of story here and director Vincent Ward does a pretty good job. While there are big war action it could be done with more thrills. There are also lots of surreal scenes which could be improved with a more imaginative camera. Nevertheless this is a memorable unique film.".

	schema:headline " A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity";
	schema:reviewBody "Daniel DayLewis is something of an unsung miracle the man will come out of nowhere select an unlikely role knock it out of the park then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here DayLewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men Steven Spielberg who is coming off a stellar 2011 where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse two acclaimed pictures.Spielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloringbook job of American politics shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.While titled Lincoln we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph GordonLevitt playing Lincoln's oldest son Robert Todd Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism Sally Field as the president's devoted wife Mary Todd and David Strathairn as William Seward the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's who also penned Spielberg's Munich unseen by me prime focus as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.Daniel DayLewis is mesmerizing here never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here he seems much more cinematic than his previous works and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for onehundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly and guttural as many other works have made him out to be but reedy and poetically satisfying boasting not much more than historical records claim. DayLewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information history and knowledge of the period and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries elaborating on smaller characters extending the work of the amendment and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.With this film there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas and how that film was beautiful striking and increasingly ambitious but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay intuned with.But that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.Starring Daniel DayLewis Sally Field David Strathairn Joseph GordonLevitt James Spader Hal Holbrook Tommy Lee Jones and Jackie Earle Haley. Directed by Steven Spielberg.".

It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's who also penned Spielberg's Munich unseen by me prime focus as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.Daniel DayLewis is mesmerizing here never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here he seems much more cinematic than his previous works and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for onehundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly and guttural as many other works have made him out to be but reedy and poetically satisfying boasting not much more than historical records claim. DayLewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information history and knowledge of the period and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries elaborating on smaller characters extending the work of the amendment and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.With this film there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas and how that film was beautiful striking and increasingly ambitious but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay intuned with.But that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.Starring Daniel DayLewis Sally Field David Strathairn Joseph GordonLevitt James Spader Hal Holbrook Tommy Lee Jones and Jackie Earle Haley.

I admit at the first speech I rather expected the voice to be deeper and more commanding but that wore off instantly and Spielberg to his credit gets every scene noteperfect. The scene where soldiers on the field were quoting back to him the Gettysburg Address was heartbreakingThe big guns to be sure but everyone in the theater stopped breathing. Spielberg has the mood and light finetuned to the point that when the characters are donning shawls against the coldthis in the white houseyou shiver. I can'think of a single actor who was not up to snuff but James Spader as a rascally vote procurer stands out. Sally Field as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln is a sympathetic gem and her portrayal should go a long way towards explaining and perhaps inviting history's revision of that unhappy woman. The film focuses most on the nuts and bolts of legislative and presidential processes and while that may be boring for someit has such a ring of authenticity and research that it had me scrambling for the history books to check on things I hadn't known. This is the most difficult of all subjects to film a dense scholarly work translated to popular culture but it succeeds on all counts. See it make your children go with you. You won't regret it.".

Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy throw in a multiaward winning star cast lead by Daniel DayLewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking  an amalgamation of art literature politics society history and most importantly humanism.Here's a brief recap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War 1861 to 1865 as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the 'Union' and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South the film's story begins with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.Running at 150 minutes this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel DayLewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with warstressed fatigue and a shrill voice but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation as a father who has lost a son and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase 'Behind every great man is a woman'. Field's Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn besides a multitude of top actors.This is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough the commonality being crucial moments in history rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nitpick I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a selfmade man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnetit is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lincoln 2012 A highly polished restrained important movie.That doesn't make this an exciting movie. The acting is terrific and filming excellent including a color saturation pulled back to give it an old look without seeming affected. It is clearly expert in the way we expect from Steven Spielberg above perhaps anyone at least in the mainstream conventional sense.But there are two things that make this movie a must see. One is the content. It's about one of the two or three most important things ever to happen in this countrythe fight to end slavery during the Civil War. This is such powerful stuff it will make you weep. If it doesn't you'll have to ask why. It's laid out as clearly and emphatically as possible while still keeping accurate.The second thing is simply the overwhelming performance by Daniel DayLewis. It is so good you forget it's a performance unlike for example his intensity in There Will Be Blood which stood out as a work of acting above the movie. Here he is so woven into the fabric of things he is indistinguishable from the historic truth somehow. It's really the magic of the transparency of moviemaking of this kind. Amazing performance.It seems sacrilege to say this but the movie isn't perfect. Because of its materialgetting the antislavery amendment through Congressit involves a lot of talk and a lot of people that you have to keep track of. I think Spielberg did this as good as it could be done so no criticism there but it does mean a lack of physical and even emotional drama through much of the film. I don't mean it's dull just that it's conversational. I also found shreds of Spielberg's Frank Capra quality of making the moviesand his subjectsa little simplified. He ties up loose ends. He makes it all a fine package very fine. Maybe too fine for what I would call high art. At times.I think we'll have an easier time judging it in six months or six years. Also the subject matter makes it almost unassailable since clearly most of us are all for the passing of any antislavery legislation.See this for all the reasons you have heard. Don't miss it. Maybe down a coffee before you go but see it no matter what. As I say it's important. It reminds you of greatness and that's not something to miss.UPDATE over one year later I see that I accepted a lot of decisions by the writer and director as their prerogative like focussing on one issue and narrowing to a short period of time. I had no bones with the scope of the movie. But in retrospect I see how the limitations of time and scope and background also create a sense of misinformation. That is if you want a bigger picture of Lincoln this movie is not quite right. Its aggrandizement is also not unavoidable like the somewhat insipid and yet moving recital of the Gettysburg Address at the beginning by soldiers. Overall though I stick to my main thoughtsee it and soak up what you can without expecting perfection. Yes see it for what it is nothing less.".

	schema:reviewBody "So what happened? 1. The first problem with this film is the script. The writer Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer winning theater writer but other than Munich he hasn't done any motion pictures. The long drawn out dialogue between Lincoln's cabinet and the lengthy parliamentary congress sessions might play well on Broadway but they linger on screen. It wasn't just Kushner's fault. Spielberg is one of the few directors who has final cut on anything he does so ultimately it's yet another vast misjudgment by the best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He's currently slated to direct Indiana Jones 5 so I guess that tells you where his judgment is. We're all waiting patiently for him to retire with some dignity but he's just Brett Favre'n it all the way. It was a huge mistake for Dreamworks when deciding on the story not to include Lincoln's childhood his struggle with schooling the severe poverty he faced growing up on the western frontier and how he had to teach himself how to be a lawyer family roots his political career and ultimately his assassination. It's very clear from the beginning that this film is not about Lincoln's life but a very specific part of his presidencyThe Emancipation Proclamation. 90 minutes of this 150 minute film was spent on the 13th Amendment. So much so that every single member of congress when voting had their own screen time to voice that vote. It should have been called Emancipation or ep13 but not Lincoln. Do not go into this movie expecting to learn about Abraham Lincoln's life. You will be hugely disappointed.2. There was no sense of space. No aerial shots of Washington DC in the 1860s... no city shots showing how life was back then... just interior scenes a few battlefield scenes and a few outdoor speeches. And this coming from one of the greatest special effects pioneers of the medium lame.3. No secret service. The Secret Service was created by President Lincoln on April 14 1865 the day of his assassination. Don't you think that would be an interesting thing to showcase in a movie titled Lincoln? One third of the US currency in circulation was counterfeit at the time. There was no mention of it. And also at no point did you see ANY security around the president except for a few soldiers around him in wide shots. It just made it seem even more like a filmmaker trying to tell his own pretentious tale of history instead of what really happened.4. To much cabinet delegation and congress discussion not enough Lincoln. Sure the film made an attempt to show his affection for his son Todd and you did see some private moments with his wife Mary but it was all put there in a disingenuous way because the story wasn't about his family. It was hammering the 13th Amendment down our throats the whole film. Did the NAACP make this film? Lol. 5. The cast was too big. There's over 120 speaking roles in this film. 120! That's insane. Daniel Day Lewis was dazzling his eyes just penetrated you as usual. He projected the essence of Lincoln at least from what legend suggests through an indirect manner that can only be witnessed to understand. He will get the Oscar nomination for this no question. My prediction he will win the best actor Academy Award. Everyone else was very good a few were great Holbrook and Stratharin especially. Sally Field was good but not great and Tommy Lee was his old self always brilliant but never stretching beyond his usual.6. The ending. Instead of showing the horror of what happened the night of April 14 1865 Spielberg decided to leave out the Ford Theater altogether and instead show another theater during another play in which a man comes on stage and makes an announcement that Lincoln was shot. Then Lincoln's youngest son Todd who happens to be attending this other play looses it. And that's it. Not only do you have to sit through 2.5 hours of boring film but there is no pay off at the end because we KNEW this ending was coming. To show it like they did was almost as tragic as the event itself. I'm not saying show the bullet rip through his skull but show us the event as it unfolded don't deny the audience of that emotion.I understand not wanting to glorify Booth. I get that. But this is history now. It happened almost 150 years ago. And Spielberg didn't think twice to show civil war soldiers being brutally murdered in the beginning of the film why not show the murder at the end and DEmystify it for all of us? And if his argument is that this film isn't about that then why even show that part of his presidency at all??? Why not end the film with Lincoln still living... insinuating that his efforts and spirit still live on? This Jewish filmmaker can make a film about Oscar Schindler and show atrocities of monumental proportion... he can make a film called Saving Private Ryan and re define brutality but he can't show the death of our most beloved President from Lincoln's perspective?  there may not have even been a holocaust if Lincoln had survived. So Steven please don't give me the we can't show that line because you showed it a hundred times in Schindler's list and you won an Oscar for it.It saddens me a great deal to write this review. I never would have dreamed that I would be giving Steven Spielberg's Lincoln a 2 out of 10. My advice Watch this film for a clinic on acting and cinematography but wait for it on video. I might buy the DVD as a cure for insomnia.".

I'm not saying show the bullet rip through his skull but show us the event as it unfolded don't deny the audience of that emotion.I understand not wanting to glorify Booth. I get that. But this is history now. It happened almost 150 years ago. And Spielberg didn't think twice to show civil war soldiers being brutally murdered in the beginning of the film why not show the murder at the end and DEmystify it for all of us? And if his argument is that this film isn't about that then why even show that part of his presidency at all??? Why not end the film with Lincoln still living... insinuating that his efforts and spirit still live on? This Jewish filmmaker can make a film about Oscar Schindler and show atrocities of monumental proportion... he can make a film called Saving Private Ryan and re define brutality but he can't show the death of our most beloved President from Lincoln's perspective?  there may not have even been a holocaust if Lincoln had survived. So Steven please don't give me the we can't show that line because you showed it a hundred times in Schindler's list and you won an Oscar for it.It saddens me a great deal to write this review. I never would have dreamed that I would be giving Steven Spielberg's Lincoln a 2 out of 10. My advice Watch this film for a clinic on acting and cinematography but wait for it on video. I might buy the DVD as a cure for insomnia.";

	schema:headline " History written by Steven Spielberg";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Spielberg visuals are excellent in movies and this one is no exception. He does a wonderful job recreating the time period that Lincoln was a part of. The difficulty I have is in believing some of the dialogue and the revisionist history that takes place in this movie. The opening scene is a bloody battle and it appears realistic. Unfortunately the following scene has two black soldiers chatting with Lincoln outside in a makeshift camp. He's sitting at a table while they discuss their observations with him. Listening to them you'd think they all grew up on the same block together. One soldier lectures Lincoln and interrupts him during their conversation while the other is Lincolns best buddy. A soldier wouldn't ever talk to a president in 2012 in this manner. In 1865 if two black soldiers acted this way they would have been immediately been put in irons. Blacks had to be extremely deferential interacting with whites during that century because the law looked the other way when they were murdered by whites. The scene is ridiculous. Throughout the movie Spielberg emphasizes slavery as Lincolns motivation for engaging with the South. Fact check Lincoln goal was to preserve the union. He did not remotely believe in equality of the races. Like most whites at that time he considered blacks inferior. He stated that he would free some of the slaves or all of the slaves or none of the slaves if it would preserve the union. The movie is sort of a Disney version of Lincoln and loose on the facts.This movie is over rated probably because Spielberg is so powerful in Hollywood and if you know any civil war history you will be disappointed. Lincoln like all presidents was a mixed bag. He believed in that it was acceptable to pay 300 to buy your way out of the war the Irish didn't like that idea. Lincoln seriously considered deporting blacks to central America or Africa after the war. There was a great deal of corruption during his administration. Like most elites he believed the war should be fought by othershe wouldn't allow his son to put on a uniform until the war was over. Spielberg paints Lincoln as a saint and it would have been better and far more realistic if he had been portrayed a man with faults. The movie is a disappointment if you want real history read a book. This movie is a fable for children.".

These speeches are so boring that more than one character simply walks away during it's interminable running. I wish I could have walked away too.Black people are treated as oracles and not human beings. The black characters in this film exhibit no manner of humanity and are reduced to simple plot devices. We don't care about their plight because they're not like us. They're heartless machines.Relations between races in this film are portrayed in a dishonest way. Black soldiers and servants openly challenge and speak to Lincoln as if he's a fellow black man. This isn't the way things were and pretending that it was from the very first scene! simply disallows the film from building any heart any credibility any weight or substance. We learn quickly this is not a film about an important American historical figure it is a very liberal interpretation. Since we do not see how poorly black people were treated we do not care about Lincoln's ultimate success with his proposed 13th Amendment.Characters do not develop character arcs fizzle conflicts left unresolved. What of Mary Todd Lincoln's impassioned speech to Lincoln regarding the enlistment of their son? She demands to be locked up in a crazy house if the senior Lincoln permits his son to join Grant's side. Well Robert joined the army and Mary Todd is still in Washington. What was the point of that scene other than to give Sally Field something to do? Why are Sally Field and Joseph GordonLevitt even in this film? They have no bearing on the narrative this film attempts to tell!Look I did not expect this film to give an accurate representation of Lincoln's life. What I did expect is that I would get a tight entertaining 2 hour slice of our greatest President's most critical hour. Instead I got a pandering meandering vapid and vacuous play oncelluloid treatment from one of the former cinema greats. This preachy hunkydory disease has plagued Spielberg since we were treated to those awful Present Day scenes in Private Ryan. Here it culminates into a suffocating veil which absolutely ruins any hope of this film being a success.Thoughtless generic boring drivel.".

	schema:headline " Political portrait that walk a strange line between hard fact and romantic sentiment";
	schema:reviewBody "Abraham Lincoln is one of those mythic figures like Gandhi El Cid Che Guevara Garibaldi Churchill Nelson Washington Richard the Lionheart Princess Diana who have become legends of folklore legends which usually hide decidedly grubbier and less pleasant realities. However because of our Human need for heroes to look up to and inspire us we usually print the legend rather than the truth.Most media representations of honest Abe falls into this latter category as best exemplified in the literal cartoon that was last year's Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which brought things into sharper relief by playing it all in deadly earnest. Of course Lincoln lived only a couple of lifetimes at remove from us so the truth is there but we choose to ignore it because we want to believe in this great noble hero who freed the black man from the sadistic demonic evil deformed Southerners as simple a battle between Good and Evil as the equally misrepresented WWII a man driven by an allconquering desire for equality so strong it even has its own stirring accompaniment of tear jerking violins and moving horns wherever it goes! It's a pleasing fantasy especially for rich white people who like to pat themselves on the back for how noble and good they are even though it relegates Black people to simpletons smiling happy children free of any adult sin or virtue perpetual victims who need nice enlightened white folk to make their destinies for them.I approached this film with some trepidation sure that Spielberg the great romantic would give us more of the same and then some. However the film walks a very strange tightrope indeed. Taken from D K Godwin's dry text it spends a lot of time looking at the political machinations and double dealing that got the 13th amendment banning slavery passed and is a highly instructive lesson about how government and democracy actually works including bribery corruption and outright lies. In turn it has been adapted by playwright Tony Kusher into what is really a filmed play with little real action and everything confined to a few room like sets where dialogue carries everything. This is all then filmed by Spielberg who injects the admittedly very restrained production with jarring and intrusive stabs of pure schmaltz usually whenever the evil of slavery is brought up or one of the many prominently and highly anachronistically positioned Black faces steps to make some clichd speech. These Spielbergian moments can be easily identified because whenever they appear in between the political machinations and congressional double dealings John Williams stirring flag waving music strikes up to pull those old heartstrings! You could almost invent a drinking game around them one that would probably get you very drunk indeed So really it's two very separate movies the GodwinKusher political lesson being the biggest with the Spielberg schmaltz in support.To its credit the film looks authentic including the dim candle and gaslight level lighting which bathes everything in semi darkness and most of the characters act speak and think like people from the 1860s rather than people from 2012 in costume Save for the aforementioned anachronistic Spielbergian romance moments both of which are very rare in historical film.This being a stage play in all but name it is the actors who dominate and here we have some of the best. Daniel Day Lewis gives us a powerful version of the mythical Lincoln we know and love rather than the less pleasant real one with his homespun tales and folksy charm stirring passion and quiet determination and he is gifted by an existing physical resemblance. Sally Field creates a powerful character our of Mary Lincoln the only character to shine a less than positive light on her famous husband strong willed and frustrated all too aware of her position as the wife of a legend a woman who pushes for the 13th largely because it will end the war and keep her son from harm. Tommy Lee Jones incarnates radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens a man too extreme for his time with the fire of the old TLJ we haven't seen in a while the brutish frightening thug like alpha male who can intimidate and crush those beneath him like bugs the man with the lashing wit and grandiose gestures and it's nice to see him back again. David Straithern another powerful presence plays Lincoln's fixer William Seward. His character is very similar to the one he plays in the Bourne series the intelligent committed patriotic manipulator who uses downright shady and suspect methods for 'the greater good' expect here we are expected to side with him. His chief agent is played with amoral glee by an almost unrecognisable James Spader bribing dead duck Democrats with lucrative posts for the 'yes' vote in a series of light hearted vignettes. Jason Gordon Levitt appears as Abe's eldest son Robert determined to enlist against his father's wishes whom even a gruesome pit full of severed limbs can't fully dissuade. Legendary Hal Holbrook lends gravitas as voice of reason Preston Blair while Jared Harris effectively incarnates another legend General Ulysses S. Grant for a few vital scenes.For a Spielberg film about war there is virtually no action and those expecting a big spectacular will leave disappointed. This is a history lesson starring famous names written by a playwright adapting a political analyst's dissertation on Congressional politics directed by the master of romanticism and sentimentality with a lot of unpleasant truth's airbrushed out and replaced by the legends we would like to believe are actually true in their place. It won't be for all tastes but it is worth a look for those with a little patience.".

His acting in this movie is definitely Best ActorAcademy Award Worthy.Lincoln was not directed or produced with the main intention to deliver an Action Civil War Movie concentrating on horrific action battle scenes. If you want mainly entertaining action scenes then James Bond  Skyfall should be your pick. I'm sure it is also an awesome film. I want to see Skyfall also. But Lincoln was my first pick of the holiday blockbuster season.Stephen Spielberg designed this Movie to specifically concentrate on The Man Abraham Lincoln Our 16th President of the United States. And how Mr. Lincoln helped end the CIVIL WAR and at the same time Abolish Slavery in our United States of America in the last few but Very Important months of this Great Man's Life.

	schema:headline " ...and the Academy Award for Best Actor goes to....Daniel Day Lewis!";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Daniel Day Lewis Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Written by Tony Kusher and Doris Kearns Goodwin.I am the president of the United States of America clothed in immense power! You will procure me those votes!'As the Civil War continues to rage America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.'Steven Spielberg has done it again! It seems like the older he gets the better his films are! I was very satisfied with his efforts particularly the set designs and tone. It was a joy to watch. I was not impressed with the cinematography efforts. It was well done but nothing stood out for me. For instance Scorsese seems to bring a new camera angleshotposition in every one of his films. I was expecting more.The acting was this film's strongest aspect. Daniel Day Lewis brings an historic performance to the screen except I didn't see him in this picture. I saw Abraham Lincoln. He was so driven into the character at times it was scary. Lewis' vision of Lincoln is self confident calm and patient. It was in my favorite scene that his patience finally wore thin on his colleagues about the negativity in the 13th amendment. The mannerisms were spot on. His efforts match my personal favored work of his in 'My Left Foot'. His best contribution to the picture was consistency. Throughout he never faltered. His accent never trailed off and his actions were always precise. He is fully deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field also gave great performances. They brought character and charisma to the picture. I particularly enjoyed the Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field combination. They compliment each other very well. My only criticism of the cast is that there were too many actors. At times the characters were defined with a tag on the bottom of the screen. I don't enjoy being told in letters who the characters are. I want the character to show me in action who they are.The Score is very well done in this movie. The team of Spielberg and Williams never fails. The music brings just as much emotion to the screen as the actors do. It helps bring the vision and atmosphere to life. This film isn't what I would call a 'masterpiece' but it was a joy to watch. A must see and one of the best films of 2012.".

	schema:headline " Spielberg's narrow in scope hagiography can't hold a candle to 1988 Gore Vidal TV miniseries";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading approximately 200 books on the subject Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter playwright Tony Kushner decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently Spielberg concurred concluding that a fullblown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three and a half hour spectacle covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life beginning with the first Inauguration with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln' come to mind.First and foremost what's missing here is little sense of Lincoln's brilliance as a master politician. Since most of the movie focuses on the machinations in the House of Representatives focusing on the fight over the passage of the 13th Amendment Lincoln's input is minimal. Tommy Lee Jones as Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens steals the show with his brilliant performance as the fiery abolitionist representative who ends up giving up his quest for equal rights for blacks in order to have slavery abolished with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Spielberg's opus is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book 'Team of Rivals'but where is the 'team'? All the fascinating characters from Lincoln's cabinet are missing interacting with one another. In the Gore Vidal movie both Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase's political ambitions are dissected and we actually get a sense of what their personalities are like. Here David Strathairn as Seward stands around with nothing much to do as Lincoln's adviser. Lincoln actually had to balance the conflicting positions and personalities of the members of his cabinet. This is effectively conveyed in both Gore Vidal's novel and TV adaptation but not at all in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.Wonderful peripheral figures who are an integral part of the Lincoln story are lost due to Spielberg and Kushner's onerous decision to ignore the earlier history. The 1988 biopic includes them Kate Chase Salmon Chases' daughter who married the boy governor of Rhode Island millionaire businessman turned General William Sprague Senator Stephen Douglas Lincoln's debate rival Billy Herndon Lincoln's former law partner and McClellan Lincoln's failed first general who later opposed him in the Election of 1864.Spielberg is more interested in the arcane focusing on the minor figures from the House of Representativesnow lost to history. Spielberg and Kushner spend so much time on the vote in the House of Representatives as if this is the defining moment of Lincoln's presidency. Perhaps from a modern perspective yes! But I found it hard to believe that the bells were chiming and there were was a giant parade in prorebel Washington D.C. on the day the 13th Amendment was passed. The real cheering was on April 9 1865 when the South surrendered. The end of the war was of course the main concern of the people of the time not necessarily the abolition of slavery.Watching Spielberg's 'Lincoln' one can hardly realize that there was indeed a dark side to our 16th President. The suspension of Habeas Corpus and Lincoln's prosecution of political enemies without due process of law is an aspect of the Lincoln presidency hardly addressed in Spielberg's flattering hagiography. Lincoln's view of AfricanAmericans was decidedly less progressive than Spielberg lets on here. Even shortly before the end of the Civil War Lincoln was still entertaining schemes of colonization for blacks in South America and Africa.And what of Mary Todd Lincoln? Sally Field looks a lot more like Mary Todd than Mary Tyler Moore did in the 1988 miniseries but Moore truly turns the President's wife into a fullyrealized character. With Kushner's sketchy script Field only is able to touch upon a few of the major points of Mary Todd's life in the White House. In the Gore Vidal movie we actually get to see and FEEL the devastating effect son Willie's death had upon her as it occurs in real time. Here like so many of the earlier events during the Lincoln Presidency it is only alluded to. What's more Mary Todd's meltdowns probably today characterized as 'bipolar' are only tangentially dealt with as opposed to the earlier TV movie where they are an integral part of the story.Kushner creates a nonpart for the character of Elizabeth Keckley the AfricanAmerican dressmaker turned servant to Mary Todd Lincoln. In the 1988 biopic there's actually a relationship shown between the two women with Keckley morphing into a confidante in effect acting as a sounding board for Mary Todd Lincoln's actual views on slavery. In Spielberg's 'Lincoln' there's an unlikely scene where Keckley confronts Lincoln on the front porch of the White House musing about the future fate of African Americans in the U.S.Daniel Day Lewis is as good as Sam Waterston but unfortunately he just doesn't have a good script to work with. Probably the best scene in the film is the confrontation between Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens in the White House pantry. But because none of the other 'team of rivals' is developed Lincoln has hardly anyone to play off of here. Spielberg's attempt to examine Lincoln's personal life also falls flat. The melodramatic scene where he slaps son Robert feels completely out of character! Before you praise Spielberg's 'Lincoln' to the hilt go out and purchase Gore Vidal's Lincoln. It's only 4.89 at deepdiscountdvd.com and Sam Waterston is simply excellent as the politician and the man warts and all! As usual Spielberg's production values far outshine the low budget efforts on television. Ultimately one should expect more from the famed director instead of his narrow focus on such an iconic figure.".

This movie was a wasted opportunity a confused mess which doesn't know what it wants to be and just because DDL is in it and it's about abolishing slavery everyone is applauding it but even 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter' was better than this pile of dog pooh and that's saying something!".

	schema:headline " Abraham Lincoln deserved a better film";
	schema:reviewBody "'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time it tells a big American story and features a big American hero it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first  the very little known Duel a minimalistic masterpiece followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be  great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre other stuff looks sometimes pretentious sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove Spielberg cannot do films about any subject I mean he certainly can but not all are that good.Most of the action in 'Lincoln' takes place during the month of January of 1865. After four years of Civil War victory is quite close for the North but the ending would have been meaningful only if the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal was adopted making the reason of going to war and the temporary judicial war decisions part of the Constitution. Timing is critical as the nation is tired and aspires for peace and recovery and without the adoption of the amendment the end of the war may mean a compromise that leaves slavery in place. Abraham Lincoln will make all possible political maneuvering in order to have the amendment pass in a Congress where he did not have the required majority. There is an interesting dilemma here about using 'unclean' political means in order to achieve a just cause and this is one of the principal themes. There are two problems here however in my opinion. One is that the political intrigues occupy a good half if not more of the film and what we get on the screen is a painfully long succession of bearded gentlemen under top hats arguing and bribing for the good cause. I guess some of the American audiences are more familiar with the historical characters but even so this is a long and repetitive succession of more of the same and even the climax scene of the voting in the House misses some of the thrill I have expected. The other problem is the political speak which is attributed to almost all characters in the film. Maybe the script writers used fragments from speeches I do not know but there is too much rhetoric too many historical sentences are being said by many characters not only by Lincoln and even in what should have been daytoday situations. The overall result seemed to me tiring and emphatic. It is actually the nonpolitical secondary threads that seemed more interesting  for example the agonizing decision of the parents Lincoln not allowing their elder son to fight in the war. This dilemma would have deserved a film by itself a smaller but maybe better one.Much was said and written even a cover story in TIME Magazine about Daniel DayLewis's impersonation of Lincoln. He is good but far in my opinion from his own creation in 'My Left Foot' or from Joaquin Phoenix's act in 'The Master' best acting of the year in my view. The way he is filmed does not help too many frames are looking towards catching his silhouette or making his profile look like the pictures which represent Lincoln in his time. Again when he is human when his words are not taken from speeches he looks and sounds better but this is only for part of the time. Rhetoric prevailed in the building of this role and Spielberg's scope looks like creating as many scenes to quote but less to link them in a fluent story as he knows to do that well. I liked much more the supporting roles of Sally Field as a Lincoln's wife or maybe the wife of all presidents or great men who sacrifice their personal lives for the greater causes and of Tommy Lee Jones as the radical proabolitionist politician Thaddeus Stevens a man whose life was dedicated to the fight against slavery but who knows to make the right political move at the critical moment to achieve the legal confirmation of the dream at a tough personal price with respect to his own ideals. In a movie where so many characters including the one that gives the name of the film are no more than rhetoric symbols these two living heroes played by the two great actors make a refreshing difference.".

	schema:headline " Steven Spielberg's is a bad director... Oh Heaven Forbid!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Spielberg will fill you with more of the dorky intelligenceinsulting spineless pretentiousness in this movie which btw he excels at. Instead of being disgusted by thoughtless behavior characters are constantly caught up in admiration of it. Instead of avoiding selfabsorbed arrogant belittling selfdiluted selfrighteous mannerisms from them the audience is forced deep into it knowing that no one in a Spielberg movie will ever have the good sense to call it out.Oh but there are interruptions in the movie. Becoming a onetrickpony and learning that characters constantly interrupting each other to cover up major plot details is an improvement from being a director who doesn't have any connection to reality whatsoever. Yes I guess he learned that it is far easier to excuse your mess to a loyal audience by leading them into it in a way where they may second guess their own intelligence and hope they conclude they were just 'too stupid to get it' than to actually do the work of thinking about what should be the right way to film this stuff.There are too many characters that do lazylipped complaining to Lincoln about something they disagree about him doing and when they can't convince Lincoln that he's wrong the same annoying character goes down to the next man in line and complains to him why what Lincoln says SHOULD be done! Could you get any more repulsive please?... There are scenes where people are playing up their own helplessness when they obviously have no reason to feel helpless in the first place. This is done mostly as a pathetic attempt to add drama or at comedy to a movie where there is none. Just because a guy chooses to let the President's son playing with a goat in the white house bother him and chooses to try to deal with bystanders in his apparent lack of control about it doesn't mean that we would make such a moronic decision about how to go about it. But because it's assumed that we the audience are also spineless dramaqueens like this guy then we must also be thoughtless fools susceptible to forced and meaningless pretensions and see this as comedy! But because the director is a hack he knows that this scene is not funny or even amusing so he tries to trick you by making you watch it before you even know what's going on He slips it in the start of a scene just following a sudden cut so we have to follow this guy around doing this stupid thing before we even know what's happening.I could go on but why bother?... Oh yeah because I'm being harassed by shameless moochers in the form of prolific knowitall professional critics about Spielberg's Rousing Brilliance and people farting about it being 'a fivestar experience that touched their lives forever' even before the damn trailers came out. Okay that's a good reason. I'll go on A guy who is needed to pass the Amendment is scared and intimidated for no reason at all. The writers seem to know this because they actually have to have him yell I would vote for it but I ain't got no courage! for the audience. This is really helpful because if he never said this we would never have any reason to know why he's not voting for the bill! 'Let's see an opposing Rep. walks up to him and questions him about it swinging broad shoulders. He responds with a sissy face. ...I guess in the land of Spielberg's spineless pretentiousness this is enough to pass for intimidation!'Hey you want a new complaint?  ...When Lincoln is returning home from a theater play where Spielberg makes you think he is about to be shot so intensely that you forget what the scene was really about. Uh... why?!? The Lincolns' black female servant thanks him for the bill he created to free all slaves. She then asks him if he really wants them in the country. He gives her a candid response about how he doesn't really know her yet to which she then reveals that her son died in the War and that this should be enough for him to know who she is. There is a heavy silence as she walks away and leaves him there to contemplate that relieved me when it was cut away from ...because there weren't any 20 minute long sweeping farting noises from trumpets where there very easily could've been! My point is this She knows he risked career and reputation at greatest height to pass this bill because it's already established in the beginning that she sees him and works for him from day to day in the White House. So when she asks 'Do you really want us here?' Lincoln should've just said 'Isn't that kind of a stupid question...? Nah I'm going behind the backs of the will of the people at the height of my popularity continuing to risk breaking legislative law and extending the civil slaughter trying to keep Southern diplomats seceded from voting all to free blacks from slavery because... oh I don't know  I just love living on the edge of ruining myself!' But because he gave some stupid answer to her stupid question we have to sit through more totally unnecessary pretentious behavior this time from her about how she is already a good enough American. Poor setup and little payoff. All for worthless pseudodramatics.Just look how many shamefully unpatriotic and amateurlike flaws this site IMDb.com has listed for this film. You see Steven Spielberg's ego may have gotten so big that he feels anything he spits out will be called a masterpiece. He couldn't even make the Capitol Building look believable despite having made realistic dinosaurs when he had less money. He used the California State Building. Same State that Hollywood is in to save money on gas mileage...?!?".

	schema:headline " Spielberg's Lincoln Makes Short Shrift of American Slavery";
	schema:reviewBody "Last night we saw a screening of Steven Spielberg's film LINCOLN. I do not plan to see this film again however I would not discourage anyone from seeing it. As I see it this film is more of a tribute to Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln rather than the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. In LINCOLN Spielberg with his retinue of John Williams film score Janusz Kaminski cinematography and David Crank art direction gives us an alchemy of film making that simply weakens as we're made to plow through the awkwardness of Tony Kushner's wordy screenplay. Too often I had overlooked the challenges several key actors had in delivering their linestext written more for reading rather than oral delivery. Odd that Kushner didn't do a better job of translating Goodwin's book often criticized for being heavily researched yet depthless in its treatment of that period.There are numerous artistic missteps that for me kept bringing the film down to tawdry and even boring at times. And certainly having John Williams compose a piano solo in the middle of a scene symbolizing the end of the Civil War was utterly distracting where using a chorus softly humming could have made the same scene compelling and powerful. He does use a chorus humming in another scene again a misstep.As to the acting well other than having to chew with overly huge mouthfuls of dialogue I enjoyed the range of thespian theatrics. Daniel DayLewis as Lincoln gives a good yet measured performance hampered at times by the Jesus lighting Spielberg insists is necessary. When you see the film you'll know what I mean. Actually several actors get that treatment. To me it's almost laughable. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln is good too but it's the same wonderful Sally Field acting we see in so many of her films. Tommy Jones as a powerful Pennsylvania Republican leader gives another great Tommy Lee Jones performance and for many it will be a highlight of the film. However for me it's Jared Harris Mad Men who really shines as Ulysses S. Grant. It took me a while to see him through the makeupwhich is also a star of the filmbut I never got over how remarkably he brought Grant to life and as close as the person sitting next to you in the theater. Indeed an awardworthy performance! Having said all this among my greatest concerns about Spielberg's LINCOLN are that it overly emphasizes the passing of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionto free the slaves. Yet in spite of itself in a rather disturbing way the film promotes the idea that slavery ended in the 19th Century. And because of Douglas Blackmon's Pulitzer Prize bookSlavery by Another Name we now know that slavery in the U.S. continued far into the 20th Century. In fact Blackmon details it through World War II. For me the film loses power with its short shrift of slavery and its narrow uninspired focus on Washington politics as usual.Finally the most glaring flaw in my view is that Spielberg in his seemingly obsessive zeal to further sanitize the Lincoln legend glosses over the fact that Lincoln aside from his reported hatred of slavery was definitely not an abolitionist. In truth he felt that freed Blacks should be sent back to Africa or Central America. And he was clear that he did not want to interfere with slavery in places where it already existed.This quote is damning to the Spielberg whitewash of Lincoln I will say then that I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black racesthat I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.  Abraham Lincoln from a speech he delivered in 1858 in Charleston Ill.In LINCOLN it's as if Spielberg has resurrected the old Selznick touch but in this case it's in such a heavyhanded way we nearly lose our passion to care. It's certainly not worthy of seeing again by this African American reviewer. Nevertheless see it for yourself and report back. We'd like to know what you think!".

Starting with the most glaring problem it's boring beyond tears with stilted and rambling dialogue which if it weren't so boring would be laughable. Acting it's obvious that Daniel DayLewis had no interest in doing this role. His squeaky voice and mannerisms made me think of high school plays I attended when my kids were in school. Sally Field looks and acts like an old and wrinkled Gidget and overacts in her highlight scenes. But the winner of the most horrible acting in the film goes to Tommy Lee Jones as a Pennsylvania Senator who is nothing more or less than a caricature of Tommy Lee Jones. Historically it's semiaccurate and many people will be surprised to learn that Honest Abe was anything but. His obsession with getting his way in passing the thirteenth amendment led to his violation of the Constitution breaking of federal laws and bribing of members of Congress. Hmm a lot like today though. The saving grace of the film and the only reason I would give it two stars is the outstanding costumes and relative lack of special effects that are usually so obvious and glaring in today's pathetic movies which are designed to make money from our sinking IQs in this country. I wonder if anyone will even try again to make a movie that provokes thought and discussion. Sorry Spielburg but this is a turkey that arrived just in time for Thanksgiving.".

That's not Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan not even close but this film captures wonderfully the way the director looks at that piece of history and though it's probably not the more realistic film ever made about Lincoln and i don't know if there will ever be one really realistic.. the movie offers tremendous performances DDL will certainly be honored a tremendous production design and not less importanta great score by John Williams once again! Sobasically i was still very surprised by the way Spielberg did it because it shows a very intimate portrait of Lincoln's personality. And i warn you this is film is for grown ups not for teenagers looking for some kind of action war movie about leadership and honor in civil war. That's Spielberg in a kind of different but always faith full way and i hope it earns lot of nominations in the Oscars this year and i will not be surprised if Lincoln wins Best Picture in January.A 1010 without any doubt !

It could have been a very good movie a spectacular movie for all time but it never even got started on getting close to that level.As a movie about Lincoln it devoted very little of the movie to the subject spending over half of it recreating the machinations of the House of Representatives debating the 13th Amendment. There was some new insight into Lincoln himself for which Mr. DayLewis should be well credited but taken as a whole this was a monumental flop.Mr. DayLewis was by all accounts able to recreate some of the physical characteristics of the late President most notably his awkward gait. Several scenes depicted Mr. DayLewis plodding away down a hall in a perfect analogy for the movie  a slow ponderous heavy dull and boring. Added to the bad acting bad directing and bad writing were the bad visual effects  the CGI additions to buildings that didn't quite fit plus all the little things that will appear as goofs in the pages of IMDb.com as others watch this monstrosity on DVD later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently I had the opportunity to watch Lincoln or the more aptly named Lincolon. Two hours of horrendous script and fiction woven by a zealot with a thesaurus who believed that replacing words such as 'empty' with 'vacus' turned his suppar script into a masterpiece. The film started with good old honest Abe 'relaxing' or should that be 'tranquilize thy consciousness' on a military camp site with the men but not just men black men! The mood and tone of the film has been set Lincolon is grounded and relaxed when surrounded by the people. He's one of you. Isn't he wonderful! Made ever so much harder to believe when we can quote Licolon from his debates with Douglas in 1858I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races  that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office not to intermarry with white people and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.The great political insights I gathered from this film was that 19th century American politics consisted of politicians calling each other farty pants and vacus nincompoops. It was the equivalent of watching 'Dude where's my car' set in the 19th Century. If that wasn't bad enough good old honest Abe was there to make sure we suffered. Every ten minutes good old lovely Abe would tell the out of depth mere mortals a story that would give us great depth and insight into a situation that would within a few seconds change that persons entire outlook on life. Half way through the film I began to believe I had walked into a movie about the second coming of Christ. At one point even the script writer had become so tired of writing Abe's story's that he added himself into the script via a character with the lines 'I know what you're going to do! You're going to tell one of your story's again! I'm not staying around for this!'. A thought probably shared by millions who've watched this film. As for Daniel Day Lewis's Oscar winning performance. I can recreate the performance right here in text. Would you like some tea Abe? .........................................yes i.... think I.... willWhat do we do Abe? ..................................This reminds me.........of a time...The common people of America with a child like grasp on history and inability to read a book that doesn't have pictures will declare this as one of the greatest films ever made. The historical accuracy of this film rivals that of 'Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter' It's a pure work of fiction and anybody who believes the civil war was about abolishing slavery needs to spend only ten minutes with their head in a history book to know the truth.I will end this review with a final quote from the white messiah Abe Lincolon.If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race I do because I believe it helps to save the Union and what I forbear I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.".

The first thing you notice when you finally enter the room is that most of the people seem to be in some state of rapture. You expectantly gaze at the artists work and suddenly realize that you don't get it. The paintings are devoid of meaning. That's how I felt entering the theatre to view this film. Lincoln was obviously one of the most significant leaders the US has ever had. How can a film about such a complex and divisive leader in his time be so blah?

Instead he creates an opportunity to the viewer to get to know the person condemned to die. The emphasis is not about what is right and wrong or who did what. Its about the person in death row as well as other human aspects involved. Proper weight is given to the case's individual details and at least my curiosity about the evidence and what occurred in the crimes was satisfied.I strongly recommend this series to people that find the theme at least mildly interesting. This series is politically some what neutral in spite of Herzog opposing capital punishment. I found some of the subjects  not all  likable and felt strong compassion for them. This is a special miniseries and I'm very glad I watched it even though I was disappointed by 'Into the Abyss'.".

He doesn't make ridiculous assertions like waiting 17 years to be executed is reparation enough for taking another's life forever. He lets the murderers speak in their own words offers no obvious judgments and attempts to be impartial not always successfully. But he tries. He offers no excuses for the evil in these people. When Darlie Routier who hacked her 5 and 6 year old sons to death whines about how she hasn't been able to hug her sons in 16 years the obvious answer to her complaint needs no explanation. And Herzog respects us enough not to supply one. When a man who beat his 13 month ! old daughter to death with a hammer breaking 18 ribs and causing multiple skull fractures not to mention biting her in over 20 places on her little body hard enough to leave tooth impressions is asked why he did it his reply is Why?

It's to me evident that even if the man being interviewed had committed the murders and done them in cold blood rather than when out of his mind the 17 years of torture he has been forced to suffer has more than covered any punishment he deserved. Jeremy Bentham observed that punishment should always be in proportion to the suffering that the crime caused it is hugely unjust and wicked to punish with many times over the amount of pain and suffering caused. It is criminally uncivilised that the authorities have been unable to see this and have persisted in treating this man in such an ghastly horrific and savage manner for such an interminably long time.Of course Herzog is not nave. He's chosen a very unusual inmate to make the case. Not only is the inmate articulate sensitive mainly rational and intelligent though not always sensible as is made clear! but he's white most people executed in the US are black and was convicted as an adult  and there's some doubt supported by the Supreme Court of his guilt. I supposed Herzog looked for a similarly white articulate possibly guiltless murderess but was unable to find one. I think that this is all quite fair  if people are such moral imbeciles as to think such torture and execution acceptable then any means of persuasion is legitimate even if ultimately unlikely to succeed. After all it is wrong to execute anybody not just wrong to murder judicially people like us... Alhough one wonders a bit about massmurderers of the Mao Pol Pot Tony Blair George Bush Stalin variety  the question of punishment for causing such massive pain suffering mutilation and death is more difficult in the cases of such extreme monsters it is still true that it would be wrong to torture and execute them  after all stringing Mussolini from a lamppost hasn't done anything to deter murderous fascists since then..The film also makes a good case for the profound depth of the depravity of executioners. Is it possible to imagine any human activity more depraved than operating a human slaughter house? Particularly one attached to torture chambers that mete out incessant cruel treatment over decades against human beings. Even soldiers have the merit of arguing that their victims can sometimes fight back. At least DIY home murderers can argue that they seldom even prolific serial killers manage to kill 200 people a year and that they do it for passion or serious money  not just 'extra pay'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can think of no better guide through the bizarre world of capital punishment than this film's director Werner Herzog.I've seen two other segments in this fascinating series and both were superbly done. This one on Linda Carty seems the weakest of the three.It centers on a horrific case but Carty is neither interesting nor sympathetic. She is inarticulate on her own behalf and Herzog's questioning of her is uncharacteristically lame.The star of this segment is Connie Spence an assistant district attorney who bears an uncanny resemblance in appearance and demeanor to Laura Bush. She sensitively speaks to the ability of Herzog to channel sympathy in the direction of a caged killer while the sufferings of the victim may fade from memory.Herzog also interviews a lawyer whose firm has done 2 million in pro bono work in hopes of getting Carty a new trial because her defense attorney failed to speak to Carty's DEA handler. This handler supposedly would have testified that Carty who had served as one of his informants was not the kind of person would would have hurt anyone.The lawyer states that if the jury had heard such statements it never would have given Carty the death penalty. Given the sordid facts of this case I question that...James BarnesI just had an opportunity to view the segment on multiple killer Barnes. It was interesting but again I feel Herzog could have done more here. The interviewer succeeds in bringing out the oddness of Barnes but fails to ask questions that are begged. For example why on earth did Barnes leave all his clothing outside of Brenda's home? What was going on in his head as he lay in wait in her closet as she did chores and watched TV?Barnes grew up in an abusive home and it's implied that he sexually abused his twin sister. He hurt animals and his rap sheet was long. What could have been done to prevent his horrors? I believe if Herzog had asked this question to Barnes and others in this segment it would have been a much stronger entry in the series. Wake up my man Werner!".

	schema:reviewBody "While watching this documentary I could tell that the viewer was meant to feel sympathy for these convicted murderers but it just didn't happen for me. Everything they said everything they were asked... I just found myself growing more and more angry with them and with the notion that I SHOULD feel any kind of sympathy for them based on what they were saying.One of them mentioned not being able to hug his little girl. That's sad. Unfortunately his victims' parents will never be able to hug see or speak to their children again. That's sadder.Someone said that he hadn't seen his wife in two years. That's a real shame. Unfortunately his victims will never be able to find a partner and get married in the first place. That's an even bigger shame.We also hear from a family member who is saddened that she can't spend holidays with her incarcerated loved one. I feel for her there. Unfortunately the victims' families are no longer able to do anything at any time with their murdered loved one. I feel for them more.One fellow talks about making his peace with God before the date of his execution and how finite life feels when you know what date your life will end. That's profound but I somehow doubt he cared if his victims had made their peace with God before he brought about their unexpected and violent ends.We also are told about how another inmate at one of the prisons was given his lethal injection improperly which apparently caused some discomfort for him. How terrible. Maybe he should have been given the option of having his life ended the way he ended his victims' lives? Although I doubt that would be more pleasant than an improperly placed syringe.As icing on the cake we hear from a fellow that a prior altercation with his victim had been very humiliating for him. Words fail me here. Am I supposed to feel pity for him? Sympathy? I only feel rage.Ultimately every part I have seen of this documentary has turned my stomach completely. If that was the goal of the filmmaker then his mission was accomplished... but I have the feeling that his goal was to make me feel sympathy for these complete monsters who in my opinion should be grateful for the life they still have as opposed to the lack of life they've inflicted on their victims.".

Adam Sandler is so irritating in this film especially with the accent he does. The whole story from beginning to end is nauseating. The film starts with Adam Sandler's character getting his teacher pregnant who turns out to be Andy Samberg. Adam Sandler's character goes back into his son's life and meets his fiance Jamie. The most nauseating scene was the part where Jamie is found having sex with her brother! I'm all for comedy and a good laugh but those subjects in my opinion cross the line. You can expect all the usual suspects in a Sandler film and lots of actors from SNL. I can't believe James Caan and Susan Sarandon even agreed to be in this train wreck of a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A dumb lead character in a comedy can result in a funny movie. However if every other character is dumb enough to be even slightly charmed by a vulgar drunken slovenly 41yearold man with an annoying voice who looks like a washedup Guns N Roses roadie plausibility flies right out the window and so do the laughs.That's My Boy has more promise in its male leads than it ultimately delivers. After all Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg have a lot more in common besides initials. They're both Saturday Night Live alumni who made names for themselves by writing original funny songs. They also both practically singlehandedly revitalized SNL's popularity by attracting a younger following.You would think a movie starring both of them would showcase each of their talents. Unfortunately in That's My Boy Samberg was restricted to a straight man role while Sandler routinely eats scenery with his atrocious Boston accent that sounds more Louisianan.The film's premise does not leave much room for laughs as it is. Sandler plays Donny a native of Somerville Massachusetts who when he's 13 years old has a thing for older women particularly his teacher Miss McGarricle Eva Amurri Martino.When Miss McGarricle takes too much of a liking to the young Donny they have sex they get caught and Miss McGarricle gets pregnant. She bears a son but gets sentenced to 30 years in prison.In a contrived totally unrealistic plot point that only serves as fodder for jokes later on in the film young Donny is ordered by the court who apparently had never heard of child care services to raise his newborn son. Even more unrealistically Donny becomes a celebrity sells his life story for six figures and blows his money away.The second part of that scenario rubbed me the wrong way already. Do you remember the name of the boy with whom 6th grade teacher Mary Kay Letorneau had sex? I don't. That boy was featured in the New York Times but not on the cover of Teen Beat!Anyway Donny's son Todd Samberg grows up to become a successful hedge fund manager but only after moving away from Donny when he turned 18 Again child services anyone?. Donny on the other hand spends his money so irresponsibly that he ultimately owes 43000 in back taxes.When he finds out about Todd's engagement to beautiful Jamie Leighton Meester Donny convinces a TV talk show host to pay him 50000 for exclusive footage of Donny Todd and Todd's biological mother still in jail reuniting at last. Such a contrived plot point serves as the reason Donny shows up unannounced to Todd's wedding site days before the wedding.Rather than the wedding party consisting of Jamie's family and Todd's boss Steve Spirou Tony Orlando being repulsed by Donny's disheveled hair ratty clothes vernacular that consists of the fword spoken every third sentence and his irritating faux Boston accent they somehow see his charm. It's surprising because if a guy who acted like Donny showed up at my wedding I would call security before he even opened his mouth.Naturally because Donny is a boy who never grew up his shenanigans supposedly ruin Todd's plans for the perfect wedding. The usual clich plot points happen when Donny and Todd have a falling out the night before the wedding sentimental music borrowed from Full House reruns play during the night scenes and the climax happens right when the bride and groom are taking their vows.I should note that there's also a plot twist involving the bride that was so out of left field that it landed in another ball park. Without giving it away I really wish the film hadn't gone there. That twist made me cringe far more than it made me laugh.Add those hackneyed wedding movie story lines to Sandler's constantly disseminating his tired onslaught of fat jokes penis gags fart noises antics revolving around elderly people having sex and homophobic humor and you've got That's My Boy. The difference between him doing those jokes in this movie and his last movie Jack and Jill 2011 is that here when using an irritating voice he doesn't cross dress.Don't get me wrong though. I don't hate Adam Sandler. In fact Happy Gilmore 1996 The Wedding Singer 1998 and The Waterboy 1998 still make me laugh both because the jokes are fresher and funnier and because Sandler's character in those movies had heart. Here he plays a buffoon so obnoxious you want to punch him in the face.The other jokes not spoken by Sandler but by other characters fall flat 9 times out of 10. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan plays Sandler's financial adviser who happens to be a huge New England Patriots fan. Get it? Because he's actually the Jets coach in real life? Hardy har har!Among the many cameos in this film the only one that's genuinely funny is Vanilla Ice who plays himself. He surprisingly does such a good job parodying his image from 20 years ago that Happy Madison Productions should actually give him his own movie.However Vanilla Ice's role in the movie reflected the problem of That's My Boy when Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg are in a movie together the funniest person should not be Vanilla Ice! Sandler really needs to reevaluate his onscreen humor and his career. While his movies are making money he's gradually losing credibility.To paraphrase an earlier funnier Sandler movie Billy Madison 1995 That's My Boy is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in this rambling incoherent film was Sandler even close to anything that could be considered funny. Everyone in my screening room is now dumber for having seen it. I award this movie 2 out of 10 stars and may God have mercy on Adam Sandler's soul.".

This script wasn't even close to decent. The premise was totally unfunny at best and probably takes the cake for sadness and sickness. Crudity substituted for freshness and humor and not only were all the secondary characters cartoonish and undeveloped but so were most of the leads.

	schema:reviewBody "That's My Boy is content with being a belligerent vulgarian comedy that it is willing to concoct any setup any oneliner or any character as long as it's on par with its irredeemable crude standard. It's first fatal flaw is that it erects so many raunchy situations that it completely undermines the characters that are involved in them which is the whole reason we laugh. We laugh not at the situations themselves but how these characters react to them. But this is only the icing on the cake of disgust.Such topics covered in the film are teacherstudent molestation strippers poor parenting child abuse browbeating the less fortunate incest and many more. Only Sandler would take such heartless and degrading topics and throw them all into a film where no wit soul or morals can be found. They are employed with such carelessness and such a disregard for humanity that it becomes utterly revolting. The only laughs to be found come from not a main character but one that shows up at the end of the film something you should expect from a Happy Madison picture. He is Abdoulaye N'gom who was also in the Sandler produced Grandma's Boy. How come somebody didn't think to put him as one of the side characters? The story can be summed up in fragmented words such as lazy overwritten camaraderie inconsiderate offensive demeaning and meanspirited but let's focus on the plot itself. It starts out on the everso bright note of teacherstudent molestation where young nitwit teenager Donny Berger is happily seduced by his teacher Miss Mary McGarricle in a closet. It results in an unexpected pregnancy where Miss McGarricle goes to prison and their baby is left with the teenage Donny who can barely take care of himself let alone another child.Donny names the kid Han Solo Berger and at eighteen the kid becomes estranged from his parents telling people they died in an explosion changes his name to Todd Peterson and begins a new life. Donny Sandler went on to live off a six figure deal to sell his story to a Television show and carelessly blew all the money forgetting that he needed to pay taxes on the earnings. Donny now owes the IRS 43000 and winds up striking a 50000 deal with a filthy reality show executive to get him Todd and his mother currently in prison to do a reunion event on camera. It's scummy and outlandishly selfish.Todd is Andy Samberg who is stunned to see Donny show up uninvited and quickly tells his wife's family that he is a close friend of his and this leads to some contrived shouting matches between the two as to how Donny was the worst parent ever. This is true. It's a too little too late effort but Donny decides it's time to make nice with Todd so he stays at their house during the wedding to reconnect with his son while trying to conceal the fact that he's only there for money.This is yet another Sandler film I like to dub an anticharacter study. First off there is hardly a likable character in the film except for Todd who is just a poor man's version of a neurotic success story. The character Donny comes equipped with Sandler's most horrendous accent since his character in The Waterboy and this could very well be Sandler's worst film in years I have not seen Jack and Jill. It aims to go for the baddest of laughs but due to the lack of discipline plausibility in the writing why isn't the baby given to child services? and the removal of heart in its material it's a middle finger to morals and an ode to chaotic meanspirited circumstances.That's My Boy inhabits a world of such cruelty to almost everyone involved. The males are incompetent caricatures motivated by ego and greed the women are no better than the size of their breasts and buttocks shown in a misogynistic light almost saying that women exist to either show off parts of their body or to be ditzy foulmouthed bimbos and every middleage side character is shown as an amoral horndog both men and women alike. Remember Big Daddy? One of the few Adam Sandler films sort of slanted and aimed more for children? It involved a louse who is stuck raising an illegitimate kid for his best friend. You could sort of label That's My Boy the raunchy sequel to Big Daddy an explain it extracted the heart and sentiment out of it. But saying that would give the film more purpose than it's entitled to. It's a loathsome painfully unfunny affront to comedy.Starring Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Leighton Meester Susan Sarandon Will Forte Nick Swardson Peter Dante and Abdoulaye N'gom. Directed by Sean Anders.".

	schema:headline " How Do We Make Statutory Rape Funny?";
	schema:reviewBody "Why do I go into Adam Sandler movies with the hope that each new offering will be the one that redeems him as an actor a writer and a producer? You'd think I was a masochist or delusional or both although I've willingly subjected myself some truly abominable projects of his in the past two years alone including The House Bunny Grown Ups Just Go With It Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star Zookeeper and Jack and Jill I've also seen him expand his horizons towards more mature more compelling endeavors like Punch Drunk Love Reign Over Me and Funny People. Hell he even won me over with You Don't Mess with the Zohan which certainly is of the same raunchy tasteless caliber as most of his other films. He has surprised me before and I live in hope that he will surprise me again.I had to keep telling myself that as I sat through his newest film That's My Boy in which Sandler doubles as the star and the producer. For him and for everyone involved this is a pathetic new low representative of nothing apart from a desperate plea for attention. With its bizarre blending of disgusting toilet humor and heartfelt moments of drama it exemplifies a complete lack of understanding on the filmmakers' part about who the movie was intended for. When you include a scene in which an obese stripper eats an omelet while using her legs to hang upside down from a pole there is no conceivable way to believably work in a sentimental fatherson bonding story. There is only one kind of audience this movie is made for and I'm fairly certain it will respond more to the stripper than to any depiction of family drama.The story begins in 1984 when a boy barely in his teens has sex with his hot female teacher who quite willingly came onto him. They're eventually caught having sex in the school assembly room while wouldn't you know it a full assembly is in progress. The intent is obvious To make light of recent news stories about female teachers seducing their male students. But hold on a minute. Imagine if the foundation of the plot had been an adult male teacher seducing his female student. Would we consider that funny? Of course not. We would rightfully think of the girl as a victim. So then why is it funny when the gender roles are reversed? Why is the boy a stud instead of a victim? In either case this is statutory rape we're talking about and the last time I checked this was not suitable material for a comedy. What we have here is not only a glaring double standard but also a warped sense of humor. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.The affair resulted in the teacher's pregnancy which in turn resulted in a thirtyyear prison sentence for her. As for the teen he was required to become a single parent to his child a son he named Han Solo until his eighteenth birthday. Initially it turned out pretty good for him he won the respect of his classmates he became a teenage celebrity and a TV movie based on his life was produced. But then we flash forward to the present day at which point we find that the teen has grown into a slovenly foulmouthed beerchugging slacker. His name is Donny Berger Sandler and if he wants to avoid a threeyear prison sentence he must pay the IRS 43000 in back taxes. He strikes a deal with a sleazy talk show host If he can film Han Solo reuniting with his mother Susan Sarandon in prison he will pay Donny 50000.There's only one problem. Donny's now adult son Andy Samberg who has legally changed his name to Todd Peterson hasn't spoken to his father in years and has made every effort to hide his past. Now a hopelessly neurotic diabetic he has become a successful businessman and is engaged to woman named Christina Leighton Meester. Donny tracks Todd down through a candid publicity photo reenters his life the weekend before his wedding and poses as Todd's oldest best friend. Even though he has the social skills of a drunk on a bender Donny is inexplicably able to win over all of Christina's family. This would include her rather elderly grandmother Peggy Stewart not only does Donny masturbate to sidebyside photos of her as a young woman and as she appears today he will also have sex with her. Yes she initiates it. And yes he willingly accepts her advances.As the plot lumbers ahead we see James Caan as a priest with a thick Irish brogue and a rotten temper bear witness to a disgusting and completely unnecessary plot twist involving Christina and her testosteronepumped military brother Milo Ventimiglia and endure a few visual jokes involving vomit and semen. We also watch as Vanilla Ice plays a parody of himself as Donny's best friend made all the more unbearable by the fact that he's actually a pretty decent actor. All the while we're expected not to laugh at the phony drama of Donny and Todd working towards repairing their relationship. The people behind That's My Boy make countless mistakes but the biggest was to believe that this subplot could in any way shape or form be taken seriously. I take that back. The biggest mistake was making the film in the first place. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

How can a guy not make a few flops??? This film wasn't even bad. Other than the over use of crude jokes it was good. If you edited about 10 or 15 minutes of the crude and sexual jokes out of this it would've been Sandler gold. The character he played was really original not one of those family guy characters he just keeps on playing over and over. It was like his mid 90 characters like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison the ones that made us love him. Of course it wasn't as good as a character. Overall a pretty fair film that could've been great with the edits. I really don't know how you can say you walked out of the theater?!!! Same with Jack and Jill it was bad but it didn't deserve the horrible reviews. The guys made about 20 massive hits how's he not gonna make one or two flops??? Anyways Sandler make the edits and reput it in theaters and I think it'll do way better.".

	schema:headline " That's my Boy";
	schema:reviewBody "The set up for this movie  which has a teenage boy impregnate his female teacher  played to the lowest common denominator and was exploitative tasteless and mean spirited but at least it was funny. The rest of the film which has Donny Adam Sadler trying to bond with estranged son Todd Andy Samberg does not have a single funny joke. Not one joke worked at any level though the number of gags must have numbered in the dozens or maybe over a hundred. Instead That's my Boy is unrelentingly loud obnoxious and boring. At one point I even felt sorry for Vanilla Ice who gave a cameo performance in this movie. I think Vanilla was trying to present the image of a cool humble and genuinely nice guy but unfortunately nothing can offset the jarring performances of the rest of the cast. Perhaps what I hated most about this movie apart from the fact that there was not a single funny joke after the setup played itself out is its underlying message. This film appears to be saying that Donny's obnoxious rude drunken and downright stupid behaviour is superior to the civilized and ethical behaviour of polite society and that everyone would be better off in the end if they were as obnoxious rude drunken and stupid as Donny himself. If this message which was clearly targeted to the people who show up for the Jerry Springer show was not clear enough in the beginning and middle of the film it was positively deafening at the end. As it turns out fiance Jamie Leighton Meester may seem like a sweet polite and civilized rich girl but that's all fake because she was secretly having an affair with two relatives while engaged to Todd. So given its lack of laughs the way it celebrates bad behaviour as something for others to emulate and its cynical use of fatherson bonding to make itself seem sympathetic and the opposite of mean spirited That's my Boy gets a resounding thumbs down.".

As expected the narrative flanks Bronson with reallife spouse Jill Ireland  here in perhaps her most embarrassing performance as a spoiled hippie brat needless to say the star more often than not lets his physique do the acting for him  but his is an undeniable screen presence and as I've written elsewhere he just happened to fit the bill for what was required of an action star in the late 60s70s.The supporting cast also includes Michel Constantin who was also in VIOLENT CITY EuroCult regular Luigi Pistilli and Jean Topart  all of them appearing as members of Mason's gang with the latter being the most villainous of the lot and who gets his just desserts in memorable fashion. The best thing the violent film has going for it are the plentiful and exciting action sequences particularly a lengthy  if somewhat irrelevant  car chase towards the end once again the work of Remy Julienne. Though the budget DVD at least presented it in the correct aspect ratio the print for COLD SWEAT which along with a few other Bronson titles has fallen into the public domain was still too soft and murky to do justice to its variety of European locations.".

This would be the first international production the others to follow 'Red Sun 1971' and 'The Valachi Papers 1972' and the weakest of three films which director Terence Young would have Bronson in the leading role. Bronson is reliable and looks in good shape. Along side him there are recognizable faces in James Mason Liv Ullmann Jill Ireland Luigi Pistilli Michel Constantin and Jean Topart. The lesser support cast do an admirable job but the likes of Mason Ullmann and especially Ireland hit the bottom. Mason basically chews on his lines. Ullmann doesn't look all that comfortable and Ireland just makes you cringe. The former two are wasted. Other than Bronson it's the villainous sidekicks Pistilli Constantin and the coldblooded Topart that are the life of the party. The script falls on the flimsy side. A tightly drilled and violently gritty story but elementary straightlaced allthesame. A former soldierdrug smuggler attempts to start a new life in the south of France with his family but some of his excomrades return to settle a score. What begins as slowgrinding laying out the premise's predicament would gradually unfold into a collection of grityourteeth catandmouse setpieces. Thrillingly fast longwinded and twistyturny cars chase being the pick of the lot. It's not until the last half of the story when the raw brutal explosiveness kicks in. The pace moves well enough and the scenic photography of the European locations is fittingly captured. The bravura camerawork solidly gets amongst the action and the swirling music score is penetratingly overstated in a gusty fashion. Durable action joint.".

It's very well made and it was very entertaining throughout plus Charles Bronson is simply amazing in this!. It has quite a few shocking scenes and i really dug James Mason's character plus the ending was great!. This was not a popular Bronson film however i really dug it as i really dug the plot plus there were a couple cool plot twists!. The character development was excellent and Charles Bronson and Liv Ullmann had very good chemistry together and i was rooting for them all the way plus Bronson had some very cool one liners!. The setting was really cool and all the characters were great plus the finale was awesome!. This is a great Bronson film that has some wicked car chases and great performances i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good. Terence Young does a very good job here using a great location some great camera work and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get some bloody wounds gunshot wounds and a stabbing. The Acting is excellent!. Charles Bronson is AMAZING as he always and is amazing here he is very likable witty intense had some very cool one liners had very good chemistry with Liv Ullmann kicked that ass was tons of fun to watch and i really dug the mind games between him and Mason!. Bronson Ruled!. James Mason is fantastic here he was sneaky very likable and really gave a fantastic show!. Liv Ullmann is very good as Bronson's wife i liked her lots.Jill Ireland is beautiful and does her job adequately she was OK. Jean Topart is pretty good as one of the main villains however he got on my nerves at times. Yannick Delulle is good as the daughter. Rest of the cast are okay. Overall i highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Charles Bronson Versus James Mason";
	schema:reviewBody "This gritty straightforward unpretentious Charles Bronson hostage thriller relies on realistic whiteknuckled suspense to maintain its momentum throughout its tense 94 minutes. James Mason Liv Ullmann Jill Ireland Michel Constantin Luigi Pistilli and Jean Topart costar in this nononsense muscular yarn with the agile charismatic Bronson. Thunderball director Terence Young emphasizes raw brute force as a man has to contend with criminal associates from his shady past who want to balance the books for his treachery. When Cold Sweat came out in 1970 the British censors complained about its violence particularly a scene where Bronson snaps a crook's neck without a qualm and then later on perforates a man with a flare pistol and turns him into a flaming shishkebab. Ostensibly based on Richard Matheson's 1959 novella Ride the Nightmare Cold Sweat depicts what happens when a group of unsavory thugs rupture the idyllic existence of Joe Martin. Scenarists Dorothea Bennett Jo Eisinger Albert Simonin and Shimon Wincelberg have shifted the setting of the story from California to the scenic south of France. In the Matheson novel Chris Martin had served as a getaway car driver for three bank robbers but he abandoned them during the commission of a crime. The authorities arrested and sent them to prison. Meanwhile Martin reformed married had a daughter and found a responsible job as a music store owner. In Cold Sweat Joe Martin lives with his wife Fabienne and her daughter and operates a charter fishing boat out of the port of BeaulieusurMer on the French Riviera between Nice and Monaco. Initially Matheson had wrote Nightmare for an Alfred Hitchcock Presents television episode. Cold Sweat opens with Joe Martin Charles Bronson of Hard Timesowns a deepsea fishing boat and he is letting a client steer it into the harbor after a successful fishing expedition. Afterward Joe gets into a poker game with some wharf buddies and wins a pile of dough from them. When he comes home to his wife Fabienne Liv Ullmann of Persona Joe learns that somebody has been constantly called them. Somebody throws rocks at Joe's windows and he sends Fabienne upstairs to lock herself up while he prowls around downstairs. Vermont  Michel Constantin of The Familycatches Joe by surprise and clobbers him. Fabienne finds Joe unconscious on the kitchen floor. Vermont holds gun on Joe after he recovers and demands that he take him on his boat to an undisclosed destination. Joe outfoxes Vermont disarms him in the kitchen and then cracks his neck. Fabienne grows suspicious when Joe refuses to phone the authorities. She argues that Joe killed Vermont in selfdefense. Later she accuses Joe of lying to her. Joe fills Fabienne in on his shady past. He served in the Korean War as an army sergeant. His commanding officer Captain Ross James Mason of Lolitawas a good soldier in combat. When the military transferred them back to Germany Ross missed the combat. Worse he got into graft taking kickbacks from service clubs and hijacking U.S. Army trucks. He sold the stolen goods on the black market. Sometimes around his headquarters Joe observes. You couldn't tell the Mafia from the army. later Joe ran into Ross in the stockade again because Ross had made 'a pig of himself' with his larcenous exploits. Joe was in the stockade because he struck a 'chicken' colonel when he got drunk. Ross invited Joe to join himself Vermont and Fausto Luigi Pistilli of Eagles Over London in an escape effort. Ross knew Joe was a good driver. Unfortunately during their breakout the former Foreign Legion soldier who furnished them with new clothes and a car Katanga Jean Topart of Action Manstabbed a German bicycle cop to death with a knife. The policeman had demanded to inspect their papers. Joe seized the car and left Ross and company to take the rap. Each drew a twenty year stretch in prison and Joe would have gotten ten years. Vermont had finished seven years when he broke out and tracked down Joe.Fabienne and Joe cruise out to a desolate stretch of road and pitch Vermont's corpse into the gorge. When they return home they find Ross Fausto and a machinegun wielding Katanga awaiting them. Ross keeps Fabienne at home and sends Katanga and Joe off in the charter boat to pick up a cache of opium from a Turkish ship. Joe gets the drop on Katanga and knocks him out. Meanwhile Joe picks up Ross's girlfriend Moira Jill Ireland at the airport punches out Fausto and stashes her at a remote cabin.When he gets back Joe discovers that Ross has kidnapped his stepdaughter. Katanga recovers. Joe takes Ross and company to the cabin where he left Moria. When it looks like they have worked out their differences Ross signals Katanga to open fire on the car that Fabienne is driving with her daughter. Joe and the former Legioneer struggle and Katanga accidentally kills Fausto and shoots Ross in the belly. Joe has to fetch a doctor for Ross before the villain loses too much blood and dies. Joe has to race back with the girlfriend and the doctor before Katanga kills Fabienne and his stepdaughter.Cold Sweat qualifies as aboveaverage with Bronson outsmarting both the criminals and the authorities. Although it is a pared down nailbiter that focuses on a small group of characters this brisk thriller conjures up several twists and turns that keep the protagonist and his adversaries from taking things slow and easy. The biggest setpiece is a careening auto chase between our hero and two French motorcycle cops along a mountainside road with Bronson swerving recklessly around cars and trucks. Veteran stunt driver Rmy Julienne stages some tirescreeching scenes with a credible Bronson at the wheel. The novel charm of Cold Sweat is the offbeat casting of British actor James Mason as a drawling southerner and actress Liv Ullumann as Bronson's love interest.".

She was always in on the contract to get Charles himself in as she was really a horrible actress most of the time in my opinion. In all his films in which she performs she always has a role in the corner somewhere as a hooker as a hippie as someone's friend. Where Charlie usually didn't say much she said too much which might have been the secret of their marriage. Anyway Cold Sweat is in a brilliant R2 DVD from Canal Plus now so stop arguing about poor film quality and fading colors and all that. One thing struck me as odd when you look at the actors and actresses involved. Some were very popular and much asked for names whilst there are at least 4 or 5 people involved who only made 1 film this one.

It was never even explained how they came back to life or to the hideout of the head of their Keystone Kopslike drug smuggling ring lead by exUS army Captain Ross James Mason who's southern accent was about as phony as a three dollar bill and just as cheap.

Some seven years ago John together with a number of GI's broke out of a US military stockade in Germany and got involved in smuggling stolen military equipment. Being the wheel man of the operation John checked out and left his fellow GI's and one French Foreign Legionnaire out in the cold when the exLegionnaire Katanga murdered a German policeman who stopped to question them. Now seven years later these same gangsters who were captured and sent back to prison are out looking for revenge and plan to make John's lifeas well as that of his wife's Fabienne and 12 year old stepdaughter MicheleYannick Dululle hell.

Ross had his hairbrained girlfriend Molra Jill Ireland go with John who was being held captive after he had kidnapped her back to town to get help before he bleeds to death. This sets up the movies exciting and dangerous car chase sequence with Molra and especially the doctorPaul Bowifasin the back seat having trouble keeping awake.Back at the hideout both Fabienne  Michele make a run for it with Katanga hot on their tail after Capt. Ross finally checked out with a little help from his friend of the movie due to loss of blood. There's a silly scene with both John's wife and daughter setting the entire brush and woods on fire to stop Katanga from killing them only to be captured by him together with John who tried to come to their rescue. There's also the mystery of what happened to Molra who just disappeared from sight and the movie as if she just had enough of this BS and walked off the set! The last we saw of Molra and the doctor was at the hideout trying to save or bring back to life the already dead Captain Ross.The movie Cold Sweat ends with a bang with the still alive and active Katanga all his fellow hoodlums were long gone by then getting John to take him out to sea at night in order to still pull off the switch with the cover of darkness in a heroin deal with a Turkish freighter. Katanga ends up as one of the many fireworks in and around the Southern French harbor town! that evening just happened to be July 14 France's National Bastille Day!".

But what his wife  stepdaughter don't know is that he was originally Joe Martin an exsoldier who left his corrupt comrades to get caught after they killed a German cop during a prison escape. The gang's leader Captain Ross manages to track Joe down  kidnaps his family in order to force him to help them secure the money needed to escape the country. But Joe doesn't take too kindly to those who threaten his family  promptly tries to sabotage their mission.Charles Bronson was one of the 1980s Bgrade action icons mainly due to starring as legendary vigilante Paul Kersey in the Death Wish series  some supporting roles in films ranging from the Vincent Price classic House of Wax to the likes of The Dirty Dozen. In the early 1970s before he became a superstar thanks to Death Wish he was making a living starring in thrillers like The Mechanic  Cold Sweat.Cold Sweat is a pretty reasonable thriller nothing more. The pace is a bit on the slow side enough to show the action setpieces as being decidedly forced. Key point being the shootout  car chase during the final third of the film  the chase takes too long for the film's pacing  is completely superfluous. There are also glaring flaws in the film's story  internal logic.But what makes this otherwise mediocre thriller rate as passable for me is the fact that Charles Bronson who is somewhat an underrated actor to me gives a good performance even though he only has one facial expression in that granite slab that passes for his face  even has a little fun constantly thwarting the bad guys' plans. The scene where Bronson  future wife Jill Ireland  a doctor they abducted to treat James Mason's wounded villain are speeding to evade the police while Mason  a traitor comrade exchange gunfire while Liv Ullmann  Yannick de Lulle attempt to escape is passably exciting. This is also probably the only film you'll ever find that has James Mason speaking in a Southern accent AND Jill Ireland playing a spaced out hippie. Not to mention that this is based on a story written by legendary Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson who also wrote I Am Legend. Not as well known as some of Bronson's other films but if you track this down it should make for interesting viewing.".

Conveniently or coincidentally or however you want to look at after watching Once Upon a Time in the West not too long back I decided it was time to explore some of actioneer Charles Bronson's other roles good  bad... so...BANG...here we have it. A 2for1 deal. Throw in director Terence Young who directed three of the earliest and at least 2 of the best bond films and an above average musical score for this kind of film Michel Magne and you've got yourself a night! Well...kinda. The directing acting and writing are all quite average at very best and surprisingly there's not even really as much actionviolence as one may expect. It's all quite tame really. Poor Liv too. Whoever wrote this screenplay must really hate women. 90 of the dialogue between Charles Bronson and Liv was him coldly barking orders at her and then following up with things like Don't You ever do what you're told?! Haha. Kind of surreal but a different kind of surreal than say Bergman surreal... Anyway probably for Charles Bronson Liv Ullmann or Terence Young completists only. Enjoy!".

At some frames you could clearly see that the car went off but in next frame it entered the corner under the perfect angle again. And the chase was fun to watch and I believe it was fun to the crew also. Especially for the driver.Though the rest of the movie wasn't much special it was still fun to watch. It gives lot of unintentional laughs also. Although big name cast legendary Charles Bronson who probably made pushups before every scene Liv Ullmann and James Mason who was in this movie only because he was very good friend with Terence Young the acting was average but not the worst I have seen. The story was quite trivial exsoldier whose past catches him and sets his family into danger. And I loved that breathtaking landscapes of SouthFrance were all the action took place.

He has a hidden past and it catches up to him in the person of a handful of thuggish goons led by James Mason with a mangled Southern accent. There's not really that much action and the suspense isn't too suspenseful But you have to hand it to Bronson. I mean look at the guy. A Lithuanian coal miner from Pennsylvania who leveraged his exotic face and sinewy muscles into stardom of a sort. In House of Wax 1954 with a crew cut he was a mute sculptor in a minor villainous role. Then step by step he built up his career into that of an action movie star more popular in Europe than America. With that gotohell bandido mustache he turned into an international icon without ever making a respectable movie. Partly I think it must have been his muscles. He wasn't a bulging body builder like Arnold Schwarzenegger but he had what people of that ilk call definition. The very veins of his arms stood out like logs and his pectorals were like the bronze breast plates of ancient Rome. And that face! If you shook his family tree a Kahlkha Mongol might fall out of it. I've always enjoyed Mr. Majestyk because Bronson was an Elmore Leonard kind of guy. He was just a farmer growing watermelons not much smarter or braver than anyone else. Just enough to come off the winner.In Cold Sweat he breaks heads and necks with his bare hands. He's supposed to be the best driver around but there's little evidence of it because in the requisite car chase along the twisting roads of the Alps Maritime his car is all over the pavement jerking this way and that and he fails to cut curves on the inside of the arc.The goons are simply goons waiting to die. None is really distinguishable from any of the others in their villainy except for James Mason as the Southerner wearing a lavender sailor's cap with the brim turned down around his ears. How he ever got into this piece of junk he's no longer in a position to reveal.It's 1970 here the end of an era and Jill Ireland Bronson's wife shows up as a hippie with a headband a guitar and a  what did they call them again?  yes a reefer.

Charles Bronson fans will like his performance as Link a thief who's forced to team up with Toshiro Mifune's character Kurodaa Samurai who has 7 days to get back a sword stolen while traveling to the US capital in 1870around that time the sword was to be a gift to the prez.Toshiro's performace was great simply great. Fans will like this. It is very odd to hear him speak english...especially when he never really learned it in the first place! There's many great little bits in the movie like when Link is trying to escape from Kuroda...he just can't get away from him.  They way Kuroda begins to really relax in the saloon cracks me up..he's usually stiff and mean looking..well not that mean looking. I voted a 10 for this....".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1800's Arizona. Two desperadoes Link and Gauche with the help of some professional bandits and Mexican outlaws rob a train which was carrying gold guarded by union soldiers but also on board is the Japanese ambassador who is heading to Washington D.C. In the process Gauche takes their sacred gold sword which is a gift from their Emperor to the U.S. president. Also Gauche backstabs Link by attempting to kill him so he keeps the cash for himself. Unknowingly to Gauche Link survives. The ambassador's bodyguard Kuroda plans to get that sword back and kill him straight away for honour but Link needs him alive so he can find out where he hid the stolen loot. The two unwillingly pair up with the same goal but Kuroda has only got seven days to do so or he and Link will die by his sword.Terrance Young's multinational Spain Italy and France production of Red Sun is a boldly unusual western in the shape of the odd couple west meets east set on the oldwestern frontier which has a nicely balanced out comic vein and stupendous lead performances. You could call it an experiment and it's an interesting blend even though the story seems familiar it does keep to its strengths and never wanders off onto pointless subplots. What goes on is elaborately important to the story. A snappily eventful script comes through with the witty humour being drawn upon the pair's bumpy relationship involving their differences and actions. Charles Bronson is at his charismatic best with a lively turn as the rascally equipped gunfighter Link and the legendary Toshiro Mifune authentically emits classy grace with ace determination and stubbornness as samurai bodyguard Kuroda. They excel together and make a real good pairing. This is what sells the film from the getgo. Alain Delon makes for an formidable villain figure as the deviously suave Gauche and beautiful bombshell Ursula Andress who offers a brief topless scene is terrifically dynamic as Gauche's robust firebrand girlfriend Cristina. Anthnoy Dawson and the wonderful Capucine also show up in minor parts. Young's direction can stumble in some shapeless touches but mainly he keeps a busy pace and engineers some excitingly biting passages of raw action like the suspenseful dying half with a bit of splatter on show. Editing is smoothly tailored. Maurice Jarre's uncannily saucy music score is less than grand but atmospheric enough to the period. Henri Alekan's spaciously scenic cinematography is kind of lost on the small screen and in full frame. This is sad as the picturesque locations are important to the feel of certain scenes. An assiduously engrossing display of swords and guns which is far from a masterpiece but chiefly entertains and makes suitable use of a flavoured international cast.".

In Red Sun the dream for many a kid came true samurais going head to head with cowboys and Indians.The concept of mixing Eastern culture and especially martial arts with the archaic Wild West has been often tried sometimes with success but more often with complete failure Jackie Chan escapades numerous SpaghettiWesternKungFucrossovers and the Kung Fu TVseries which was a technical and aesthetic failure even though the audience loved it. This had little to do with the incompatibility between east and west but rather lacking directors who could handle both genres with equal dignity.The story is rather plain and simple Bronson and Delon plan to rob a train that happens to carry the imperial Japanese ambassador. The heist goes fine but fieryeyed Delon remember he is French and lefthanded betrays his partner leaving him at the mercy of the Japanese entourage  but not before stealing a Samurai sword that was meant as a present for the USpresident. The ambassador makes Bronson a deal he cannot refuse bring back the sword within a week or loose your head. To insure that Bronson is doing his job the disgraced swordkeeper Mifume is sent along likewise obliged to commit 'harakiri' when the seven day span is over. Both men form an uneasy camaraderie one driven by obligation the other from thirst for revenge and each perceiving the others culture as plain alien.It would be very hard to duplicate this 'innocent' clash of the culturesscenario today too many similarities too many crosscultural interchanges have occurred. Today a kid from Japan would be no more alien to the image of an American cowboy than your average businessman would be to the concept of eating raw fish with rice namely sushi which they eat anyway during lunchbreak. Back in the early 70's those images tended to be way more exotic to the averageJoe. Back then we could believe Mifumes wideeyed look of disbelieve at 'culture' of the Wild West as well as Bronsons inability to comprehend his 'partners' culture. Needless to say this leads to manya comic relief and once the colts and katanas are pulled plenty of action.Mifune and Bronson are simply veterans at what they do so is Ursulla Andress by the way namely dressing undressing and throwing tantrums. They really don't need much dialogue to bring their sentiments and thoughts across  each confused and by degree disgusted by the others culture and behaviour. No matter how you look at it the chemistry works and is believable. Throw in Alain Delon doing what Delon can do best  namely look chiseled like a roman statue and throw glares that could cut through ice  you've got the perfect cocktail of experienced acting and charisma.Terence Young made this happen by applying the same he did to the first two James Bond films make a serious movie but don't take the movie too serious. The result was a comicbook Western that owed more to the EuroWestern of the 60's perhaps even a bit more to the German Schnitzel rather than the ItaloSpaghetti Westerns than it did to John Wayne or Bonanza.Granted this is not a cinematographic masterpiece this isn't Sergio Leone nor is it Eastwoods The Unforgiven. This would be comparing Dr. No to the ultrarealistic violence of Casino Royal. Neither films need to be taken serious but should rather be enjoyed. This isn't Dance with the Wolves this is about a bandit and a samurai on a mission to retrieve the emperors sword on the way slugging it out with bandits and Indians. Throw in the as usually excellent soundtrack by Maurice Jarre and what you get is the perfect blend between EuroWestern and Samurai Adventure. 810".

No matter how you look at it the chemistry works and is believable. Throw in Alain Delon doing what Delon can do best  namely look chiseled like a roman statue and throw glares that could cut through ice  you've got the perfect cocktail of experienced acting and charisma.Terence Young made this happen by applying the same he did to the first two James Bond films make a serious movie but don't take the movie too serious. The result was a comicbook Western that owed more to the EuroWestern of the 60's perhaps even a bit more to the German Schnitzel rather than the ItaloSpaghetti Westerns than it did to John Wayne or Bonanza.Granted this is not a cinematographic masterpiece this isn't Sergio Leone nor is it Eastwoods The Unforgiven. This would be comparing Dr. No to the ultrarealistic violence of Casino Royal. Neither films need to be taken serious but should rather be enjoyed. This isn't Dance with the Wolves this is about a bandit and a samurai on a mission to retrieve the emperors sword on the way slugging it out with bandits and Indians. Throw in the as usually excellent soundtrack by Maurice Jarre and what you get is the perfect blend between EuroWestern and Samurai Adventure. 810";

Given that fact and Leonard Maltin's unpromising  rating I had suspected that it was going to be a big disappointment when I eventually catch up with it  but happily it turned out not to be the case. It is actually a very enjoyable largescale action film which while perhaps lacking the touch of greatness deserves to be reevaluated more positively.The four international leads  Charles Bronson Toshiro Mifune Alain Delon Ursula Andress  are topnotch and the supporting cast also includes Capucine Anthony Dawson and Luc here billed as Luke Merenda. The chemistry between betrayed outlaw Bronson and samurai warrior Mifune is especially successful and provides the film with some nice humorous touches as well as a couple of good lines their casting is all the more interesting for its pairing one of THE SEVEN SAMURAI 1954 with a member of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN 1960 that film's equally popular Americanization! Delon has a smaller part than I was expecting but he does well as Bronson's doublecrossing partnerincrime who apart from the prerequisite European sophistication has a vicious streak about him. Andress adds the required eyecandy as his sluttish girlfriend and along with Monica Randall playing Mifune's inexperienced one night stand at Capucine's rundown brothel provides the film with some unexpected  if very welcome  dashes of nudity.Besides there's a fine if subdued score from Maurice Jarre as befits the film's title too renowned cinematographer Henri Alekan often bathes the scenery in a warm golden hue and the use of remote locations throughout is inspired. Still the film could probably do with a few trims here and there as some scenes tend to go on too long  such as the aforementioned midsection revolving around Bronson and Mifune and the climactic Indian attack. The fullframe presentation is not too bad considering I can only complain of excessive headroom on occasion and a general washedout look to the print on the U.K. disc I watched.".

The director Terence Young may have made three successful Bond movies but the rest of his career was littered with mediocreorworse films like The Christmas Tree The Klansman Inchon and The Jigsaw Man. This is another example of Young underachieving as a filmmaker. In 1870 a locomtive makes its way through the Wild West. Aboard is a small band of Japanese travellers heading for Washington with a valuable sword which they are to present to the President as a gift from the Emperor of Japan. An outlaw Link Charles Bronson and his gang storm the train and steal various valuables including the aforementioned blade. However one of Link's accomplices Gauche Alain Delon steals the loot for himself almost killing Link in the process. A samurai warrior Kuroda Toshiro Mifune sets out to retrieve the sword. Link joins him hoping that he can catch up with his double crossing partner and exact his revenge... The film is a real mongrel of a movie. Backed by French Italian and Spanish financers directed by a Brit and starring American Japanese and Swiss leading actors it is hardly surprising that it seems to draw its inspiration from a muddled patchwork of influences. For a while the unusual plot threatens to develop into something really interesting. The fusion of western conventions and samurai movie conventions is initially intriguing too. However pretty quickly the whole thing slips into overly familiar cliches and it is barely helped by somewhat tedious pacing and supporting actors with such heavy accents that it is hard to tell what they are saying much of the time. Red Sun could have been  perhaps should have been  a good movie but what it emerges as is unfortunately rather a waste of a good idea.".

I guess teaming up is the right word even though Mifune has actually sworn to kill Bronson if he doesn't work with him.  So most of the movie is Bronson trying to escape Mifune's character.  Of course the 2 men eventually bond and find out they are much more alike than they initially thought and end up fighting alongside each other in the film's wonderful climax.Charles Bronson shows a good sense of humor in this film an element lacking from most of his other films.  Toshiro Mifune who is simply one of the world's greatest actors is not required to do much but I enjoyed seeing him teamed up with Bronson.

Bronson and Mifune go to a bordello run by Capucine to get Ursula Andress a hooker favored by Delon as a hostage.Red Sun works nicely as a film because of the interesting if antagonistic chemistry between Bronson and Mifune. From an uneasy alliance they develop a genuine regard for each other. As for Delon he has a gentlemanly demeanor that's a very thin veneer for one of the meanest mean streaks ever on the big screen.Fans who are younger will recognize the plot of Red Sun being later used in a modern day feature Renegades with Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips as the uneasy allies with Rob Knepper as the gang leader with a mean streak.I'm not really big on foreign made westerns but I make an exception in the case of Red Sun.".

To see Toshiro Mifune from 'The Seven Samurai' and Charles Bronson from 'The Magnificent Seven' riding side by side as if they were in some kind of movie time warp is quite entertaining and the eastwest contrast is done well. They both play against each other nicely with humour and feeling.Apart from Mifune and Bronson there is good support from Ursula Andress Capucine and in a minor role the always welcome Anthony Dawson. Alain Delon is good as the main villain too but isn't in it enough. Mifune steals the film even when he isn't saying anything. He lifts the film whenever he is on screen.Praise also must go to the music score by Maurice Jarre particularly in the action sequences and Henri Alekan's cinematography of the landscape is beautiful and adds greatly to the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1972 and directed by Terence Young Red Sun is a Western starring Charles Bronson as a train robber who teams up with a samurai Toshir Mifune to get Gauche Delon the moralless killer who wronged them both. Ursula Andress and Capucine are also on hand. Red Sun combines a gritty realistic tone with comic booky flavor typical of Spaghetti Westerns but the filmmaking is just overall more professional and effective than most ItaloWesterns. The movie flows well increasing momentum for the kinetic final act which contains some pictorially dramatic scenes. I was surprised by how good Red Sun is. All the main cast members fit their characters superbly with Delon standing out as the handsome villain dripping with evil. Ursula who doesn't appear until the midway point is even more stunning than usual. The relationship of Link Bronson and Kuroda Mifune is amusing and interesting as it develops. Furthermore the locationssets are notable especially the cane field in the final act. Despite all these good things there's the obvious problem that Gauche is a murderous weasel right out of the gate so why are we supposed to root for his accomplice Link? The answer is that this is a story of redemption. Yes Link is obviously a greedy criminal at the beginning but he's otherwise likable and seems to have some kind of sense of honor underneath his gruffness which is palpably contrasted by Gauche. SPOILER ALERT As the story unfolds Link's association with Kuroda slowly and positively affects him to the point that he's no longer a lucreobsessed scumbag by the climax Disarmed by Link at the end Gauche tries appealing to Link's greed but Link decides that the dying samurai's honor is more important to him than learning the allimportant location of the stolen money so he executes Gauche. Just before Kuroda expires Link promises him that he will return the priceless katana to the Japanese ambassador thus preserving Kuroda's honor. Give Link some credit He coulda made a small fortune off the sword which would make up for the loss of the stolen loot but he gave it back to the proper owner instead which testifies to a vastly changed man. END SPOILER The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in Spain. GRADE Borderline BA".

Talk about a strange conglomeration of actors!When the film begins the first Japanese ambassador to the United States is on a train heading through the west towards Washington DC. However a gang of bloody bandits hold up the train and kill a lot of folks...and steal the gift from the Emperor to the President. The ambassador is determined to get this back and sends one of his samurai Mifune to recapture the sword that was stolen by Gauche Delon. It also happens that Gauche which oddly means 'left' in French just tried to murder his partner Bronson and so the Samurai and the angry crook decide to work together to get their revenge on Gauche. But not surprisingly the partnership is a rocky one...and the pair have to eventually learn to work together in order to get what they want. This process makes up the bulk of the film.While the mismatched theme is very familiar the situation is at the very least hard to believe and a bit contrived! You simply have to ignore this and watch the film and enjoy it for what it is an escapist action film. The Comanches in the film by the way fight like idiotscharging up to be bumped off one after the other! Not especially good or bad...just competently made and worth your time overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "We have a reluctant buddy relationship between a Japanese Samaria Kuroda and an American desperado LinkCharles Bronsonwhich is the focus of most of the screen play. We have another reluctant buddy relationship between Link and his sometimes outlaw partner and sometimes enemy Gauche. The latter 2 are partners in a train holdup involving other gang members. But during the last part of the robbery Link is left for dead after dynamite is thrown into the car where he is. However a group of Japanese including the new Japanese ambassador to the US revive him and he miraculously escapes with little permanent damage. The ambassador demands that Link and Kuroda team up and catch Gauche retrieving the gold ceremonial sword that was meant as a gift to President Grant and killing Gauche who killed the other Japanese guard.. Initially Link refuses especially because they are out in the middle of nowhere without horses. But eventually the ambassador imposes his will on Link. The 2 set out on foot across rocky desert with somewhat different agendas against Gauche. Kuroda wants to kill Gauche immediately whereas Link wants to take time to try to get Gauche to tell where he hid most of the considerable loot from the train before killing him. The 2 periodically argue about this difference threating to leave the other or fight. Toward the end of the film Link and Gauche temporarily team up again to fight against a Comanche war party....Sometimes mixed in with these doings is Ursula Audress as Christine. She is Gauche's woman and a participant of a bawdy house. She is kidnapped by Link and Kuroda who hope she will aid in the capture and perhaps interrogation of Gauche. She tries to escape a time or two getting mixed up with raiding Comanche whom she mistook at a distance as Gauche's gang....Lots of dead bodies pile up during the course of the film especially those of the US troops guarding the train the outlaw gang and the Comanche. Sometimes Gauche or Link rapid fire their pistol like a machinegun implausibly mowing down a half dozen. The screenplay has some other plausibility issues as well.... Toshino Mifuni does an excellent job in his critical role as Kuroda. At one point he has a contest with Link over stick vs. sword as a closerange weapon. Also Link challenges him to a wrestling match believing he will win. Kuroda even apparently kills a bothersome mosquito with a swipe of his sword.....The screenplay keeps your attention throughout so I can recommend this film for those who are not put off by a high body count. See it on YouTube.".

	schema:reviewBody "My reaction to Domino is about as mixed as the mixed race flowchart that Mo'Nique presents on The Jerry Springer Show during the movie I know that doesn't make much sense unless you've seen the movie. I dare you to not laugh once she starts introducing terms such as Blacktino Chinegro and Japanic. I suppose if you suck at the teat of political correctness then you might not get the joke but otherwise it's one of the funnier scenes in the movie the running 90210 joke being the funniest. At this point you're probably wondering what in the world Mo'Nique Jerry Springer mixed flow charts and 90210 have to do with a movie about bounty hunters. It's a legit question. All I can say is welcome to the unconventionalism that is Domino.I didn't mind the fact that this isn't very conventional but at times it does feel a little convoluted. By the end of the movie I was pretty clear regarding what was going on unlike the 'tard in front of me who couldn't decipher the concept of flashbacks but the script does feel unnecessarily complex. Yeah the movie kept my interest and is fairly entertaining but it was just begging for tighter editing. Trimming about 20 minutes would've made the story stronger and the narrative more fluent. My guess is that Scott was experimenting and just couldn't bear to get rid of anything Tom Waits' cameo especially felt unnecessary.Tony Scott's made a movie that appears to be something he and his friends could most enjoy while under the influence of substances of a dubious nature. I can deal with the frantic pacing the quick camera cuts and the strange coloring but is it really necessary to show characters saying the same line multiple times from different angles? Sometimes it's all just a little too weird for the sake of being weird.One of my biggest complaints is that we mainly know that Domino is a bounty hunter because she tells us about 24 times in her narration which starts to grate on the nerves after a while. I would've preferred to see a little more focus on you know her actual bounty hunting. SHOW us why she was a really good bounty hunter don't just tell us over and over. I was expecting some really cool scenes with Mickey Rourke and Keira hunting down their bounty showcasing the technical side of the hunt and wrapping it all up with cool toughguy and girl bounty hunter stuff. Maybe a little sniping here a vicious beat down there. Sadly it never came.Do I remind everybody that I'm a reviewer by pointing out in every single review that I'm Johnny Betts. I'm a movie reviewer? No I do my job and show you what it is that makes me a movie reviewer! By writing crappy reviews Johnny? Uh well I guess we all get mixed reactions sometimes.".

Knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. She punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it but she isn't the least bit real and Knightly isn't the least bit convincing either.The film is boring. It's loud too and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor rerun of Scott's True Romance climax with Domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are  surprise! surprise!  destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino.Unfortunately this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses. Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman always solid is underutilized.Don't be fooled by this film's multilayered gimmickridden surface.

I could tell you that Domino Harvey Keire Knightley once a model has turned into a bounty hunter under the leadership of Ed Mosbey Mickey Rourke. Also part of their team is Choco Edgar Ramirez who looks like a Latino version of Val Kilmer. The movie also involves mafia stolen money a man with an arm detached from his body Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green from 'Beverly Hills 90210' as themselves sisters named Lashandra and Lashindra and a Jerry Springersequence that could have been a comedy short on its own.I liked all of it for multiple reasons its energy being one of them. The movie feels like one long music video even more than films like 'Trainspotting' 'Go' and 'The Rules of Attraction' funny how they all deal with drugs in one way or another but it never becomes exhausting. It is one of those films where style over substance succeeds maybe not in great way but simply in a way. I also liked it for the actors. Keira Knightley is convincing as a tough girl even more admirable after just seeing her as a naughty but delicate girl in 'Pride  Prejudice'. Mickey Rourke is back with extraordinary performance in films such as 'Spun' 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' 'Sin City' and now 'Domino'. Not only them but also Ramirez Delroy Lindo Tom Waits and especially Christopher Walken as the producer of a reality show the team is doing give the movie something extra to enjoy.

If I have to choose between loving it and hating it I'd say I love it. It was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos.This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken's TV production company what is Christopher Walken doing in every film by the way?. I guess that is a clever film technique because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTVReality Show editing footage as he likes. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point.It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapidfire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess but it's a rather enjoyable mess. It is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works. I give it a weak 710 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who graded this film  but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "My flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it together.The first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy postMTV texture. Fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves  for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another Snatch for the moment....When the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one overdosed amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary Domino's lesbian come on on Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short NO this is NOT a movie about Domino's character.Then i thought it's probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another Uturn of the plot.This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese AfroAmerican woman who fakes driver's licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh well nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300000.Then at some point you start to think Oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things. There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.Plus there are numerous other subplots the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan the love story between Domino and Chocco the mescaline episode the FBI surveillance operation...Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie? Judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear  it is a veritable mess!".

	onyx:emotionText "My flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it together.The first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy postMTV texture. Fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves  for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another Snatch for the moment....When the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one overdosed amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary Domino's lesbian come on on Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short NO this is NOT a movie about Domino's character.Then i thought it's probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another Uturn of the plot.This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese AfroAmerican woman who fakes driver's licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh well nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300000.Then at some point you start to think Oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things. There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.Plus there are numerous other subplots the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan the love story between Domino and Chocco the mescaline episode the FBI surveillance operation...Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie?

I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino.Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know or care. I don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I didn't care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked didn't make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was trite and shallow. The editing was horrible. I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There's a place for it. Good examples of choppy MTV style colorful editing not sure if there's an official name would be Fight Club just off the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts. It was used tastefully and wasn't used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back.I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment. Frankly I hate it.".

	schema:reviewBody " Domino  has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and  sickening  photography. It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of  style over substance I couldn't disagree more. I believe that  Domino  represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's filmmaking career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as Crimson Tide Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutchedangle framing. This was then carried through to  Enemy Of The State and Spy Game which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively.  Man On Fire was an extreme departure  a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in  DominoCouched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation  Domino presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do in fragments flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have  traces of mescaline in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer HarryGregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the 90210 culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in  Domino is in the surface and the surface is everything. I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work".

	schema:reviewBody "Domino opens up with the title character being interrogated and through the voiceover narration she informs us This is the part where I tell them to go to hell  that I'm not talking until my lawyer arrives. And two seconds later she tells the interrogating officer I'll tell you everything. This sets the tone and rhythm for the rest of the movie and lets us know the narrative isn't afraid to contradict itself. Soon we jump to the setup of the film's ending then we jump back to the beginning of Domino's story and then we jump to an important plot point that won't come into play until twenty minutes later. Literalists and traditionalists please stop watching the film immediately. So in the spirit of the film I'll come back to this point in a little bit and probably say something completely different. If you're with me you'll understand. If not get lost.Regarding the style I never thought I'd see the day when I'd like a movie with a music video meets reality TV vibe. I've hated  no scratch that  I've loathed films that would merely flirt with the idea. I've stopped caring entirely about plotcharacters and any redeeming values because the style has driven me up a wall in those other films. Here though Tony Scott doesn't think twice about embracing it and at first it didn't sit well with me as I remembered all the failures that came before Domino. But then something happened . . .Mel Brooks in describing his overboard ideas of comedy once said What's the point of going all the way to the bell without ringing it? Let's ring the damn bell. Maybe my problem with this MTVRealityseries style of filmmaking has been the fact that every other filmmaker was content to go part way  to just flirt with the idea  but here at last Tony Scott rings the bell.And holy crap! When I started to listen it actually sounds good! Real freakin' good.Perhaps another reason why it works in this film is because Tony Scott understands the potency behind each of a film's individual elements. And he's not content to let the music editing on screen performance Kiera Knightley's voiceover and onscreen text tell their small part of the story and work together as a whole Domino uses each of its given elements to simultaneously tell their own version of the tale from beginning to end in its entirety. It's a fullon frontal assault of the senses and gives the viewer the feeling five people are telling their own interpretation of the exact same story at the exact same time  talking over one another contradicting one another interrupting each other going back and correcting themselves.You've heard of Howard Hawk's overlapping dialogue? Tony Scott gives you overlapping cinematic narrative elements. The genius and the magic is that Tony Scott masterfully maintains comprehensible order through all this narrative chaos and somehow Tony Scott makes it all work.Also the film's stylization has another point behind  it serves as a reflection dare I say an alternate yet effective means of character development? for Domino Harvey her attitude and the world she lives in. This movie is not content simply telling us about the world it's a part of that world too and for two hours it wants to bring us there. Or to draw an analogy  you can listen to a book being read in a flat monotone or you can listen to it being read with different voices for each character and the narrator gets up and acts out the story too. Domino goes that extra distance.The plot? I'd be wasting my time if I tried. Domino Harvey is a former model turned bounty hunter. And the movie itself is an actionadventure thriller. You don't need to know anything more. The point of Domino isn't on the contents of the plot the point of Domino resides in the style in which that plot is told and it is told very effectively. Or in other words a summarization is nearly pointless. If you need to get the plot you're not going to get Domino at all.Domino is a style an attitude a perspective. It's a film willing to tell its audience to either come along for the ride or get lost. Based on a true story? Kiera's voice over says it If you want to know what really happened . . . get lost! note stated with significantly harsher language that IMDb doesn't want to accept in a review but you get the idea.".

The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as needs improvement is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack and although the soundtrack is quite fitting the opening is a little too long and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate heavy grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip. The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another artistic aspect to it also combined with the events that happen throughout the film this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand.

Tony Scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though. That is the one and only upside to this film. If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER!3".

There was a desire to be dominant and a need for everyone to realize that she was strong a true Leo. She seemed to be spending so much time having fun that she lost sight of herself destroyed herself. She became what she was running away from. Ironically Tony Scott spends so much time trying to shock us with lap dances and severed arms that we never get to know her which probably would have suited Domino just fine. Scott tells you at the beginning that this is a true story sort of and Domino states that she just wants to have fun. The movie gets lost between those two needs telling the truth and having fun two things that rarely go hand in hand. To me the most telling part is one of the details. When the Hollywood suit wants to make a star out of Domino they want to move Ed the guy who has done this for a living out of the center of the poster to put Domino there. They refuse because it's just not true. But look at the main page for the movie Domino and who is in the center. Like almost all of Tony Scott's work having fun is way more important than telling the truth. Sadly it ain't even that fun. Domino plays like some strange melding of Natural Born Killers Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and The Usual Suspects and all the fancy camera tricks in the world won't make that exciting.".

Contrary to some comments here there is a plot it's just not revealed linearly not every movie should be straight forward and have big global issues on its mind and I'm cool with that.DOMINO drips with style. The style is running off the screen it's so heavy. Definitely if you couldn't handle Man on Fire for this reason stay away from Domino it's Man on Fire x 2 for style and personally I loved MOF too. And the style that director Tony Scott has been working on and perfecting FOR THIS MOVIE fit the material perfectly. Not every movie can look and flow the same way and frankly as a filmmaker myself I totally support the director's vision here and his attempt to shakeup the mainstream bythebooks style a bit.You can't handle the style of Domino good go watch just about anything else available out there because 90 of it's gonna be an A to B type movie with lingering shots that you can feel comfortable in. Me though I can appreciate when something different comes out visually that fits in the world the filmmaker is creating. It's taking cinematic risks in the mainstream you gotta appreciate that! Keira Knightley does an amazing job here! The movie is on her shoulders she doesn't once seem like a weak little girlie from the getgo I believed in her character no questions asked. Personally I was already a fan now I'm totally hooked the Brit has talent  I hear too she may get an Oscar nod for Pride  Prejudice... Rourke continues his comeback streak nice job. Ramirez the cast's newcomer was entertaining as well and I enjoy the subtle moments of lust and torture bw him and Domino.Call me crazy but I had a blast with this movie! It was one of those movies you can actually call a ride and mean it. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not if you liked the remixstyle trailers you're gonna enjoy the movie.P.S.  the real Domino Harvey was on the set during some of the filming and apparently was happy with her translation to screen.

She and her two fellow hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez begin to become known for their exploits until finally a reality TV producer Christopher Walken decides to make a reality show about them. Unfortunately the bondsman is manipulating them into his own plot to rip off a nice chunk of change.According to the credits this is based on a true story. Sort of.Anyway however much of this story is actually true it's a pretty interesting one. The script is okay not great but not bad with some character development and neat ideas. A few moments are even kind of compelling.Unfortunately director Tony Scott manages to singlehandedly destroy the film. The style he used is absolutely awful. It involves nonstop fast cuts of largely blurry handheld shots that don't make very much sense. It also involves doing things like cutting to blackandwhite or 16mm or 8mm randomly for no apparent reason speeding things up slowing down repeating a frame repeating a line over and over again subtitling a few words of the line onto the screen like the audience is a bunch of morons and moving the camera forward backward sideways diagonally and sometimes even all four at once. I think. It was kind of hard to tell. It's hard to make out what exactly is going on at times but more importantly it's excruciatingly annoying. This throws you completely out of the movie and consequently makes it very very boring. It isn't quite painful on the eyes but that's about the best I can say for it. Never in the film are you involved or entertained and very often you want to just rip your hair out of your head to distract you from the extraordinary ineptness. It's like Oliver Stone and Michael Bay working together on one of their bad days both of them very high on meth or something. Now doing weird things like those mentioned above with some restraint can be very effective if it's used for a reason. Unfortunately the only reason Scott seems to have is to say Weeeee! Look at me! I have forty million dollars and a movie camera! Look at meeeee! And so the movie absolutely falls to pieces and just kind of lies there motionless occasionally jerking either to try to come back to life or maybe just having some nerves jump randomly like corpses sometimes do.However a few good things do emerge somewhat from the rubble.Knightly is absolutely brilliant. She completely captures the violent half sane half wildly crazy person she's portraying. She also gets the emotional damage across in a subtle believable way without getting melodramatic. This is some seriously good acting. She makes a great bounty hunter. Maybe I should hire her to take down Tony ScottMickey Rourke is awesome. This isn't quite the absolutely knockout he had as Marv in Sin City a few months ago but he's still about as tough and cool in a terrifyingly evil way as they get.And Christopher Walken does the Christopher Walken better than he has in quite a while. He isn't on screen for very long but man when he's there it's just great to watch him.Unfortunately those three can't quite pull the film up out of the bottom of the garbage heap. They do manage to save it from a ZERO STARS rating but Scott just screws this up so badly they can't save it any more than that. It's frustrated because he isn't a bad director  he did a good job with Top Gun Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State among others. So what exactly was he thinking?In the end there really isn't much reason for anyone to see this film. If you're in it for the action it's hard to tell what's happening and when you can figure it out it turns out it's not that well choreographed anyway. If you're in it for the strong sexual content you probably wouldn't make out anything worthwhile. If you're in it for the story you're screwed. If you can just catch a couple of nice sections with Knightly Rourke and Walken and then shut it off you'll get a little out of it. Otherwise shun this film and hope Scott gets his act together the next time he decides to make a movie. And that he doesn't manage waste three great performances on a piece of total junk.".

	schema:headline " True Hollywood Story Domino";
	schema:reviewBody "On the outside Domino looks like yet another example of Tony Scott flexing his artistic muscle through his trademark cinematic style. The director is known for his forays into adrenal disorienting surrealism the most recent example of this being 2004's Man on Fire. Scott has a flair for quickcuts whimsical superimposed titles and moody crossprocessing that if not apparent in his last feature is fully exposed in Domino. Some will say these techniques crowd out the story and distract from a plot that is complicated enough already. And that might've been true in another film. But critics have underestimated Scott.In Domino the true significance of the story rests within Scott's seemingly problematic electric visuals. The weight of Scott's storytelling in this film is immense but creatively camouflaged behind a sexedup facade. In reality the late Domino Harvey was and still is just as complicated  a riddle waiting to be solved. It makes sense then that any film portraying Harvey would follow suit. Domino is based sort of on Harvey's wild days as a Los Angeles bounty hunter. The film narrated by Domino Keira Knightley shows flashbacks of her life and offbeat career. Laurence Harvey Domino's movie star father dies and her mother decides to leave England for California taking her young daughter with her. In Los Angeles Domino grows up an outsider gets kicked out of schools and tries modeling but quickly tires of it. Finally the exmodel who says she's been practicing violence since age 12 decides to make a career out of bounty hunting.In due course the professionals Ed and Choco Mickey Roarke and Edgar Ramirez take a chance on the toughasnails rookie and soon the three become inseparable. They bust fugitives living life on the fringe until Domino's story reaches Hollywood TV execs who send cameras to trail her as part of an illadvised reality show named Bounty Squad.Naturally the bounty hunters' lives are later thrown into further chaos when a job gets botched by the conflicting agendas of their bail bondsman boss the FBI the mob and four anonymous crooks. The twists and turns lead to a dramatic denouement in Las Vegas  a bloodbath which takes place at the top of the Stratosphere Hotel amid the roar of circling FBI helicopters in true Tony Scott fashion.The film is unapologetically divergent from the truth many details are completely fictional. Despite these trespasses however Domino does what it is supposed to do it gets the most important things right  The facts are ultimately irrelevant because Harvey's distinctive spirit is represented.In the images flickering frenetically across the screen Scott succeeds in evoking the sense of a powerful yet fragile existence  one that is undoubtedly true to life. His stock double exposures and psychedelic colors aren't gratuitous here Scott uses them to convey the dangerous and transient nature of Harvey's life in a way that seems both hypersplashy and acutely insightful. It's not often that one can fulfill the commercial requisite at the same time as being attentive to character but Scott pulls it off.Domino states in the film as she also stated in life that she finds the Hollywood fishbowl the '90210' world abhorrent. So how does this mesh with the glittering fakery Scott displays? The answer is perfectly. Though Domino is highly exemplary of Tinseltown's bombastic commercialization this works in the film's favor because Domino is in many ways a deliberate swipe at the entertainment industry  a selfreflexive film masquerading as a popcorn action flick which satirizes LA's charlatans in a way Harvey probably would've greatly appreciated.During their introductions Ed lead bounty hunter asks Domino what her full name is to which she replies Just Domino. At the end of the film cast credits flash on screen sans identifying surnames. You don't have to be a genius to understand the meaning of this. We all know who Keira Knightley is from our tabloid magazines but Keira is an unknown just as Domino was a stranger to anyone who knew her famous father.By the end of Domino the only people who seem real are the bounty hunters. Though Domino and her crew are ruthless antisocial guntoters they are infinitely more likable than the nymphomaniac entertainment lawyers the nameless FBI agents and the smarmy television actors who populate the rest of the film. These are people who live far more nauseating existences. They are the people whose messes Domino cleans up.Keira Knightley excellently cast in the lead role simultaneously embodies Harvey's toughness along with the gravitas and quiet desolation of a woman who had designs on freedom but found herself still operating both inside the intrigues of a corrupt society as well as inside a prison of her own making  a drug addiction. This part of her life isn't fully explored in the film and many of her motivations are left a mystery communicated instead through some bizarre flourishes of 'Richard Kelly theology.' However Domino preserves Harvey's mysticism and in some ways this is the best form of memorialization. The fictional Domino taunts the audience with the line I'll never tell you what it all meant. It's possible that these words may have come directly from the lady herself.Copyright c 2005 by Lauren Simpson".

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Scott's adaptation of late bounty hunter Domino Harvey's life Domino is a film as LSD experiment. The camera never stops moving the plot never starts making much sense and the characters have rarely more than a whisper of personality or depth. That doesn't mean that Domino is without it's moments but what doesn't work more than outranks what does.Domino is one of the many films to tell it's tale in a convoluted flashback form. It begins essentially at the end and then backtracks to give us some idea who Domino Harvey Keira Knightley is. The daughter of film actor Laurence Harvey most famous for his role in The Manchurian Candidate she is abandoned to prep school by her mother Jacqueline Bisset after her father's death. She is then prodded to join a sorority in college where she promptly punches out one of her fellow sorority sisters leading to expulsion. Despising the Hollywood lifestyle she sees an ad for a bounty hunter seminar and decides to show up where she meets bail bondsman Claremont Williams Delroy Lindo and bounty hunters Ed Moseby Mickey Rourke and Choco Edgar Ramirez. She hooks up with them and proves to be useful becoming an official member of the team.When one of Claremont's mistresses' Monique granddaughter is diagnosed with a serious illness Claremont hatches a complicated scheme to obtain the money necessary involving a 10 million dollar armored car robbery mob connections and mistaken identity. Ed Choco and Domino are dispatched to reclaim the money accompanied by a reality TV crew trying to create a show based on their lives run by producer Mark Heiss Christopher Walken but things quickly turn messy for all of them.Domino is ostensibly supposed to be about the life of it's title character Domino Harvey but we are rarely allowed to get very deep into this character. Sure some details are revealed but that doesn't equal insight. Domino in this film is very much a sketchy rendering the details all missing. Her relationship with her mother is addressed but never explored. How she relates to her fellow bounty hunters is glimpsed briefly also and the film works best in those moments but this group doesn't really become characters we can be invested in. When the going gets rough there isn't enough development of these people for us to put much concern into them.On the plot front Domino is a difficult film to figure out. The screenplay from Richard Kelley makes it difficult to follow the various twists and turns. You are never really sure what is going on at times making it near impossible to become invested in the film's story. The combination of confusing plotting and nascent character development ends up leaving you with little to peak your interest.You can't really talk about Domino without addressing director Tony Scott's overexaggerated filming style. The film never stops doing something for more than a matter of seconds. Whether it is handheld filming postproduction massaging to effect color add jitter or editing that can reduce whole segments to almost subliminal images Domino always has something going on. This could be identified as a style but it's more like Tony Scott showing off. Domino has the feeling of a film school student playing with his first major film and throwing everything into mix to show how arty he is. It doesn't ruin the film but it doesn't really add anything much to it either and at times it is a distraction.Actingwise Domino has a solid cast. Knightley is good in the role of bad girl Rourke gives one of his best straight performances in years and Ramirez gets the job done. Walken is amusing to watch as always and Ian Ziering and Brian AustinGreen of Beverly Hills 90210 fame show up to poke some fun at their images playing themselves.In the end Domino adds up to not much. Lacking an involving plot interesting characters and a bit too much visual sophistication Domino is ends up with a role of snake eyes.".

They have come from around the world especially their youngest son Jesse Freddy Rodriguez who has just returned from Iraq after being wounded. Jesse's older sister Roxanna Vanessa Ferlito is a struggling actress who flew in from Los Angeles. The oldest son Mauricio John Leguizamo is a successful attorney married to Sarah Debra Messing a hedge fund manager who drove in from Manhattan. The children are surprised when their mother announces to them at the dinner table that she wants a divorce and their father doesn't even put up a fight. The entire family is put into an uproar and begins to question their future.My Comment This story is a slice of ethnic life focusing on the Puerto Rican community in west Chicago's Humboldt Park district with a predominantly Latino cast. A large part of the movie was filmed inside the house with everybody joking around arguing and reconnecting with each other. The storyline is exactly like any family saga but told with a different accent. The script is fairly predictable with no unexpected moments you know exactly what is coming next. As in all families when a real crisis happens the whole family comes together. There are several scenes that tend to be contrived. Overall this Christmas movie is entertaining and can be enjoyed by all and not only an ethnic audience. Overture Films Run Time 133 Rated PG13610".

I certainly didn't mind spending an hour and a half getting to know them. My only criticism was Debra Messing who never quite had a handle on who her character was at first seeming like an uptight bitch but then making a farfetched complete turnaround. I also thought that the subplot with Jay Rodriguez's character seeking revenge on the man who had murdered his brother was underwritten and overall not necessary for this story.But these are small bones to pick.

	schema:headline " A Charming Holiday Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The title gives the impression that this will be a clichd holiday flick that won't take long to be forgotten. However while Alfredo De Villa's 'Nothing Like The Holidays' may have a similar story outline to other Christmas holiday flicks but what makes this stand out is the humour the wonderful ensemble cast and the richness of the Puerto Rican culture. They story though familiar has heart. Movies like 'The Family Stone' come to mind but 'Nothing Like The Holidays' stays true to its story and characters unlike the aforementioned example. I liked that it did not have a fairytale ending.What's also impressive is that that character and situations in the movie are easy to relate to and recognizable. The family Rodriguez very much felt like a real family. Each family member and their friends Ozzy and Johnny carry their own burden but there is a strong bond of love and support that keeps them together. There are plenty of laughoutloud moments but 'Nothing Like The Holidays' can also be described as an interesting family drama and the themes such as sibling rivalry reconciliation and forgiveness are well handled. I enjoyed how the Puerto Rican culture was brought by the family. It felt very natural and authentic.Needless to say the entire cast has done nothing short of an excellent job. Initially it was a bit awkward to see John Leguizamo play Elizabeth Pea's son but after a few minutes of watching their interaction I managed to look past that and enjoy the characters. It was also good to finally see Debra Messing in a movie where she is given a role of substance instead of 'the sidekick friend' or 'cheating wife'. Alfred Molina brilliantly downplays his part. The romance between Ozzie and Roxanna played delightfully by Jay Hernandez and Vanessa Ferlito forms a nice little subplot. Melonie Diaz has a strong presence. Luis Guzman is the comic relief and Freddy Rodriguez is simply great. To sum it up the cast seemed to have superbly worked off each other and as a result they were really convincing as a likable but real family.In my opinion 'Nothing Like The Holidays' is much superior to most Christmas holiday flicks. A great movie to watched with loved ones and even though it feels familiar its charm humour treatment culture and heart make it worthy.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you can envision mixing Thomas Bezucha's The Family Stone 2005 with LinManuel Miranda's In the Heights still running on Broadway you will get a rough idea of what this 2008 family drama is all about. It's refreshing to see a holiday feature focused on the vibrancy of the Hispanic community and director Alfredo De Villa does an energetic job celebrating the ethnicity found in Chicago's Puerto Ricandominated Humboldt Park neighborhood. However he gets little help from the bythenumbers screenplay by Rick Najera and Alison Swan which is mired in clichs and stock characters. The story works strictly within predictable convention by using a Christmas family reunion as an excuse for melodramatic revelations and confrontations among its members.The plot elements are laid on thick. The Rodriguez family is headed by jovial bodega owner Edy whose recently secretive behavior has convinced his hottempered wife Emma that he is having an affair. She unceremoniously announces at the family dinner table that she wants to file for a divorce. Oldest son Mauricio has become a smug rather insufferable New Yorker and brings with him his highpowered wife Sarah an uptight gringo on the verge of managing her own 300 million hedge fund. Much to Emma's chagrin they have decided to put off having children to focus on their careers. Looking battleweary and acting disengaged younger son Jesse has just come home from a tour of duty in Iraq to find his exgirlfriend settled down with another man. Daughter Roxanna is a struggling actress in LA whom the neighborhood thinks is going to be the next big star. Her life gets complicated by a budding romance with exgang member Ozzy who is tormented by the shooting death of his brother. And as if it isn't obvious an old ugly tree in the Rodriguez front yard stands as a symbol of the family's solidarity.All the characters are sketched in broad strokes rather than developed with nuance so the film feels more suitable as a TBS TV show. Nonetheless the cast is likable and sometimes a bit more when given the chance. Alfred Molina SpiderMan 2 a Brit of SpanishItalian ancestry has mastered a diverse array of ethnic roles in his career and plays Edy with convincing Latino flavor. Elizabeth Pea Lone Star is a welcome sight as Emma. A surprisingly restrained John Leguizamo Moulin Rouge! plays Mauricio and an unsurprising Debra Messing Will and Grace plays to type as Sarah. Effective albeit limited work comes from Vanessa Ferlito Grindhouse as Roxana Jay Hernandez World Trade Center as Ozzy and Luis Guzmn providing comic relief as a jokester cousin obsessed with his hair. The film's best performance comes from Freddy Rodriguez Federico in Six Feet Under who realistically conveys Jesse's pain with a minimum of help from the trite script. Paul Oakenfold contributes the percolating soundtrack. The 200 DVD offers an entertaining commentary track from De Villa Rodriguez and producer Robert Teitel a 12minute featurette that reunites some of the cast members to discuss the making of the film the original theatrical trailer and the inescapable blooper reel.".

The 200 DVD offers an entertaining commentary track from De Villa Rodriguez and producer Robert Teitel a 12minute featurette that reunites some of the cast members to discuss the making of the film the original theatrical trailer and the inescapable blooper reel.";

Being a latino myself at first I was dubious that this theme would fly and devour creativity in a Holiday film. I mean all I would have to do is videotape my own family Holiday gatherings put the footage in a film editing machine and there you have it A latino Holiday flick. But I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the cinematic gift of Nothing Like The Holidays. Alfred Molina and Elizabeth Pena play Edy  Anna Rodriguez the paternal protagonists of the flick. Mr. ERod and Mrs. ARod not the one you're thinking reside in an area of Humboldt Park in west Chicago. They own a convenient grocery store. Freddy Rodriguez plays their military son Jesse who served in Iraq. John Leguizamo plays the eldest son Mauricio a successful New York executive married to a careerdriven gringa named Sarah portrayed by Debra Messing. And Vanessa Ferlito plays the saucy daughter Roxanna Rodriguez an amateur actress living in Tinsletown. It is the Holidays so the Rod Clan unites and shoot steroids. Oops wrong Rodriguez story Sorry ARod the one you are thinking. Anyways The Rodriguez do reunite for Christmas and as many latinos would tell you there is never a dull moment when that ritual happens. The Latin Holiday dinners are filled with lechon maduros jamon turrones plenty of alcohol but of course there are spices of vivaciousness neurosis dominance machismoism and egoism. And there is plenty of that in the Rodriguez clan and even leftovers for their close friends. Let's just say that Silent Night is not the Latino Christmas Theme Song. Eventual subplots of The Rodriguez Bunch are what create the plot line toys of Nothing Like The Holidays. But I will not scrooge it up and open that plot present and let you see for yourself. Director Alfredo De Villa developed an effective relational latino Christmas character village in helming the film. And Writers Greetings goes out to Screenwriters Alison Swan and Rick Najera for their entertaining and endearing screenplay. The acting ensemble of the film was not lacking with authentic thespian presence but Alfred Molina and Freddy Rodriguez performances were the ones in the acting wonderland department. However top acting nods here goes to Debra Messing for her grand performance you just don't mess with the Messing! I did also enjoy strong supporting work from Jay Rodriguez and the great Luis Guzman as friends of the family. To wrap it up Nothing Like The Holidays is something for the Holidays to make you smile!  Good".

Nothing Like the Holidays is the story of the typical Puerto Rican family living in Chicago. The snow is on the ground the holiday spirit is in the air and on a middle class street the Rodriguez family is cooking more than just arroz con pollo for Christmas dinner. The entire film is definitely an inside joke for that LatinAmerican community particularly the Puerto Rican community. Having a Puerto Rican background myself I couldn't help but notice that my mother and I were the only ones laughing out loud during the movie Keep in mind however we were the only Puerto Ricans in the theatre. The film lets the audience get a look at a Puerto Rican family without having to get to close to the real thing and is honestly a well put together dramaticcomedy. The film could have definitely been more then what it was I felt like the filmmakers started to get the juice out and stopped when they had enough to make a Mango Mojito. However the oneand a half ounces of rum were enough to keep you giggling. All in all the story line was acceptable the performances from everyone were enjoyable and the film was not afraid to tell an insider or two that will make the latinos laugh while their nonlatino company can't help but wonder why John Leguizamo's rambling about the Fried Pork y Chuletas sent of his house is in any way funny. An instant Latino classic and overall worth the price of admission.Jesse Alexander Ramos".

	schema:reviewBody "Christmas has become so commercialized no thanks to Santa Claus and the spirit of consumerism having to buy buy and buy some more to meet those pesky wishlists of friends and family. I guess there's this feel good feeling to this holiday because it's just at the edge of the new year and it's the spirit of sharing good tidings and to look forward to better things ahead in the new year. But I share similar sentiments with the head of the Puerto Rican Rodriguez household that it should be none other than a festival to have everyone get together.Edy Rodriguez Alfred Molina and wife Anna Elizabeth Pena look forward to Christmas because it's a time where family members far and wide and doing their own thing get to come back home to share in the festive spirit. This year's gathering is all the more special because son Jesse Freddy Rodriguez is permanently home from his tour of duty in Iraq. There's eldest son Mauricio John Leguizamo and his wife Sarah Debra Messing who are two accomplished corporate folks in New York and daughter Roxanna Vanessa Ferlito who's a Hollywood star in the waiting. Add friends such as Johnny Luis Guzman and Ozzy Jay Hernandez and you have one happening get together party right?Not quite as the veneer of what would be a joyous occasion get marred by everyone bringing their baggage to the table. Anna and Edy contemplate divorce Jesse gets flak for being the hero as well as being coopted to run the family provision shop business. He also continues to nurse an aching heart toward ex flame Marissa Melonie Diaz who has now moved on. Mauricio and Sarah's marriage get strained by her refusal to bear children because of an impending promotion which she doesn't want to jeopardize. Roxanna is nowhere near being a star still stuck at bit parts on television. Whew!While billed as a comedy it's not laugh a minute even though there were a couple of smart oneliners to tickle your funny bone. Instead it's quite a thoughtful drama to see how each character navigates through the sea of their own problems and whether they are able to come out tops. And everyone could identify with one or more of the characters especially in their attitudes toward family member being envious of the more successful sibling of favouritism of being at loggerheads of reconciliation and ultimately the notion of blood being thicker than water.Not all subplots get resolved amicably and reasonably which roots this film to a tinge of realism rather than opting for a feel good fairy taled styled finale where every loose end gets tied up with a smile. Which makes this film stand out amongst the crowd of feel good Christmas theme movies out there this season. It's quite a compelling drama to sit through despite some story threads being just a little bit bare but for the powerful ensemble cast pulling everything through as a convincing family unit you might want to invest some time on this film as well.".

I particularly enjoyed Jesse Freddy Rodriguez who has just returned home from serving overseas and John Leguizamo along with his executive fishout of water wife Debra Messing.

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing Like the Holidays is an extremely safe Christmas movie. That's not to say that it's not good because trust me it is. It's a film likely to win a lot of hearts with its focus on the one thing that everybody can relate to when it comes to the holidays their family. Nothing Like the Holidays could be considered an ethnic film. The cast is primarily made up of unknown Mexican actors although the familiar faces of John Leguizamo and Luis Guzmn do give the film some credibility. A lot of the jokes may be catered towards a Mexican audience where the family rituals relationships and inside jokes may be more fully realized and understood. Regardless I believe the film to be accessible to any audience willing to explore a Mexican take on the traditional Christmas movie. Nothing Like the Holidays starts like any typical Christmas film. All the different members of the family are coming home for the holidays. For the Rodriquez family though things are a bit different. They've got Jesse coming in from his most recent stint in Iraq as a member of the United States Army Mauricio the oldest brother making a name for himself in New York City and Roxanna the struggling L.A. actress who everyone in the family thinks is a millionaire movie star from her recent stint on a made for television movie.On top of the traditional family drama ex girlfriends in town for the holiday fights over when to have a baby and the arguments over who will take over the family business there's one other thing that seems to be tearing the Rodriquez family apart the dinner table announcement that Ma and Pa will be getting a divorce...and P.S. it's nonnegotiable. The reason I really liked this film is because it felt so real. The use of unknown actors helped me believe in the authenticity of what was happening on screen. The Rodriquez family is your typical Mexican family. The holiday is meant to be spent together and the kids will do anything to keep the family tradition alive. The inattic conversations on how to get mom and dad back together the oneonone advice sessions between a father and a son in the army and the intense subplot of a family member too scared to tell the family that he's sick all lead to the realness of this film. It may not be the most cheery Christmas movie but in real life the holidays are often everything but so it's nice to see an authentic portrayal of a real family and what they go through during the Christmas season.Nothing Like the Holidays isn't a wellknown film but I would recommend it as a solid entry into the overcrowded Christmas movie genre. It won't break ground but it will win your heart and what happens on screen is often funny but always real a characteristic that shouldn't be overlooked as you look for holiday films to rent this Christmas season.Michael Buffa Editor Popcorn Jury httpwww.popcornjury.com".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a DVD extra where most of the cast reminisce for a few minutes and they say it was one of the coldest winters in Chicago. Since the movie initially was released in November 2008 they must have been talking about the winter of 2007. I believe I was there but I don't remember. Two of my daughters live there and it was nice seeing a family drama filmed in Chicago.It is Christmas holidays and various family members from New York and Hollywood travel to Chicago to have Christmas with mom and dad who have been married for 36 years. Also coming home is the youngest son a soldier who was wounded in Iraq. There is a large banner Welcome Home Jesse over the family porch.But soon we see what might be described as family squabbles. Mom is disappointed that she has no grandchildren yet. Dad wants son to work with him and take over the family business a popular store that sells food and alcoholic beverages. The youngest daughter is called a star by everyone but she has only gotten bit parts in Hollywood. Her old friend a potential boyfriend has a grudge against a former felon who had killed his brother and ponders how he can get just revenge.The movie has a good mix of drama and comedy which mirrors real life when you get a group of adult children together as a family. Of course the best thing the movie has going for it are many of the best actors in the business and they make it feel real.

	onyx:emotionText "There is a DVD extra where most of the cast reminisce for a few minutes and they say it was one of the coldest winters in Chicago. Since the movie initially was released in November 2008 they must have been talking about the winter of 2007. I believe I was there but I don't remember. Two of my daughters live there and it was nice seeing a family drama filmed in Chicago.It is Christmas holidays and various family members from New York and Hollywood travel to Chicago to have Christmas with mom and dad who have been married for 36 years. Also coming home is the youngest son a soldier who was wounded in Iraq. There is a large banner Welcome Home Jesse over the family porch.But soon we see what might be described as family squabbles. Mom is disappointed that she has no grandchildren yet. Dad wants son to work with him and take over the family business a popular store that sells food and alcoholic beverages. The youngest daughter is called a star by everyone but she has only gotten bit parts in Hollywood. Her old friend a potential boyfriend has a grudge against a former felon who had killed his brother and ponders how he can get just revenge.The movie has a good mix of drama and comedy which mirrors real life when you get a group of adult children together as a family. Of course the best thing the movie has going for it are many of the best actors in the business and they make it feel real. You have to play loose with the real ages of the actors the mom and dad are not much older than some of the children. But it works.Good movie. Makes you care for the characters and it makes you think.";

But it's a plot line that's largely dropped.'To Die As a Man' 'Morrer Como Um Homem' a film from Portugal is a bizarre patchwork of scenes some of which resort to spins or whiteouts or extreme blue or red filters and it doesn't need to do all this because its account of a wouldbe transsexual who lives with a young drug addict and shelters her assassin son is quite bizarre enough. And ought to be interesting. And as the drag queen Tonia Fernando Santos is watchable. But the 138minute running time makes this quite another kind of drag. You could easily excise 30 or 40 minutes but the story line would still ramble too much.A drag queen who's getting too old and is asked to leave the show. Haven't we seen that before somewhere? That's Tonia. She has competition from a younger black performer Jenny Jenni La Rue. That sounds familiar too. The hesitating to get the sex change operation done. The young druggie lover done. The haughty exdrag star met by chance who struts her stuff reciting German poetry done.But despite the familiarity of themes there's life here. Drag queens are so cameraready. Rodrigues has a gift for odd or arresting moments like the switch blade snapping into a transparent shower curtain a chicken bone and a highheeled shoe dropped into the aquarium a man committing suicide on the beach seen only from behind. There is a welcome willingness to experiment and take risks. Despite the camera tricks being outthere campy the visuals are generally very nice. Only the director keeps killing things by stopping the action for a lengthy song or musical number or going off on some new tangent and losing the momentum. Or sinking into subject matter that seems too derivative.I lied the killer soldier theme isn't completely dropped. He lies waiting for Tonia in her house one night and turns out to be her longlost son Z Maria Chandra Malatitch. Tonia agrees to hide Z Maria who destroys her aquarium. But she's more interested in helping her young boyfriend Rosario Alexander David who's pretty convincing stay off drugs. And more than that she's interested in her little dog.One or two moments that have nothing to do with AIDS or Christianity or sexuality like the time when Tonia and Rosario wander in a woods and find wild forgetmenots seem more natural than anything else. It is possible to care about these people. And wish they were in a better movie.This will play well to the some specialized LGBT cinema audiences. Jason Anderson of Eye Weekly speaks of searing melodrama with great moments of formal audacity and says that Rodrigues' three features to date are throwbacks to a far more radical era for queer cinema and 'To Die Like a Man' is no less extraordinary than its predecessors.

	schema:reviewBody "A middleaged transvestite Tonia Fernando Santos who works as a prominent dragqueen diva in a Lisbon club finds herself losing her professional footing when a young black artist Jenny Jenni La Rue is quickly stealing her limelight. However this ultimately falls secondary to her more personal issues of a youthful boyfriend Rosario Alexander David who is a drug addict and her previously estranged son Z Maria Chandra Malatitch who deserted the army after killing his lover in a frenzied loss of control. Despite the selfdestructive tendencies of both her protges Tonia is never dissuaded to drop a lost cause even though Rosario persistently pawns her belongings and Z Maria remains overtly contemptuous for his parent.Joo Pedro Rodrigues starts off with a bang two soldiers in full camouflage engage into their carnal desires in the midst of a dense wood. Soon after they venture into a touch of voyeurism observing a homosexual couple in their house which in turn seems to trigger an intense rush of selfhate in one of the soldiers who shoots his lover comrade in arms. Portrayed with the use of some brave if not always successfully framed camerawork To Die Like a Man starts off strongly suggesting a power of themes to be harnessed. Soon after however focus shifts to Tonia who in herself is a delight to view but is pasted onto a jarring disfragmented story which at times seems more interested in capturing eerie odd shots then actually telling a story. Jumpy and unfocused the picture gives off a strikingly independent almost unprofessional vibe that at times is shaken off when Rodrigues actually succeeds in capturing a cinema moment.This is not helped by the often wooden support cast who at times drops off into pointless banter or ventures into singing in graveyards or reciting poetry the only moments when the movie decides to stay still and deliberate with a given scene. Plodding on within its odd self imposed chaos characters fail to resonate despite a solid performance by eyecatching Fernando Santos. The artistry involved does engage or something capture the imagination but framed withing a fickle story it simply drags the promise away letting the movie die with a whimper. Obviously a pretty divisive movie many viewers will find the audacity of some experiments profound and help gloss over the weaker spots but my interest waned after tiresome ongoings and never came back into focus.".

The other was Russian Ark an obviously brilliant film which I simply couldn't make any sense of because I knew nothing of Russian or art history. Rodriguez has a knack for conceiving arresting images the back of the DVD case has a few such stills but I found his sense of where to put the camera absolutely alien I kept on saying to myself I would never frame this shot that way. To my eyes and brain it had the look and rhythm of a student film.I know others have praised the performances but I found them flat nearly to the point of amateurishness. There's nothing to like about any of the characters in the first 45 minutes as far as I got and I ordinarily have no problem with that if the actors can communicate the inner pain that drives them to be so difficult I readily empathize see my review of Greenberg. If the actors just seem to be stating their lines that's another story.It's a shame because as the other reviewer notes there's a good film here waiting to get out. I could imagine watching the same narrative and being entranced if it were wellacted and shot by a director with talent oops I mean whose cinematic style resonated with me. I honestly can't say for certain that Rodriguez is barely competent behind the camera and with actors and has been given enormous slack by the critical community because of his subject matter. It's possible that his aesthetic is simply opposite mine. But I will note then when I watch Godard or Ozu whose styles don't mesh well with my brain I'm still aware that they're freakin' good they're just not to my taste.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading a few bad reviews of 'Dead Like Me Life After Death' I was prepared for something not very good. What I got was like watching a necrophiliac having his way with the corpse of that wonderful show. How Stephen Godchaux and John Masius both regular writers on the series could seemingly have so little connection to everything that made that series special is a deep mystery and I don't feel good slagging this off as I've enjoyed their work in the past.Where the series had been original lively funny poignant and quirky in the good way which is a rarity this thing is irritating boring not even remotely amusing and feels disrespectful and opportunistic. The threadbare plot involving a callow replacement for the sadly absent Rube performed with subtlety and wit in the series by Mandy Patinkin is a bust that never goes anywhere or even resolves itself. That Rube's substitute is a man who was killed in the World Trade Center on 911 is in particularly bad taste especially since it adds nothing to his character who is a miserable creep it's just a weird throwaway. The replacement of series original Laura Harris as Daisy Adair is also a major trouble spot. Sarah Wynter in a word is awful. Harris's Daisy was imbued with a knowing sadness under her surface superficiality. Wynter just devours the scenery playing Daisy as a vapid talentless idiot.It's nice that talented original cast members Ellen Muth Callum Blue Jasmine Guy et al got work but they deserved a better vehicle than this shoddy mawkish mess. If you are a fan of the Showtime series do yourself a favor and skip this. Once you've watched it you can't unwatch it and doing so will only make you mourn anew the premature death of the original. Which I suppose is apt.".

	onyx:emotionText "After reading a few bad reviews of 'Dead Like Me Life After Death' I was prepared for something not very good. What I got was like watching a necrophiliac having his way with the corpse of that wonderful show. How Stephen Godchaux and John Masius both regular writers on the series could seemingly have so little connection to everything that made that series special is a deep mystery and I don't feel good slagging this off as I've enjoyed their work in the past.Where the series had been original lively funny poignant and quirky in the good way which is a rarity this thing is irritating boring not even remotely amusing and feels disrespectful and opportunistic.

I am not gonna complain about George looking older Mason being a little chubby or any of the nit picking gripes most folks have for this movie. What I will complain about is how this film has a totally different feel than what fans of the series had came to love. The dark quirkiness of the series is gone and replaced by slick looking production and crappy camera angles. So now I will get down to business as to what was wrong with the key elements of the film. For starters Joy Lass has somehow went from being super bitch in the series to mother of the year. Happy Time doesn't even look like the same place.Although I was glad Murry had more screen time George has somehow been exhumed and laid to rest in another graveyard and gotten a larger headstone. Der Waffle House burns down in the second scene. The comic book crap with the voice overs. The product placement of the stupid phones that everyone got their reaps on. How Hudsons ETD changes and its never explained why. No answer as to how Betty Rebecca Gayhart was able to jump over the cliff and into the lights in season one. Every scene with Sarah Wynter and the way she ripped apart Daisy as a washed up talentless codependant actress and not the sly cunning woman we had grown to lovehate. They should have just said Daisy had gone to the lights with Rube and this dumb blond chick was someone new. No answers to what became of the relationship between Daisy and Mason. Too Much Roxy.. I felt that Jasmon Guys character was never that necessary in the series and only annoyed me. This movie gives ya lots of her.How so many scenes were spent retelling stuff already known such as how a reaper looks different. It was like watching the pilot episode all over again. The post its falling from the sky in the end had more cheese than Wisconsin. The only thing that I can say was good about the movie was George reveling herself to Reggie. We all wanted this to happen in the series and felt it was only a matter of time before it happened. I really wish that the series had lasted longer than it did. If you look at how the last episode ended with George walking by a sleeping Reggie and Joy at her grave and dropping candy only to have Reggie wake up and see George in the sunrise as George explains in the voiceover what its like to be Dead Like Me was a better wrap up for the series although not intended than what this movie was.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to even know where to begin! Firstly I have to repeat a common theme through all the posts I have read and that is DLM was still could be a fantastic show. The wry take on the irony of everyday life things we take for granted death just another one of those things the interactionhumour and frailty portrayed by the cast had me completely hooked.I think I made the mistake of watching the Two Seasons backtoback on DVD and then expected the film to be a finale giving closure to all those who were left in the wilderness when 'The Suits' decided to cancel the show.Well this is obviously what the suits decided it could have been' but to quote Dr. Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park Yeah but your scientists Suits were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should.Okay let the ranting begin apologies I will go off at Tangents but seriously if you spent time watching the series and followed 'The Rules' this film decides that the most fundamental rule set out in the Pilot episode doesn't matter! We don't decide who lives or dies we take the soul to save them suffering asper the young child in the trainwreck. If you leave the soul it will decay and become distorted and twisted and not the person that oncewas.The film then says Nah......doesn't matter! You have Roxy 'saving' a man from drowning and pushing his soul back into his body!!!!? She is one of the strongest personalities in the show abides by the rules apart from ripping a man's soul from his body in temper before putting it back and even moved into Law Enforcement so strong is her moral conduct. Yet here we have her breaking a fundamental rule?Okay I have read all the posts and see that Sarah Wynter takes a hammering for her portrayal of Daisy. Now I agree that she played Daisy Adair completely out of the character we had become to know. A character who's frailties and subtle cracks in the tough exterior were beginning to slowly ebb out and expose who she really was. A sad and lonely person who's years of reaping had left her emotionally damaged.This character played by Laura Harris was mesmerising and brilliantly acted. What I refuse to say though is that Sarah Wynter is at fault for completely closing all the doors on that subtlety and instead went back to the selfcentred version we saw in her first appearance.Now lets be honest Sarah is an Actor who is told by the Director how heshe wants the character to be seen there are also the writer's who gave the Director the duffest of scripts to work with I cannot blame Sarah for her portrayal just the idiots who decided that TwoSeasons of characterbuilding was not really what the viewers needed or wanted! Are they kidding. Laura Harris's acting and character building made the viewer sympathise with her. In onefellswoop they decided that Sarah would be merely a shadow almost a Graveling! of that dynamic set in motion through the brilliant scripts of the show.In the Laura version I am sure that when Daisy forgot the words on stage she would have broken down and ran from the stage. Her chance at fame atlast in her grasp snatched cruelly from her and sentencing her to more years of misery in a world she was yearning to depart?RubeRube whereforartthou Rube!? He got his Lights...ooooohhhhpleeeease!!!! What a copout! Lets be honest Rube was the man you just wanted to know what the heck was going on! His Authority when questioned often brought a perfect response of well you do that then lets see what happens attitude which made the viewer wonder just what powersoptions were available to him? Watching the 'Behindthescenes' feature he nailed perfectly what it was that made the SecondSeries for his character. He explained that each show just gave you a tiny piece of the jigsaw that expanded his character. The money in the undelivered envelope being terrible mistake the wanted poster alluding to a Bank Robbery his daughter being found as a Reaper arrived perfectly awaiting the line I Reap what you Sow it never was said as he met his daughter the day he died. Why did he need that money? Did he die the day of the robbery and manage to post the money just before his fate? Mason a character who was the joker in the pack but like Ying and Yang with the character of Daisy he felt a bond that almost became Brother and Sister especially brought home when she refused his offer of the ring. Mason was a cool character the naughty child who you just knew was going to oneday really make Rube show his colours while goading Roxy and Georgia again an almost perfect balance of humour and again frailty as you see him find the record showing Daisy's lastwords then realising that she really is the damaged goods mentioned above.I would write more but you get 1000 words.....give the film a miss...please!".

	schema:headline " Not as good as the show...but better than most movies  worth the time.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have waited a year  12 for this movie. So I was more than a bit excited to finally see it.I am happy to say it was good. I would LIKE to have given it 1010 but I don't think it was excellent. It certainly takes the shows aspects  uses them well. It does a lot of explaining at the start for newcomers so you can at least try to follow what was a 2 year TV program with some sense of logic.First let me pick at the things I didn't like. I was thrown off by Georgia Lass Ellen Muth having a new voice in the starting scenes which were done to a comic book styling  I personally did not really like...liked it even less when they used it again later in the program. Its like they were trying to fill film space.. But once the show started her more familiar raspy but not sounding like a 60 year smoker like in the opening credits voice seemed to come back. Also the idea that reapers never change appearance is hard to swallow when Georgia clearly looks older than 18 and Daisy has changed noticeably. The new boss Cameron Kane Henry Ian Cusack was annoying as hell he didn't catch on to me in any way  I quite admittedly was rooting for his departure the whole way thru. He cant replace Rube and it was one of the shows biggest flaws in trying to replace him. No more Der Waffle Haus this was a staple of the show  if they do more movies or bring the show back they have to recreate it. It was sorely missed. I didn't like the new Happy Time it looked too high end for HT. There is a scene where Delores Christna Willes  Georgia are interviewing someone with another coworker and its in a conference room that you would envision in fortune 500 companies instead of a temp agency. Daisy Adair Sarah Wynter...played by Laura Harris on the TV series was good but again like CameronRube you cant replace the original  in this case they literally tried to. Daisy suddenly has no southern accent  seemed to go back to the shallow Daisy of the first few episodes instead of the complex Daisy of the later episodes.Now what worked. The cast still were able to pull off their roles to perfection. Mason Callum Blue looked acted and sounded like Mason most of the time. His character showed no change  his idiotic incompetent slacker mentality was placed in perfectly when needed. Roxy Jasmine Guy was in fine form  showed even more attitude than she did on many episodes of the show...which is great since we are to believe she has this ass kicking attitude which only was shown a handful of times in the series here it was in almost every scene except where she meets the Police commissioner  oddly turns Daisy like for a minute. Georgia was still great. Her dry sarcastic tone was a little lighter in this but its still there. Her interaction with her sister was maybe too short hey 2 more scenes of that to build it up more would of been great instead of cartoon drawings wasting film. Her expression  words at the end of the episode were perfect as she is showered in a downfall of post it notes. It also gives the viewers overwhelming hope that if there is another movie or return of the show that a much needed return may happen. It was both wonderful and frustrating to me. Wonderful in the hint that there could be a return. Frustrating in the possible false hope or worse yet if there isn't anymore episodes no way to tie up that loose end. The supporting cast of Delores  Joy Cynthia Stevenson were quite good when they had screen time. Reggie Britt McKillip got more screen time than probably ever before  she ran with it well. She has grown up she has matured and she has developed a life. Of course she is still haunted by her sisters untimely death  when she is confronted with the possible death of someone else she is close to she is pulled back in after possibly just finally getting on with her life. I always liked Reggies character on the show and was glad they gave her a lot more screen time here. Her interactions with Joy  Georgia was terrific  really added to the movie IMO. I was disappointed how little screen time was given to Crystal Crystal Dahl as Happy Times mainstay receptionist and the fact there was no Kiffany at all. The movie opened up as many doors as it closes. Which is good for giving a new moviereturn of the show room to move but it is bad if there is no more as many questions are again unanswered.As an avid fan I was going in with high expectations  low hopes. I was demanding excellence since thats what the show always brought. But I was fearful it wouldn't meet up to that level  be a giant dud. I am pleased to say that it was good enough that it will make most DLM fans happy. Could it be better? Yes. Could it have been worse DEFINITELY.It was most certainly worth the 87 minutes I spent watching it thru the credits. Any DLM fan has to see it if for no reason than to go down memory lane  keep up to tabs if there is a resurrection of the show lets hope.Hopefully the execs at MGM are taking notice of the great reviews its getting everywhere  bring the show back.........with Rube  the original Daisy.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is one thing that could be said of the television series of Dead Like Me it's that it was made great by it's superb characters and a moving theme. Despite having a great premise the plot was never the strong point of the series sometimes undermined by inconsistencies and holes.Now in 2009 Dead Like Me Life After Death offers all of the same plot inconsistencies but with none of the excellent characters which made us fall in love with the original series. The characters in the film are extremely shallow and altogether unfaithful to their originals. Of the original team of reapers who made it to this film George Roxy Mason Daisy all but George are condensed in to a few clichs. In fact the presence of these characters only serves as a function of nostalgia as their contribution to the story has been mangled and broken beyond comprehension.The main story is told through George and Reggie whose paths become intertwined after Reggie's secret boyfriend is critically injured in a road accident. The heart of the story explores the relationship between the sisters as George's identity is uncovered and Reggie reveals her true feelings towards the boy. There is a subplot involving the other reapers and the shady new head reaper Cameron but it reads more like a collection of ideas and events than a cohesive story. After squeezing all of these ideas in to the short screen time you're left with a subplot which is underdeveloped inadequately explained and ultimately shallow. The Happy Time sections were as pointless as they were unnecessary highlighting a failed attempt to incorporate Delores' character in to an already disjoint storyline.The absence of Rube's character is tangible whilst watching the film. To make matters worse the beginning of the film draws attention to his absence only to abandon it a quarter of the way in. This only serves to emphasise his absence.George's character is a mostly faithful reproduction from the series. However a lack of character development diminishes her significance in the story. Despite being the main character I'm left with a feeling that George's only purpose in this story was to play the supporting role for her sister.Reggie's character has changed significantly from the original series. In fact one could be forgiven for mistaking the now 18 year old Britt McKillip as an entirely different actress. The once gawky confused and insecure girl is replaced by a teenager who is just plain insecure. Despite this it feels like an acceptable continuation of the original character. Ultimately Dead Like Me Life After Death is about the evolution of Reggie's character and her ability to finally accept the reality inevitability and absoluteness of death. If it's closure from the series that you seek in this film then it is at least granted to Reggie's character with moderate success.Overall Dead Like Me Life After Death comes across as a disjointed set of events and ideas lacking cohesion direction and purpose. If you seek nostalgia then you will be disappointed by this film. If you seek closure then you will be disappointed by this film. It does however have an extremely cryptic ending lending itself to the possibility of a sequel or new series. Unfortunately I just can't escape the feeling that the golden goose is dead.".

A different Daisy? George looks different? Why should I even bother to rent this? But I did  and I'm happy to report that DLMLAD is a really good movie much better than you'd think reading about it here. The stuff that I thought would bug me no Rube etc didn't matter at all. There are two major plot lines and both are engaging and wellwritten. Without giving anything away one of the plots involves George's mom and sister I always thought the George's family segments dragged in the original show but in the movie George's sister Reggie has grown up and she brightens the screen whenever she appears. The writing is good and a couple of lines had me on the floor je ne sais quoi plus there are a number of we always wanted to see that! moments which I won't spoil for you.Yes George looks older but her new look grew on me pretty quickly. If I had to make one change I'd have added more exposition about Crystal but maybe some things are never meant to be known.In short thumbs up a good movie following up on a wonderful show.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I will say that this movie isn't as bad as it could have been but it got pretty close to it. Feel free to share what you think.WARNING Spoilers for both the movie a series to follow.All the main ingredients to a bad follow up movie were there Same character different actor plot holes contradictions to canon characters acting out of character corny dialogue unresolved plot threads.Firstly I'll deal with the plot holes or at least contradictions of previously established canon. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but suspension of disbelief shouldn't extend to ignoring the previously established rules within the fictional universe. That is just called bad writing.Okay the first few episodes of Dead Like Me pretty much centred around the consquences of ignoring the rules. Each time George tries to ignore or get around the rules the consequences are bad. Yet we are meant to believe that Roxy of all people would start disobeying the rules. We know from the series that she disobeyed the rules deliberately and had to put up with Gravelings going after her. You get a pretty good idea the reapers in that group all know the consequences of not following the rules.Now we are meant to believe that Roxy would go right ahead and ignore the rules because of a sleazebag like Cameron? Roxy is an established ballbuster and would not be even the slightest bit likely cosy up to a slease like Cameron let alone listen to anything he says. It doesn't make sense for her character or her previously established history.To a certain extent you could say the same is true for both Daisy and Mason though it is slightly more believable that they would be tempted...esp Mason! The Cameron plot line made no sense. Some have suggest that he may have been there to deliberately tempt each character to see who would be the next head reaper. However if that is true it was a really poorly executed idea and gave no definite clues in the movie. The fact they successful cremated him and seemingly sent him to space seems to speak against him being a lackey for the Powers that Be. If he WAS meant to be a tempter that is probably even worse because even though that would explain his motives it would seem a bit stupid that the PTB would used this method to pick the best head reaper. Any idiot could see that It'd be either Roxy George or a someone from outside the group. Mason and Daisy obviously aren't options for any sane PTB.George being able to talk to her younger sister makes no sense. It has already been established that if a reaper tries to contact a relative in the living world the lose their memories and end up looking mentally ill. That is of course completely ignored because they wanted George to talk to Reggie. This I find very infuriating as I feel they could have solved the problem AND stuck to canon. For example in the series Reggie seemed to some how catch onto the fact that Millie is actually George. Perhaps they could have explained that in some way like maybe she has a rare ability to see reapers for what they are in the same way only George seems to see gravelings directly just a suggestion perhaps a bad one but at least it is an explanation!. Better yet they could have had it set during Halloween since it has been semiestablished that they show their true faces on Halloween. Point is they could have found some solution based in canon for why she could talk to Reggiereveal her identity without just ignoring the problem.Joy wrting a book on grieving and heading up support groups is out of character. Joy has all the compassion of tin foil. That is just part of her character that's why her husband and daughter were so distant from her  she just found it hard to connect with people and feel sympathy. However it starts off with her being all sympathetic with this woman at a support group. I agree that in 5 years she might have changed but the fact she is STILL having trouble connecting with her own daughter seems to speak against this change. While it is possible that she finds it easier open up to a group of strangers they had nothing in the script to explain that. If Reggie had a simple line like You can share your feeling with your support group but you can't do it with me it might have made a bit more sense but as it was it seemed incongruent.The woman playing Daisy was just atrocious or at least the writing for her was. She didn't even sound vaguely like the original and acted completely out of character. She had none of the sass of the original. The sexual tensionlatent romance with Mason was dealt with for about 3 seconds in one scene.They scripted as a bimbo whereas in the series she was cunning and manipulative but with a vulnerable side.I basically felt that the original series was done a great injustice.I should point out that even though the two writers did work in the original series they only did a couple of episodes in the first season and several in second season the latter I didn't feel was as good.".

Any TV series is better than the movie from any point of view. Take into consideration that the writers can afford a few episodes that fail over a two year season. One tends to remember the great episodes and push aside the crappy the ones. So in a nutshell you cannot compare any movie to the series.I was happy to see they managed to get about 80 of the original cast back after 5 years of doing nothing. I enjoyed the movie but it lacked revelations. There was no cosmic secrets answered about the show. It merely asked more questions and some to most of the characters seemed to take a back seat. I was hoping they would use the opportunity to expand on the Reaper Society and I kind of thought that was where the plot was heading but somehow failed to push through.The focus of the film is on Georgia and Reggie and unfortunately characters like Mason Roxy and Daisy become less significant than they should be in this film. The subplot with Cameron Kane wasn't well developed and makes the movie fall short of the mark.So why did I give the move a seven out of ten? That in my honest opinion is a C average. It is just OK but could have been better. Sadly due to the nature of the story that reapers never grow old they won't be able to make another. The actress Ellen Muth is showing her age. I sincerely hope she can move on to better roles but I am afraid she will always be haunted by the series and movie.".

'deadwood' and 'john from cincinnati' come readily to mind... so when i saw that these people had made a movie i thought 'great. a studio that cares about its audience...'. maybe. maybe not. personally i would've rather they made no follow up than a foul up... there's LOTS of things that are at best unsatisfactory about this project. first off for me was the 'new' daisy adair...easily one of the most dynamic characters of the show though a 'latecomer'...and boy if people want to see the difference a good actress makes they need look no further than here...i imagine the actress that played daisy saw this as a good opportunity to pardon the pun make a killing... seems the studio decided they didn't need her THAT badly. bad decision... but it would seem that's only one of many... see this if you must. just don't get your hopes up. or you did like me...";

And the new head of the Reaper Squad was a two dimensional character with no back story and no real presence in the story. The show had no real story line. Nothing made sense  the actions of the characters did not fit the story's ground rules. The script had none of the raw edginess and dark humour of the TV show. The pacing was irritating  very amateurish. After watching the whole series we looked forward to a wrap up of the show ala Serenity. It would have been better to have let this show remain in purgatory than leave a bad taste in one's mouth. A waste of a creative premise and an excellent original cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all regardless what you think of the movie if you haven't yet gotten both seasons of the series on DVD by all means get your copies of those as soon as possible  watch them!Is change good or bad? Well I suppose that can only be answered yes. You see it matters what is being changed  how that change manifests itself. Having so stated I generally prefer the familiar  which means that I generally abhor change.In the broadcast versions of Dead Like Me we lost Betty Rhomer Rebecca Gayheart after 5 episodes  though I didn't then share with her fans profound enthusiasm for her character or performance I had grown accustomed to her  I was deeply disappointed.My initial reaction to the appearance of Daisy Adair Laura Harris was OMG they've gone replacement blonde in an effort to boost ratings using the 'sex sells' model in a show not only that isn't about sex but also that doesn't have a significant sexual component. I thought at first that the show was ruined but I kept watching what I quickly discovered is that Harris is a most excellent actress  that the writers understood how to integrate Daisy into the DLM story.That Harris is very easy on the eyes turned out to be a bonus  a perfect dessert to follow the substantial main course. In that case every aspect of the change was surprisingly good.That isn't to discount Gayheart who is in every sense a fine actress but to recognize that Harris earned her fans after Gayheart had already set the bar awfully high.As the story unfolded I was pleasantly amazed to discover the actors  writers taking the DLM experience to a level even higher than where the show began then in a flash the deorbiting toilet seat of fortune snuffedout my favorite show.Some time later I was elated to discover there was being made a DLM movie  I looked forward to its theatrical release all we DLM fans  I would be vindicated when the box office numbers were tallied. Then I learned the movie was going to be directtoDVD.Okay that's a minor setback  but as soon as Rube Sofer Mandy Patinkin starts bustin' chops in the trailer when people get a chance to see ... WHAT? No Rube?  Daisy stays but someone else is going to play her? I was immediately overwhelmed with the sensation that the DLM franchise had been lost clearly the universe had gone mad. Or had it?I own the complete first season of Dead Like Me two sets of the complete second season of Dead Like Me  now I own the directtoDVD movie Dead Like Me Life After Death. Yes I've watched them all plus every episode of the series as it aired on Showtime  most or all of the SciFi rebroadcasts. Kudos to the team that edited the SciFi versions they seamlessly replaced the foul language so that the censorship wasn't obvious.Without spoilers my overall impression of Dead Like Me Life After Death is that like the series it is too short by that I mean that it left me wanting much much more! But isn't that the whole idea? There were some plot twists that I think were inevitable for reason of continuity  it's always tough to overcome prejudice arising from actor substitution.Pleasantly the movie also focuses more on George Lass Ellen Muth than did the broadcast series. This is probably as much a result of the crutch principle as anything else but it works in a way that really saves the movie.Saves? Okay maybe that's a bit strong remember I'm prejudiced by the broadcasts. In reality there's an awful lot of development that happens through the series that doesn't readily translate through the movie format  that requires compromises.The makers of Dead Like Me Life After Death brilliantly incorporated storyboards to aid in the transition between scenes  to bring the uninitiated up to speed without boring longtime fans of the series.However even these conceits left a lot to be condensed into its 87minute runtime  that means among the reapers that the roles of Daisy Adair Sarah Wynter Roxy Harvey Jasmine Guy  Mason Callum Blue are minimized  stereotyped.Some purists will take issues with the scripting as it relates to character development within the movie. In the end I think the directors  editors did the best that could reasonably be expected from a comparatively short feature movie format.I urge the readers of this review to obtain for themselves a copy of the DLM directtoDVD movie Dead Like Me Life After Death even though it is set 5 years after the George's death it works in several different ways 1 It is a passably good introduction of the DLM series to the uninitiated or alternatively 2 It is a passably good ending to the DLM story if it goes no further DLM fans won't feel completely cheated or alternatively 3 It is an EXCELLENT bridge between the DLM series  future DLM productions.Given the diversity of missions  objectives defined by the DLM fanbase  Given the budgetary constraints  political battles that threatened to kill the project before it got the green light plus the myriad hurdles that threatened its survival during production  Given the postproduction mastering manufacturing  distribution problems that cropped up that this movie ever got distributed is barely less than a miracle  those factors must be considered in any reasonable review of this movie.I got mine through Amazon.com if you haven't ordered your copy yet order it today!

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Like Me Life After Death is a good entry into the series. Though not quite as fun or engaging as the series was it was quite enjoyable to see the characters again and how they have all grown matured and subtly changed. It felt a bit restrained in comparison to the episodes which had a bit more energy and emotional content. However the quality of dialog special effects and visual design are all very good.Surely this film won't be as enjoyable to individuals who are not familiar with the series as they won't perceive the subtle character differences and certainly won't understand why the reaper team is so frustrated with the new team leader of Cameron Kane. Nor will neophytes to the series pick up on the fact that George's mom has also grown and matured significantly or why it was such a big deal that she reveals her secret to her sister. And despite the fact that they did an excellent job of introducing the world that the story is built upon the significance of Der Waffle Haus Happy Time and even Murray the cat are all lost.Overall it was a satisfying experience and yet leaves me regretting the series was canceled so prematurely. Dead Like Me was such a refreshing show with its dark humor yet its light and happy sadness. The ensemble cast weird deaths and character arcs are all sorely missed. In fact I canceled my Showtime subscription when I heard they had canceled the show. I hope there are additional installments into the franchise but I fear that this is it. And if that is the case it was a satisfying way to tie it up unlike the unceremonious cut it received five years ago.".

Nothing really new in the show to make it a must see.The plot seemed to meander through the lives of the reapers and basically had no place to really go with the characters. I'd have liked to have seen what the characters were doing 5 years one. Apparently the same old thing.The new head reaper was just a WTF!? Why was he evil because he wanted Chaos!? OK why did he want Chaos!? I guess for the sake of it. No other reason!? Huh? So they HAVE to kill him? When they are out there basically doing the same thing earlier. King of hypocritical on their part. Where was the balance of the universe for the actions of the reapers when they broke the rules. Daisy injuring or killing the star of the play was just out of character for her IMO. She was conceited and Vain but deep down had a good heart. I just couldn't see that character doing that.Mason gets shot on a security camera and waves and walks off and that DOESN'T make the front page of every paper and news show and there isn't a million cops looking for him!? huh? Probably the worst written part was the meeting between George and Reggie. There was just no build up to that scene and there was no emotional impact which the entire movie should have led up to. Maybe that was the actors more than the script. Actually the last scene with Reggie and her mom going on vacation as they drive past George had more emotional impact than the meeting of the sisters. I was hoping for a memorable scene but nope just a I'm your sister! Surprise! more or less. Ugh...I could think of 10 better ways to have Reggie stumble onto George than how it was done in the movie. Actually the Halloween idea in the TV show would have been perfect for that but showtime blew it.How bout a meeting between the mom and George for some closure on both sides. I think there was more of a need for that than a meeting between Reggie and George.It was fun to see the Characters again too much Delores and her cat The movie just disappointed. So much potential. It was like waiting for Christmas all year and getting a new sweater. Umm..yeah....Thanks.".

I was appalled by them keeping the Daisy Character while replacing the Actress. Delicate Laura Harris has a unique look that defines the dead Southern Actress character. To replace her with a notsodelicate Actress with bad beesting lip surgery was hard to watch. Later it's easy to see why Laura Harris didn't play the part. Daisy went from being a suggested slut to being an actual slut and a failure of an actress. Reading the script I'm sure Laura said NO WAY!. It did however allow me to understand that the part was written and had to be played so killing off Daisy at that point would have required a major rewrite. Other than that the movie was fine a nice continuation. Rube is gone we've seen Reapers get their light why not Rube? The new guy played by different rules how uncommon is that? The movie could have gone on for hours and become a miniseries but they chose to limit the focus to a Reggie  George relationship to make a movie. I think most of us would like to see the TV series back but for a movie it fit the series fine. 9 out of 10 I stand by it!!!".

I was a little bit confused at the lack of any reference to the ending of the original series where it had been made clear in the final scene that Reggie had seen George walking away from her grave site so the revelation to Reggie in the movie that the strange blonde following her around was really her sister seemed a little oddly played and somewhat out of touch with the series.I missed the Waffle House and yes I missed Rube and the original Daisy but the actors and crew worked with what they had and Millie was her wonderful old self.

	schema:reviewBody "Russia's first proper foray into Tolkeinesque fantasy cinema WOLFHOUND based on the first novel of a tetralogy by Maria Semyonova about a lastofhistribe mighty warrior is a mixed bag  on the one hand it is formulaic derivative and uneven in terms of acting and pacing on the other there is enough novelty in the film's distinctly Slavic demeanor philosophical subtext and production design to make it play well internationally as a crossover curio.WOLFHOUND opens with the backstory of the main character a mighty warrior from the Grey Hound tribe named Wolfhound Bukharov. While still only a child Wolfhound's family is killed by marauders led by the evil priest Zhadoba and his henchman the ManEater Domogarov. Zhadoba steals a sword forged by Wolfhound's father and has Wolfhound enslaved. The boy grows up dreaming of revenge.Zhadoba is priest of Morana a malevolent goddess that has been imprisoned by spell cast by the rulers of Galirad one of whom Princess Helen Akinshina is betrothed to the ManEater's son Vinitar Bely in an effort to keep the peace. Zhadoba is trying to free Morana to wreak havoc upon the world and subsequently dominate. He hopes to accomplish this by spilling the blood of Helen at the ancient shrine where Morana is imprisoned. Standing between him and his goal is Wolfhound who after saving Helen from an assassination attempt in Galirad becomes her bodyguard.Contrary to many Russians' fatalistic attitudes towards life the film presents a new and intriguing philosophical slant in terms of the free will versus determinism debate which comes out in favor of free will. Wolfhound frees himself from slavery by killing one of his captors thereby changing his fate. As a free man he pursues revenge but throughout the film his conscience in the form of visions of a female spirit comes to question whether the seemingly fated cycle of killing is worth continuing when he encounters Vinitar the last of his enemies in battle.If the plot sounds formulaic and derivative it is. Intentionally or not the opening sequence is virtually a remake of John Milius's CONAN THE BARBARIAN. Masked in a sharptoothed skull helmet Zhadoba is vaguely reminiscent of Tolkein's dark lord Sauron. The predictability of the storyline and the pace which lags in places sometimes makes you wish they'd just get on with it. In terms of editing the film could have been better served with a classic chronological progression of the main character's life rather than its more trendy nonlinear flashback tack which dampens its philosophical message.The performances are uneven with the supporting cast generally better than the leads. TV heartthrob Bukharov Russian TV series MAROSEIKA 12 and internationally known Oksana Akinshina LILJA4EVER THE BOURNE SUPREMACY look appropriately wideeyed in the right places neither of them leaves much of an impression. The purported love story between them feels pat due to being underdeveloped plotwise. Since this is Russia's first LOTRstyle fantasy and the genre is very alien to Russian cinema some sequences feel downright awkward in terms of acting. Also a bit gawky is the very noticeable use of facial closeups presumably in order for the film to subsequently play well on the small screen.One of the more memorable performances was that of the matronly Nina Usatova as the leader of the savage Kharyuk people whose lands Helen's entourage has to cross to reach her betrothed. Usatova steals every scene in that sequence which is somewhat obviously played for comic relief.Nevertheless the film acquits itself well by stretching its comparatively shoestring budget to the limit. It looks similar to a 40  50 million Hollywood film. The cinematography is atmospheric well lit and generally melds well with the computergenerated effects. CGI use is rather sparing compared with something like LOTR but then this is not only because of budgetary constraints. The filmmakers didn't cut corners on things like extras and sets. The film features around 1800 costumed extras and nine different large sets were built the most spectacular of these being Galirad which covered 5 kilometers square on a Mosfilm studio backlot. The film also makes use of numerous onlocation forest sequences shot in Slovakia. CGI is used mostly in the background in establishing shots and the level of CGI use builds up slowly until going fullbore in the closing magical battle sequence. The battle scenes of are varying quality  some are quite clear and easy to follow while others are pretty sloppy and a blur of swords and grunts. The fighting is not very gory and would probably earn the film a PG13 rating in the U.S.The film's unique and exotic look which draws on an amalgam of some neverbeforeseen elements from Slavic archeology makes it a novelty item. Wolfhound looks positively Scythian with his long hair beard scars and animalhide costume. Helen's red beaded wedding dress was painstakingly created from 3000 individual parts. The bat sidekick is a first and its CGI is very accomplished  nearly impossible to tell that the bat was not real. A healing process used by a white wizard to remedy some nearfatal wounds is also thus far oneofkind. It uses heat provided from the campfires and the three healing sequences one of them repairing the bat's wing elicit a sense of wonder.Outside of Russia the film should benefit from the postLordoftheRings renewed interest in the fantasy genre and the general curiosity about Russians' take on the genre.".

It looks similar to a 40  50 million Hollywood film. The cinematography is atmospheric well lit and generally melds well with the computergenerated effects. CGI use is rather sparing compared with something like LOTR but then this is not only because of budgetary constraints. The filmmakers didn't cut corners on things like extras and sets. The film features around 1800 costumed extras and nine different large sets were built the most spectacular of these being Galirad which covered 5 kilometers square on a Mosfilm studio backlot. The film also makes use of numerous onlocation forest sequences shot in Slovakia. CGI is used mostly in the background in establishing shots and the level of CGI use builds up slowly until going fullbore in the closing magical battle sequence. The battle scenes of are varying quality  some are quite clear and easy to follow while others are pretty sloppy and a blur of swords and grunts. The fighting is not very gory and would probably earn the film a PG13 rating in the U.S.The film's unique and exotic look which draws on an amalgam of some neverbeforeseen elements from Slavic archeology makes it a novelty item. Wolfhound looks positively Scythian with his long hair beard scars and animalhide costume. Helen's red beaded wedding dress was painstakingly created from 3000 individual parts. The bat sidekick is a first and its CGI is very accomplished  nearly impossible to tell that the bat was not real. A healing process used by a white wizard to remedy some nearfatal wounds is also thus far oneofkind. It uses heat provided from the campfires and the three healing sequences one of them repairing the bat's wing elicit a sense of wonder.Outside of Russia the film should benefit from the postLordoftheRings renewed interest in the fantasy genre and the general curiosity about Russians' take on the genre.";

'Wolfhound' sounded like it would be an entertaining joke  some low budget tragedy of a movie with a bunch of men running around with swords.However while it wasn't the most amazing film I'd ever seen there was very little to make fun of as I was shocked to find I actually enjoyed watching it. Yes the fight scenes are hokey at times but the way it's done you kind of start to transcend the action on screen and imagine more than there is. It's hard to explain but things are constantly moving even if it doesn't make the greatest sense. I can understand how anyone would feel this is derivative. It didn't add too many new and original ideas and yet there was enough interesting to keep the somewhat generic plot from becoming tedious. Wolfhound's bat is an obvious gem but there's enough other things to wonder about the various characters the details that are glossed over sometimes to keep you wondering despite the somewhat plain metastory.Lush interesting scenery also pops up from time to time giving it hints of Lord of the Rings and yet it's somehow nice not having overexaggerated scenes.The clincher though is that there was something altogether too real about the movie. More than once I found the world 'believable' thanks to subtle special effects and a kind of grittiness that makes the characters while not altogether perfect human. Once I was done I was crying out in appreciation that the movie didn't drift into the usual Hollywood marketing overacting or other posturing drudgery. The bat didn't talk dance and sing and inspire a line of breakfast cereal! Rapture! It felt fresh and real something altogether missing from most of the blockbuster movies I've seen recently and thankfully devoid of the usual overpaid actionmovie actors trying to upstage each other! It may not become a favorite of mine but it was a breath of fresh air. A movie instead of a sales pitch for a series. And I'm quite thankful for that. I hope the cast all the success in the future... hopefully without letting it go to their heads.Also next time maybe they can light their sets better or afford better cameras. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Russian made fantasy film concerning Wolfhound who seeks to get revenge on the people who killed his family and his tribe and threw him into slavery. He ends up meeting a princess and...well thats the story.I don't know if this is a great film I really don't care Frankly the film grabbed on an emotional level and took me back to the place I go when I read good swords and sorcery novels. From the point where we see Wolfhound and his bat I was hooked. More so once he started his solo assault on the castle that is the first great yes great set piece of the film. No one is making films like this any more...or maybe ever. This film has the high adventure of old Hollywood fantasy films but mixes it with a sense of reality and gravitas that is missing in pretty much every sword and sorcery fantasy movie. As much fun as the earlier films were they always had a sense of dress up. In most cases we were not in these mythical kingdoms we were on sets. Lord of the Rings came along and blew that all to hell. Now everything feels unreal...or did until this film came along.Set in a time when the gods still walked among men the film has the feel of a rural Russia. We are in these places the towns the forests the castles and the temples. These are real places. The characters seem real as well. To be certain they are not real people but the fantasy equivalent but they still feel as though they belong in the world they inhabit. This is a world where magic works and for most of the film its kept to a minimum so that the magic we see is special indeed the film is reasonably free of CGI which only really shows up for the final show down between the various factions and while the CGI at the end isn't LOTR perfect it gets the job done.The story based in some form on a novel or novels is nicely dense. The film doesn't breeze along mindlessly it is heading in a certain direction and it takes its time going where its going so that layers and characters are built up. Many minor characters are given enough of a presence so that when you meet them later in the film or see them in the background you have a sense that the character is some one other than soldier number 2. If there is a flaw it is perhaps an odd side trip to a river community. While it allows for some information to be brought in to the plot it isn't wholly necessary perhaps what happens there will have effects in the promised sequels.Also helping things is a dynamite score which is often hauntingly beautiful. I may have to try and track down a cd if one exists. The music is often married to some very beautiful sequences to stunning effect I'm particularly thinking of the song of the prisoner who changed his fate and the sequence when the princess heads off to meet her bridegroom the latter is a beautiful sequence that is cross cut with the bad guys getting ready to attack.I love the film. I can't speak rationally about it since even though its flawed the opening sequence where the villains attack and kill Wolfhound's family is clichd and has some really bad wigs I fell under its spell. Its a grand adventure film of the highest order. Its the sort of film they don't make any more or never really did.You'll forgive me I want to go into great detail about the film but I think it would be better if you just saw it for yourself. Its wonderful.".

And then after the fall of USSR I haven't seen any Russian movie at all. I was very intrigued upon hearing of this movie  I wanted to see how modern Russian cinematography looks like.I can say that the movie is a treat. It may not be the best fantasy movie ever but it's definitely in the top of my list.The story is not really all that original but it's different enough from the typical Hollywood to feel fresh. As others have noted the movie deals with some philosophic aspects regarding fate and free will as well as Slavic mythology.The production value is just fabulous. I found the town of Galirad incredibly realistic and then I've read that it was actually built on 5 sq.Km 2 sq. miles. It looks real it feels real. The costumes are also nicely done.The special effects are just incredible especially considering that we're not talking about Hollywood budgets. The main character has a bat sidekick which happens to be the most realistic CGI animal I've seen. I'm still not convinced it's 100 I think they cheated by using a real bat in some of the shots.Acting is good even though it's not stellar the characters are somewhat underdeveloped.Overall I think it's a mustsee movie  if only to see something different than you're used to. as an aside just after I've seen the movie I checked the TV Troy was on. It looked so fake so clich so much obsessed with the big stars it had onscreen that the story had to take the backseat that I couldn't watch it. With this film the Russians have shown that they still can do great movies. I can't wait to see more of them!".

	schema:headline " Fantasy to beat the stuffing out of Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "I've just seen this glorious epic at a Kiev cinema and am amazed at how Russian cinema can release such a superb fantasy film. This is an adaptation of the first Volkodav fantasy novel by Maria Semyonova that draws on a wide range of Slavic mythology.Alexander Bukharov is well cast as the hero the wolfhound fighting the evil wolf with a strong supporting cast that relies on impact more than the hairstyles toothwhitener and revealing loincloths of Hollywood. This is not a sentimental film but accepts the violence and closenesstonature of tribal life reminiscent of the Dark Ages. The film's stark realistic feel reminded me of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto that emotionally draws many parallels. Bukharov would be an ideal King Arthur or King Alfred  it's a pity that his nationality will probably write off any Hollywood offers. The obvious comparison is to Lord of the Rings but the movie manages to keep originality in many plot strands effects and characterization's. Its landscapes are relatively muted having been filmed in Slovakia rather than New Zealand but its effects and monsters are winners over Hollywood by maintaining suspense and keeping many nasties just out of vision. By having the main effects based on primal forces of nature rather than a newgeneration iteration of Predator or Alien it avoids the typical clichs that most fantasy films suffer from. I hope this gets a wide release in Europe and the USA  it certainly deserves it.".

This is an adaptation of the first Volkodav fantasy novel by Maria Semyonova that draws on a wide range of Slavic mythology.Alexander Bukharov is well cast as the hero the wolfhound fighting the evil wolf with a strong supporting cast that relies on impact more than the hairstyles toothwhitener and revealing loincloths of Hollywood. This is not a sentimental film but accepts the violence and closenesstonature of tribal life reminiscent of the Dark Ages. The film's stark realistic feel reminded me of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto that emotionally draws many parallels. Bukharov would be an ideal King Arthur or King Alfred  it's a pity that his nationality will probably write off any Hollywood offers. The obvious comparison is to Lord of the Rings but the movie manages to keep originality in many plot strands effects and characterization's. Its landscapes are relatively muted having been filmed in Slovakia rather than New Zealand but its effects and monsters are winners over Hollywood by maintaining suspense and keeping many nasties just out of vision. By having the main effects based on primal forces of nature rather than a newgeneration iteration of Predator or Alien it avoids the typical clichs that most fantasy films suffer from. I hope this gets a wide release in Europe and the USA  it certainly deserves it.";

Although story was somewhat predictable and not very original it was nevertheless enjoyable experience.It was also refreshing seeing some of Slavic Mythology adapted to widescreen and to be honest it would be nice to see some of ancient folk tales adapted into movies  it could be even commercially very profitable accompanied with adequate marketingyes its old fashioned and riddled with clichs yet I found it much more satisfactory then last Conan 2011 movie.My Rating 7510".

The fights are awful and general as the plot itself you can't see who is doing what and it's pretty hard to understand why they behave the way they do. Too many stamps. The main and originally deep idea of Wolfhound looking for another life purpose after having done the only thing he've been dreaming about for 20 years was transformed in an ordinary love story with some extra mystical evil. Not once you will recognize episodes from the Lord of the Rings Indiana Jones Star Wars and Night Watch Nochnoj Dozor. Someone in a web review said that the Wolfhound reminds a cartoon where each has his own part and plays it in the most obvious way with the same face expression during the whole movie. I do subscribe to the point. The only good thing about the movie is the Bat  the Wolfhound's pet. By the way  in a matter of fact the Hero got his nick 'coz it's not his true name for killing the slavedriver named Wolf. But they never explained it...".

The story was a little hard to follow at times and overall I found them pretty boring.When I picked up Wolfhound I was really expecting more of the same.However it turns out Wolfhound is a pretty good movie. It keeps a pretty good pace all the way through. The production values are really good. The story was good. Actors did a good job. I don't really have anything to complain about with this movie.I would have to say I liker it better than Eragon and In the Name of the King.The DVD case says Conan the Barbarian meets Lord of the Rings. Well I wouldn't go that far. Sure I think it's a little better than the first Conan movie but it really doesn't come close to The Lord of the Rings what does?. LOTR is going to be a pretty hard movie to beat in this genera.If you enjoy fantasy movies and stories then this movie is for you and you won't be disappointed.".

The bloody battle scenes borrowed from the spastic camera work of Gladiator and the first scene borrowed from Conan the Barbarian 3. The fact that there are not enough speaking parts and the stories backstories and flashbacks are difficult to follow and put together 4. The music that aspires to loudness more than anything else 5. And the fact that most blond bearded longhaired Russians look alike.But I decided to be more lenient because...1. This is a Russian fantasy film that can look back to a great tradition of movies like Sadko 1954 2. It is based on a book and it must have been difficult to compact all that data into a coherent whole 3. The ending is kind of cool and carries a positive message 4. The sets costumes art direction and composition are excellent  IN SPITE of the anaemic colour scheme 5. I liked the bat 6. It wasn't an American action film.".

Every movie got a long scene  this one has it too. But it was so funny and idiotic so at a time i decided that Im seeing a Bulgarian movie  Bulgarian cinema is really SUCKS  Im a Bulgarian and I know that. That was the scene when with pictures and screaming somehow we have to understand how the main hero became Wolfhound and how he actually became a main personage in many folklore songs... Sooooo boring long scene. Well Im agree with the guy who said that the movie has a good part inside and that is the BAT  I cannot say that the actors are talented or not  the main heroine is pretty and sexy. Wolfhound looks like Brad Pitt from time to time and other faces are typically Russian and not suitable for that kind of movie. Im 30 yo and I've seen so many Russian movies before so when i saw so many fat faces suitable for chief of a communist party or milkwoman in cow factory from 1970  90  I think Im about to puke the scene with the drowning of a woman in the river so annoying and stupid. I saw some good CGI effects  some nice cadres  the one with falling arrows.I find the battle scenes well done  the movements are not typical for the other action movies  they are real and good. Blood is fake and not well done  orange blood ?!  I don't think so. Anyway  I give 2 out of 10  because of these positive things and the BAT ! ".

I had a feeling that this would turn out to be a good drama. Maybe it won't be awardworthy or anything just good as like a regular drama with a good message. After the seeing the movie I came out feeling touched by it. People Like Us was such a good movie.STORY People Like Us has a very simple plot. After his father passed away Sam a salesman Chris Pine has to deliver 150000  which was left behind by his father  to Frankie Elizabeth Banks a sister whom he never knew about. As the relationship develops Sam tries to reexamine his own life choices.MY THOUGHTS The writingdialogue in People Like Us is believable and very good the music score is beautiful and sets the emotional tone well the ending to it is so touching and downright perfect that it made me left the theater with emotion. This movie does a great job talking about the loss of a loved one and trying to rethink choices in life.The only problem I had with People Like Us was that the movie started off a bit slow but then it gets better as it goes on.THE ACTING Chris Pine does an excellent job playing Sam a guy whose father had passed away and wants to rethink his own choices in life. Elizabeth Banks does great playing Frankie a sister that Sam never knew he had. The everso gorgeous Olivia Wilde had a good supporting role as Sam's girlfriend. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic as the mother. The kid is fantastic as well.IN CONCLUSION Although slow at times People Like Us is such a good drama featuring great performances good dialogue and an ending that made me feel touched.810".

I had a feeling that this would turn out to be a good drama. Maybe it won't be awardworthy or anything just good as like a regular drama with a good message.

For all we knew that meant he could have become gay he didn't and it had nothing to do with that.This is an adult family film. It's PG13 rating is not for nudity swearing or violence. It is rated that because it is a mature look at dysfunctional family problems. So while little of that is shown they are referred to through the dialog thus making it a mature film for teens and up.From the opening credits of Dreamworks the artistry of the film was evident. Instead of the usual music for the kid fishing from the moon we hear conversations in a recording studio. In our opinion every actor and actress gave outstanding performances. While the topic could have had a heavy handed approach it did not. It was deftly edited and paced.In summation this movie was art because the content was all heart. I have deliberately avoided talking about specifics because I want all viewers to be as surprised as we were in the viewing. I give it a ten and intend to watch it again.".

Honestly everyone is just that good in these roles especially Banks. Hers is the best performance I've seen this year bar none. The movie itself is so wonderfully written and packs true emotional resonance. The plot may sound clich but nothing is handled in a predictable or unreal fashion. Secrets are revealed and it sheds new life on family and the meaning of love. To paraphrase what seems important now really isn't and what's may seem not important now really is there's a lot to digest about this film.

The acting is great the storyline is well written with adequate character development to let you get emotionally invested. Michelle Pfeiffer gives the level of performance you typically expect from Diane Keaton with empathy and sincerity. Chris Pine as Sam shows he's much more than just a pretty face but the true scene stealer is Michael Hall D'Addario who plays Josh the badboy son of Elizabeth Banks' character Frankie. I really enjoyed that it isn't your typical romantic comedy between a man and woman who end up either together or not. Frankie and Sam being sister and brother as the primary love interests give it a very interesting twist but there's also the motherson subplot as well as Sam and Hannah played by Olivia Wilde.

It is a joy watching these two outstanding thespians at work. It is amazing the intensity and depth they bring to their performances. They bring these tortured characters to life and you feel their pain. When I was getting ready to write this review my first instinct was to say that there wasn't a really likable character in the film. That instinct was wrong. Its not that the characters aren't likable its just that they are flawed and in deep emotional pain because one man didn't do his job as a responsible husband and father and the pain he caused lives after his death. This is a very dark film very depressing gritty and true to life. No Brady Bunch happy endings here folks. Surprisingly I think it makes it a better movie. The only major beef I have with this film is the character of the boy Josh. He is without a doubt the most appalling child character since Wesley on Mister Belvedere. I kept wanting one of the adults to give him a good smack in his little fresh dirty mouth. I always hate it in movies when they show smart aleck kids who talk to adults more strongly then real life kids would dare do!".

This film was exceptional. It stars Elizabeth Banks Chris Pine and Michelle Pfeiffer. People like us made me laugh cry and feel every emotion in between. The visuals in this film were great and the acting was superb. My favorite character was Frankie played by Elizabeth Banks because her performance was so solid and she definitely carried the comedy of this film as well as the heavier emotions. My favorite part of this film is when Sam played by Chris Pine is getting to know Frankie and her young son because I enjoyed watching their bond grow.It really bothered me that Sam wouldn't tell Frankie who he was until the end of the film because it just complicated their lives but it gave the film a much needed twist. I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because of adult content and younger children may have a more difficult time fallowing along with the plot. Overall I give People like us 4 out of 5 stars.".

But in his will he wants that money to go to FrankieElizabeth Banks who is his halfsister that he didn't know about until he got his father's will. So he decides to go stalking Frankie and her son and soon chemistry starts to form between them I guess it's awkward chemistry. Now Sam already has a girlfriend played by Olivia Wilde but the chemistry between Sam and Frankie is just so well written in this to the point I wanted to see more of it. And the fact that they are halfsibling makes things awkward and yet interesting to watch. Elizabeth Banks is still very hot and attractive random but wanted to throw that in. This movie is mostly about understanding one another since everyone comes from different background no matter how close you are with them.

Banks and Pfeiffer each turned in very sturdy performances. Wilde was also effective but she needed more screen time.Kudos to the director Alex Kurtzman for his reasonably light touch. It seems like he allowed the actors a long leash in developing their characterizations. This is no easy task because Kurtzman also cowrote the script.The musical score had some strong moments particularly when they highlighted classic rock tunes from decades ago. There were periodic sentimental tunes which seemed a bit manipulative. And there was a beach scene which was a bit deflated because it was so typically pretty. I wish this film would have taken more risks and navigated through an even murkier emotional landscape. At the end of the day I would recommend this and I look forward to seeing more films from Kurtzman. If you're still with me at this point I beg your pardon. Uh bartender...

The plot is very thin and the entire outline can be predicted in about 15 minutes. But the most annoying part of the film was the extremely sweet American way of trying to make the viewers feel good. They try so hard that it backfires and on me it had the exact opposite effect. Real shame because the story which is based on actual events had potential. This artificially feelgood vibe hinders the viewer from identifying with the main characters and decreases the reality level of the film. Which is of course strange to say the least as it is as I already mentioned inspired by actual events.".

	schema:headline " A Contrived Concept Makes Way for a Surprisingly Worthwhile Emotionally Resonant Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "A studio picture with a premise this contrived shouldn't work but this 2012 family drama works in ways that are quite unexpected and emotionally resonant because a palpable level of truthfulness emerges with the characters even as the plot teeters precariously on credibility issues. Firsttime filmmaker Alex Kurtzman a goto screenwriter of beraction fare like Star Trek and Mission Impossible III based his personal movie on events in his own life when he met his own half sister for the first time as he turned thirty. The plot focuses on Sam a slick 31yearold huckster of a salesman in the bartering business. Just as he gets snagged by a bad deal that costs him the huge bonus he just secured to pay off longstanding debts Sam finds out his father Jerry Harper a legendary Laurel Canyon record producer has died which means he needs to come home to LA for the funeral against his will. Reuniting with his estranged mother Lillian becomes challenging enough but Sam also discovers that his father left him 150000 in his shaving kit.The catch is that it comes with instructions to deliver the cash to an 11yearold named Josh who happens to be the son of Frankie a half sister he didn't know he had. Tempted to keep the cash himself Sam finds Frankie and follows her to an AA meeting where she shares the sudden news of her father's death and the hurtful anger she feels for not being publicly acknowledged as his daughter. Her pain is what becomes the common bond that she and Sam share and the beginning of a web of lies he tells her in order to build upon his newly discovered family ties. It's this thread of deception that propels Kurtzman's storyline and the moment you start to feel the movie get phony he manages to get it back on track through the burgeoning relationship that forms between Sam Frankie and Josh. Of course the further Sam delays in telling the truth the more catastrophic the results. Perceptive performances are critical in pulling off this kind of drama and Kurtzman coaxes strong work from his cast.Chris Pine captures Sam's manic energy and evasive nature to a T and he manages to reveal the vulnerability underneath that shows he never quite gave up on his quest for his father's approval and love. Still etched in my memory as the hottotrot bookstore clerk in The 40YearOld Virgin Elizabeth Banks has matured as an actress and delivers a genuinely empathetic performance as Frankie a single mother struggling with a hardscrabble life and a smart troublemaking son. She and Pine manage a nice rapport that skirts the incest minefield that could have occurred in lesser hands. Too long off the screen and still looking like People Magazine's most beautiful woman Michelle Pfeiffer makes her few scenes count as the newly widowed Lillian who met Jerry back in the seventies when she was a former hatcheck girl at the Troubadour and dreamed of becoming the next Joni Mitchell. She succinctly shares her anger toward Sam for his indifference toward Jerry while slowly revealing her own secrets and fears. As the precocious Josh Michael Hall D'Addario is given lines only an 11yearold in a mainstream movie would speak but he is such a likable young actor that he manages to come across as authentic.Olivia Wilde has a thankless role as Sam's putupon girlfriend Hannah but she provides more depth than the plot device she represents while indie mainstay Mark Duplass Humpday seems to be showing up everywhere these days this time as Frankie's conveniently available downstairs neighbor. There are cameos from familiar character actor Philip Baker Hall 5050 as Jerry's attorney friend and Jon Favreau as Sam's belligerent boss. A.R. Rahman Slumdog Millionaire provides the original music while cinematographer Salvatore Totino really captures the vibrancy of LA life beyond the stereotypical images. Kurtzman sometimes abuses quick cuts to emphasize Sam's restlessness but when the truth is revealed in the story it reinforces the message he sincerely conveys in appreciating the value of family and the importance of forgiveness. His clever use of home movies to bring this message home results in the heartbreaking impact that was obviously intended. I definitely recommend this surprising movie.".

There is depth to the dialog and much careful attention given to the direction and acting in particular Banks' range is amazing as her character grows in several ways in front of our eyes Her background slowly unfolds in front of us revealing the origin of her flaws her pain her inability to find peace until Sam comes into to show her there were pieces missing in her family picture too. In particular I found how they depicted her interaction with her son. Yes we have seen fractured relationships before but they have rarely been shown in such a honest and natural way.There is more to praise in the film as Sam's mother comes into share her concealed memories and how the new developments might affect her future.

Cute kid movies are bad enough but this was the troubled wise guy kid type movie which for me is even worse.

He was only roughed up by bullies who sadly became my heroes.I felt a lot of the story was contrived. We were left waiting for the 'climax' for far too long and there was no real payoff. This is not to say that the script didn't have a few good ideas it did it was just that these ideas never seemed to be developed with any amount of introspection. Everything was very much on the surface.I was reluctant to watch this movie because the last time I saw Chris Pine was in the dismal pseudo comedy 'This Means War'. I blamed his onedimensional acting on the script. Regretfully though this script was much better he was still unable to become two dimensional even though there were abundant opportunities for him to do so. Since the rest of the characters revolved around his role we are left with rather lifeless cardboard interactions between characters. Elizabeth Banks did the best job here but she couldn't pull this together on her own. In the end we were left with a film which attempted to tug at the heartstrings but succeeded in only producing a mild case of heartburn.".

Frankie Elizabeth Banks is estranged from her father because he abandoned her shortly after she was born. When the father dies Sam learns for the first time that he has a half sister a single mother who has been left more on her own than he was. People Like Us is Sam's journey to connect with his new relatives after a sum of money is left in the will for Frankie.It starts with drama dragging out the introduction of Sam for as long as we could stand him. I was vaguely familiar with Chris Pine going in optimistic for what he could do so I was prepared to like him. But I will warn you now if you don't care for him at all in the first five minutes you never will. The introduction of Elizabeth Banks was much better. Finally using sex appeal and comedy to the film's advantage. You would think the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer was for that purpose as well but apparently not. She had no purpose. But back to Banks she had a much more entertaining role than the others were given and a more legit role. She wins the whohadaworsefather argument hands down.At this point we could have made Sam a more interesting character. He hates his father for the typical absent reasons choosing his work over him but then he meets Frankie and realizes his father was even worse than he thought abandoning her for a brand new family. The film doesn't do much with that dynamic opting instead for the drama involved with Sam squirming his way into the life of Frankie and her son. And then more drama and more drama.Being classified as a dramedy I was waiting for some desperately needed comedy. Banks had a few lines at the beginning but after that they expected us to like these characters care for them feel sympathetic for them all because they're trying to live life the best they can. That gets old quick. The filmmakers must have forgotten that the fastest way to one's heart is through their funny bone. Some welltimed comedy goes a long way in making a drama digestible and that was the biggest mistake for People Like Us.".

Just say it for heaven sake! But he doesn't. At least Chris Pine doesn't look 12 years old in this one which was what made the movie This Means War such a farce. He does look a bit more mature thank goodness. And he's pretty good in this one. And I know. I know. In either film I've mentioned had that one vital important sentence been uttered it could have made a much shorter movie. But on the other hand perhaps it would have meant the creators might have been forced to come up with a few more reasons to create suspense in the audience. Maybe. Clever ending here I will say.

I'm a huge fan of Michelle so naturally I knew I would get around to it though the premise made me uneasy. The story essentially revolves around Sam Chris pine who learns his father has died and left him a shaving case filled with money to give to his half sister Frankie elizabeth banks that he never knew existed. During this journey we learn all about what in his eyes was a very unhappy childhood the estrangement with his parents Michelle Pfeiffer is his mother some obvious relationship issues he has with his current girlfriend Olivia Wilde and the difficult issues Frankie and her son have. I felt the acting was top notch for the most part. Loved Michelle as I always do. The only issue I had with the film were some of the unanswered questions and certain aspects that seemed less believable. Where was Frankie's mom in all this? Why would Jerry Sam's dad be so detached with him yet make the effort to reunite the kids on Sundays? Why would that detachment between Sam and his father mean distance between Sam and his mother? What the hell ended up happening with everyone trying to arrest Sam at the end? There is this shift where you get some insight that Sam may not be all that great of a guy... The argument he has with his girlfriend troubles at work yet it was never really addressed... Just he made up with everyone and yeah happy ever after getting to know his sister. They delved a bit into Lillian's heart condition yet didn't fully explore why she wasn't seeking treatment and why she finally agreed to it that convo even after she was back home never happened.Despite all that the movie was enjoyable and thought provoking  which are movies that are rarely made these days. So if you can forgive the questions that arise once it's finished and enjoy it for what it is it's worth it.".

Sam Chris Pine returns home when his father dies returning home we see that Sam did not get on well with his deceased father. Meeting with his dad's lawyer he learns that he has a halfsister that he never knew he had. When he meets this women named Frankie Elizabeth Banks he takes a while to tell her the truth about him leading to the two of them starting a relationship which is built around lies through Sam.The story is very predictable when such scenes as Frankie falling for Sam only to get super mad at him when learning the truth only at the end to forgive him over the thing they have in common which was a bad dad. Even when some of the scenes are predictable the film does have some great dramatic moments such as many of the scenes shared between Pine and Pfeiffer. Some of the writing was not well written especially some lines that had me confused and they mostly came from the son of Frankie and how most of his dialogue was laughable to me. I believe that the film is based on a true story because I would not know why some person would want to write and original story like this one. The film's cinematography was very bad to me because usually it seemed they used sunlight too much on these actors faces to try make them look more dramatic especially when Pine would look into the distant sometimes this was not a good use of cinematography at all.Chris Pine plays Sam and shows once again that he is not as good an actor as someone with his fame could be by taking risks. Everyone else around him comes off better mainly because he is just not a dramatic actor and should stick to his action films were he is not called to give a performance but just jump and run. Elizabeth Banks has been great at comedy but in this film as Frankie she gets to show how her dramatic work can be. She has fun in some scenes opposite Pine but sometimes when she is being dramatic she is believable but at other times she could have been better. She is better then Pine because her character does have more of a transformation. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Pine's mother Lillian and she truly is the best thing in her limited scenes with Pine. It's not one of her career best performances but she does such a great job in the film acting very natural and being the most emotional performance in the film that made me tear up sometimes. Also some actors in limited time such as Olivia Wilde are also worth a shout out. The actor playing the kid tried to make this character good but I was just annoyed by the child whenever he said anything.The film is fine with some moments that are laughable even if the film was based off true events. Performances are fine with Michelle Pfeiffer being the standout in performance and in emotions that the film really needed. Overall I enjoyed the film and the chemistry that a lot of the actors had in the film.MOVIE GRADE B MVP Michelle Pfeiffer".

This is one of my favorites.A distraught mother wishes her deceased Vietnam soldierboy son home only to discover he isn't quite who he was when he left.Many different horror archetypes zombies vampirism cannibalism are touched on without being confirmed which makes the film that much more effective.The film is also a sharp and dark commentary on the state of the returning GI. Andy sits for hours in his dazed zombielike state and stares at the walls. He becomes violent and acts irrational. Many symptoms of posttraumatic shock syndrome.Written by Alan Ormsby who also collaborated with Clark on Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things and would later go on to pen Paul Schrader's remake of Cat People.If you're looking for another solid Bob Clark spookfest check out Black Christmas which bears an eerie similarity to the original Halloween though it predates it by several years!! before Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things.Many have commented on the shocker ending. If you are expecting something along the lines of the original Carrie  something to make you jump out of your seat  you will be disappointed. The ending is more dour and stunning. I didn't see it coming but it made perfect sense in line with everything that had happened. It's the kind of ending that a film would never have now. It's simply too honest. One of the better horror endings I've seen actually.".

	schema:reviewBody "So many horror films both then and now exist solely to provide cheap titillation to gore hounds and casual thrillseekers.  'Dead of Night' aka Deathdream however is serious business and seriously scary. Comparable to 'The Exorcist' in its exploration of the parentchild dynamic when the child is given over to something sinister I personally liked this more than I liked 'The Exorcist.'  It's leaner more suspenseful and less pretentious.  Richard Backus is Andy a soldier who returns from the war presumably Vietnam the very night his parents and sister are informed of his death in combat.  The homecoming is not a happy one however.  Andy just isn't quite himself.  Laconic humorless and irritable he doesn't want to go out and isn't interested in seeing visitors.  Worse there could be a link between him and the gruesome murder of a truck driver that occurred the night of his return.Like 'The Exorcist' 'Dead of Night'  a reworking of The Monkey's Paw  aspires to be more than simply a horror film.  It aspires to be a Vietnam allegory and it aspires to be a family drama.  Remarkably it succeeds as all three.  It makes a compelling statement about returning soldiers is a truly frightening horror film and also a harrowing family drama.  John Marley as a Andy's father conveys torment and confusion effectively and Lynn Carlin is especially good as Andy's mother a woman who has disappeared completely inside of her denial.  The suspense is unbearable and there's skillful use of both sound and space in creating it.  The chills are never cheap and are consistently hairraising.  The movie marches headlong into its inevitable conclusion and is utterly uncompromising throughout.  That it was rated PG at the time is a shocker.The movie has some flaws and lacks visual polish but this is almost irrelevant given how brilliantly everything works.  The director is Bob Clark who would go on to direct the first two 'Porky's' films 'A Christmas Story' and 'Baby Geniuses' and he has made a rare horror film one that is intelligent thoughtful and damn scary.".

I could never get my hands on it anyway so I figured I'd never know. But I just watched it yesterday and it is as good as all that.Though filmed in the early 1970s Deathdream doesn't come off as hopelessly dated. Its themes resonate strongly even today.As an allegory the film makes its antiwar points bluntly. This war thought it is never named it's obviously Vietnam is killing too many of our boys and making zombies out of the ones that make it home. But the movie is not generally antiwar  it manages to contrast Vietnam with WWII represented as a good war in the person and words of the mailman where there was little doubt what we were doing was right and that our military forces were being led authoritatively to absolute victory. The same couldn't be said for Vietnam and by 1972 no one really remembered what we were fighting for anymore. Deathdream was filmed before Vietnam ended and released after making its timing perfect.There are a few criticisms hardly worth noting  some scenes are poorly staged and lighted and Clark doesn't always get the best out of his actors and has little to work with in some cases. Early scenes are a bit stilted Was the movie shot in sequence with the story? That might explain it but the movie finds its groove at about the 30 minute mark.Don't expect a slick production. It's a small claustrophobic personal movie with rough edges to spare. Some scenes of violence are cartoonish and others are brutal. Also the effects and makeup are much better than we have any right to expect. Poor rotting Andy is a heck of a sight and a sad sight in the scene where he is led down the stairs by his mother. Deathdream is an amazing accomplishment all things considered.Everything's fine Bob.".

But rewatching as an adult I saw the movie more for what it wasmeant to be a social commentary about the Vietnam war. It stillholds up very well today. I am glad to know it has been rereleased on DVD with additionsthough I haven't seen this yet. For years it was difficult to even finda video copy. Plus it was released under several different names.

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Clark was such a fantastic and visionary filmmaker during the early 70's and directed no less than three very important and hugely influential horror movies in a row. Unfortunately he reverted to making lame  mainstream comedies during the 80's and 90's and  even more unfortunate of course  was his untimely death earlier this year 2007 as a result of a car accident. But back then he definitely was the man because he was singlehandedly responsible for one genredefining slasher Black Christmas one playful yet creepy zombie classic Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things and then this one a unique and genuinely intriguing horrorsleeper. Deathdream is primarily an unsettling shocker but it definitely also qualifies as a subtly powerful antiwar protest and even as a depressing middleclass family drama. Right from the excruciatingly sober opening credits showing the frozen image of a soldier dying in agony after taking a bullet in the chest you immediately realize this won't become just another outrageous splatter flick with zombiesoldiers and gratuitous massacres. Rightly so because the story then cuts to the dinner table of a seemingly random American family who are very busy making plans for when their son Andy returns home from Vietnam and you literally sense tragic news is about to knock them down. Andy is indeed reported killed in action shortly after and the drama affects both the parents differently. Especially the mother refuses to accept her beloved son's departure and stays up entire nights praying  wishing for Andy to come home. And then suddenly he DOES come home  but not as his family and friends remember him. Andy doesn't talk or eat he spends the whole day in a rockingchair whilst staring in the distance and his body rapidly starts decomposing if not regularly supplied with fresh doses of human blood! Andy Brooks isn't just a pitiable character in a 70's horror gem. No he presumably represents every young soldier who reluctantly enlisted to serve in Vietnam only because their fathers and the smalltown communities they lived in expected them to. Rather than to feast on the blood of innocent bystanders Andy returns to raise feelings of guilt and anguish among his former friends and particularly his dad. Deathdream clearly features some harsh social undertones and they're magnificently supported by the realistic characters and respectively the terrific acting performances. The relationships between Andy's mother Andy's father and Andy himself are perhaps the best achievement of the entire film. The pacing is quite slow but it works efficiently and the overall ambiance of Deathdream is very creepy. The images of Andy in his rockingchair complete with screeching sound and his grimaces when chocking the family dog in front of several young children are unforgettable. Considering the main themes and undeniably the budgets Bob Clark disposed of you shouldn't expect a lot of gore but still there are some nasty and convincingly unsettling makeup effects to enjoy. If they weren't interested just yet all horror fans will unquestionably want to see the film because it marked Tom Savini's debut as a SFXguru. In my humble personal opinion the ending could have been a bit better and less abrupt but that's just a small detail. This film ranks high amongst the best genre achievements of the 1970's and it's fundamental viewing for all fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of Deathdream is set at night in the midst of the Vietnam War. The viewer witnesses a young soldier get shot. Next we see an American family having dinner. They haven't heard from Andy their son in Vietnam and are trying to cope with this. In the middle of their dinner they get the news that he has been killed in battle. The grieving process begins. But Andy comes home in the middle of the night! They assume that the messenger was mistaken and celebrate their son's return. However Andy is very different to themhe is ostensibly emotionless and doesn't say much. And he's a little pale. And more than a little violent.slight plot spoilers ahead though not anything you don't know from reading the plot summary or the back of the DVD This has to be one of the most depressing horror movies I've seen. I suppose it could be classified as a zombie movie even though there is only one zombie and in the tradition of NOTLD this one has a message. Everyone knows someone who returned from war a different person. Not only is Andy emotionally numb he also needs to kill in order to survive just as he did while he was at war. The family which was fragile before his return is now completely torn apart. The dad drinks mom is in denial sis insists on making things like the good ole days and they all fight about Andy who has nothing much to say at all.slight plot spoilers over This lowbudge production has a madeforTV feel but it isn't by any means a bad movie. The performances are mostly great. There are some amusing events and dialogue that seem somewhat out of place but I was thankful for the comic relief. There are also some cheesy and overdone elements but they don't affect the movie too much. There is also the killer's viewpoint camerawork which Bob Clark also uses in Black Christmas that became staples of 80s slashers. The climax seems absurd but that is only because with all the melodrama it is easy to forget that this is a horror movie! The final sequence is heartbreaking. I highly recommend Deathdream to anyone who thinks that horror movies are only for escapism and have no other value and everyone who already knows that this isn't true. My rating 810".

	onyx:emotionText "The opening scene of Deathdream is set at night in the midst of the Vietnam War. The viewer witnesses a young soldier get shot. Next we see an American family having dinner. They haven't heard from Andy their son in Vietnam and are trying to cope with this. In the middle of their dinner they get the news that he has been killed in battle. The grieving process begins. But Andy comes home in the middle of the night! They assume that the messenger was mistaken and celebrate their son's return. However Andy is very different to themhe is ostensibly emotionless and doesn't say much. And he's a little pale. And more than a little violent.slight plot spoilers ahead though not anything you don't know from reading the plot summary or the back of the DVD This has to be one of the most depressing horror movies I've seen. I suppose it could be classified as a zombie movie even though there is only one zombie and in the tradition of NOTLD this one has a message. Everyone knows someone who returned from war a different person. Not only is Andy emotionally numb he also needs to kill in order to survive just as he did while he was at war. The family which was fragile before his return is now completely torn apart. The dad drinks mom is in denial sis insists on making things like the good ole days and they all fight about Andy who has nothing much to say at all.slight plot spoilers over This lowbudge production has a madeforTV feel but it isn't by any means a bad movie. The performances are mostly great. There are some amusing events and dialogue that seem somewhat out of place but I was thankful for the comic relief. There are also some cheesy and overdone elements but they don't affect the movie too much. There is also the killer's viewpoint camerawork which Bob Clark also uses in Black Christmas that became staples of 80s slashers. The climax seems absurd but that is only because with all the melodrama it is easy to forget that this is a horror movie! The final sequence is heartbreaking.

	schema:reviewBody "I attended the world premier of Dead of Night which was held in 1974 at the Britton Theatre in Tampa. John Marley was in attendance and spoke for several minutes preceeding the showing about the making of the film and how happy he was with how it turned out. After the showing he stood at the rear of the auditorium as the audience filed past. Several people stopped to complement him saying they had really enjoyed the film and it was really scary. But the best compliment he received came from two teenage girls who proclaimed much to his delight that it was scarier than The Excorcist! The film was shot in and around the small community of Brooksville just north of Tampa. The drivein theatre that was utilized for several scenes was the U.S. 41 DriveIn in Brooksville which is now long gone. John Marley was a great character actor. You'll probably remember him as the studio head who awakens to find the bloodied head of his prized horse in bed with him in The Godfather. He also played Ali McGraw's father in Love Story in addition to many other film roles.Dead of Night is one heck of a sleeper that slowly creeps up on you and its small town look and feel make it all the more frightening. Despite the limited budget Bob Clark has managed to create a quiet little film that builds mounting dread. I've looked for many years for a copy but figured it had slipped into obscurity forever. I just found out its finally on DVD. I highly recommended this one!".

It is very unique in its using a horror movie to tackle a controversial subject the effects of the Vietnam war on both the soldiers and their families. As a veteran of Iraqi Freedom experiencing emotional trauma in a war can have an effect on somebody turning them into a shell of their former selves a wonderful metaphor of portraying Andy as a zombie and change the family structure as well. All said I felt sorry for Andy in the end not scared of him though I'm not condoning his actionshe was one of the undead who injected blood to keep from decomposing another metaphor of the supposed drug use in Vietnam. But experiencing the horrors of war and the effects it has on a family made me almost want to cry in the end because it hits so close to home. Kudos to the cast and crew of Deathdream aka Dead of Night amongst numerous titles for crafting a unique blend of zombie horror and family drama into one of the most unforgettable films to ever come out in the 70's despite some plot holes eg. How did Andy get home? but they're forgivable.

So this young man died in the war but returns home any way because his mother send prayers so her son would not die. So he is a zombie even though he still looks like a normal human being. He changed being distant to anyone but his mother and he doesn't seem to have any need for food or drink no heart beating. He does a bit of killing assuming he needs the victims' blood to stay alive? It doesn't help in the end as his body starts to rot anyway. Clearly the director wanted to make some kind of statement or tell some message but that must have gone over my head. Yeah war does change people but if that was the message the director wanted to tell the viewer this was not a convincing way to do so. What was very clear to me is that the mother had seriously an obsession with her son. She loved him more than she did love her daughter or husband.

Soon there are murders happening in their small town with people drained of blood.Cool lowbudget horror movie from Bob Clark. It's a variation on the Monkey's Paw story  Be careful what you wish for. The cast is pretty good particularly the actors playing the parents John Marley and Lynn Carlin. Richard Backus plays the son and was apparently cast for his creepy stare which he uses to great effect throughout the film. Chilling at times with a great atmosphere throughout thanks in large part to the budgetary limitations. Lowbudget '70s horror films are some of the grittiest and creepiest ever made. The first half is much better than the second which is why my score isn't higher. After awhile the strangeness gives way to a more traditional vampire type story. I'm not sure if we can even call this a vampire movie but it has the primary element  undead person who craves blood from the living. Tom Savini handled the special effects in one of his earliest films. It's an interesting and worthwhile horror film you should check out.".

He gets around all right and looks normal. But when introduced he doesn't offer to shake hands. The most he can muster up in a vague smile and sometimes not that. He doesn't say thank you if you give him something. He shows little interest in the usual male proclivities like sports and sex. He's never really happy to see an old friend. He never laughs.That's what the central figure Richard Backus is like. His family  father John Marley and mother Lynn Carlin  are overjoyed when he suddenly appears at home since they recently received a telegram that their soldier son had been killed in Vietnam.That the Vietnam War I think is what this story is about. In 1972 the year of this release the movies still couldn't really touch Vietnam because it was too controversial and studios are ever on the alert for an alienated audience that refuses to buy tickets and gives bad reviews. Apocalypse Now didn't show up until 1979 and Platoon not until 1986.As in The Monkey's Paw Backus' mother wishes him home and home he comes but he's some kind of mixture of vampire and zombie who needs the blood of others to delay his decomposition. I suppose his condition is supposed to be symbolic of what was to be called PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. Beckus' symptoms more closely match one of the common features of schizophrenia  flattened affect. He simply doesn't show any emotion except for an occasional burst of rage.Towards the illogical end after he's murdered three people he turns into a boring monster with a Halloween face. I don't care if it was Tom Savini's make up debut or not. The best horrors are more hinted at than fully revealed. A cockeyed world is more frightening than a world divided into pure good and pure evil. Cf. Carnival of Souls or The Cat People. Marley and Carlin are professional and do their jobs well except that Marley isn't really a convincing drunk. Backus as the disintegrating ex soldier isn't much of an actor but he looks the part. A cleancut lad with a lower jaw that doesn't quite fit the rest of his face and seems to just go up and down when he grimaces or speaks rather like a ventriloquist's dummy.The director the late Bob Clark who appears as the chubby police officer does the best he can with the script. And both the direction and the script are in fact quite good except for the ghoulish transformation. I worked in one of Clark's later movies From the Hip a rude lump of foul deformity. The movie itself was no good but the director ran a happy set and was one of the least pretentious authority figures imaginable.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading other reviews that compared elements of the film to John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and the mention that the film had deeper connotations regarding Vietnam veterans returning home from the war my curiosity got the better of me.From the very beginning of the film it is abundantly clear that the production is very low budget and the film looks dated. The war scene looks like it has been filmed in the local woods and there are glaring inaccuracies to their uniforms. However what the film does well is to create a very creepy atmosphere from the moment he is shot and you hear Andy's mother reminding him of his promise to return home.The acting is often wooden and sometimes quite strange which actually adds to the film's creepiness. The sound and camera work is lacking at times but occasionally it excels with a number of unconventional shots that are surprisingly effective. There is also some interesting use of sound used to convey Andy's confused and primal state that reminded me of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' 1974. I felt the film started to drag a little in the middle but picks up again as it draws to a close. There are some memorable scenes with Andy that appear to be metaphors for PTSD in war veterans. It also touches on other issues such as alienation depression and the Oedipus complex. The violence itself is not particularly gory or emphasized by today's standards and the film tends to focus rather on Andy's disposition and the effect it has on his family.The film's conclusion is disturbing and unsettling. It left me feeling depressed but with a greater understanding of the loss experienced by victims of the war and their families. I was initially concerned that the film might reinforce prejudice towards war veterans that struggle to readjust to civilian life but the antiwar sentiment is so strong that I think the film is worthy of merit even if it makes for difficult viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those horror films that work on an emotional level as well as a visceral level can be quite devastating Cronenbergs' remake of The Fly would be another good example. Here's a story written by Alan Ormsby that can work as a metaphor for the effects of the Vietnam War on the young men who fought it. Its characters are thoroughly relatable and sympathetic and its horror works quite well. Thicky atmospheric and spooky it benefits from solid acting in all of its major roles.John Marley and Lynn Carlin star as Charles and Christine Brooks the parents of Andy Richard Backus a soldier fighting the war in 'Nam whom they're told died over there. So it's a delight to them when he turns up alive and seemingly well. But all is NOT well and Andy is definitely not the same person that he was when he went away. The signs don't take long to reveal themselves and Charles is dismayed over the change in his son while Christine still full of love for her boy tries to deny that anything could be wrong.This is an impressively mature genre effort from the late great cult director Bob Clark Black Christmas '74 Porky's who'd previously guided the more irreverent Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things. It's also historically important for marking the first credit for makeup effects legend Tom Savini. Filmed on location in Florida it's got some fine suspense and is often genuinely creepy. Savini's effects are good but parcelled out in small doses until near the end. And that ending when it comes is a grabber that will really stay with you.Marley and Carlin are wonderful as the parents with the differing feelings and reactions toward their son and Backus does a fine job of being initially standoffish and growing more and more unnerving as the story plays out. Henderson Forsythe is excellent in support as the concerned local doctor and various cast members from Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things  Anya Ormsby Jane Daly Jeff Gillen and Ormsby himself who was also a makeup artist on this show  play other supporting roles and bits.Any fan of the genre is well advised to check this one out. It's simply one of the finer horror films to come out of the early 1970s.Nine out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Clark was on a creative high back in the early seventies with this film and the seminal masterpiece 'Black Christmas' and overall it's a real shame that the director went on to direct rubbish like Baby Geniuses as if he's stayed on track he could well have been remembered as one of horror cinema's finest assets. Deathdream is actually a really original and inventive little movie which takes it's influence from both the vampire and zombie genres and tells a story rich with classic themes such as 'be careful what you wish for' as well as the horrors of war and the effect it has on it's veterans. The plot centres on an American family with a son fighting in Vietnam. Around the same time that he's due home the family get the dreaded home visit from an army man who tells them that their son is dead. However after the mother's wishes for her son's safe return the family are delighted when he turns up on their doorstep. But the fact that he's a little worse for ware isn't down to his experiences in Vietnam and it turns out that the report of his death wasn't inaccurate...It has to be said that the film gets off to a slow start but it's never boring and director Bob Clark uses this time well to set up the situation which pays dividends once the real horror starts. Even though zombie films were popular around the time that this one was released it does manage to retain a lot of originality as it centres on just one zombie and his plight. The film takes influence from the classic short story 'The Monkey's Paw' and I can't blame scriptwriter Alan Ormsby for using it as a basis as it's a great story and most definitely one of horror's finest works. The influence that this film has had on cinema is modest but well felt with George Romero's semimasterpiece 'Martin' being the film to take most from it. The blood and gore on display isn't likely to satisfy the most hungry of gorehounds but what we do have is well used and the kill scenes are more shocking overall than they would have been if they were soaked in the red stuff. The makeup on the lead character is a major standout and it's not difficult to believe that it was done by the great Tom Savini. Overall Deathdream is a really good and original slice of horror and I wouldn't hesitate to name it as one of the best 'lesser' hits of the seventies.".

What this one really does well is the rather innovative use of dealing with the subject matter at hand detailing the condition afflicted here without really overexposing it all that much. By going with the symptoms here for PTSD as a lynchpin for the change in behavior here this manages a pretty remarkable feat of giving the film a realisticbased backstory motivation for the horrific behavior but also a thoroughly unique and creative one that doesn't seem all that farfetched here to possibly happen. Unfortunately the only other working part here is the film's two horror scenes where he traps and stalks a doctor in his office after realizing the truth and the finale where a thrilling encounter at a drivein leads to a frantic carchase through the streets of town with a flaming car and a nice crashstunt that makes this one all the more enjoyable as it's really the main part of this that works. Despite the originality of going with the backstory explanation for the film the biggest problem is that nothing of interest is done with it. The film tries to make it seem like being cold distant and completely devoid of interest in interacting with family or friends is cause for being the creepiest tactics imaginable and yet all they do is drag the film out with sceneafterscene of the same behavioral tendencies and nothing is done about it either his parents or anyone around him. Nothing about these are scary and when combined with the majority of time spent here detailing the family life where the dad becomes convinced something's wrong and the mother is in absolute denial about everything doesn't help matters by focusing on drama rather than horror because what's shown isn't that scary which makes her behavior seem overblown and needless while his just drags the film along lifelessly. This is furthered by the fact that the supposed mystery about the mysterious soldier being responsible for the early offscreen death here is so clumsily done that it's impossible to come to any other conclusion here other than he did it as the evidence is so clearcut and delivered in such a clumsy manner that the police look like incompetent fools for not seeing it making these go on for what seems like forever. The last big problem is that the film really only deals with horror elements in two scenes which are completely unscary that their effectiveness is really questionable especially the finale with the laughable makeup effects used here. These here are what really hurt this one overall.Rated PG Violence and Language.".

	schema:headline " Our Obsession with Voyeurism";
	schema:reviewBody "After viewing 'Rear Window' again I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.When watching 'Rear Window' it is better to imagine Alfred Hitchcock sitting in that wheelchair rather than Jimmy Stewart. When the camera is using longshots to watch the neighborhood it is really Hitchcock watching not Stewart. Hitchcock's love of voyeurism is at the center of this movie along with his fascination with crime and his adoration of the Madonna ideal.In many of Hitchcock's movies 'Rear Window' 'Vertigo' 'Psycho' 'The Birds' etc the blonde actresses are objects. Notice how rarely they get close with the male leads. In 'Vertigo' Stewart's character falls in love with the image of Madeleine in 'Psycho' we see the voyeur in Hitchcock peeking out of Norman Bates at Marion and in 'Rear Window' Jeff would rather stare out of his window than to hold the beautiful Lisa by his side. For Hitchcock these women are ideals that should be admired rather than touched.However the story of 'Rear Window' isn't about the image of women as it is in 'Vertigo.' 'Rear Window' focuses more on seduction of crime not in committing it but in the act of discovering it. At one point in the story Jeff's friend convinces him that there was no murder and Jeff is disappointed not because someone wasn't dead but because he could no longer indulge into his fantasy that someone was. Think how popular crime shows are on television and noir films at the movies. People do not want to commit crimes they want to see other people commit them.'Rear Window' is one of the most retrospective movies I've ever seen. In a span of two hours it examines some of the most recurrent themes in film. When we watch 'Rear Window' it is really us watching someone watch someone else. And all the while Hitchcock is sitting on the balcony and seeing our reaction. It is an act of voyeurism layered on top of itself and it allows us to examine our own behavior as we are spellbound in Hitchcock's world. The only thing that I feel is missing in the movie is a scene of Jeff using his binoculars and seeing himself in a mirror. Why did Hitchcock leave it out? Maybe because it would have been too obvious what he was doing. Or maybe he was afraid that the audience would see themselves in the reflection of the lens.".

	schema:headline " Another Hitchcock masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature not in the perverted sense but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with Vertigo' which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score as a cinematic accomplishment it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff James Stewart is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart Judith Evelyn we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa Grace Kelly.  In another scene Detective Doyle Wendell Corey sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase then Doyle's reaction and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says Be Careful Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella Thelma Ritter was digging up the garden?  Moreover wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the Ice Maiden' in her films yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between Psycho' 18 and Vertigo' 61.  I personally think more highly of Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction because I rated them both 1010. Rear Window' is a classic a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.".

I personally think more highly of Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction because I rated them both 1010. Rear Window' is a classic a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces Rear Window is a deep and entertaining classic with many strengths and a little bit of everything.  A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot and there are numerous subplots some humorous and some moving all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of filmmaking that like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot as good as that story is in itself.For the first 30 minutes or so we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful nononsense nurse who constantly sheds some light  sometimes unwanted  on what is happening between them.  The action and suspense that occur later serves in large part as a catalyst that resolves some of the important issues between the two.After we get to know the characters and their world things start to happen as Stewart becomes engrossed in some of the things he has seen.  The ethical and moral concerns of meddling in others' affairs become intertwined with more urgent questions about what may have happened in those other apartments and from then on the tension builds steadily.  It leads up to a riveting climactic sequence filled with suspense and made even more meaningful by our awareness of its deeper significance to the main characters.There is much more that could be said but you should see this for yourself. It is a classic that will be enjoyed not only by thriller fans but by anyone who appreciates carefully crafted movies with a lot of depth.".

Also I'm a fan of the Simpsons and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie Rear Window I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.Rear Window is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart he's just so great as L.B. I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn't even try but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines the way he looks and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement he is confined to a wheel chair but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B. he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly what a beauty! Beauty and talent what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B. because he is having doubts about marrying her and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.'s heart.I loved the ending to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won't tell you'll just have to trust me it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. Rear Window is a true classic and I'm extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let's keep this classic alive! 1010".

However the technical accomplishments explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laidup shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality  refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast too including Wendell Corey Raymond Burr in one of his last badguy roles before PERRY MASON and the scenestealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy Miss Torso then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year she will be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah it's a movie that's in IMDB's Top 20 and it has good reason to be. For starter's let's look at the simple premise  James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont Grace Kelly his officer friend Wendell and his nurse Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe from his rear apartment window and it is one of these  a Raymond Burr  who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie bar a couple of brief scenes is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this  he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see but never thankfully anything more than that  this is how you do suspense!. The set design is wonderful  the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries  an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows yeah they don't care much for curtains. There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives  there's a mini soapopera contained in the movie all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick onedimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role  he was born to it  and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face managing to effuse her character with both grace groan and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious. What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments and with whom we never actually interact with have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and in my opinion this is the best piece of work he's done that I've seen. It's virtually flawless and you're never let down or bored. Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar although he did have tough competition that year with On the Waterfront'.Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting script and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence. Regarded as a classic and deservedly so. 9.110".

But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silentfilm chills.  As L.B. Jeffries Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment the audience views right alongside him.  So for more or less 50 percent of the film the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.  As the thrills build in the second hour of the film there is considerably more dialog than the first hour.  This could and occasionally does present a challenge for the audience member that could either be accepted  payed off or resented can one sit back and just watch things unfold as in a film from the 20's?  Personally the experience of seeing these events unfold and increase was near electrifying.  Along with Stewart's performance which ranges from amusing to terrified compelling to frightened i.e. Hitch's 'everyday man' there's Grace Kelly as Lisa who carries her own beauty  inner conflicts and Raymond Burr as Thorvold who could have things going a little better with his wife.  If we empathize with Jeff it's because we become as much apart of his mindsetPOV as he already is and that's the ticket to the film's true success.  Not only is there a magnetic kind of skill to which Hitchcock and cinematographer Robert Burks presents us with the apartments' supporting and minor characters and how their fates are played out against the enclosed backdrop but the psychology of Jeff becomes parallel or against to the audience's.  This is the story of one man's temptation and compulsion to be involved with those he can see much like moviegoers have with any given film and how perception of the realities around him become ours.

	schema:headline " Rear Window describes Hitchcock at his best...";
	schema:reviewBody "Rear Window comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...Hitchcock demonstrates in Rear Window that he is a great voyeur that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...Speaking of technical challenge Rear Window is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...Hitchcock forces limitations on himself as he did in Lifeboat when he shot entirely on a restricted set in only one boat... And in Rope his first Technicolor film where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...Having restricted his movements Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call pure cinema.Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see closeups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...Rear Window describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels yet hides its own complexity... Stewart tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her though he himself does not seem to realize it...All the while the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives The tormented middleaged bachelor composersongwriter the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape the newlyweds and lovers the tragic Miss Lonelyhearts and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers the hearingimpaired sculptor working day and night the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer Miss Torso who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and most important the hysterical nagging wife  lying in bed  and her grouchy fedup husband a jewelry salesman...One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart  in her romantic dinner for two  raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of Rear Window a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees or think he sees what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing...

Like Stewart we are restricted in movements paralyzed inside the apartment immobile trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all aboutnot surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And of course all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character a voyeur by profession an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...When you see the film feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you...

	onyx:emotionText "Rear Window comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...Hitchcock demonstrates in Rear Window that he is a great voyeur that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...Speaking of technical challenge Rear Window is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...Hitchcock forces limitations on himself as he did in Lifeboat when he shot entirely on a restricted set in only one boat... And in Rope his first Technicolor film where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...Having restricted his movements Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call pure cinema.Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see closeups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...Rear Window describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels yet hides its own complexity... Stewart tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her though he himself does not seem to realize it...All the while the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives The tormented middleaged bachelor composersongwriter the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape the newlyweds and lovers the tragic Miss Lonelyhearts and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers the hearingimpaired sculptor working day and night the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer Miss Torso who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and most important the hysterical nagging wife  lying in bed  and her grouchy fedup husband a jewelry salesman...One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart  in her romantic dinner for two  raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of Rear Window a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees or think he sees what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fiance Grace Kelly and his nurse Thelma Ritter warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the too perfect too talented too sophisticated Grace Kelly...Rear Window is visually very strong...

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window wittily written by John Michael Hayes is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger the static confined Lifeboat and the cutless one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer more personal emotions. As such it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple a photographer James Stewart is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girlfriend Grace Kelly is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur which he probably already is to a degree and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's personality offering glimpses of potential past present and future selves and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors there is a childless somewhat patheticseeming middleaged couple who dote over a pet dog Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed aging spinster with no apparent friends and the young bachelor songwriter when he isn't trying to compose songs is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is understandably suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller a romance a mystery and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one and he knew exactly what he was doing everything happens as it should on time with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed it looks both artificial and realistic and seems almost to change at times as circumstances dictate. This is after Dial M For Murder Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here as a new more independent director was emerging decidedly postSelznick often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess moving people and things around here and there changing camera angles slyly never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture some of them quite silly all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film but it also aims to entertain it has a light touch and it can be scary it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in itit's a work of art.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick easy to understand addictively interesting featuring great stars Grace Kelly and James Stewart familiar bit players Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal. In this case Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open and some even slept on the fire escapeI've done that to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals. Bored beyond belief he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors. Meanwhile there is his girlfriend none other than Grace Kelly playing a too perfect socialite intent on winning his heart and soul. Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out that they are essentially incompatible she a socialite who always goes first class he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accommodations. Naturally the audience me! finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.Raymond Burr long TV's Perry Mason in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night. Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on. There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts the ardor of the newlyweds the angst of the songwriter the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty the pampered dog in a basket and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife. Hitchcock's America at midcentury. Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man. The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work. Dancing beauty's man looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform returns. The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties etc. Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch which is why I think he is so beloved. In the final scene Grace Kelly finding her man asleep puts down the adventure book she is reading for his benefit and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions. One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially marital reality.There is some tension and some mystery but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic. You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting. See it for Thelma Ritter the sadonic character actress of many films most notably this and All About Eve 1950.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:headline " The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "I think that Alfred Hitchcock's rear window is a fantastic movie. I'd go as far as to say that it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There are a few main aspects of the film that I would like to point out that sold me on this wonderful film the framing and filming techniques suspense building and pacing of the film were all perfect and made for an interesting thrilling and overall exciting display of some of theater's finest filming techniques that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. First the framing of the film was excellent. Upon first hearing the premise that the entire movie takes place from one man's room you might be hesitant. Such a boring consistent setting couldn't possibly make for an interesting film. But within the first few minutes of starting you find very quickly that these first impressions were very wrong. The film manages to build a complex active and very real world using just the room of main character photographer L.B. Jeff Jeffries and the view from his window. By cutting from shots of his apartment to the surrounding complex outside the movie manages to make you think there's more to this film than just Jeff's living room. On top of this the framing techniques used keep the film exciting. To start you never see more than Jeff can through his window this allows you to really connect with the characters and theorize about the events going on at the same time as they do. We'll talk more about this under pacing but the film always gives you just enough information to make you wonder what's really going on. Using what's not shown in frame as much as what is Hitchcock manages to keep you glued to the screen throughout the movie. This lasting interest is brought about just as much through the pacing and suspense of the film. While Jeff is looking out his window one day he notices some suspicious behavior from one of his neighbors and begins to think he has witnessed a murder. As the film continues the evidence of this is given to you in bits and pieces. You only see half the story and half to piece the puzzle together yourself along with the main characters who slowly start to believe Jeff's theories about his neighbor's actions. However with every bit of evidence towards the crime Jeff's detective friend strikes it down with a completely logical explanation leading Jeff and the audience along with him to believe that he might be delusional. Every plot point in the film is spaced beautifully so that every time you think you've figured it out some new idea or suspicious act comes up and throws you completely off. As Jeff slowly convinces more people that he's witnessed a murder there are always others who outright deny his ideas. Another point related to pacing is the building of suspense. The movie manages to subtly build suspense as the movie progresses resulting in a thrilling conclusion. One method it uses to do this is by confining our hero. Due to an accident at a race track Jeff is confined to the wheelchair in his room with a broken leg. He is unable to leave his room which is what results in him watching his neighbors through his rear window. The suspense continues to build as he watches helplessly as the events before him unfold. There's nothing he can do but watch it happen and try to make a convincing argument.  With all of these filming concepts combined Alfred Hitchcock was able to produce one of the best thrillers of all time certainly the best I've ever seen. It was intense interesting and kept me theorizing until the last second. With a great cast and exceptional production value I would easily recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic with an exciting plot and interesting premise that will keep you engaged and entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "I  first saw Rear Window about 4 years ago in a videofilm program that I was attending. At that time I was simply blown away by it.For starters I was simply impressed w the set. The fact that you can see out of Jeffries' apartment window across the courtyard and into the other tenant's apartments to see their goings on is incredible. The music used is a musician tenant  creating a piece. The fact that it ebbs and flows w the action until the very end when you actualy hear the finished piece committed to vinyl is really cool.I liked the fact that you only see what Jeffries sees and therefore have to try and guess what actually happened.While the movie in a way is actualy about nothing yet it is about voyeurism and to a lesser degree about love between two apparently different people. However that is a side line to the actual plot.for Hitchock this film uses suspense rather than gross thriller such as Psycho or the Birds did to draw you into the film. I've seen it many times and always get something out of it every time. I own a non restored copy on tape and watch it at least twice a yearor more.It's simply one of the best movies ever made that I've seen and one of my all time favorites. A near perfect movie if I say so myself.Hitchcock realy paid attention to detail in this movie. The fact that you see miss Lonely Hearts actions Even Lars Thorwald's action is incredible. The attention to detail is simply incredible.".

The style of acting he used now looks actorly.' His camera framing is well considered but unimaginative by today's standards. The stories are not engaging to me.But this film really is a classic. Not because of the acting or the dialog but because it was so cleverly conceived. And because the execution is so purely cinematic.The first problem a writerdirector faces is what stance the camera takes. Is it a fairly static audience' as if you were watching a play? Is it godlike in always seeing things from the best perspective though sometimes humanly impossible? Is it a character? Or does it follow a character sometime showing their point of view sometimes their reaction? Does it act?Do we admit the camera exists  by introducing jiggle or showing operator's functions like focusing developing? Do we dissolve the camera's perspective by juggling time or perspectives? Do we try a 100 simultaneous cameras' approach?Hitchcock usually uses the static theatrical approach  way too much for modern tastes. He punctuates this by sometimes doing a character focused shot and sometimes a spectacularforthetime godshot  as in the Psycho' shower scene.But this film is more purely conceived for the camera. There are no godshots. Nearly all the camerawork is from Jeff's eye or of Jeff's apartment with a few notable exceptions. What is novel is why this works  the set and entire story were composed backwards. That is instead of having some slice of life that the camera discovers this reality exists as if it were created by the camera before the action starts. Everything that is required to motivate the world is comprehensible from that apartment  the entire physics of this world is based on its center.In other words Hitchcock's achievement here is not how he accommodates the camera to the world but the world to the camera.Pure genius.".

	schema:headline " A Review on Rear Window";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window features a shocking neighborhood murder only to be uncovered by a peeping wheelchairbound photographer L.B Jefferies and his cover girl girlfriend Lisa Fremont. How we know such details from each character is due to Hitchcock's panning and fantastic sense of mise en scne. At the opening of the film what is first seen is the window the main character L.B. Jefferies spends his days looking out of. From there the camera's motion moves as if it were to float about the neighborhood catching the neighbors sleeping Jefferies his shattered camera and a magazine with his girlfriend on it. Without getting too into it Hitchcock had already planted important information into the viewer's mind without having to achieve the same thing through an extensive amount of dialogue. Very aware of what and how people and objects are placed he knew precisely what he was doing. One of the first things the viewer learns about the photographer is that he seems unhappy to be in a relationship with a 'perfect woman' he finds him and Lisa to be incompatible due the fact that the two come from different worlds. Each neighbor featured in a way relates to Jeffries's relationship situation or relationships in general. For example there was a moment where the shot was focused on Miss Lonelyhearts raising her glass to nobody and Jefferies did the same. This could because Not to mention the most obvious aspect of the film the one vantage point. Hitchcock creatively chose to limit the motion of the camera to the motion of the main character. Doing this it is impressive how he envisioned and conveyed what he wanted using other camera techniques. For example he used close ups on several neighbors to shift the focus onto them. In addition there were several closeups of both Jeffries and Lisa individually and together. The proximity in these shots along with the eye leveled position of the camera play a role in how intimate the viewer gets to the character including their feelings and emotions. This I believe creates a more intense feeling when suspense is reached towards the end of the film.The use of light is also intriguing. Its symbol of clarity and when not present obscurity. Having this in mind it is important to mention that whenever the characters had to hide from the gaze of Mr.Thorwald they would retreat into the darkness. In addition whenever Lisa came over to talk to Jeffries about the potential murder she would turn the lights on begging for him to stop scaring her and talking nonsense. However when she began to believe him she stood in the darkness alongside him. Lights were also turned off when Mr. Thorwald found Lisa with his wife's jewelry right before he attacked her. Not to mention that light was also used to fend away the big angry Thorwald from strangling Jefferies sooner. Besides that where the film stands in the beginning is drastically different to what it becomes later in the film. A man with relationship problems quickly turns to a gang attempting to catch a neighborhood murderer. However this change is not remotely noticed which makes it important to note. The suspense portrayed was incredible. The unsafe and dangerous measures that Lisa went through to invade the Thorwald apartment was only the beginning of a very hairraising intense ending. There were very sudden moments in between cuts where Lisa would be shown and the terrifying responses from Jefferies and Stella would also be shown right after. Meaning that there were moments where we couldn't see when Thorwald was coming or not. The film was an overall great thriller to experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad to see I'm not the only person who thought this movie was a stinker. How Hitchcock maintained his title of master of suspense after making this is beyond my comprehension. There is NO suspense in the movie. Jeffries suspects his neighbor is a killer and gollygeewillikers his neighbor IS a killer. Wow what a twist. I haven't been so underwhelmed since I saw The Burbs which is a far better movie and much more entertaining and Disturbia at least delivers some true action.Rear Window is so tepid you wonder if audiences of 1954 did not have a pulse. If they found this suspenseful they must have been hypnotized.Aside from the boring uneventful plot there are other serious issues with this movie. Stewart's relationship with Grace Kelly is totally unbelievable. He is 20 years older than she is. He should be flirting with someone his own age  namely Thelma Ritter who was about the same age as he. But Hollywood  even today  is always pairing old dudes with young women as if that happens every day in real life. Grace seems to have made a career of slobbering on old men  Gary Cooper Bing Crosby etc. What did people see in her anyhow?If Stewart really is a roughandtumble photojournalist you'd think he'd have a better physique. His nude chest is embarrassing to look at  the only thing more embarrassing is when he locks lips with Grace Kelly.One also wonders if Stewart's character was an idiot. He can't occupy himself any other way than spying on his neighbors? He doesn't know how to read? He doesn't have a TV? He can't listen to the radio? He IS in a wheelchair I thought the reason for a wheelchair was so the person could be mobile he is not bedridden.This movie might have had some success if it had been shot in blackandwhite. Then there could have been a noir thing going. But there is so much talk talk and more talk that I doubt even that could save it.Critics have also made a big deal of the voyeurism theme of this film as if that is truly shocking somehow. Again maybe that was a big deal in 1954 but in our day and age it is just yet another tired example of motion picture psychobabble.I admire Jimmy Stewart in Westerns  he was generally good in them. But every movie he made for Hitchock was embarrassing yes I include that turkey Vertigo in the group while this one is not quite as bad as The Man Who Knew Too Much it comes close. I hope I never have to sit through this again as long as I live!".

	schema:headline " Voyeurism Murder Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High";
	schema:reviewBody "It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films but 1954's Rear Window is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. Jeff Jefferies an adventure photographer wheelchairbound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors all strangers to him and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like Miss Torso and Miss Lonelyhearts. But his attention focuses on a suspicious whitehaired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot which seems farfetched at first but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script. Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in Vertigo but still likable even as he tries to reject his glamorous sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr prePerry Mason shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character. Robert Burks' probing camerawork makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark filmmaking style and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor even the slowmotion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras an hourlong documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work.".

	schema:headline " Alfred Hitchcock topnotch suspensethriller embroils a magazine photographer confined to wheelchair in killing";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock awesome intriguecomedy in which a magazine photographer seeks diversion in watching his neighbors  often with a telephoto lens and binoculars  discovering a possible murder . Thrilling flick with funny moments  nice acting  adequate settings and funny dialogue . The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses . It involves a bewildered as well as hapless wheelchair bound photographer James Stewart because of a broken leg who spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them Raymond Burr has committed murder his spouse and dismembered the body . The photographer soon enlists the help of his high society fashionconsultant sweetheart named Lisa Freemont Grace Kelly his visiting nurse called Stella Thelma Ritter and a Detective Wendell Corey to investigate the weird deeds .This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was one of the main Alfred Hitchcock films made for Paramount . In fact  at the time the set was the largest indoor set built at Paramount Studios . The entire picture was shot on one set which required months of planning and construction . The film was shot quickly on the heels of Dial M for murder 1954 November 27 1953February 26 1954 . Alfred Hitchcock's movies have become famous for a number of elements and special iconography  vertiginous height  blonde bombshells  voyeurism  long nondialogue sequences  a matter of mistaken identity etc . This charming as well as inventive mystery movie has these particularities  furthermore contains a fun intrigue  amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The first part of this production is slow and artificial  however  the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed . Interesting and intriguing screenplay adapted by John Michael Hayes based on a story by Cornell Woolrich . Screenwriter John Michael Hayes based Lisa on his own wife who'd been a professional fashion model when they married . The original story by Cornell Woolrich had no love story and no additional neighbors for L.B. Jeffries to spy on and those elements were created by Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks and he also was known for making his actors follow the script to the word and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an engaging as well as fun script . Very good acting by the great James Stewart as as a photographer who soon becomes convinced that one neighbor has killed his wife and Grace Kelly as gorgeous and elegant girlfriend  both of them make a marvelous duo . Grace Kelly made three of her eleven films with Hitchcock this film as well as Catch to a thief 1955 and Dial M for murder 1954 but Rear window film was thought of as the best . Excellent support cast such as Thelma Ritter  Wendell Corey  Kathryn Grant  Frank Cady and Raymond Burr . And of course  Hitch cameo  about a half hour into the film winding the clock in the songwriter's apartment. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks  Alfred's ordinary cameraman  showing nice images from studio . The film negative was considerably damaged as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s  nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded out. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration . Rousing as well as atmospheric score by the classic composer Franz Waxman .The motion picture was stunningly directed by maestro of thriller Alfred Hitchcock . The film was unavailable for decades because its rights were bought back by Alfred Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the infamous Five Lost Hitchcocks among film buffs and were rereleased in theatres around 1984 after a 30year absence. The others are The Man Who Knew Too Much 1956 The rope 1948 trouble with Harry 1955 and Vrtigo 1958. This essential and fundamental Hitchcock will keep fascinated and thrilling right up until the edgeofyourseat climax . And the American Film Institute ranked this as the 48 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked 3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Mystery in June 2008.".

So far I've sat through the 39 steps North by northwest Rear window and Psycho and so far only the latter has really entertained me. The premise of the film is great one....A guy laid up in bed believes he witnesses a murder from his bedroom window and goes about proving it. I like the idea but Stewart's inkling and further surmises are so fat outweighed by the evidence brought to his bedside that he'd be registered mentally ill if he'd continued with his allegations in real life...He is of course proved right! It reminds me a lot of 12 angry men of which I have the exact same criticism. WHERE'S YOUR GODDAM EVIDENCE!!!!So what is my problem with Hithcock? Well I guess I'm of an age where thrillers have been made as being a lot more gritty...see Se7en French connection and I suppose I'm basing my reaction to any other thriller upon what I've been brought up with. To me there is a whole heap of plotholes and lack of realism that I just feel the audience of the day must have been very naive. But that isn't the case as films such as 'M' and Casablanca to name but two have proved.OK so I understand that a film doesn't have to be realistic to be entertaining....Was the Wizard of Oz realistic...I don't think so and to be fair I did find this film relatively entertaining but I kept thinking it was supposed to be a thriller and those annoyances kept annoying me!!!!Maybe one day I will get it...Maybe one day I'll be watching this again and saying to my grandkids how great a film it is.....But I think it'll more likely be se7en or 'M'! May your thunder begin!".

And I am now interested in reading some of Cornel Woolrich's short stories from which this screenplay was created.  But still I was bored.Leaving behind the importance of this movie and only commenting on how it affected me I only give it a four out of ten.  On my personal rating scale that's counted as not great not horrible don't bother.  See it if you must.  It is after all one of the talked about films in certain circles. If you have not seen it and end up in one of those circles rest assured that the person extolling it's genius is most likely paraphrasing a magazine article he or she read last night and is not too sure what they are supposed to think about this one.".

I went on a bit of a rollercoaster ride myself regarding how I viewed this movie. When I first saw it on the big screen as a kid I was fascinated and almost terrified at the end. Years later watching it twice within five years on VHS I found it boring with Grace Kelly's dialog annoyingly corny and dated. Recently I viewed it again  a fourth try  and absolutely loved it. Next to Psycho it's now my favorite Hitchcock film.Yeah it's still dated quite a bit and in future viewings I might fastforward through a couple of talky parts with Kelly or Thelma Ritter. I would prefer to stick with the focus of the story namely Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment. That storyline is entertaining and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart is usually fun to listen to anyway. Kelly is there for looks.Speaking of dated can you imagine all the people in the apartments keeping their blinds open all the time and Stewart keeping his door unlocked all the time as well and people entering without bothering to knock first? True it was more trusting and safer world back then but it couldn't have been THAT transparent and trusting. Give me a break! Yet credibility aside it's so involving and fun to watch that who cares if doesn't make a lot of sense?".

I believe he is a better actor than Anthony Perkins however I found his performance to be so emotionally distant that I did not care a whit about happened to him. Supporting performances are outstanding especially Jason Robards as the Advocate and Anthony Hopkins as the prison chaplain.

After all books and films are different medias and thinking of how much is lost without the author's special language and distinct style  for an example  shouldn't a director try to make up for that loss by adding something unique for film?I would go for the latter. Otherwise your filmversion of an essential piece of literary work will be just that a version of an essential book not an essential film in itself.Of course this can cause a lot of controversy and there's no doubt that some directors have managed to completely ruin an excellent book when trying to make 'their own' version of it. BUT look for an example at 'A Clockwork Orange'. Burgess intricate play with language and manipulation of the reader  slowly taking him into Alex's world and way of thinking  simply will not be translated into film. So instead Kubrick used the unique opportunities of film and managed to combine the use of audio and vision to stunning effects. Kubrick managed to make something own out of it no question about it.And that's what I feel is missing in 'The Trial'. Yes it is a perfectly welldone job. I couldn't think of a more suitable actor for Josef K than Kyle 'Agent Dale Cooper' MacLachlan that's EXACTLY the way I envisioned him when reading the novel! Also the settings in Prague provides the movie with beautiful and suitable backgrounds. Though some scenes for lengths sake has been cut short it also stays true to the events in the novel and manages to catch some of the atmosphere in the novel. The movie is carried through very competent the actors are talented and there's a a nice 'Godfather'esque grainish color on top of it all. No this isn't a bad movie. On the contrary!But why shouldn't I rather read on the novel myself? Because what is really comes down to is this if a translation from one media to another is to be successful it can never be just a translation. It has to stand on it's own legs.And that's where this film fails. We aren't offered any new perspectives or different ideas on Josef K and his torments. Quite simply it's an enjoyable watch but probably holds appeal mostly to those who don't have the time or interest to read the novel instead.610".

He goes through the entire proceedings not knowing even what crimes he is being charge with.The bizarre court is a cavernous building where families children adulterous spouses and bullying thugs inhabit.

And the harder he fights the court the more deeply entrenched he becomes.Students of Kafka's literature will recognize the familiar themes man against an inhumane bureaucracy the eminant demise of man the demise of freedom at the expense of rules and regulations the literal use of metaphores and the ultimate doom of all humanity.Its not your average story but for those who are seeking something different I would heartily recommend it.".

Why bother with derivative stuff like 'Waiting for Godot' a pathetic attempt to infuse the tragedy with facile humour. Hopkins is perfectly cast as is the castle at Prague. Kafka sees the world the world of power and corruption so clearly but fails to see the redemption Epicurus and Ecclesiastes did.Perfect atmosphere cinematography and acting. The film is a delight.To short to be properly Kafkaesque but who would watch it if it were long enough? It avoids the problems of too literary a take that the film of Finnegan's Wake makes.We want to shout almost all the way through not 'Look behind you!' but 'What's the Charge?'This is not a film for the young. It lacks the obvious ennui that a teenager would seek and find from the book. It rather I think shows an adult understanding of our helplessness.We can love the void or hate it but we can't deny that it is there. If we can unlike the Kafka's antihero refuse to take it all at face value or more importantly at the apparently deep skulllevel value the bureaucrats would wish us to believe are real then we can live.I see Kafka as despite himself deeply lifeaffirming. The Castle Trail or Plague we see is only an illusion. As the gatekeeper says the door is open and is only there specially for us or for us to ignore.I'm delighted to have ignored the doors the gatekeepers and the controllers that would have had me imprisoned in my own mind.

Still McLaughlin is excellent as a confident terrified and confused man who's life is inexplicably changed when he his charged in an unknown place for an unknown crime. Hopkins and Robards as the Priest and legal counsel are in excellent form. Set during the time period when Kafka was alive to give the film a sense of place I strongly recommend this version of the story for someone who wants a little more scenery and a sense that Josef lives somewhere instead of just in some strange version of a modern town.".

I have not read the book and perhaps this is how it was supposed to be. The silliest thing I noticed about this film is that Anthony Hopkins took up the whole of my DVD cover and then only appeared for around 10 minutes of the about 2 hour film.

	schema:headline " Kafka Should See Us Today.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not easy to transpose Kafka to the screen. And he was unexpectedly a damned hard read in German class too. I dare anyone to make a movie about a man being refused entrance through a gate that was built solely for him to enter. What I mean is much of what goes on depends on trivial humdrum matters that are slightly cockeyed. Okay a man turns into a giant dung beetle. What do I do now Ma? In this very good adaptation of The Trial  better than Orson Welles' and Anthony Perkins'  that note of things being off kilter is effectively captured. The production has an oneiristic quality in which we are Kyle MacLachlen the only person who plays it straight indignant at being arrested by a couple of clowns who won't identify themselves or tell him what the charge against him is. But instead of taking MacLachlan to the Depot they let him spend the day working at his job in the bank then return to his apartment at night.He asks his landlady Juliet Stevenson in a peerless performance to be his advisor since he needs someone to help him face whatever trouble he's supposed to be in. She smiles coyly looks away from him and acts thoroughly distracted  exactly as figures do in a dream when you're trying to get their attention. It's not that easy to paint everyday interaction that preposterous without going overboard. Luis Bunuel managed it in one dream sequence in Los Olvidados when a mother turns to her child with a great big grin and offers him a slab of raw dripping meat. And a production team seemed to fall into it almost by accident in the cheap horror movie Carnival of Souls. Portentous things happen. Strangers want to take you away for no reason. People in other rooms are listening to you. The air reeks with paranoia. The very air you breathe is ominous. If Kafka were alive today he could write the same novel slipping only the clothes and furnishings out of Prague in the 1920s.Nobody can claim the movie sticks closely to Kafka's novel. It's all chopped up into inchoate bits and pieces like MacLachlan at the finish. Beautiful buxom women keep throwing themselves at MacLachlan's feet and begging him Kiss me. Make love to me. This happens to me all the time but I don't recall its happening to Joseph K.A bit of gratuitous nudity might have helped because in its second act the movie runs headlong into a problem often encountered by absurd stories. If anything can happen how can you build a dramatic structure out of it? What carries the viewer along? Certainly it's not Joseph K's character. He's no wimp so it's hard to feel he's being humiliated. He's defiant demanding and insulting not an inconvenient dung beetle. The movie begins with his arrest and ends with his pointless execution. I can't remember his ever asking what he's being charged with. He talks to several people along the way but they respond with gibberish.That doesn't detract from the performances which are just fine on everyone's part. Two cameos stand out. Jason Robards is a frail but sprightly lawyer. Anthony Hopkins appears in one scene as the prison chaplain who relates the parable of the man waiting forever before the gate of the law. Hopkins is simply magnetic. Nobody else could have told that simple paradoxical tale so grippingly.".

It looks great being very beautifully photographed and with settings that are both attractive and atmospheric. It's sensitively scored too without being too intrusive or lowkey. There are also a few good performances Anthony Hopkins steals the film even if his screen time is rather brief Juliet Stevenson is wonderfully authoritative and Jason Robards gives energy.However Kyle MacLachlan is very bland the character is not very interesting here but MacLachlan is lacking in screen presence and charisma. The rest of the cast don't stand out.Other big problems are some really leaden pacing that fails to give the film much life and a story that never ignites fire lacking the crucial darkness emotional power emotionally 'The Trial' is incredibly distant and is too academic disjointed and not always having cohesion. The script is also dull awkward and heavy handed. The direction is too staid.In conclusion while following the book closely it's a case that's not really a good thing and it just feels bland. 310 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie deals with the biography of Frida Kalho well performed by Salma Hayek  though Laura San Giacomo was originally set to play her but was dropped when fans objected to a nonMexican playing the role who after a terrible accident with a trolley causes herself a crippling injury  then she gets away from her parents Roger Rees and Patricia Spinola to live on the paintings . She falls in love with famed muralist Diego Rivera Alfred Molina  he gained 50 lbs  23 kg  for this character who bears a separated marriage to Valeria Golino . Later on  Frida is wedded to Diego and the troubles come out .The yarn relies heavily upon their tempestuous marriage  because the different artistic temperaments burst  creating a stormy relation . The picture is correctly based on historic deeds and even Edward Norton did an uncredited rewrite of the script . Thus  it appears Leon Trosky  who has romance to Frida  but he's murdered with a hatchet by Ramon Mercader and then is framed Diego Rivera  though later being absolved . Besides  there are several famous people  Siqueiros Antonio Banderas  Nelson Rockefeller Edward Norton  Leon Trosky Geoffrey Rush and others very secondaries such as Andre Breton or Josephine Baker . Frida is specially known by her mustachioed and onebrow paintings and Rivera by his impressive murals and one of them was ordered to break by Nelson Rockefeller but reflected to famous communists on the Rockefeller Center . The film was perfectly directed by Julie Taymor and includes magnificent cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto as when imaginatively brings to life the scenes on the Kalho's paintings  where the color is glimmer and spellbound . The motion picture attained success and achieved enough box office  obtaining two Oscars for the awesome Musical Score Elliot Goldenthal and Makeup . Rating  Above average . Well Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " gripping performance by Hayek";
	schema:reviewBody "Salma Hayek unibrow and all gives a genuinely great performance as Frida' the Mexican artist who is more famous perhaps as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right  although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.Frida Kahlo was a woman who endured a life of crippling pain caused by a trolley accident in her youth yet her innate energy passion and love of life  as well as her enormous abilities as a painter  allowed her to overcome that daunting obstacle to achieve a measure of fame and recognition.  What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous lovehate relationship with Rivera which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting.  In many ways Frida' is a typical artist bio highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as Pollock' and Surviving Picasso' both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures.  Frida' however since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme.  Frida in many ways prides herself on her independent fiery nature yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms.  She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her.  Thus she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without.  That the relationship is one of utter codependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera even after their numerous breakups keeps coming back to his one true love.Based on the Hayden Herrera biography the Clancy SigalDiane LakeGregory NavaAnna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life.  We see for instance the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico right before his assassination.  We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.If for no other reason Frida' is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the in' cause for the art world to rally around  at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced.  Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core. We witness for instance Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings.  When Rockefeller the personification of capitalism balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses the film makes an interesting companion piece to The Cradle Will Rock' from a few years back.   We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.As Frida Hayek literally carries the film.  Tender and vulnerable one moment she can become fiery and selfconfident the next.  Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime  and which often became the central subject of much of her art.  Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure.  His seeming worldweariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply which apparently few in his life  apart from Frida  were ever able to see.  Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powersthatbe whom he claims to despise Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time.  Geoffrey Rush unfortunately is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story. The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings.  Sometimes it works sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction.  Still Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.All in all Frida' provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine  and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it.".

And often it's always the same Heshe was born had a difficult childhood created some masterpieces had some affairs usually with actorsactresses orand musicians and dies a sad and lonely death. But what a refreshing difference Frida was! Frida Kahlo's life was more suffering than joy yet the movie does not pity her all the time but shows Frida's lust for life love art and her husband Diegor Riviera.It tells the story of a really unusual life When Frida is a student young beautiful full of live and in love with a gorgeous boy Diego Luna from Y tu mama tambien and Dirty Dancing  Havanna Nights she experiences a horrible accident when her bus crashes with a tram. Frida then becomes a cripple for the rest of her life but through this she experiences herself in a new way and starts to paint mostly selfportraits where she deals with her pain her family political situations and people she loves. Soon after the accident a miracle happens Frida learns to walk again and the first thing she does is to visit the famous artist and painter Diego Rivera to ask his opinion about her paintings  the beginning of an unusual and often complicated love story that should last a lifetime.We get to learn a woman who experiences so many tragic things in life that it should be enough to commit suicide yet she never gives up grows stronger and one thing that certainly helps her through hard times is her wit her dignity and her love for life and art. She takes what she wants and needs which also includes love affairs with men and women but has also a lot to give. Plus her works so honest brutal but also beautiful in their truth reveal one of the greatest talents of our time.A whole lot of this movie works of course through its female protagonist whose role is not that easy and a real challenge sometimes. The wonderful and graceful Salma Hayek who is immensely gifted does really great work here and awakes Frida and her world to life again. Hayek perfectly holds the balance between triumphs and losses joy and sorrow madness and daily routine life and death. She is just a pleasure to watch she doesn't play Frida she IS Frida. Another important character is of course Diego Rivera the greatest love of Frida's life. Alfred Molina a great British actor is perfectly casted for this role and besides has a remarkable resemblance to the real Diego. Outstanding performances also by the supporting cast Valeria Golino Ashley Judd with a great imitation of the Mexican accent Geoffrey Rush and Edward Norton.Frida  a feast for the senses full of life and exploding emotions and a tribute to a truly unique and remarkable woman who was the greatest female artist of the last century!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Frida' is a rich and passionate account of two celebrated Mexican artists whose lives were bound up with major events of the 20th centurythe Mexican and Russian Revolutions... The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak love and betrayal...Frida and Diego are two dynamic artists of extraordinary and diverse talents... While Diego's work is more public and monumental Frida's paintings are grotesque and intimate on a much smaller scale...The film chronicles Frida's audacious selfintroduction to the great muralist Diego Rivera and her physical ailments... There is pain in this woman's life a pain she don't deserve to have a pain no one deserves to have... There's a line in the film where Kahlo says 'at the end of the day we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strongwilled female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him by playing practical jokes by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife Lupe Marin Valeria Golino.But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself a charming amateur. She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain anger and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen what we get instead is a love story a tale of Frida's romantic and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...Londonborn actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a wellknown womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s with its native markets textiles music and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting movie but less interesting perhaps than the reactions it draws.First the nuts and bolts review.  Selma Hyack does a great job portraying the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo who marries puts up with and in some ways maybe even excells famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.  It's a tough role and Hyack seems to let it all hang out in many ways.Alfred Molina is good but not great as Rivera and the rest of the supporting cast also performs well including a cameo appearance by Ashley Judd as Italian bornphotographer and leftwing activist Tina Modotti.The direction is crisp and effective throughout and the colors and ambiance of the film are simply great.  This is a movie about artists and it fullfills the first requirement of art.  It is visually stunning to look at.What intrigues me is the heated debate this generates among those who know and admire Frida.  It may well be impossible for anyone to make a bio picture that satisfies purists those who are quite familiar with the subject matter.  But purists have to realize that movies are too expensive and difficult to make this one took decadesfor the moviemakers to concentrate on such a small audience.  They have to look at the big picture and make a film that is understandable to mass audiences or else count on losing millions of dollars.For myself I knew next to nothing about Frida Kahlo only that I had seen some of her paintings and that she was Rivera's wife.  Since I like Rivera's work I went to see the film. But I knew more about Tina Modotti when I walked into the theater than I did about Frida.Whether this was an accurate portrayal of her character and life I haven't a clue. But I do feel I came away knowing a lot more about her than I used to.My single gripe is that the film seemed to make Frida take a back seat to her husband when it came to art. She is portrayed as someone who is very unsure about the value of her own work.  But I can't get too mad about that because Frida may have been that way in real life for all I know.I am a leftist politically but I think we often get much too caught up in politics and rhetoric and often assign political meanings to things when they don't apply.  It is very very complicated to make a biography and no 2 hour film is going to capture every facet of a complex person's personality mucy less cover every aspect of their lives.OverallI'd say Frida accomplished its limited mission. It told me something about an artist I knew little about. I will now look for more of her work.  I provided me with some fine acting direction etc. And perhaps best of all allowed me to spend two hours in Mexican culture in some way shape or form.  I enjoyed the experience.".

But I can't get too mad about that because Frida may have been that way in real life for all I know.I am a leftist politically but I think we often get much too caught up in politics and rhetoric and often assign political meanings to things when they don't apply.  It is very very complicated to make a biography and no 2 hour film is going to capture every facet of a complex person's personality mucy less cover every aspect of their lives.OverallI'd say Frida accomplished its limited mission. It told me something about an artist I knew little about. I will now look for more of her work.  I provided me with some fine acting direction etc. And perhaps best of all allowed me to spend two hours in Mexican culture in some way shape or form.  I enjoyed the experience.";

I read the book several years ago  have been a Frida fan ever since.I heard an interview wHayden on NPR not too long ago talking about her book  the movie adaptation.  She did years  years of research on Frida and is probably as close to an 'expert' on her life as we could come across in the year 2003.  She praised Julie Taymor for this film and was quite happy with her adaptation. Reading the reviews on this page i find it hard to believe that there are critics of this movie.  Everything from the music beautiful! to the cinematography to the acting . . . greatness!!  Selma really put her heart  soul into this role and she has now made her way onto my list of 'favorite actresses'. It would be hard to put anyone's life onto the big screen  get every single detail right on  esp. someone who lived 50 years ago. I think Julie Taymor has done an amazing job of representing the life of Frida.".

Yes Salma Hayek inhabits the character of Frida and makes it entirely her own. But Alfred Molina's portrayal of her overweight philandering husband really brings this movie to life. History is important to this movie also. Although removed from the turbulent events dominating European politics in the 1930s Mexico embraces the ideology that will soon tear Europe apart and reflects that ideology in its art. Diego Rivera as portrayed by Molina is certainly a greater lover of women and painting than he is of political ideology but the fact that he plays host to the exiled Trotsky shows that he is willing to put himself in harms way for the sake of his political principles. Trotsky is played charmingly by Geoffery Rush and his introduction to the story sends Diego and Frida's marriage to another level. This movie never fails to surprise you and if you have not seen it yet you should.".

As a testament to Kahlo's art this film is magnificent and its director Julie Taymor is herself a cinematic artist so keen is her eye for detail and colour.The film spans the life of Mexican artist Frida from age 18 in 1925 just before the near fatal bus accident that almost killed her and left her badly injured for the remainder of her life until her death in 1954 aged 49. It portrays the complicated relationship between her and Rivera at the time Mexico's most famous artist and communist and presents a picture of a fascinatingly rich life that included love affairs with Leon Trotsky and Josephine Baker.Salma Hayek plays Frida and is perfectly cast as are many of the other actors who physically resemble the people they play. One of the criticisms levelled at the film is that it is not in Spanish. This is a legitimate criticism as many of the cast especially the bit players are Mexican. It is deeply ironic that Frida who so identified with indigenous Mexico has her story told in English by an international cast. Nonetheless the film is wellmade with authentic set design and captures the spirit of Frida's time.Taymor illustrates Kahlo's creative life as much as her colourful existence often using Frida's own paintings to create scenes. For example when Diego and Frida wed for the first time they later divorce only to remarry Frida's wedding portrait entitled 'Frida and Diego Rivera' 1931 represents the exchange of vows. First we see a still of the painting then the painting in animation before this gives way to the actors in scene. Moments like this pepper the film a clever device that constantly reminds us of Frida the artist.The film evokes the painful existence of Frida's physical life again using her paintings to heighten the audience's sense of her injured body. There are many moving moments such as the miscarriage Frida suffered and the baby in bits the steel girdle that encased her torso to support her spine in later life and her twilight years when she was bedridden. Her life was truly a triumph over adversity.Frida's paintings are described in the film as agonised poetry on canvas this poignant line aptly sums up the 'agonised poem' that Taymor paints of Kahlo's brief life.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing corny uninformative confused and clichridden";
	schema:reviewBody "Having studied the history of art academically for five years at college and university I was aware of Kahlo only vaguely as a shadowy player on the fringes of the Surrealist movement. I was familiar with a few of her selfportraits and knew about the appalling accident that had such an impact on her life. My first criticism of this movie is that it adds very little to this outline. Very old fashioned in style making repeated use of corny montage sequences to depict happy periods of the artists life. Many of the scenes such as the argument between Diego Rivera and Roberto Siqueros have a We Are History quality about them ...and now comrade Danton it is time for the French Revolution! We see nothing of the intellectual context of Kahlo's existence merely hoary old clichs about the passions of the vierevolutionairre! Nor later is it mentioned what became of Rivera's being suspected in the assassination of Trotsky. Nor was it mentioned that Siqueros was suspected of the first botched attempt on Trotsky's life.Whilst Salma Hayek manages to look something like Kahlo albeit more attractive even with that giant cyclops eyebrow her enacting the teenage schoolgirl Frida is risible. Hayek is a gorgeous curvaceous mature woman. As a schoolgirl she was entirely unbelievable. In common with most movies about artists this one made almost no effort to try to get inside why the artist made the work that she did. We instead get more or less the old romantic clich of the artists spontaneous and unaccountable stream of invention. There is no explanation of the undoubted fact that Kahlo was part of the Global Surrealist diaspora. No clue as to the influence upon her imagery of such painters as Paul Delvuax Rene Magritte  Dorothea Tanning and Giorgio DeChirico. No hint therefore that her work was part of a global movement rather than being simply some idiosyncratic flash in the pan. These influences on Kahlo are immediately apparent to anyone familiar with those artists' work but to others not so versed some indication of that influence is needed if we are to see what she painted in context. If we are to understand for example that she may be seen as having taken the techniques of Surrealism and applied them to a very different sense of the subconscious and the mind than had it's mainly Francophone mainly male originators. Otherwise it appears as I say unaccountably idiosyncratic arbitrary solecistic and perverse. We are given no sense of Kahlo's mental landscape her intellectual concerns or her taking on such issues. Nothing to indicate that in fact her art makes that of husband Rivera the genius seem plodding dullard and dated. There is no real attempt to address the possibility that Kahlo was a talented and intelligent woman overshadowed by an egoistic oaf. We are not even given any hint that she had an intellectual landscape or indeed anything going on in her head apart from lust and jealousy! And even this is treated in a trivialising and prurient lesbianromp style.Instead of any such guidance or context what we are treated to is a collection of visual gags tricks and tromploel animations of selected images that serve only to sprite up the story and divert our attention from the virtual absence of the real paintings. This is the stuff of popvideo's rather than any serious attempt to understand an artist. The very nadir is reached when a foolish cavalcade of cutandpaste images lifted from various paintings rolls across the screen in advertisement of the directors absolute lack of understanding of visual art. You cannot divorce a detail of a painting from the rest and expect it to still equal the whole.Faint attempts to show the continuous influence of physical pain upon Kahlo's iconography are undermined by the fact that said pain is occasionally referred to but almost not shown at all. Kahlo here never once actually looks like she has so much as a headache let alone persistent ischemic and anatomical agony as a result of dozens of simultaneous fractures and tissue damage caused by being smashed to bits in a collision and impaled by a three foot steel bar! We are notified that this is the case. It is stated. But we are not given any real sense that the character we see is actually experiencing the persistent aftermath of such a trauma. Through most of the film she appears to be just swell! As happy as Larry! Tip top old bean. Only near the end do we see a few winces and a bit of a stagger appear. Yet we are told that the pain is omnipresent and we know that her paintings dwell on this. So why does this director so utterly fail to show us anything that connects the facts with the depiction! There is nothing here to disavow me of my suspicion that Kahlo has been given such extensive attention as she has received in the past twenty years merely on account of her being a a woman in a man's world  that of latino machismo and revolutionary artists  and b one of the few well known artists from the third world. There was nothing here to contradict my suspicion that the attention accorded this artist has largely been lead by feminists and leftist revisionaries on the basis of what they would like Kahlo to have been rather than what she actually managed to be.I would have liked to have discovered otherwise. But I did not discover otherwise by watching this movie.".

	schema:headline " Four pillars on which the film is constructed sexuality politics art pain";
	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilersThe innate problem of looking at a film based on a true story is that there is not going to be a consensus on whether the personalities and facts are faithfully reflected particularly the personalities. This seems to be particularly the case when you look at the various comments on Frida. Having acknowledged this problem however I shall not dwell on it but will go directly to the four aspects cited in the summary line.Sexuality in Frida the film has attracted too much discussion which is not surprising given the attention the filmmakers have paid to it. Within this aspect there is a variety of themes.Look first at Diego Rivera who is physiologically incapable of fidelity. The film goes to a considerable extent to demonstrate this point. However over the years since Benjamin Braddock and Mrs. Robinson's time the saying that having sex is like shaking hands has become banal.Of Frida Kahlo's occasional homosexual tendencies repeated references approach the point of being irksome. Starting right from the beginning when she dresses as a boy for the family portrait we see further hints in the exquisitely crafted dance scene with Tina Modotti Ashley Judd then more explicit treatment in New York when Gracia claims that Firda is even better than her husband building up to a grand finale in Paris.Yet another theme on sexuality is the exploration of the sexual relationship between an elderly man and a relatively younger woman. While this one is less frequently tackled a good example can be found in an excellent treatment and performance by Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon in Atlantic City. In comparison Frida's relationship with Leon Trotsky is more transient but sufficiently interesting to leave an impression.Politics purportedly constitutes quite an important part of Frida's life. The treatment of this aspect in the film however verges on an interpolation into the sexuality aspect an interpolation that is often so abrupt as to leave the film a little disjointed. Politics as an important part of Frida's life has not come out clearly. At times it is more like an afterthought.Similarly Frida Kahlo's stature as a legendary painter has not been fully projected on the screen. One reason maybe that during most of the duration of the film she is under the shadow of Diego Rivera. There is perhaps also the distraction of the other aspects. For whatever reason the prerception of Frida Kahlo the great painter somehow does not seem to project as much as one might expect in this film.In the final analysis is it not true that Firda Kahlo's life was really shaped by her enduring the unendurable physical pain day in day out? If that is the case the audience has not been led fully into this inner world of suffering. After witnessing what appears to be an amazing recovery from the accident the audience goes on to share her colourful and turbulent life which she meets head on with vibrant energy and zeal. The full magnitude of her punitive predicament is not brought home until close to the end when at the top of the mini pyramid she intimates to Leon Trotsky the true depth of her pain.On casting I must say it's splendidly done. Oscar nominee Salma Hayek and equally impressive Alfred Molina consistently complement each other's performance. The Kahlo family father mother and sisteris superbly portrayed by an ensemble of talented Central and South American artists not generally known to the global audience. Also deserving mentioning is the role of Diego Rivera's first wife played by Italian actress Valeria Golino I think.The globally better known members of the cast are basically in cameo roles except for Geoffrey Rush who plays Leon Trotsky. Of the remaining three Ashley Judd playing the flamboyant Tina Modotti has relatively more scope and is excellent. Interesting to see how her southern accent in Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood has gone even further south! The appearance of Antonio Bandaras and Edward Norton as David Alfaro Sequeiros and Nelson Rockefeller respectively albeit brief would give a degree of satisfaction to people looking for some Hollywood flavor.Tony Award winner The Lion King director Julie Taymore who is also well versed in mime and puppetry took on Frida as her second fullscale cinema motion picture. Other than faint traces here and there the film does not betray her stage background. Interesting to note that there is a degree of surrealism in her handling of certain scenes such as Frida waking up to the gravity of her injuries after the accident and her first impression of New York City. We also see scenes with a hypnotic blend of music and image. There is a pervasive aesthetic quality throughout the film.In conclusion althought not everybody's cup of tea Frida has enough to interest the general audience and intrigue some.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frida Kahlo Salma Hayek is an tempestuous teenager when  she suffers a bus accident in Mexico. Her column and leg have multiples fractures and she is impaled by a metal bar. Her father and mother spend all the money they have in surgeries and treatments and in the end also due to her will and strength she walks again. Frida shows her paintings to the famous painter intellectual and communist Diego Rivera Alfred Molina to criticize them. He finds them excellent and they become friend lovers and get married to each other. Diego is very unfaithful to her and has many night stands with his models but when he has an affair with Frida's sister Cristina their marriage ends and they divorce. In the 30's Leon Trotsky Geoffrey Rush gets political asylum in Mexico and is lodged with his wife in the house of Frida's parents. Frida and Trotsky have an affair when Trotsky's wife ask him to move to another place. Rivera moves to USA and Frida has a gangrene in her toes. They are amputated and Frida gets worse and worse using pain killers steel jackets and other treatment. But she starts painting maybe her best pictures. Rivera comes back to Frida and gets married with her for the second time and stays with her until her death. The story of this Mexican artist is wonderfully presented in this movie with a stunning performance of Salma Hayek. Frida is showed as a great artist revolutionary human being having a great sexuality feeling pain due to her accident but having a great pleasure in life. All the cast and the direction are excellent. The theme song Burn It Blue' from the Brazilian Caetano Veloso is wonderful and won the Oscar. The makeup also won an Oscar. An excellent entertainment indicated for any audience. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Frida'".

Alfred Molina normally a brilliant chameleonic actor who vanishes into whatever role he plays seems strangely inert.

Even the trip to New York is a cheap unsatisfying pastiche of flat graphics that any high school film studio could put together.

	schema:headline " More lively Frida";
	schema:reviewBody "If compared the former version of the director Paul Leduc with the present one of Julie Taymor one should acknowledge that this version is more attractive for most of the fans of cinema. The former one is very original since there were no dialogues in the film but you should know something about Frida in order to understand the person and the context where she developed herself. Here Salma Hajek reflects all virtues and sins of this Mexican revolutionary woman. It was also easy to see the existing differences between two famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera Alfred Molina and Alfaro Siqueiros Antonio Banderas. The first one was an anti Stalinist while Siqueiros followed the orders of the Soviet dictator. Both were violent men.

	onyx:emotionText "If compared the former version of the director Paul Leduc with the present one of Julie Taymor one should acknowledge that this version is more attractive for most of the fans of cinema. The former one is very original since there were no dialogues in the film but you should know something about Frida in order to understand the person and the context where she developed herself. Here Salma Hajek reflects all virtues and sins of this Mexican revolutionary woman. It was also easy to see the existing differences between two famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera Alfred Molina and Alfaro Siqueiros Antonio Banderas. The first one was an anti Stalinist while Siqueiros followed the orders of the Soviet dictator. Both were violent men. Siqueiros and other communists pro Stalin were in fact responsible for the barbarian murder of Trotsky. In the case of Frida she was well represented by Salma Hayek as a revolutionary left wing of doubtful communist ideas lesbian and intensive lover. The disorder of her marriage with Rivera it is well shown in the film as well as their incredible love for each other.";

Frida is objectified and marginalized into cliches that we can easily dispose of into trash cans. The Film Frida tries to be on par with films such as Polluck or Lust for LifeVan Gogh Kurt Douglas which show the passion and reasons why these tortured masters painted the way they did. Instead the audience gets to see a whore a drunk and empty deformed characture that is pale in comparison to the real person. Frida was revolutionary because she painted such beauty in a time when everyone copied Picasso Pop and Polluck. Frida's use of color stands far above her contemporaries. Diego Rivera painted Frescos when no one was. Instead the film choose to show You are who you have Sex with instead of the Artist.

	schema:headline " Underrated but still not entirely realized";
	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the 1946 film which starred Lana Turner and John Garfield is significantly better than its reputation. The script adapted from James M. Cain's first novel is by the awardwinning playwright David Mamet while the interesting and focused cinematography is by Sven Nykvist who did so much exquisite work for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. An excellent cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange whose cute animal magnetism is well displayed. Bob Rafelson who has to his directorial credit the acclaimed Five Easy Pieces 1970 and The King of Marvin Gardens 1972 both also starring Jack Nicholson captures the raw animal sex that made Cain's novel so appealing and shocking to a depressionera readership and brings it up to date. Hollywood movies have gotten more violent and scatological since 1981 but they haven't gotten any sexier. This phenomenon is in part due to fears occasioned by the rise of AIDS encouraged by the usual blue stocking people. Don't see this movie if sex offends you.Lange is indeed sexy and more closely fits the part of a lowermiddle class woman who married an older man a caf owner for security than the stunning blonde bombshell Lana Turner who was frankly a little too gorgeous for the part. John Colicos plays the caf owner Nick Papadakis with clear fidelity to Cain's conception. In the 1946 production the part was played by Cecil Kellaway who was decidedly English indeed they changed the character's name to Smith. Also changed in that production was the name of the lawyer Katz to Keats. One wonders why. My guess is that in those days they were afraid of offending Greeks on the one hand and Jews on the other. Here Katz is played by Michael Lerner who really brings the character to life.Jack Nicholson's interpretation of Cain's antihero an excon who beat up on the hated railway dicks while chasing any skirt that came his way the kind of guy who acts out his basic desires in an amoral animalistic way was not entirely convincing perhaps because Nicholson seems a little too sophisticated for the part. Yet his performance may be the sort better judged by a later generation. I have seen him in so many films that I don't feel I can trust my judgment. My sense is that he's done better work particularly in the two films mentioned above and also in Chinatown 1974 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975 and such later works as The Shining 1980 and Terms of Endearment 1983.The problem with bringing Postman successfully to the screen is twofold. One the underlying psychology which so strongly appealed to Cain's depressionera readership is not merely animalistic. More than that it reflects the economic conflict between the established haves as represented by the greedy lawyers the wellheeled insurance companies the implacable court system and the simpleminded cops and to a lesser degree by property owner Nick Papadakis himself and the out of work victims of the depression the havenots represented by Frank and Cora who had to marry for security. Twoand this is where both cinematic productions failedthe film must be extremely fastpaced almost exaggeratedly so to properly capture the spirit and sense of the Cain novel.

	onyx:emotionText "This remake of the 1946 film which starred Lana Turner and John Garfield is significantly better than its reputation. The script adapted from James M. Cain's first novel is by the awardwinning playwright David Mamet while the interesting and focused cinematography is by Sven Nykvist who did so much exquisite work for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. An excellent cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange whose cute animal magnetism is well displayed. Bob Rafelson who has to his directorial credit the acclaimed Five Easy Pieces 1970 and The King of Marvin Gardens 1972 both also starring Jack Nicholson captures the raw animal sex that made Cain's novel so appealing and shocking to a depressionera readership and brings it up to date. Hollywood movies have gotten more violent and scatological since 1981 but they haven't gotten any sexier. This phenomenon is in part due to fears occasioned by the rise of AIDS encouraged by the usual blue stocking people. Don't see this movie if sex offends you.Lange is indeed sexy and more closely fits the part of a lowermiddle class woman who married an older man a caf owner for security than the stunning blonde bombshell Lana Turner who was frankly a little too gorgeous for the part. John Colicos plays the caf owner Nick Papadakis with clear fidelity to Cain's conception. In the 1946 production the part was played by Cecil Kellaway who was decidedly English indeed they changed the character's name to Smith. Also changed in that production was the name of the lawyer Katz to Keats. One wonders why. My guess is that in those days they were afraid of offending Greeks on the one hand and Jews on the other. Here Katz is played by Michael Lerner who really brings the character to life.Jack Nicholson's interpretation of Cain's antihero an excon who beat up on the hated railway dicks while chasing any skirt that came his way the kind of guy who acts out his basic desires in an amoral animalistic way was not entirely convincing perhaps because Nicholson seems a little too sophisticated for the part. Yet his performance may be the sort better judged by a later generation. I have seen him in so many films that I don't feel I can trust my judgment. My sense is that he's done better work particularly in the two films mentioned above and also in Chinatown 1974 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975 and such later works as The Shining 1980 and Terms of Endearment 1983.The problem with bringing Postman successfully to the screen is twofold. One the underlying psychology which so strongly appealed to Cain's depressionera readership is not merely animalistic. More than that it reflects the economic conflict between the established haves as represented by the greedy lawyers the wellheeled insurance companies the implacable court system and the simpleminded cops and to a lesser degree by property owner Nick Papadakis himself and the out of work victims of the depression the havenots represented by Frank and Cora who had to marry for security. Twoand this is where both cinematic productions failedthe film must be extremely fastpaced almost exaggeratedly so to properly capture the spirit and sense of the Cain novel. Frank and Cora are rushing headlong into tragedy and oblivion and the pace of the film must reflect that. A true to the spirit adaptation would require a terse streamlined directorial style with an emphasis on blind passions unconsciously acted out something novelist Cormac McCarthy might accomplish if he directed film. I think that Christopher Nolan who directed the strikingly original Memento 2000 could do it.For further background on the novel and some speculation on why it was called The Postman Always Rings Twice Cain's original apt title was BarBQue see my review at Amazon.com.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

However there is one problem standing in the way Cora is married unhappily married but married nonetheless.Aside from an intriguing story The Postman Always Rings Twice is a wonderfully put together film as Rafelson does a splendid job delving into the characters and their relationships as well as examining the problems associated with forbidden love.  As a viewer you truly feel the passion between Lange and Nicholsonwho both won academy award nominations and you almost feel for their pain.  In the 1930's women in America were at quite a different position than they are today.  They were expected to stay with the husband no matter what the circumstances as divorce was quite uncommon.  Lange was very convincing as this trapped 30's woman who eventually broke free the only way she knew possible..I definitely recommend The Postman Always Rings Twice for any fan of entertaining and thoughtprovoking movies.  Although the character development is not quite as extensive as some of Rafelson's early work particularly the 1971 classic Five Easy Pieces the movie combines an intriguing screenplay with superb acting to make its own statement.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to understand how attractive it must have seemed to make a 1980s movie of The Postman Always Rings Twice. James M Cain's famous depressionera melodrama had already been successful as a book 1934 and a movie 1946 and a 1980s version could obviously benefit from the advantages of being made in colour and at a time when censorship constraints would be far less strict than they had been in 1946. The result is a production in which this story of lust adultery murder blackmail and the hand of fate is told in a style which is far more raw gritty and explicit than the 1946 movie.Frank Chambers Jack Nicholson is a drifter who stops for a meal at a remote countryside diner  filling station somewhere outside L.A. and decides to stay a little longer after catching sight of the establishment's attractive cook called Cora Jessica Lange. Cora's the wife of Nick John Colicos who's the considerably older Greek proprietor of the business. Nick offers Frank a job as a mechanic and soon Cora and Frank are involved in a passionate affair.After the couple fail in an attempt to run away together they decide to murder Nick. They succeed at the second attempt but soon Cora is put on trial for the crime. The prosecuting attorney succeeds in getting Frank to betray Cora but some slick work by her lawyer results in her being acquitted. After the trial Frank and Cora resume their relationship and a succession of surprising developments culminate in a tragic conclusion.Frank is a man whose misfortunes don't simply emanate from his weakness or the consequences of making a wrong turn in his life. He's a violent petty criminal who's driven by lust but nevertheless seems more in control of his destiny than is typical of a noir protagonist. In this version of the story in an interpretation which is probably more realistic he's more cynical and brutal than John Garfield's 1946 incarnation and as a result is a far more unsympathetic character.Jessica Lange's Cora is also different from Lana Turner's as she seems much too strong and spirited to be as trapped as she claims and also doesn't have the kind of mystique or ambiguity which makes it seem credible that she could've been harbouring dark thoughts about killing Nick for some time.The ways in which the characters of Frank and Cora have been changed is interesting to watch but the same can't be said of the changed ending which lacks both the irony of the original and its significance to the story's title.This movie is strong on atmosphere and intensity and convincingly evokes the period in which the action is set. Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange are excellent in their roles and the supporting cast particularly John Colicos is also very good.".

Cain couldn't write the sex scenes in this movie not even in Snappy Stories pulp magazines the kind with covers showing some gorgeous doll with the shoulder of her dress ripped and a bra strap showing and some goon with a gun lurking in the shadows behind her.You can't help comparing it to the 1946 version with John Garfield Lana Turner and Cecil Calloway. The earlier movie is much sleeker more compact and brought up to date and the characters are sketched in with greater simplicity.This one is a period picture. The time is the 1930s and the production design is just fine. They're always tooling around in cars. What cars they had in those days  that yellow Model A convertible roadster with the rumble seat! I loved the one I once owned even though I could never find replacement parts for it. The old days are gone forever. Sob. Anyway neither Nicholson nor anyone else loves the cars as much as Nicholson winds up loving Lange and vice versa.There is a slight problem in this bond between the two of them namely Nick the Greek. He's a nice enough guy  trusting not too bright has ties to a vibrant Greek community which we don't see much of. As a matter of fact except for some occasional runins with the law this curious trio seems to live all alone at the Twin Oaks Roadside Stand.Nicholson is required to show some range and he does a splendid job  by turns dumb sleazy and horrified. Lange doesn't quite do the job that Nicholson does but she's more than adequate. When she finally gives in to Nicholson on the butcher block table she makes us believe it. The writers though have given her a strange and unanticipated quirk. After she's just watched Nicholson bash in her husband's head with a giant socket wrench and she's just been severely punched in the face twice and knocked to the dirt among the shrubbery she gets a case of the hots and invites Nicholson to join her in an al fresco romp. It just doesn't belong. Neither does Nicholson's brief tryst with Angelica Huston as a comic circus lion tamer. And it IS a little hard to swallow the notion that Lange is converted into a lawabiding pregnant willing Hausfrau because of her mother's death  given that until then we didn't even know she had a mother.But those are relatively minor issues. Overall this is a superior movie gritty as they say. Nicholson unlike Garfield in 1946 looks like he really works at his job. What filthy hands. Not much can be said for his mind either. By the time he and Lange are reformed the postman is at the door again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disappointing is the first word that comes to mind after sitting through this sexedup noir remake of a 1946 film of the same name based on a popular novel. This critic has neither seen the original nor read that novel so he is forced to take this film on face value and evaluate it on its own merits. That said The Postman Always Rings Twice failed to come close to my expectations. You won't care a lick about drifter Jack Nicholson and bored housewife Jessica Lange who start a torrid love affair behind the back of her husband and then look to kill him off. These two amoral jerks are all dressed up with nowhere to go in this script and once the deed is done the story really jumps the tracks. This was an intriguing premise but the many talented people who made this film have all done much better things.The biggest selling point for this film was its steamy sex scenes and there are indeed a few. But something is missing. Something that should be fairly obvious to those of us who have had sex in our lives. Nobody is ever nude during them! Save for one brief scene where we see Nicholson's rear there is a jarring lack of nudity. At times these people seem to be having intercourse right through their clothes! I've heard Nicholson is a legendary lover but is he strong enough to.... I'll stop there. What happened? I'm sure they at least negotiated with Lange about perhaps a topless scene or something. I guess she said no. Look one does not need nudity for a sexy scene. The only interesting scene in Random Hearts is a testament to that. But when you advertise your picture as a steamy sexy thriller you pretty much have to go all in or the whole thing is a waste.Aside from the sex scenes this film seems confused about what its characters are supposed to do once the husband is out of the way. And the conclusion is so abrupt its almost like they ran out of money and just decided to kill one of the leads off and call it a wrap. The acting isn't bad but thats about all the film has going for it. Lange is her typical self... not great but not bad either. Nicholson is born to play this type of character and he doesn't disappoint. You may remember John Collicos from TV's Battlestar Galactica. Angelical Huston is on hand for a cameo that they probably just gave her when she was hanging around the set to be close to her main squeeze Nicholson. This film is really just a waste of your time when you consider all of the better pictures these people have made. Avoid it. 4 of 10 stars. And what does the title have to do with the movie anyway?

It tries to compete with the great 1946 version. How do you top a film as brilliant as that? The answer is you don't! Even if this new version does follow the original novel more closely who cares? As the tragic plotting lovers Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever so they generate very little heat in their allegedly steamy sex scenes. It's as if the filmmakers were so aware of the miscasting that they tried to disguise this by making the sex scenes between the duo more erotic meaning more explicit. BIG MISTAKE! This just makes the lack of chemistry even more painfully obvious and the sex scenes rather silly. Despite having virtually nothing in common Nicholson and Lange can't keep their hands off of each other and do a lot of huffing and puffing. They go at it like two wild animals in heat but this does little to make the film any more watchable or entertaining. Yes Lange is even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual and she brings more intensity and depth to the role than the script really required. But whether she knows it or not Nicholson is a constant thorn in her side. Sure Jack is a great actor too but even though his character is a plotting murderer there was a romantic edge to the role when John Garfield played it in 1946 and Nicholson does not have one bit of that romanticism. I still kringe when I think of him as the love interest in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. How did he ever get to be cast in parts like that? Stay as clear from this as possible and settle only for the untoppable original.".

Despite having virtually nothing in common Nicholson and Lange can't keep their hands off of each other and do a lot of huffing and puffing. They go at it like two wild animals in heat but this does little to make the film any more watchable or entertaining. Yes Lange is even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual and she brings more intensity and depth to the role than the script really required. But whether she knows it or not Nicholson is a constant thorn in her side. Sure Jack is a great actor too but even though his character is a plotting murderer there was a romantic edge to the role when John Garfield played it in 1946 and Nicholson does not have one bit of that romanticism. I still kringe when I think of him as the love interest in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. How did he ever get to be cast in parts like that? Stay as clear from this as possible and settle only for the untoppable original.";

	schema:headline " Pornographic remake of a film noir classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "Eroticizing the tale of two killers previously made in 1946 director Bob Rafelson took out the subtlety and innuendo that made the original so hot. By adding sadomasochistic sexual activity between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange he cheapens the story that could have been an interesting pulp fiction update of James M. Cain's story. In the original John Garfield and Lana Turner really did have heat that didn't need to show the audience what the two did in bed. Their power burnt through the screen but if there is any steam between Nicholson and Lange sadly it is only dry ice not timbers smoldering.Nicholson then one of the hottest actors in Hollywood plays an obvious sleazebag. His character is never likable which dissolves any sympathy towards him. Garfield played the role as a victim of circumstances with a past which made him more interesting and complex. Lange however does provide some heat and shows the potential of becoming one of the biggest stars of the 80's after a weak start in the 1976 remake of King Kong. She lacks Lana Turner's glamour and the famous white shorts and halter top with matching turban but making her more earthy adds a different dimension to her character that Nicholson's lacks.Rather than a Cecil Kellaway type as the cheatedon husband the producers added a more ethnic flavor to the character played by veteran character actor John Colicos. The same year he made this movie he made soap immortality as the evil Mikkos Cassadine the world's wealthiest Greek on General Hospital. On the soap he victimized the world. Here he plays a lower class Greek who married a younger woman. Unlike Kellaway the age difference isn't grandfatherly and works better. Michael Lerner is very good as the attorney who defends Nicholson and Lange for murder and a young Anjelica Houston is seen briefly as a circus owner involved with Nicholson. She utilizes the same accent she would later perfect in the hysterical The Witches.What really makes a color version of the story work is the notsosharp photography that really makes it look like a pulp fiction magazine come to life. The ending drags a bit but it is ironic to watch the two characters slowly destroy themselves and each other. That's what film noir is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this story was told a few times in the past being one of the versions the classic of same title starring Lana Turner and John Garfield one of the most acclaimed stories of all time The Postman Always Rings Twice becomes a sexy romantic and sad tale on the hands of Bob Rafelson The King of Marvin Gardens yet this work resurrected the film noir genre in the 1980's giving new forms exploring a more sexual and violent side which wasn't possible to be presented in the golden era of noir.With the same story as the 1946 adaptation of James M. Cain's novel the film stars Jack Nicholson as Frank Chambers the drifter who fell in love with Cora Papadakis Jessica Lange a simple housewife who helps her husband Nick John Colicos to manage a roadside diner in the East Coast. But they have a plan to kill Nick and live together forever but the destiny has some tricks up's and down's twists and turns to make their lives complicated each time their plot fail again and again. The difference between the seductive and classic version of this same story is the approach given by writer David Mamet who made the love story between these two characters something sexy animalistic a full exploration of the senses with a lustful couple ripping each other's clothes having sex on a kitchen table one of the most iconic moments of the 1980's something almost gratuitous but very effective for most audiences nowadays. While Tay Garnett's version was a provocation that could never go too far in its sensuality only showing short kisses but very effective tender moments this update is more of a visual film made to present something exciting thrilling. And Nicholson and Lange have the chemistry and quality in their wild performances here.To me comparing back to back both films they're equally great just as the novel. They have their differences specially concerning about the characters characterization and performances of actors the way they were written. Examples Nicholson is more believable as a hobo than John Garfield in the way he's dressed the way he talks and moves the Cora played by Lange was something new more passive and quite joyful which is nothing similar than the one of the book and 1946 film materials who is very smart dominating in the relationship with Frank but the most striking difference was the friendly Nick played here as an rude and irritating man therefore the script is basically giving a reason for us not like this guy and cheer that the horrible plans of Frank and Cora become successful. The George C. Scott rule of not giving awards to actors unless the play the same parts is useful here to see in which films the acting worked better. If only we could team Jack Nicholson and Lana Turner together....we would have something explosive and very interesting. On a minor look to the film I really enjoyed the ending with a devastating moment without the trial and that whole depressive conclusion although it ended sad the same way but this time the viewers will make their own conclusions instead of having the title explained at the final and moralistic scene as MGM's version. Also enjoyed Sven Nykivst colorful cinematography with a right use of darkness in the most tense moments. The melodramatic soundtrack works one time or the other but for the most of the film is just silly. The importance of this version of The Postman Always Rings Twice is the fact that it brought back the film noir with a new style new faces ok Nicholson was in Chinatown in 1974 so it doesn't count and more baldness. After this film we had Body Heat the parodyhomage Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid and plenty of others. Take a look and enjoy it. 1010".

	schema:headline " Bitter Disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "The Postman Always Rings Twice 1981  out of 4Considering the talent in front of and behind the camera there's really no way to look at this adaptation of the James M. Cain novel as anything but a disappointment. In the film Jack Nicholson plays drifter Frank Chambers who enters the lives of Cora Jessica Lange and her much older husband Nick John Colicos. Soon the drifter and Cora start up a sexual relationship which leads to them planning the murder of the husband. This here would be the fourth version of the classic story and the second one filmed in America. Unlike the previous versions director Bob Rafelson didn't have to worry about censors but even so this version isn't nearly as hot as the earlier one with Lana Turner. Outside a rather intense sex scene towards the start of the picture this thing really never takes off which is too bad because they've got a terrific cast and some beautiful settings but in the end the film is just flat. I think the first forty five minutes are the best thing in the film as we see the love triangle set up and there's no question that the director has the look of the era down perfectly. I thought the setting really added a lot of atmosphere but sadly very little else happens. Nicholson was the perfect choice to play a drifter but the screenplay really doesn't give him too much to work with. Lange is clearly the best thing in the movie as she delivers a sexual charge to the thing. Colicos is also extremely good as the husband in a strong supporting performance. What really hurts the film is the second half because the director never really makes us believe or feel anything for the two leads. Are we supposed to hate them for what they've done? Are we supposed to be rooting for them to get away with the murder and live happily ever after? The entire second half of the film features way too many dialogue scenes that lead no where and in the end the romance that starts to bloom towards the end just never fully works. The film isn't nearly as bad as its reputation but at the same time there's no question that it's a major disappointment and a bitter feeling takes over when you think about what could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "I say that oneline statement having yet to read James M. Cain's original short book or the 1946 film starring John Garfield and Lana Turner. So I have now seen the Postman Always Rings Twice directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange twice now and see it on its own terms without much to really compare it to. Perhaps my perceptions could change once I see the older Hollywood film even though Luchino Visconti's own version of the book Ossessione is one of his masterpieces but for the moment this is a fairly competent sometimes exciting and usually sensual story of lust murder thick plots and a few tight twists and turns. Nicholson's Frank Chambers is a sort of bluecollar wanderer who wanders into the life of Cora Lange rarely been sexier who is married to a gregarious overbearing lug Papadakis John Colicos perfect in a characteractor bit who with his wife run a little restaurant. Chambers works his way into not just Papadakis's good graces as a worker but Cora's undergarments as well so to speak. Soon a plot thickens between the two lovers over what to do with the other. Right out of the best filmnoir there's quite a sequence that spins as their scheme unfolds which includes money as well as each other. That everything doesn't go quite to plan makes this film both captivating and cool while sometimes frustrating.Here Rafelson has his cast really locked in place like it can't go wrong. Nicholson as a streetwise tough guy who falls for a woman with whom there's immediate sexual magnetism but also has some flaws that come with the package almost too easy for him but not a bad performance. Lange brings some dimension to a character that could be either a real prize or a true femme fatale. And character actors like Michael Lerner only better in Barton Fink and even featuring Angelica Huston in an early performance add some good weight to the cast. The sex scenes years later are still enticing and the ending is a true whopper that is part of the story's best catharsis though in its own formula still tragic. If then it doesn't feel really as successful as the best noir of the 40s and 50s its almost hard to say. Sometimes scenes kinds of come and go and the flow of the story sometimes gets jammed up after the midway mark goes by. It turns more into a domestic drama than something more exciting in the suspenseful turns early on. Just when Rafelson has his crew working to put life into some scenes a few are a little flat in comparison.Still even if you have seen the original 40s takes on Cain's novel it's never less than interesting what goes on thanks to the nature of the story. It's a look at very flawed psychologically cruxed people who attempt at happiness in ways that change them for worse and for better possibly more the former. Occasionally the sex could be in danger of veering off the more stylish side of the lust in the 40s noirs into softcore land but it's balanced out by its general professionalism and the acting randing from sosotobetterthanaverage. It's a like it or hate it film.".

So I have now seen the Postman Always Rings Twice directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange twice now and see it on its own terms without much to really compare it to. Perhaps my perceptions could change once I see the older Hollywood film even though Luchino Visconti's own version of the book Ossessione is one of his masterpieces but for the moment this is a fairly competent sometimes exciting and usually sensual story of lust murder thick plots and a few tight twists and turns. Nicholson's Frank Chambers is a sort of bluecollar wanderer who wanders into the life of Cora Lange rarely been sexier who is married to a gregarious overbearing lug Papadakis John Colicos perfect in a characteractor bit who with his wife run a little restaurant.

	schema:reviewBody "Wasn't there some significance to the title in James Cain's novel and the 1946 movie version? It's a long time since I visited either so I can't be certain but I seem to remember the postie's propensity for ringing twice was at least referred to. Unless I missed it it gets nary a mention in this lethargic 1981 remake of the original making the title somewhat meaningless.Anyway Jack Nicholson reins in his trademark rakish devilish attitude to play the role of the drifter previously played by John Garfield who conspires with luscious housewife and gas stationdiner cook Jessica Lange to do away with her annoying Greek husband Nick. Nick takes his wife for granted he has a Stavros accent and buys himself silk nightgowns and so deserves to die. Jack and Jessie make a convincing couple  probably more so than Garfield and Lana Turner although that's the only respect in which this version surpasses the original. Their attraction is animal their lovemaking more of an adversarial duel than a demonstration of intimacy as they tear at each other on the diner's kitchen table. It's easy to see why Cora falls for Frank even as his ardour cools. He offers a way out from the drudgery of her life with Nick. But for Frank you always get the impression until the end at least that it's more about the sex and that he never really knows what he wants.The story is slow in unfolding but drags fatally once the killer couple get away with their crime. Perhaps that's deliberate to demonstrate the aimlessness of their relationship  or of any relationship that isn't fuelled by love. The couple blow hot and cold with each other as they wait for Cora's brief probation period to be over so that they can move away from the scene of their crime. You get the impression that if Cora's life hadn't been cut short they would have ended up either destroying one another or drifted aimlessly through life long after any love they feel has been extinguished wondering why the hell they stay together. Either way you don't really care that much whether their end is happy or tragic.If you have a choice watch the original or the Italian movie Ossessione another version. If you don't this one's OK but it's nothing special.".

The investigation that transpires is predictably weary as you feel like your watching something out of a old school crime TV episode but what it has going for it is that the grimy locations help with the moody ambiance and the main performances up it a notch. Yul Brynner is in the lead and along side are Edward Woodward and Charles Gray as a shady if eccentric villain The Owl. So there are some real solid acting chops on show. An American secret service agent working with Scotland Yard goes about trying to infiltrate a dangerous counterfeit ring looking to upscale their business. Brynner plays it tough as nails but there's something a little more to his psyche that be shows minor cracks while Woodward is the chatty local partner who's assigned to Brynner's American agent. I thought it was going to play out like some buddy feature as the two shared a fitting combination with some British humour but it soon moves away from that angle midway through when the thick script brings in the villains and the scheming begins also slowing things down as our protagonist Brynner sets his plans in motion by snooping and trying to uncover the mastermind behind this counterfeit ring. In between this are some intense exchanges beatdowns nasty encounters and sauna visiting amongst the London views. There's clichs aplenty amongst the smokescreen of genre staples and throw in that racy big band score typical of the era. The plot is rather thin as you can feel it being stretched out with the amount of repetitive actions occurring and its revelation feels abrupt making little headway but I always found Brynner to be a very watchable actor despite that detachedpersona and it does possess a dangerous edge never making the character feel too safe. The earnest direction is tranquil in manner and the handling rather practical in style as the pace is leisured throughout making a little sluggish. Although its does come to a crushing end in the final stages with a downbeat final shot. He's rather a tough nut.".

A man in Paris has lived alone for decades since the death of his wife. One day he sees a woman being beaten up by a young man in the staircase of his flat so he tends to her wounds and offers her a place to stay. He is in his 50s and she is 26 and has nobody. Surprisingly she has a keen sense of intellect and helps him finish his book.The ending was rather weird as the movie ends without closure about both the girl's past and psyche and the man's death which might or might not have been staged by him. Because of this I'd say give this a pass.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this at Pifan 2013 in Bucheon South Korea. What seemed to be a simple drama about an older man who takes in a troubled young woman got weird with the occult and stuff. A man in Paris has lived alone for decades since the death of his wife. One day he sees a woman being beaten up by a young man in the staircase of his flat so he tends to her wounds and offers her a place to stay. He is in his 50s and she is 26 and has nobody. Surprisingly she has a keen sense of intellect and helps him finish his book.The ending was rather weird as the movie ends without closure about both the girl's past and psyche and the man's death which might or might not have been staged by him. Because of this I'd say give this a pass.";

The problem perhaps is that the script is not quite up to the same standard as the rest of the film or that it superficially resembles something else.Superintendent Harry Andrews is wellcast as the blunt instrument of Imperial Power leading a force that look more like regular soldiers than policemen.

For example Eric Blair better known as George Orwell served in the Imperial Indian Police force in the 1920s reaching the rank of Assistant District Superintendent in Burma.He said that on the one hand seeing the dirty work of Empire at close quarters which included being hated by much of the local populace had affected his outlook on almost every aspect of his life on the other hand he also wrote that I loved Burma and the Burman and have no regrets that I spent the best years of my life in the Burma police..This film is not meant to have a happy ending any more than 'Bridge on the River Kwai' or 'Lawrence of Arabia' both also psychological studies of the lead character are meant to. Those that might naively suppose that a younger man could have played Howard's role and then swanned off into the sunset with Rampling or something are completely missing the point. In what may be an allegory of Indian independence itself noone involved comes out of it very well all that remains is a little hope for the future as symbolised by Sultan's son.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the talent of the star players in this film I was disappointed. Trevor Howard tries to work with what he's given but Yul Brynner's performance was wooden and predictable. Despite what some of the other reviewers have saidI thought this film was not nearly as good as it COULD have been and the biggest problem was the script. Boring hackneyed clichd lines choked any life out of this story which as noted has a basis in real life. The battle scenes were poorly done and I found myself fastforwarding through them to get back to the dialog as bad as it was. I can't fault the actors so much as the script and direction. Howard and Brynner deserved better. As an action movie when compared to some of the other mid1960s efforts it falls far short.".

A western that doesn't take place in the United States  has no native American characters or white guys with American accents but THE LONG DUEL is undoubtedly a western that has been relocated from the American plains to British run India . Hey even most of the protagonists are called Indians and that's no coincidence .THE LONG DUEL is by no means a terrible wretched movie but it is rather mediocre . The story as I mentioned is something that has appeared countless times where an injun war party has gone on the loose and it's up to a sympathetic calvary officer to negotiate with the dove and kill the hawk only this time the Indians are Hindus and the calvary officer is a fine upstanding spiffing chap The production values are hardly outstanding with some very obvious studio exteriors and back screen projection and no doubt the PC fascists will have a field day when they see that most of the Asians aren't actually Asian at all but a bunch of British actors in dark make up . The film does contain some gun battles and fist fights so it's not exactly a total bore and one scene with a fugitive hiding down a well does contain some suspense . Make up your own mind as to the movies merits".

Photographed in Technicolor and Panavision.Copyright 12 September 1967 by the Rank Organisation and London Independent Producers. Released in the U.S. through Paramount 4 October 1967. New York opening at local theaters as the lower half of a double bill with Chuka 1 November 1967. U.K. release through Rank Film Distributors 27 August 1967. Australian release through British Empire Films 3 November 1967. 10350 feet. 115 minutes.SYNOPSIS In the India of the 1920s British police officer Freddy Young strongly opposes his government's harsh treatment of local tribes most recently reflected in his senior colleague Stafford's internment of the Bhantas following allegations of petty poaching made by a local landowner. Sultan the tribe's chief engineers an escape from the fort taking with him a small band of loyal followers and his pregnant wife. When she dies in labor on the long ride back to the hills Sultan resolves to deliver his people from their bondage. Although the British officers regard Sultan as a dangerous criminal Young recognizes him as a fellow idealist and an enemy to respect. Young's admiration for the tribal chief conflicts with his assignment to capture the rebel he even spares Sultan's life during a religious festival realizing that the leader's murder during public worship would only arouse wider rebellion. While Stafford's daughter Jane is moved by Young's concern for the tribe and its leader British authorities demand the immediate capture of Sultan. Young reluctantly agrees.NOTES Made at Pinewood Studios London and on location in Spain.VIEWERS' GUIDE A Boys Own Paper story but too violent for Saturday matinees.COMMENT CinemaScope was turned loose on India at an early stage with King of the Khyber Rifles and The Rains of Ranchipur. Other Scope movies to take advantage of the pictorial and action opportunities of the subcontinent include North West Frontier Stranglers of Bombay The Tiger of Eschnapur The Indian Tomb Nine Hours to Rama The Brigand of Kandahar Tarzan Goes to India Harry Black and the Tiger and Bhowani Junction.What does The Long Duel add to this lore? Not a great deal. Certainly the action scenes are splendidly staged  and there are plenty of them. Unfortunately the story itself though most promising fails to fully develop its themes of command conflict and romantic entanglement. Indeed the romantic scenes are treated in such a perfunctory fashion you get the impression they were written in after the movie was completed in order to expand the otherwise insignificant role played by Charlotte Rampling. The seeds of conflict between the Howard and Andrews characters are astutely sown early on but their growth is stunted partly by a lack of black and white character differentiation in the writing which is not altogether a bad thing but mostly by the tired jaded and indifferent performance handed out by Trevor Howard. Howard's lack of spark also undermines the title duel between himself and Brynner  though as in the conflict with Andrews this is not clearly a hatehate relationship either. Brynner's portrayal is certainly forceful enough but its effectiveness is dissipated by his unexplained American accent.Aside from Andrews the film's best portraits come from the minor characters  Virginia North as a dancing spy Laurence Naismith as the collector Maurice Denham as the governor George Pastell as a treacherous merchant. Edward Fox can be spotted at the Gymkhana Club he has one line. Annakin has directed many of the studio and dialogue scenes in a listless style. But the movie really comes to life in its many action episodes where the anamorphic screen filled to bursting with horses men gunfire and explosions really comes into its own. The location scenery the film was actually photographed in Spain looks rugged enough to be authentic too.OTHER VIEWS It's a lucky thing The Long Duel has such rousing action footage for in most other respects it's neither very convincing nor exciting. Trevor Howard is getting a bit old for this sort of lark though it is nice to see Miss Rampling in a role somewhat different from that in Georgy Girl. The script is okay but on the technical side the film cannot escape the charge that it is actually a considerable mishmash. Location exteriors do not blend very harmoniously with some garish interior sets and there is also some matte work of unbelievable amateurishness.  JHR writing as George Addison.".

Yul Brynner as tribal chief is among the arrested but they break out with one fatality. After that Brynner and the able members of the tribe become brigands and popular heroes in India where the Congress Party is getting most demanding for India's independence post World War I. The provincial governor Laurence Naismith is acutely aware that Brynner and his tribe are becoming popular heroes. Possibly this story is post the Amritsar Massacre which galvanized the move toward independence.The solution they come up with is to give Andrews a cocommander in Trevor Howard. Howard before his army service was an anthropologist and has studied Indian culture. He's also suspected of the unpardonable sin of 'going native'. But he may be the answer to the Raj's Brynner problem.Brynner borrows a lot here from his earlier work in Taras Bulba playing the tribal chief. Howard cuts a sympathetic figure as a most unmilitary officer showing his range. A Captain Bligh he is not. He even gets a love interest in Charlotte Rampling playing Andrews's daughter.I thought the climax was a bit on the unreal side involving both Brynner's son and Howard. More I will not say.The Long Duel is an interesting saga of those last days of the British Raj though it plays like a western with real Indians.".

DUEL is also set in a later period the 1920s reflecting a time in which the futility of British rule was becoming more apparent but there is little that is overtly political here. Instead we get the collision of attitudes between hardline authoritarian Harry Andrews and the liberal Trevor Howard a familiar theme in everything from prison dramas to westerns. Both actors give their usual authoritative performances all the more impressive given some of the uninspired writing.

Paul Walker does a decent job with a character that an Actor won't be able to do much with except go with the flow. No real surprises or twists and turns just straight to the point B rated action. Actually has some pretty good fighting sequences and shoot outs. Laurence Fishburne is surprisingly cast as a supporting with a weak performance mainly due to the script and content and possibly direction as well. Bobby Z is definitely a good B movie with a rating of 5 overall considering everything listed above.

	schema:reviewBody "The plot Kearny a loser convictis pushed into impersonating Bobby Z a largerthanlife drug dealer in a hostage trade only to find both his own and Bobby Z's enemies trying to kill him.Herzfeld previously directed 2 Days in the Valley a Tarantino ripoff if ever there was one. However unlike most people I actually kind of liked it. This movie is another attempt to clone Tarantino's style heavy on flashbacks stylized violence and witty antiheroes. Unfortunately it's not all that great but it did manage to keep my interest for the runtime.Bobby Z is built up as a smalltime celebrity in the local surfer scene as well as a rising star in drug distribution. Kearney on the other hand is a three time loser with a price on his head. The movie compares and contrasts their personalities many times with Bobby Z being revealed as a manipulative egocentric jerk while Kearney shows many admirable qualities despite his impulsive violence.After a somewhat grim opening the movie becomes quite lighthearted. In fact I'm really at a loss as to why they even opened the movie with such a dark and disturbing bit of character development if they were just going to completely ignore it for the rest of the film. Oh well. Much of the movie is like this however. Whenever anything shocking and dramatic happens it's instantly forgotten by the next scene where everyone pretends that it never happened. Even being shot seems to be glossed over rather quickly with some cursory first aid. It reminded me of a video game where picking up a first aid kit heals your character of all wounds.The acting was passable. It was certainly better than many directtovideo movies but nobody really stood out. I guess the script didn't really allow anyone to shine though I was probably most disappointed that Laurence Fishburne was given such a bland role. Still it's always fun to see him even if it's in such a small and clichd role.If you're looking for an action movie this will probably satisfy you but I'd be surprised if you remembered it later or recommended it to your friends.".

Fast  Furious star Paul Walker plays threetime loser Tim Kearney. Herzfeld and scenarists Bob 4 AM Open All Night Krakower and Allen Lawrence recount Kearney's career in an amusing series of flashbacks that may be the funniest thing about Bobby Z. In short Bobby Z is a tolerable beer and pizza movie with an Rrating and about 90 minutes worth of mayhem. Noyou can forget about female nudity. The hackneyed theme of mistaken identities is played out again with little to make it memorable butthere is enough gunplay to keep you distracted. The best thing in the Krakower and Lawrence screenplay is that they keep the hero on the run outnumbered and constantly improvising. As for their fidelity to Don Winslow's novel that is another question since I haven't read it.The plot relies on the timeworn theme of deceit. D.E.A. Agent Tad Gruzsa Lawrence Fishburne of The Matrix trilogy offers former Marine and threetime loser Tim Kearney a quick and easy way to get out of prison. Kearney is eager to take Gruzsa's deal because he has just killed a member of the Aryan Brotherhood Maddog Chuck Liddell of How High with an automobile license plate when the pugnacious thug pulls a knife on him. Indeed Kearney slashes Maddog's throat just as surely as if he had wielded a knife. Now the entire Aryan Brotherhood both in and out of stir demands payback. Meanwhile a ruthless Mexican druglord Don Huertero Joaquim de Almeida of Desperado has taken Gruzsa's partner hostage. Gruzsa must produce a legendary surfer dude with a reputation as an infamous pot smuggler to get his partner back to safety. Of course there is more here than meets the eye but Herzfeld plays his aces close to his vest and doesn't reveal the surprises until the final quarterhour. Anyway Gruzsa and his new partner take Kearney to a rendezvous on the border where the exchange is scheduled to take place. During the exchange Gruzsa shows his true colors and breaks out an assault rifle. He tries to kill Kearney but he misses our hero narrowly when Kearney trips over the railroad between the bad guys and the goodbad guys. Gruzsa kills his next partner and snuffs some of the opposition before he clears out. Later he checks in at a tattoo parlor run by Boom Boom M.C. Gainey of Con Air and reveals that Kearney is out and across the border. Boom Boom mobilizes the Brotherhood and they set off in pursuit on their bikes.In Mexico Kearney is recaptured by Don Huertero's henchman and taken to his palatial estate. Kearney meets Bobby Z's girlfriend Elizabeth the strikingly gorgeous Olivia Wilde of Turistas and she has sex with Kearney and knows that he isn't Bobby Z. Meanwhile Kearney learns that Bobby Z has a child elevenyear old Kit Juan Villareal of Harvest of Redemption and the two bond when Kearney escapes from the hacienda with the bad guys hot on their trail lead by Johnson Keith Carradine of The Long Riders who likes to spit every time that he meets somebody of whom he disapproves. You will be amazed at how this obnoxious character buys the farm.Bobby Z is complicated enough to be interesting but it remains altogether a little too smug to be attain the greatness of something like True Romance. Happily Walker doesn't play a dual role. Meantime Walker delivers a strong charismatic performance as the eponymous character. He plays it free loose and easy. Yes there is a happy ending that seems a little too unbelievable but then it's only a movie. Comparably Bobby Z isn't as much fun as Into the Blue or Running Scared.".

I wonder why it made its way to the silver screen because it's not better than dozens of Straight to Video productions. Storywise you will get nothing more than you'd also get if you rent a JeanClaude Van Damme Film. Same goes for character development. There are some nice shootouts and fights but nothing remarkable. It sometimes feels as if you were watching a film from the seventies there is nothing really stylish or spectacular in the action scenes. Although it feels good to see movie that doesn't use the much common and enoughseen style of today's action flicks the way this film shows the action seems outdated. Also the film's pace should be higher again it feels 70sish. As usual these days there are some nice twists and turns in the story. Paul Walker does a decent job but not as convincing as in Running Scared. Laurence Fishburne he fails to put any life in his bad guy role. I am not impressed of Olivia Wilde in the leading female role. At least she tries hard to be more than decorative. 510".

The whole 'syking everyone out to think I'm Bobby Z' script work got old really quick Paul Walker's acting was sub par I haven't seen a lot of his work but I've been told by many that he's not that great of an actor. I cannot imagine what went through Laurence Fishburne's head when choosing to be in this film he has done better WAY better! There are way too many close up shots of Paul Walker for absolutely no other reason than to show off his Good Looks and play some really lame music along with it. There is always some hot girl and a kid involved that need their lives saved if you've seen it once you've seen it a hundred times just this time with Paul Walker. I suggest this film to people who only like Paul Walker and his close ups and not action flicks because thats about all you get. Walker couldn't portray a criminal to save his life!

By impersonating the legendary criminal Bobby Z... I felt it was a little too convoluted slow in places read 'quite boring' stupid too in others and don't think Paul Walker or surprisingly Fishburne clinched their characters in what should have been an action reasonably fast paced thriller.Please do not watch this movie. It was very woeful... It was sad to see the great Neo the terrific Laurence Fishburne incur this. Paul Walker? Forget it...I was looking forward to seeing this film on the power of Laurence Fishburne primarily Paul Walker and secondly the author of the source book material Don Winslow.

I also loved many of his other films such as The Fast and The Furious 2 Fast 2 Furious Joyride and Into The Blue. Anyways back to his newest movie that I saw last night Bobby Z. Like I said I expected some good action from this and I was more than pleased by the storyline the numerous action scenes and the load of stars that follow Walker in the film such as Lawrence Fishburne Olivia Wilde Jacob Vargas and more. I have actually heard a few people say that Paul is a horrible actor but they just need to keep their mouths shut because they don't know what they are talking about. Paul Walker has delivered good entertainment to the audience every since The Fast and the Furious and he's a great actor if you ask me. Bobby Z is probably one of the best straight to DVD movies I have ever seen it delivers good action along with a tricky side that you never see coming. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 because of the tremendous action and simply macho portrayal of it by Paul Walker. He's a great actor and no one thought this movie was going to be good before they seen it so I hope they believe me now. I highly recommend this movie if you are a Paul Walker fan like me or if you are an action junkie like me. 9 out of 10 best straight to DVD rating from me ever!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Isn't it funny how the movies you really don't expect much out of turn out to be the most fun. Bobby Z wasn't something that was high on my list of things to see but it was streaming and fit my mood so I watched it and what a surprise a well written Action film with a pretty good plot! Bobby Z is a legendary local crime boss in Southern California. He is a very elusive man that the Mexican drug lords go to extreme measures to find. Don Huertero Joaquim de Almeida has kidnapped an FBI agent and will only exchange him for Bobby Z but there's a problem Bobby Z is dead. The clever folks at the FBI decide to find someone who looks like Z and send him in that man is Tim Kearney Paul Walker and his life depends on how well he can trick people into believing that he is Bobby Z a man he's never met. Paul Walker is the star of this clever film and he does a tremendous job. I'm not fan of Walker's whenever he does anything that isn't a gritty Action film he stinks fortunately this is a gritty Action film and he was engaging delightful and even funny as he tried to play someone he's not. As for the rest of the cast it was certainly a unique mix of people but being centered around one man and one goal really made it work. It's unusual to find a deep plot in an Action film and that's why this film was so unique. Aside from some terrific stunts and fight scenes there were twists and turns crosses and doublecrosses even some humor. Bobby Z was really a lot of fun to watch and it will keep you guessing while at the same time showing you some terrific action sequences I was more than impressed by this film and by Paul Walker for that matter. It's easy to say well he's been playing an undercover agent in The Fast  Furious for a decade now but it certainly wasn't the same thing. The Death  Life of Bobby Z is a wild ride that's a lot of fun and it will keep you guessing you can't ask for more than that.".

	onyx:emotionText "Isn't it funny how the movies you really don't expect much out of turn out to be the most fun. Bobby Z wasn't something that was high on my list of things to see but it was streaming and fit my mood so I watched it and what a surprise a well written Action film with a pretty good plot! Bobby Z is a legendary local crime boss in Southern California. He is a very elusive man that the Mexican drug lords go to extreme measures to find. Don Huertero Joaquim de Almeida has kidnapped an FBI agent and will only exchange him for Bobby Z but there's a problem Bobby Z is dead. The clever folks at the FBI decide to find someone who looks like Z and send him in that man is Tim Kearney Paul Walker and his life depends on how well he can trick people into believing that he is Bobby Z a man he's never met. Paul Walker is the star of this clever film and he does a tremendous job. I'm not fan of Walker's whenever he does anything that isn't a gritty Action film he stinks fortunately this is a gritty Action film and he was engaging delightful and even funny as he tried to play someone he's not. As for the rest of the cast it was certainly a unique mix of people but being centered around one man and one goal really made it work. It's unusual to find a deep plot in an Action film and that's why this film was so unique. Aside from some terrific stunts and fight scenes there were twists and turns crosses and doublecrosses even some humor. Bobby Z was really a lot of fun to watch and it will keep you guessing while at the same time showing you some terrific action sequences I was more than impressed by this film and by Paul Walker for that matter.

He plays a convicted that needs to pretend being the famous Bobby Z in order to escape from his certain next conviction. It feels right for me to state that Walker does his job perfectly despite the fact that he looks more like a model than like a bandit. His character in here is similar to Van Damme's in 1999's Inferno. Directing is also very well done delivering plenty of enjoyable scenes which end up bringing irony and fun instead of suspense which is more often in action films.

It is not at all an easy thing to make this whole wacky plot stick together and somehow she does it.  If she has trouble at sometimes it is certainly not her fault.  The part is incredibly challenging even for one of Hollywood's most brilliant actresses.  I'd like to see Meryl Streep try to tackle this one!  Brynnor Gavin Kaye and the rest all do good jobs but the spectator can't help but ask what are they doing in this movie?  Richard Chamberlain is delightful and he and Katharine Hepburn really are the driving forces.

ANSWER STAGE DOOR CANTEEN Question In 1969 what movie starred Katherine Hepburn Dame Edith Evans and Danny Kaye?ANSWER THE MADWOMAN OF CHAILLOTOdd that Kate Hepburn should pop up in two unfair trivia questions but it does happen. Actors do run into each other in all kinds of films both good and bad memorable and forgettable and regular or short film look at a comic short called THE STOLEN JOOLES which has most of the stars of Hollywood in the 1930s in it.STAGE DOOR CANTEEN was done for patriotic morale boosting for our soldiers and it celebrated the canteens used to entertain our men on furlough. So the making of that film had a reason that transcends it's current obscurity. I might add as it is the only major movie that stage star Katherine Cornell popped up in for just a few minutes it is worth it as a time capsule as such.But THE MADWOMAN OF CHAILLOT was based on a Giraudoux play about modern society endangered by the forces of power and greed. It is about the discovery that the city of light Paris is reposing on a huge untapped oil field and that various power figures without any soul Yul Brynner Charles Boyer Paul Henried Oscar Holmolka Donald Pleasance may be able to empty the city of it's neighborhoods it's citizens it's life and light and replace it with derricks. Giraudoux made sure that the villains represent everything that he suspects. Brynner is the ultimate ruthless billionaire he is upset when a waiter accidentally spills water on him. Boyer is a stock broker. Henried is a General. Homolka is the French head of the Communist Party Giraudoux has no illusions about what a political label means  there are power mad people in all political parties. Pleasance is a prospector for oil. There is also John Gavin as a right wing religious demagogue.Opposed to these villains are Kate Hepburn the leading local social figure from the past  called the madwoman of Chaillot and her friends Giulietta Massina Margaret Leighton and Edith Evans who is still trying to campaign in 1969 for Mr. Wilson's League of Nations. Also aiding Hepburn are the rag picker Danny Kaye  in the best dramatic performance in a major motion picture in his career  also his only Oscar nomination Richard Chamberlain Gordon Heath and Nanette Newman. Although Hepburn Massina Leighton and Evans have social position none have the political clout of the villains. So when they are made aware of the threat to their beloved Paris and by extension western culture and morality they hold a trial in absentia of the villains and find these villains have to die.This film is better for the brief vignettes of it's stars than for the total impact. Brynner's malevolent general ruthlessness is one of his best acting jobs. So is Henried's almost comical criminal activity he confesses to having arranged the murder of four promising young aides of his because he suspected one of them but not knowing which of sleeping with his wife  it turned out his wife had been faithful after all Brynner Boyer Homolka and Gavin congratulate him on his luck!. Kaye has several great set pieces  a rag picker he wraps eloquent about the great glory days of garbage in the past where each neighborhood's garbage had a special character all it's own as opposed to the garbage of the modern homogenized neighborhoods of Paris that those villains forced on the citizens. He is superb in the scene where he is the defense counsel for Brynner and his group  demoniacally showing what these people are really like while defending them. All those comic scatterbrained sequences in his movies built up to these scenes of poetry and passion.Hepburn of course was great  that last sequence where she mistakes Chamberlain for the lost love of her youth and mournfully laments his loss is a highpoint in her career. She rarely had so poetic a scene of tragic delicacy.But the story oddly enough for all we may approve of the hatred shown for the powerful who use and discard us is not fully acceptable. Henried's general is too stupid he almost launches a missile attack on Russia while talking to Hepburn. Brynner is so impossibly arrogant that a consortium of his fellow billionaires would probably ruin him to shut him up. But the acting is still so good that it one can forget these minor problems. Any film where Donald Pleasance uses his prominent proboscis by putting it into a drinking glass to smell for oil cannot be all bad. So I'll give it a 6 if not higher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every Civics class are they still teaching Civics in our increasingly more ignorant society? should watch this and write an essay on it if they know what one is or what a subject and predicate is. What a fantastic analogue to today's insane reality where the news is owned by the corporate giants Yul Bryneer does a great turn describing how 'sensible' this arrangement is. To see Yul Bryner laughing is a treat in itself when you have visions of Yul the Outlaw dancing in your head. Of course his evil in this film is far more insidious than any The Wild Ones could have envisioned.The Ragpicker's soliloquy by Danny Kaye is sometimes pointed to as the highlight of his career when he was trivialized as a song and dance man....much as Einstein's political views on the insanity of war were sublimated to his scientific contributions. To watch Margaret Leighton give way to the Ragpicker's depiction of how easily women can be bought with 'sable and morals'. As the defense lawyer he almost gets his clients off by describing how he gave to all taxexempt charities and built many hospitals for the children who ate the food he grew in his 234 farms. This will remind you of George Bernard Shaw's lines in The Countess in which the Indian muses on the much overlooked fact that those great givers to charity whose names are etched on hospital walls are the same corporate giants who owned the mills that put the patients IN the hospitals. Of course we the people are no longer taught the skill of analytical thinking so we wave the flag and gladly sacrifice our children to the merchants of death via their minions the Army recruiters. And of course it's all about oil just as this illegal immoral invasion of Iraq is. How timely this movie is. No wonder you can't find it in the video stores. No wonder you can't even find reviews of the movie in Leonard Whoever's Reviews Book or the TimeOut English Review Book but in Variety's 2000 Movie Guide. Too dangerous in a time of McCarthyism of Salem witch trials where the 1st Amendment is so easily discarded.Naturally we have a minister who admits to being involved in some antiSemitic activities using an atrocious Southern accent. Each of the plotters the commissar the broker the doctor the DeGaulle prime minister...all 'confess' to one another their nefarious doings in order to show their loyalty to one another. The fact that Katherine Hepburn gives each of them an 'exclusive contract' to the oil under her mansion in Paris....soon known by all....indicates according to Yul that they are all worthy of being business partners each one totally derelict of the chains of morality.This is a movie you'll see again and again. See it once for the gorgeous scenes of Paris a city I love. See it again to remind yourself that once there was a Camelot once there was a citizenry who cared enough who knew enough about the danger democracy is in within our country to revolt courting injury from the police stooges. Of course those police didn't have pepper guns or 'nonlethal' stun guns that kill. Even at a Red Sox over Yankees celebration by a direct hit not the political demonstration the guns were bought for.These great actors are topped by Katherine Hepburn..her welling eyes mirroring her emotions her concern at killing these monsters her sadness for her lost love the ragpicker? that drove her insane. Here's an example of If you had fore knowledge of the evil Hitler would do to the world would you have killed him?.Yul Bryner shows also that he was an actor not just a movie star...but then what enervated these great actors Charles Boyer Dame Evans Guiletta Massina Margaret Leighton Betty Davis' nemesis? It was a labor of love by an international cast which understood the greed the amorality the savagery of our 'leaders'. I note that the previous comments also mirror the reviewers' political outlooks in their thumbs down approach too much truth for them?If ever such a dramatization of our society's plight also Britain's by the way is needed it is the year 2005 with amoral incompetence in the saddle of our Executive Cowboy and mirrored by the insipid cowardice or ineffectiveness of our Democrats in Congress. Although you won't find it for less than 69 it's well worth the money.".

Of course his evil in this film is far more insidious than any The Wild Ones could have envisioned.The Ragpicker's soliloquy by Danny Kaye is sometimes pointed to as the highlight of his career when he was trivialized as a song and dance man....much as Einstein's political views on the insanity of war were sublimated to his scientific contributions. To watch Margaret Leighton give way to the Ragpicker's depiction of how easily women can be bought with 'sable and morals'. As the defense lawyer he almost gets his clients off by describing how he gave to all taxexempt charities and built many hospitals for the children who ate the food he grew in his 234 farms. This will remind you of George Bernard Shaw's lines in The Countess in which the Indian muses on the much overlooked fact that those great givers to charity whose names are etched on hospital walls are the same corporate giants who owned the mills that put the patients IN the hospitals. Of course we the people are no longer taught the skill of analytical thinking so we wave the flag and gladly sacrifice our children to the merchants of death via their minions the Army recruiters. And of course it's all about oil just as this illegal immoral invasion of Iraq is. How timely this movie is. No wonder you can't find it in the video stores. No wonder you can't even find reviews of the movie in Leonard Whoever's Reviews Book or the TimeOut English Review Book but in Variety's 2000 Movie Guide. Too dangerous in a time of McCarthyism of Salem witch trials where the 1st Amendment is so easily discarded.Naturally we have a minister who admits to being involved in some antiSemitic activities using an atrocious Southern accent. Each of the plotters the commissar the broker the doctor the DeGaulle prime minister...all 'confess' to one another their nefarious doings in order to show their loyalty to one another. The fact that Katherine Hepburn gives each of them an 'exclusive contract' to the oil under her mansion in Paris....soon known by all....indicates according to Yul that they are all worthy of being business partners each one totally derelict of the chains of morality.This is a movie you'll see again and again. See it once for the gorgeous scenes of Paris a city I love. See it again to remind yourself that once there was a Camelot once there was a citizenry who cared enough who knew enough about the danger democracy is in within our country to revolt courting injury from the police stooges. Of course those police didn't have pepper guns or 'nonlethal' stun guns that kill. Even at a Red Sox over Yankees celebration by a direct hit not the political demonstration the guns were bought for.These great actors are topped by Katherine Hepburn..her welling eyes mirroring her emotions her concern at killing these monsters her sadness for her lost love the ragpicker? that drove her insane. Here's an example of If you had fore knowledge of the evil Hitler would do to the world would you have killed him?.Yul Bryner shows also that he was an actor not just a movie star...but then what enervated these great actors Charles Boyer Dame Evans Guiletta Massina Margaret Leighton Betty Davis' nemesis? It was a labor of love by an international cast which understood the greed the amorality the savagery of our 'leaders'. I note that the previous comments also mirror the reviewers' political outlooks in their thumbs down approach too much truth for them?If ever such a dramatization of our society's plight also Britain's by the way is needed it is the year 2005 with amoral incompetence in the saddle of our Executive Cowboy and mirrored by the insipid cowardice or ineffectiveness of our Democrats in Congress. Although you won't find it for less than 69 it's well worth the money.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a segment within a scene almost ending the first act of The Madwoman of Chaillot that suggest the direction the story is going to take. While the fanciful old countess Aurelia Katharine Hepburn explains young Roderick Richard Chamberlain the joys of being alive the visuals turn to a slightly hazy retrospection of her love life in which Roderick is seen as her mustachioed lover Alphonse and the waitress Irma Nanette Newman with whom Roderick will fall in love is seen as Aurelia when she was younger. All this theatricality is followed by a brief scene that ends the act in which Irma delivers a soliloquy about her growing love for Roderick. Then after a fascinating first hour in which the plot is so startlingly current as act two starts we enter the world of filmed theater and the movie hardly recovers. If The Madwoman of Chaillot is remembered with affection after it ends it is because of its first part in which a rich and ruthless selfmade man who leads a group that includes a general a Catholic priest a broker and a communist commissar joins a similarly cruel prospector whose plan is the creation of an enterprise to dig up oil in the middle of historical Paris. The prospector has sent his nephew Roderick to put a bomb in the Palais de Chaillot to kill a public officer who denies him permission to begin his oil operation. But when Roderick fails and the police believe he is going to commit suicide he meets countess Aurelia who hears about the plan and decides to solve it by herself. Then action slows down everything is done in interiors and the situation is resolved in strange ways  first with a metaphorical trial which is pure stage material and then with a certainly weird execution of the villains. By 1969 director Bryan Forbes was riding the crest of his own international film wave and had a great cast in which even John Gavin delivered a fine funny performance of an evil priest. Masina is a delight Evans is wonderful and Homolka Leighton Henreid Boyer and Dauphin are as good as all the supporting players while Hepburn tries hard with her teary eyes... I could not help thinking what this would have been with a French actress in the lead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Giraudoux who wrote The Madwoman Of Chaillot became a prominent French writer in the years between the two World Wars and died in 1944 a year before this play made its debut on the French stage. Those who were occupying France at the time Giroudoux died would not have wanted this item shown to be sure as it is an indictment against the greed and thoughtlessness of the modern age and the ruthless people in positions of power.Katharine Hepburn plays the title role a picturesque old woman who dresses in preWorld War I fashion as an outward manifestation of her rejection of the modern age. She would have looked out of place in 1944 in 1969 she and her fellow senior citizen rebels Edith Evans and Margaret Leighton look even more so. Right at the beginning of the film the age is established for us showing the student protests that rocked France in the late Sixties and we see Kate her best 1913 fashion just gliding through it all.While she rejects the changing times some power people who you would not think of at first as allies are meeting at a Paris caf plotting to really upset her world in a way she can't escape from. Charles Boyer Oscar Homolka Donald Pleasance Paul Henreid John Gavin and Yul Brynner who seems to be taking the lead in the group have discovered that Paris is sitting on a bed of shale with oil deposits that would rival the Middle East as a source. That would certainly make France a power to be reckoned with. In fact Paul Henreid who is a French general makes note of the fact that France has gone its own way politically which at the time Charles DeGaulle was doing separating himself from America and that accursed island nation Great Britain.Of course the site of oil derricks in and around those colorful parts of Paris that have their own legend separate and apart from the city as a whole is something that Kate can't permit. The scheme is brought to her attention by a number of the citizens who have overheard bits and pieces at the caf and were shooed away. Yul Brynner took an especial delight in doing this.Hepburn and her fellow mad women formulate a plan and try these people in abstentia. Parisian street character Danny Kaye the ragpicker who is as far down the economic scale from the conspirators as you can get offers a great defense for them as lawyers do for their clients but it's a done deal. And she's got an interesting fate in store for them.When The Madwoman Of Chaillot made it to Broadway in 194950 and won a Tony Award for Martita Hunt playing the title role theater goers then knew of the great Kettleman Hills oil strike which was close to Los Angeles city limits. There are still parts of the area where you can see functioning oil derricks even today. The image of a gusher coming out of a derrick next to Notre Dame or the Arc De Triomphe was really in the minds of theatergoers back then.Hepburn does well in the part showing that maybe The Madwoman Of Chaillot and her mad friends really have a lot more sense than we might give them credit for. They may have rejected the 20th Century but they rejected the mass wars that characterized it and the all consuming quest for domination and profits above all. There's still beauty in Kate's world and she'll fight to preserve it.The Madwoman Of Chaillot might be a bit quirky for some tastes but Katharine Hepburn's fans will love it.".

But scrap that and listen to what the actors are SAYING about life and liberty and THEN it makes sense for this is an allegory of a film. The closest I can find elsewhere is OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR which uses allegory just as well. Danny Kaye is always a treat but Hepburn is in glorious 1913 costumes and owns the show and remember this is 1969. The same year as THE LION IN WINTER for an entirely different performance. So you have to junk many standard film rules aside and THEN you will find this a very good treat of film. Have it with good French Bordeaux and cheese too.

When I saw the original Broadway production starring Martita Hunt which as I recall took place exclusively in the madwoman's basement I was taken by how delicately the author Giraudoux balanced a serious theme with the humor generated by a group of eccentrics and street people. The film takes the serious theme beats it over the head until it becomes at the very least repetitive with very few touches of humor save perhaps the scenes in which the madwoman inveigles the conspirators to walk into her net when a touch of the old Hepburn edginess appears.

Although it's not very successfully sewn together by director Bryan Forbes there are vignettes that are wonderful and Edward Anhalt's script contains many witty lines. Unfortunately the film is too often draggy if not outright boring. It's really too bad that there's not more substance here. The cast is enormous but the fact that Donald Pleasence Yul Brynner Charles Boyer Danny Kaye and many others are involved merely make for a far too densely populated film. That doesn't mean that the performances are bad. In fact Hepburn is quite touching realizing that in order to stop dreaming she has to wake up! It's also fun watching her share the screen with the likes of Boyer Margaret Leighton and others. Pleasence Brynner and Kaye are exceptional as is Giulietta Masina as Hepburn's flighty lovelorn friend. Ultimately Forbes is simply not a particularly imaginative director. The pacing of the film is very slow especially in its last quarter.

I have read the English adaptation of the original play by Giradoux and I have seen the musical Dear World based on the stage play. Too many characters were added to the screenplay and too much dialog was removed. The director wasn't sure whether it was a drama or a comedy or a tragedy or a farce. Or maybe he thought it was all of the above. I watched it with someone who did not know the story and she was totally lost. Hopefully this will not make it onto DVD. I can't imagine any company wasting the money on such a project.".

This story deals with the difficulties facing a northern Carabinieri captain named Bellodi Franco Nero he is a proverbial honest men  a stiff  idealistic officer and investigating a Mafia killing in a small Sicilian town in 1961 . He is helped by an upright Brigade  both of whom contend dangerous enemies  but determined in their will to fight crime and corruption .

Important figures have a vested interest in ensuring that the very existence of the Mafia can be denied . Meanwhile  Bellodi finds corpses buried under a blanket of tar and faces several risks . But ambition  vendetta  corrupt government influences and decay reach everything and everybody .This exciting and thoughtprovoking Italian cop thriller turns out to be one of the first and best films about the mafia . This heavygoing tale has an interesting and politically incorrect writing by the same director Damiano Damiani along with Ugo Pirro and especially dealing with corruption interwoven between high authorities and Mafia . Based on the Leonardo Sciascia novel of the same title  the movie dramatizes the hold that the Mafia has on Sicilian life  the blackmail the Omert  the power and politics . The picture displays thrills  disturbing issues  suspenseful  great visual style and is pretty entertaining  though sometimes is hard to follow . Excellent main cast as Franco Nero as a roughandready captain who attempts to prove the wealthy man in the city is in the mafia  being very good played by the great Lee J. Cobb . Supporting cast is frankly magnificent such as Nehemiah Persoff as Pizzuco  Tano Cimarosa as Zecchinetta and Serge Reggiani as informer . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli though being necessary a right remastering . Sensitive as well as appropriate musical score by Giovanni Fusco who composed an enjoyable soundtrack .The motion picture was well directed by Damiano Damiani . He's an expert on all kind of genres as Drama Arthur's island  The Most Beautiful Wife  The witch  and Empty canvas based on the Alberto Moravia novel  Terror Amytiville 2  the possession  Historical The Inquiry  Spaghetti Western Trinity is back againand the prestigious A bullet for the General . Damiani was specialized on crimethrillerSubgenre or Italian cop thriller Confessions of a Police captain  How to kill a judge The case is closed  forget it Goodbye e amen  Mafia I Am Afraid and Warning starred by Martin Balsam . Il Giorno Della Civetta seems to be a must see for the Poliziesco fans . This is one of the crowns of the Italian Poliziotteschi police thrillers and Mafia film of the 1970s  along with other films directed by Enzo G . Castellari  Ferdinando Baldi or Umberto Lenzi . Rating  Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching  this highly recommended film is the same for the Italian mafiafilm of that period.".

He's an expert on all kind of genres as Drama Arthur's island  The Most Beautiful Wife  The witch  and Empty canvas based on the Alberto Moravia novel  Terror Amytiville 2  the possession  Historical The Inquiry  Spaghetti Western Trinity is back againand the prestigious A bullet for the General . Damiani was specialized on crimethrillerSubgenre or Italian cop thriller Confessions of a Police captain  How to kill a judge The case is closed  forget it Goodbye e amen  Mafia I Am Afraid and Warning starred by Martin Balsam . Il Giorno Della Civetta seems to be a must see for the Poliziesco fans . This is one of the crowns of the Italian Poliziotteschi police thrillers and Mafia film of the 1970s  along with other films directed by Enzo G . Castellari  Ferdinando Baldi or Umberto Lenzi . Rating  Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching  this highly recommended film is the same for the Italian mafiafilm of that period.";

From what I can gather this might actually be one of the earliest examples of the gritty Italian police procedural that ultimately became the more rumbustious Euro Crime genre which we know and love so dearly! As with many Damiani titles his rich and layered work focuses far more on character development and plot rather than repeated car chases and wild ungainly haymakers!

	schema:reviewBody "I've always wanted to go to Sicily but this tale of the law and the mafia clashing has now made me fear that an old woman might call me a whore from the window a passing car. Just outside of a sleep Sicilian town a construction manager is ambushed in his truck and shot dead while trying to escape. The assassin is spotted by a local man and we forsee the problems the police are going to have as we as the audience witness people purposefully ignoring the corpse until a member of the Caribinieri forces the driver of the bus he is on to stop. New hotshot police Captain Franco Nero is straight on the case being new to Sicily and nave about the way things work there. He knows that the local Godfather Don Mariano Lee Cobb is behind it all but in front of him there are endless underlings hit men liars and even the general public covering things up. It's all to do with building contracts for a new road but how can Nero stop them when even the dead man's brothers are reluctant to help?Hope lies in the shape of Claudia Cardinale because it was her husband that witnessed the murder but then again the husband has gone missing. Rumour and lies fly about the place trying Claudia's husband to the killing claiming that Claudia had made him a cuckold. Claudia is adamant that she has been faithful to her husband but what can one woman do against the might of the mafia and their strange 'sweety wife' tactics that turn the public against her. Those heading here from Andrea Bianchi's mental Cry of A Prostitute or Enzo Castellari's Big Racket will be wondering Where's all the gunfights car chases and bitch slapping? but they needn't worry. Yes the only shots fired are at the start of the film and the film is nearly two hours long but the plot and the acting of those involved drew me into the story. Franco Nero comes across as a young nave and ambitious cop who will stop at nothing to get the biggest catch but his faults also gradually start to shine through and erase his selfconfidence. I'd say Claudia Cardinale stands out the most though as the desperate mother who doesn't even know if her husband is still alive with even the police trying to manipulate her out on her own just trying to tell the truth. Lee Cobb was also good as the overconfident Mafia boss who struts around in front of the police like a rooster with his first hardon.Throw in a whole cast of supporting actors who also stand out and you've got an ever unfolding drama set in the sun that just shows you how difficult a job the police have in rooting out the mafia in Sicily. Damiano Damiani proves once again that he's a solid director. No trash here people.".

	schema:reviewBody "I keep getting pulled into these film adaptations of Leonardo Sciascia's novels and I never cease to wonder at their fine quality. Sciascia was an Italian novelist from Sicily famous for being one of the first writers to openly write about the Mafia a subject that in the early '60s was still prickly in fact many still denied the Mafia existed when The Day of the Owl was published in 1961. Today this criminal organization is an incontrovertible fact which perhaps affects the impact this film adaptation has on modern viewers.I would still heartily recommend this movie to fans of the crime genre on the simple fact it remains a gripping and wellwritten crime drama. Franco Nero plays Bellodi a police captain recently transferred to Sicily where he's slowly learning the ropes. Full of new ideas and a passionate attitude he tries to rip the veil of silence that covers Mafia hits when the owner of a construction company shows up murdered. As always everyone denies having seen anything. His only possible witness is a man who lives in a house nearby the murder scene but he's nowhere to be found and his wife Rosa played by Claudia Cardinale doesn't know where he's gone to.Bellodi not only has to investigate a murder that leads to one of the most important men in the town Don Marino played by Lee J. Cobb the local Mafia don but he also has to untangle the truth from the lies surrounding the case since the Mafia tries to hide the true motives of the murder by making it look like a crime of passion involving Rosa the victim and Rosa's wayward husband  in that society honour can be conveniently used to cover up all crimes.Nero Cardinale and Cobb are excellent and the other actors mainly unknown Italian actors do a great job bringing the movie to life too. The movie doesn't have a boring moment and the intellectual conflict between Bellodi and Don Mariano is gripping. The movie being one of the first ones to tackle the Mafia uses many tropes that since then have become trademarks of the genre  the cop willing to bend the rules a little for justice for instance but more importantly the sense that the Mafia is an unbeatable opponent too rich and powerful ever to be brought down. Compared to American movies this one is quite pessimistic but then again the Mafia in America is not half as chilling as it is in Italy and Sicily.".

While i agree with most that the plot and acting is pretty weak the truly classic oneliners more than make up for this. For instance he utters go thou thundering steed while driving an articulated lorry He takes out a cigar before announcing ahh another bad habit and probably my favourite line in history fucketh mehe says this just before his truck crashes!.I saw this movie first in '97 and have bought it since and it has not lost any of its charm. All in all if you want to have a laugh then you should definitely rent or buy this movie as it is hilarious! Hilariously badbut in a good way.";

It has a great mixture of funny dialog and violent humor and unlike most films the bad guy is obviously the only star. This is done by contrasting the boorish uninteresting people of the film with our colorful funny antihero. Of course who watches a film like this for dialog or characters? We want to see the bad guy on the screen doing what he does best. And Rumpelstiltskin does this this quickly not wasting a lot of time developing other characters whom we could care less about. However the characters are certainly not underdeveloped either. You'll just have to see this film for yourself.".

I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is a welldrawn character but it isn't your usual scream queen but more like Linda Hamilton in Terminator. Otherwise this film is a mess it's lowbudget showing in almost every scene. Rumpelstiltskin himself is extremely annoying mouthing bad oneliners almost every minute. The specialeffects are not that much to write home about either and the less said about other characters the better I must confess I even disliked the baby wishing for a unhappy ending. It's also surprisingly boring despite a healthy pace throughout. My suggestion don't watch but give ms Ulrich a better part in something else.".

However I found this film rather entertaining since it's directed and coscripted by Mark Jones the creator of Leprechaun though this was the third and last film he ever wrote and directed.What we have here is a grotesque Freddy Kruegerlike hunchbacked babystealing punk whose name is the movie's title who loosely based on the children's fairytale is cursed by an old hag who imprisons him in a brownishgreen rock for onethousand years for trying to steal the Baby John's soul so that he could live on for eternity and never be killed. Onethousand years later in present day Los Angeles a woman's police officer husband is killed by an armed carjacker in the line of duty. A few days later she finds the stone that Rumpelstiltskin is imprisoned drops a tear on it that's what you have to do to release him with a tear and a true wish when crying and remembering her dead husband. Somehow Rumpelstiltskin is released from his imprisonment transforms into the woman's husdband makes love to her and turns back into himself to suck her baby's soul out. Later on we have a whole hell of a lot of exciting things going on including Rumpelstiltskin chasing after her and her baby and a sleazy television host in a huge truck wreaking even further havoc till the very end.Despite its lowbudget and amateurish acting the picture does have its great moments and memorable situations but refuses to deliver any real shocks or a lick of redeeming value though it does have some excellent special makeup effects by Kevin Yagher Child's Play 1 2 3 and Bride of Chucky.So give Rumpelstiltskin a chance and you'll have a good time with this fastpaced flick.".

Now our little devilish fiend wants the soul of mommy's baby to render himself immortal.While most mediocre horror efforts from the 90's made the mistake playing it serious when not up to the task at least there was nonsense like RUMPELSTILTSKIN that has its idiotic heart at the right place. Main attraction is without a doubt Max Grodnchik as the titular little bastard spewing one ridiculous oneliner after another. At one point he even quotes Col.

When trying to protect her baby Shelley  who appears to be so mildhearted and very gentle at first  begins with kicking Rumpy in the balls then suddenly pulls out a big knife and viciously shouts When you take one more step I'll rip your head off and shove it up your ass! and she said it like she meant it. She then proceeds cutting off one of his fingers planting the knife in his forehead and even shoving a spikeshaped broomstick into his mouth. I mean if that doesn't put a grin on your face I'm not sure what will.The rest of the film is a ridiculously fun ride and the movie's pace even gets upped a bit by injecting that roadmovie vibe halfway through the film.

Sorry that was just a quick filter to stop potential 'haters' of this movie seeing it or reading this. So if you like horror you'll be aware that between around 19881996 the genre was ridiculous and terrible bar a few noble exceptions. Only 99 of the stuff that came out was terrible. However as a kid it was great to be able to watch things like LeprechaunRumpelstiltskin and be mildly scared mostly by the box cover and be amused also. I have fond memories of Rumpelstiltskin and when I watched it yesterday I still enjoyed it. It's nothing special but Rumpelstiltskin looks quite evil says lines like this ain't no fairytale and even raises the dead once. Awesome!You can see the director thought 'shit look at my budget I don't need all that' so he just decided to blow stuff up. There are some great explosions of trucks...yes there is a Rumpelstiltskin car chase! Criticisms. Acting the acting was so bad not quite 'Manos' bad but everyone bar the mother of the baby and the cop who dies early on were terrible. Even little Rumpel is only OK would have liked less comic humour and more sinister stuff. Plot It's weak and sometimes it's too slow others too fast. Like when Rumpel is unleashed the pacing goes out the window. Though I must say there's plenty of the little guy in this movie and that's what we want to see so I can't complain. Rumpel He's a good character but if it wasn't for Leprechaun's cult following would they have made Rumpel more sinister? It may not have worked because he's laughable even before he speaks.This movie works only if you suspend all belief and expect as little as possible. It helps if you're bored and just don't care what you watch also. 610 just because of it's faint charm and explosions. There is no horror to be found in this movie!".

Sorry that was just a quick filter to stop potential 'haters' of this movie seeing it or reading this. So if you like horror you'll be aware that between around 19881996 the genre was ridiculous and terrible bar a few noble exceptions. Only 99 of the stuff that came out was terrible. However as a kid it was great to be able to watch things like LeprechaunRumpelstiltskin and be mildly scared mostly by the box cover and be amused also.

Therefore I was delighted when I found 'Rumpelstiltskin' on Netflix and wondered how I managed to miss this one during the eighties. Then about halfway through I realised with a little help from the internet that it was actually made in the nineties. I don't really know why I feel the need to mention that so early  perhaps because the film simply feels like it was made in the eighties. That and because I couldn't get the Terminator out of my head.Rumpelstiltskin is a  sort of  modern take on the fairy tale about the little man who tries to steal babies unless you can guess his name. He was happily kiddiesnatching all those hundreds of years ago when a crafty old witch only caught him in the act and banished him into a statue. Then in the eighties yes I still refuse to believe that this was filmed in the nineties he's thawed out yadder yadder yadder and now he's after another mum with another baby.And in my opinion it kind of felt like the original Terminator film. There was an unstoppable creature hunting down a helpless woman with a man to protect her. Okay so Sarah Connor was lucky enough to have Kyle Reece to help her out. Here the female protagonist has a sleezy chatshow host to generally get in the way and wind her up. He's definitely no Kyle Reece but he is pretty amusing.Rumpelstiltskin could just be another monster Bmovie but it's basically saved by the titular monster's performance. He's just so delightfully nasty. He's impervious to pain and knows it. Therefore he likes to take his time as he stalks and terrorises all those who get in his way.The film knows what it is and doesn't ever try and take itself seriously. If you like slightly tongue in cheek films with a thoroughly evil little man at the centre of it all then give this horror classic a go especially if you can catch it on Netflix for free!.".

The Rumpelstiltskin character looked great and the plot line kept my interest throughout. The makeup was great and it the minimal use of special effects made this movie much less outrageous than it could have been. It was almost overthetop but stopped just in time. It was not very true to the old fairy tale but took a modern twist on it. Rumplestiltskin was reawakened 500 years later in the 1990's and needs a firstborn son to steal its soul and set him free. I totally did not expect him to be driving a motorcycle or a semitruck but it happens and it worked. There is a long chase scene where he is driving an oil tanker and spouting out humorous oneliners until he wrecks it. The only way to kill him is to burn him with fire and straw but before the protagonists discover this he kicks some ass and takes a few wicked beatings. This film was hilarious creepy and a thoroughly enjoyable take on a classic fairy tale from our youth. I give it a 9 for originality and entertainment value.".

You might be forgiven for thinking that you're watching LEPRECHAUN here but no this is just another in the long line of silly killer creature movies including the likes of TROLL GHOULIES and lots more. I'm desperately trying to think of something positive to say about this film but the best I can say is that it's slightly better than LEPRECHAUN but not much...Things kick off promisingly with a scene set in the 1400s which sees a group of frightened villagers set fire to Rumpelstiltskin and banish him but not before he's torn out somebody's eyeball and munched it! Sadly almost immediately the film goes forward to the present day and we are introduced to the biggest group of nonactors poor performers and basic idiots that you are ever likely to see. The prize for most irritating actress of all time goes to the woman playing the lead's friend who wears silly hats and has a fine line in ridiculous facial expressions. Her brutal necksnapping comes as welcome relief.In a film which has criminals who decide to steal cars WHILE POLICEMAN STAND TALKING ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY and in which a man escapes from a huge truck ON A CHILD'S BUGGY the only impressive thing is Rumpelstiltskin's appearance designed and created by the talented Kevin Yagher. With dead grey drawn skin and an almost reptilian look Rumpelstiltskin seems to be the logical progression of some of Jim Henson's creature creations for example the ones in THE DARK CRYSTAL. Sadly the scriptwriters decided to make Rumpelstiltskin a ridiculous villain by giving him lots of silly Freddy Kruegerstyle wisecracks which totally ruin the impression.The plot seems to have been borrowed from THE TERMINATOR Rumpelstiltskin rides a bike massacres a police force and chases the leads in a huge truck which then explodes the moronic comedy just isn't funny and even the silly gore effects  severed heads arms etc. fail to impress. From the moment the heroine sticks a broom handle into Rumpelstiltskin's mouth to defend herself you just know this is going to be a bad film and indeed it is in every possible way. Sometimes I wonder why I watch rubbish like this when I could be doing something more productive. Please don't make the mistake I did and avoid this at all costs!".

Her brutal necksnapping comes as welcome relief.In a film which has criminals who decide to steal cars WHILE POLICEMAN STAND TALKING ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY and in which a man escapes from a huge truck ON A CHILD'S BUGGY the only impressive thing is Rumpelstiltskin's appearance designed and created by the talented Kevin Yagher. With dead grey drawn skin and an almost reptilian look Rumpelstiltskin seems to be the logical progression of some of Jim Henson's creature creations for example the ones in THE DARK CRYSTAL. Sadly the scriptwriters decided to make Rumpelstiltskin a ridiculous villain by giving him lots of silly Freddy Kruegerstyle wisecracks which totally ruin the impression.The plot seems to have been borrowed from THE TERMINATOR Rumpelstiltskin rides a bike massacres a police force and chases the leads in a huge truck which then explodes the moronic comedy just isn't funny and even the silly gore effects  severed heads arms etc. fail to impress. From the moment the heroine sticks a broom handle into Rumpelstiltskin's mouth to defend herself you just know this is going to be a bad film and indeed it is in every possible way. Sometimes I wonder why I watch rubbish like this when I could be doing something more productive. Please don't make the mistake I did and avoid this at all costs!";

Both movies feature a psychotic little imp who is transported to modern times In this case modern being the mid 90's to wreak havoc on their intended victim. Both the Leprechaun and Rumpelstiltskin are similar in the fact that they are single minded in their goals.

	schema:reviewBody "Hmm there's beautiful big money to make with horror movies about ugly little creeps That's what writerdirector Mark Jones must have thought after the release of Leprechaun in 1993 and since other directors were already making sequels to his horror movie he promptly started writing a script revolving on another midget committing nasty and gruesome deeds. There are quite a number of similarities between Rumpelstiltskin and Leprechaun even aside from the titular characters' short length. Both movies revolve on unworldly creatures  one from the Irish mythology and the other a medieval fairy tale character  being unleashed in modern civilized times. They're both fanatically searching for something that righteously belongs to them whether it's a pot of gold or the soul of a firstborn baby and they are eager to butcher a whole lot of people whilst firing off one cheesy and ludicrous oneliner after the other. I vividly remember reading and listening to the fairytale version of Rumpelstiltskin as a child. It was one of my favorite macabre stories what with its 15th Century rural setting and a plot containing elements like child kidnapping and emotional blackmail. The film version opens in these dark medieval times but then quickly jumps forth in time towards the violenceinfested streets of LA in the 1990's. Rumpelstiltskin is locked away in a magic stone but he's set free when a mourning mother sheds a tear on the stone and wishes for her recently killed husband to come back from the dead and meet their son. When the wish is granted hideous little Uncle Rumpel as he hilariously refers to himself once or twice claims ownership of baby John. The rest of the film depicts Rumpelstiltskin chasing after mother child and a TV host guy who says equally retarded stuff as the evil dwarf. Rumpelstiltskin is fairly enjoyable 90's horror shlock but you obviously cannot expect a good or even halfdecent movie. Mark Jones seemingly hesitated about what he wanted to achieve as well as the opening sequences with the tragic death of a young policeman and his struggling being left behind at eight months of pregnancy are serioustoned and melodramatic but then as soon as Rumpel shows his hideous face the movie turns into a fastpaced and almost slapstick type of horror comedy. The little creep pretends to be Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator because he smokes big cigars and consecutively steals a heavy motorcycle and a gigantic petrol truck. There are a couple of imaginative killings but don't expect any gore. Max Grodnchik isn't as menacing as Warwick Davis was in Leprechaun  especially the voice isn't creepy enough  but he definitely is ugly enough for the job. Lead actress Kim Johnston Ulrich is very good but all her direct colleagues Tommy Blaze and particularly Allyce Beasley only evoke sentiments of irritation.".

The Pleasure Garden tells the story of a chorus girl Patsy who gives the gift of friendship to a newcomer a rube of a girl called Jill who gets herself robbed on her first visit to the theatre and who lacks a friend contacts and a place to stay. Patsy gives her all of these.At first the film seems that it is going to be Jill's story as we follow her hiring by the masher of an impresario and her quick elevation to the star of the lowbrow dance show the theatre is presenting. But it gradually becomes apparent that Patsy is the focus of the tale as she is romanced by a friend of Jill's earnest fiance Hugh a rodent of a man called Levett. Levett and Patsy marry whilst Hugh finds himself sidelined by Jill's new found stagedoorJohnny admirers. Levett and Hugh sail away to their overseas job in the colonies leaving Patsy to pine for her husband and Jill to romance a rou Prince.Patsy and Levett's marriage is a curious thing. He asks her that they share our loneliness together before he sails back to his job which she takes as a proposal of marriage we get the impression he was after some temporary female company. Once back in the colonies Levett shows his true colours shacking up with a dusky native maiden and drinking like a soak. Patsy gets word that he's sick and decides to ship out to see him but the fare isn't easy to raise her now wealthy old friend Jill refuses to help her point blank and only the cosy old couple who run the house where she boards save the day. Unfortunately for Patsy the first thing she sees when she arrives at Levett's lodgings is her husband in his native maiden's arms. There follows a denouement of rather rancid melodrama as Levett kills his mistress is haunted by her ghost almost kills Patsy is killed himself by a deus ex machina colonial superior leaving Patsy and Hugh free to realise that they love each other.Levett's cynical view of women he quickly recognises Jill for what she is his view of marriage as a mutual sharing of loneliness his sexual obsession with his Other of a mistress his murder of her when she puts his respectable life at risk and his haunting by the dusky temptress is a pretty lurid and provocative portrait of white middleclass masculinity soured by experience and conflicting desires. That he has to die for Hugh and Patsy to get together suggest that Hitchcock and his sources were up to the idea that respectable petit bourgeois marriage is built on the grave of all that it excludes long before the cultural and queer theorists were writing their stuff. Levett is a fascinating character far richer and far more unknowable than the rather bland leads  the first in a long line of portraits of human oddity from The Maestro.The film's opening sequence as Charles Barr points out in his introduction to the recent Region 2 Network release in their The British Years boxset has a dirty old man sitting in the front row of a theatre looking through a lens at the bodies of the dancing girls  voyeurism the male gaze women subjected to it all ready to go in old Hitch's very first sequence in his dbut film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pleasure Garden is the first film that Alfred Hitchcock directed to completion. It's a nice look into the earliest directorial thoughts and techniques of the master. Even in this earliest film we can see signs of what would become some of his signature trademarks. I enjoyed some of the point of view shots early in the film with the blurred view of the man looking through his monocle as well as the gentleman looking through the binoculars at the show girls legs. There is also a spiral staircase in the opening of this movie. Not that it was used like the staircase in Vertigo but it made me smile thinking of how important that would be in his later film. The story deals with the idea of infidelity. Jill Carmelita Geraghty is an aspiring dancer who gets engaged to Hugh John Stuart who has to leave for work overseas. Patsy Virginia Valli who has helped Jill get her start starts to worry about Jill keeping her promise to wait for Hugh. Jill's career is taking off and she begins to fool around with other guys. Patsy marries Levett Miles Mander Hugh's friend who also goes overseas to work with Hugh. Unlike Jill Patsy remains true to her husband thinking only of being with him. She receives a letter that her husband has taken ill and scrapes up the money to go be with her husband in his time of need. When she arrives she finds that he has taken to drinking and island women. That's when the trouble ensues. I enjoyed Hitch's first film. It's a little slow starting but picks up pace as it goes along. I liked seeing Cuddles the dog thrown in for a little comic relief to contrast the seriousness of the film which of course is another of Hitchcock's trademarks. There was also a nice subtle score by Lee Erwin that fit the film well. Out of 4".

But this the first complete Hitchcock movie shows no signs of his future greatness. He is clearly a journeyman director some one who shows promise but sent to Berlin for his final exam.On the plus side this movie starts off surprisingly well with a snappy Americanpaced chorinesonthetown plot. If they had cast Marion Davies and Marie Prevost in this it would be typical if rather underwritten. The start moves fast plot points pop up and suddenly we take a turn and the story descends into melodrama.Fairly typical of Hitchcock you might say and you would be right but he hasn't got any sense of what his chosen symbols are  both leads are brunettes which will come as a surprise to anyone who knows Hitchcock's taste for icy blondes. The symbolic items are standard and not particularly shocking  Virginia Valli's weddingbed deflowering is indicated by an apple with a large chunk bitten out of it  and the actors are not really up to their jobs.Hitchcock was never a great director of actors but a great director of scenes. By 1927 his visual flair got his bosses to invest in great actors for his pictures starting with Ivor Novello for THE LODGER. But here everyone is.... at best adequate with Miles Mander very stagy and whoever plays his native lover  still miscredited in the IMDb as Nita Naldi  seemingly braindamaged.There are a couple of interestingly composed visual glosses the door that Mander must go through looks like a Turkish harem door and the decoration on either side differs dramatically on one side is life on another death. But this is UFA with great cameramen and all the technicians who made great expressionist fare like CALIGARI and modernist masterpieces like Lang's work ready and eager to work.... and there's none of that here.I find it hard to give this an exact rating the great start is sunk by the foolishness of the ending and Hitchcock at the the start of his career is not the great film maker he would be in another thirty years  or even four. But it is Hitchcock and therefore demands our attention so I'll give it a good mark for that.But if it weren't Hitchcock's first film no one would care. It probably wouldn't even still be in existence.".

I would agree with one reviewer that Cuddles the dog gives some of the scenes humor. The transformation of two of the characters for the worst is loud and clear and the plot is not only crystal clear but quite effective.

	schema:reviewBody "Compared to the industries in Hollywood and Germany precious few British films from the silent era have been preserved and deemed worthy of study. The Pleasure Garden would probably have been consigned to the dusty bin of obscurity were it not for its being the debut of one Alfred Hitchcock.Hitchcock was of course destined for greatness so this picture inevitably gets scrutinised for hints of said greatness or at least traces of Hitchcockiness. A pointofview shot of the legs of a chorus line in the opening scene is often referenced as an example of such a bit of pure voyeurism that is at odds with the moralist plot line. A slightly more storyorientated pointofview shot occurs when a pickpocket eyes up Virginia Valli's handbag. Hitchcock was clearly interested from the beginning by the idea of putting the audience in the place of a character and the latter example helps to tell the story visually but it is of little longterm value. Neither the thief nor the legviewer become established characters so there is really no need for us to become them.The way these early scenes are shot may be aimed to cut down on the intertitles by conveying the story visually. You see during his apprenticeship Hitchcock had done some art direction work on Der Letzte Mann a picture best known for containing no intertitles whatsoever except one at the beginning and one near the end. While the resultant excess of technique is in fact more distracting than title cards the idea obviously fired the young Hitch's imagination. To avoid having to tell he goes to somewhat forceful lengths to show. Then again it could just be because the 26yearold director really liked to look at women's legs.But after those showy opening sequences The Pleasure Garden gets bogged down in a series of talking scenes. By contrast the interaction here is shot rather flatly and there are suddenly lots of intertitles. This middle section of the picture is incredibly slow and boring. The plot is muddied by a lack of welldefined memorable characters and the fact that the two female leads look very similar is especially confusing. In the melodramatic climax there are some vague attempts at psychological manipulation with a few closeups of a menaced Valli but it's too little too late.The Pleasure Garden is full of tricks many of which can be seen as corresponding to the technique of the later Hitchcock  God shots pointofview shots closeups to focus us on a particular object. But these are all things any monkey could pick up after hanging around a few film sets and the director does not yet know how to put them to best use. The Pleasure Garden may pique the interest of Hitchcock completists but other than that it is simply dull.".

Top hat'd Hamilton smoking a cigar while standing in front of a 'Smoking Prohibited' sign.

Surprisingly dull and lackluster results considering the way it all sounds although the climax does have a little bit of action to it.

She has been embraced by her friend who has been in the chorus for a while but one she gains popularity she has no time for the other woman. A marriage of convenience takes place and things really unravel. Also the young starlet begins to realize that all her attention can't seem to make her happy. Things get kind of weird when the cad ends up in some island paradise with a native cookie whom he uses in every way possible. There are some really ridiculous confrontations and overacting by the principles. Everything gets wrapped up kind of neatly. Hitchcock was obviously learning the camera. I disagree with a previous comment about a monkey hanging around a film set being able to come up with this film. There are already hints of a style coming to the fore.

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's first film a very good melodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "At the age of 25 Alfred Hitchcock who had been an assistant director to Michael Balcon was given the chance to direct his first film which was of course silent. It is very good and showed at once that he had talent. Assistant director on the film was a girl named Alma Reville who was to become Hitchcock's wife and lifelong partner in all of his film projects. The film is based on a popular novel by 'Oliver Sandys' which was the pen name of a woman whose real name was Marguerite Jarvis and who in this same year appeared as an actress under the name of Marguerite Evans in the comedy film STAGESTRUCK with Gloria Swanson. The title of this film is the name of a music hall in London where two girls are in the chorus together and share a room in Brixton. The melodrama concerns the adventures of their lives and respective fates. The film was shot at Babelsburg Studios in Germany and had an international cast. The American actress Virginia Valli plays Patsy the good girl of the two. And Jill the girl who goes to the bad is played by another American actress Carmelita Geraghty. The German actor Karl Falkenberg plays the unpleasant and sinister Prince Ivan who leads Jill astray. Falkenberg acted in 100 films between 1916 and 1936 after which he disappears from history. Probably he was Jewish was banned from the screen by the Nazis and then sent to a death camp. Possibly the best performance in the film is by British actor Miles Mander who outdid Falkenberg by appearing in 107 films between 1920 and 1947 including WUTHERING HEIGHTS 1939. In this film he plays a cad who married Patsy and then betrays her with a mistress and goes to pieces with drink and decadence. He delivers a very finely judged performance and does not overact. Carmelita Geraghty is very convincing in her downward spiral into immorality selfishness and selling herself for fame and fortune. The film is not particularly creaky with age and is well worth seeing.".

Essentially a story about two show girls one a gold digger and the other a nice girl. The former marries into royalty and the latter makes an initial marriage mistake that makes up the bulk of the narrative.The commercially released DVD which I viewed runs 5935 but the timings here on IMDb range from 75 to 92 minutes. I was aware of a few abrupt transitions that may be due to trimmed footage most notably the departure of Jill's husband from their honeymoon to his plantation job. Also we last see Patsy as she is selecting her trousseau for her upcoming marriage. I imagine the original film has a good deal more about how she ended up contrasting with Jill's fortunes. It does seem unbalanced to leave her story up in the air.All in all an enjoyable and competently made film.".

'The Pleasure Garden' is sweet little gem and is total pleasure to watch. It doesn't feel like Hitchcock's movie and there are very little his trademarks visible how could there be he was just beginner director. The story is very straightforward and simple melodrama but it is not silly. Nothing is hidden under the surface. All the elements are well put together. Besides being Hitchcock's first movie as a director there is nothing special but it is a sweet film that definitely deserves to be seen. Especially by the fans of the legendary director.P.S. Alma Reville and Alfred Hitchcock got engaged during the shoot and what a couple they became.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's films are often analysis by film critics film students and filmmakers alike. Memorable Films like 1940 'Rebecca' 1948 'Rope' 1959's 'North by Northwest'  1963's 'The Birds' are some of his most study. Yet the 1925's silent film 'Pleasure Garden' is not one of his films wellknown. In my opinion it equally worthy of seeing and dissecting even if some parts of the film was a bit boring. Made way before the director became the master of suspense. 'Pleasure Garden' is the director full feature debut after filming short films for years. While Hitchcock fashioned for himself a recognizable directorial style over a career spanning more than half a century. His stylistic trademarks begun to take shape here. You see it in the opening scene where he use the camera to mimic a person's gaze forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism like 1954's 'Rear Window' or 1960's 'Psycho'. Lots of surprising raciness sexual overtones in this film. It's rare to see that much 'skin' in this time period of filmmaking history. There is also a spiral staircase in the opening of this movie like 1958's 'Vertigo' use as a motif for impending danger or suspense. Still if you hoping for something like a serious psychological thriller then this film might not be for you. Most of the film is told through ditzy romantic  comedy. Don't get me wrong the cheesy comedy parts were fine and I did like the dog Cuddles but there were a few things that could had made this film a lot better. First off I think the film could had juxtaposing the humor against some of the heavy subject matter a lot better. The horror part of the film really comes out of nowhere with the film turning an odd slasher film. I think the movie needed a better way of foreshadowing it. Another problem with this film is missing a strong 'MacGuffin' for the protagonist to pursue. The movie is almost directionless and bit too melodrama because of it. The first half of the film looks nothing like the second half at all. It seems like two different movies sloppy edited together with lots of pacing issues. Because of this it become very jarring to watch at times. Based on a novel of the same name by Oliver Sandys AKA Marguerite Florence Barclay the plot is supposed to tell the story of two chorus girls Jill Cheyne Carmelita Geraghty  Patsy Brand Virginia Valli at the Pleasure Garden Theatre in London and their troubled relationships. While at first it seems like Jill Cheyne will be the protagonist of this story due to her strong desires to be a dancer it became apparent that Patsy is indeed the main focus of this film with her melodramatic with her husband Levett Miles Mander. This wouldn't be a problem if Patsy wasn't so bland. She really wasn't that interesting. I think the movie could had solve it if they kept with the chorus theme even when the two main actresses can't dance worth crap. Why because it would allow the good hearted Patsy and the selfcenter gold digger Jill to have some competition with each other. I kinda like the rivalry between the uber rich and the middle class. It would make a better movie. It would be like something similar to 1924s 'White Shadow' movie theme. Instead the second half also takes us out of the interesting yet sexy world of Chorus dancing into the out of place plains of the British Empire colonies. While in truth these movie sequence is indeed shot in Italy in story it's supposed to be Africa. At least what's I believe is supposed to be Africa. In my opinion it looks more like Malaysia or Indonesia based on how the location  people look. I really couldn't buy it being Africa at all. To make it worst there were a numerous mishaps surrounding the production such as the film stock being confiscated by Italian customs officials  a whole load of expenses going missing. For a Hitchcock movie I really surprised by the lack of any exotic  adventurous with this location. Because of that it was somewhat dreary. Even the supporting actors were a mixed bag for me. Miles Mander was alright for the villain but I really didn't care for John Stuart as love interest Hugh Fielding. I found his character to be just as dull as Patsy. I couldn't care for their clumsy totally unmotivated Deus ex Machina love affair. It was just awkward to watch. No wonder why not a lot of people watch this movie when it came out. To add to the misery there was no cameo from Alfred Hitchcock. So don't bother looking for it. The film was not actually much liked by the distributors as well who took exception to its Europeaninfluenced 'arty' touches and a violent shooting near the end. It was only released after the success of Hitchcock's next picture 1927's 'The Lodger'. Since then it has existed in a bewildering number of hack versions often containing alternate or cut footage but recently most DVDs has fully restored the film to its original 90 mins from five different edits. Just make sure you get the right DVD if you choose to watch this movie. Still the print used for most of these DVDs clearly seen better days. So don't be surprised to see rather heavy contrast and plenty of scratches and speckles. The music score composed and performed by Lee Erwin was surprising well done but its mono so it's not saying much. Overall I have to say this dinky period melodrama lacks the depth and engagement of the director's better films to come. Still it's worth checking out for any Hitchcock fan even if it's just for analyzing all of his work.".

She opens her arms only to a new girl Jill Cheyne Carmelita Geraghty who seems an innocent but quickly shows she's a woman with an agenda and little time for friends after they serve their purpose.

We begin with a shot of dancing girls rushing down a spiral staircase to perform followed by a shot of a row of male spectators each individually expressing voyeuristic delight capped off by the one woman in the row who has nodded off.I felt a bit like her well before the business of The Pleasure Garden had concluded. Not that Pleasure Garden is ever bad. It offers decent central performances and some delightful bits of business courtesy of Patsy's middleclass landlord couple and a cute dog named Cuddles in the film. But the story lacks the depth and engagement of Hitchcock's better films to come.Hitchcock does a nice job early on playing with audience expectations. Patsy's opening moments show her in a blond wig and when one patron clumsily compliments her on her lovely curl of hair she takes it off her wig with a smirk. Then I give it to you and hope you have a nice time she says cutting him off.But it's Jill who turns out to be the film's heel something anticipated in the way she pushes Cuddles off Patsy's bed in a moment no one else sees but us. Hitch loved these sort of designing women and made much of them in other movies but here he just trots Jill through her paces until she upstages Patsy 11 minutes in and then proceeds to shake her off once she gets herself established with the same sleazy patrons Patsy wisely avoids.The story is much the same with the other duplicitous character in the film a friend of Hugh's named Levet Miles Mander the only actor here who worked in another Hitchcock film Murder!. Levet is entirely too sly and onenote to make us understand why practical Patsy jets off with him after he tells her sob stories of a lonely life on a tropical post. No surprise we find him a few minutes after marrying Patsy in the arms of a tropicalisland girl he treats like a maid.The story does nothing with Jill after establishing her true nature we watch her coldly cut off Patsy a couple of times and wonder what made Patsy into such a victim when she had smarts and looks to spare. Valli like Geraghty an American actress in this very British film plays her part with too much fluttering vibrato even if it is what the story requires. The resolution of Patsy's unhappy marriage is done in a particularly utilitarian style Hitch showing his screen economy but not the shadings or textures of his later work.I liked The Pleasure Garden more for the hints of later greatness though the symbolism here is too often onthenail for its own good. When Levet is done with Patsy he casually throws a rose he gave her into the river and tells her Had to  it wilted. Meanwhile her relationship with Hugh just sort of happens out of left field with us being told by the end Cuddles knew all along.It's a pat end for a pat film not terrible just stunted by the time it was made the silent medium it was made in and the inexperience of its maker who managed to get much better very soon.".

The best thing about the film was maybe the cute dog. Too bad he did not even appears in 5 scenes even if he had the final shot. I cannot say I am familiar with anybody from the cast here even if some of them have been prolific in film before and after this one. It is a silent don't be fooled by the music blackandwhite film that like so many other suffer from simply not enough intertitles to understand exactly what's going on even if the dramatic finale was decent. Also like many other films from almost 100 years ago this one got restored and there are several information in terms of the runtime. The version I saw was really short barely made it beyond the 1hour mark. Good thing though as it really wasn't a thrilling watch. Not recommended unless you're a Hitchcock completionist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edgar Wallace was an astoundingly prolific English author of the 1920s and early '30s who churned out so many novels  mostly crime thrillers  that two different movie studios one in Britain one in Germany actually specialised in producing lowbudget film adaptations of his works. A minority of Wallace's novels including 'The Green Archer' and 'The Terror' dabbled in the supernatural but usually offered a contrived 'natural' explanation. Ironically Wallace's most famous screen credit is for a story he did not write. Hired by RKO to script 'King Kong' Wallace accepted the assignment but died before he could begin the film gave him a story credit solely for the boxoffice value of his name. Although Wallace made millions from his bestselling novels and plays he died skint this was down to a combination of his personal generosity and his penchant for the geegees.I've viewed an incomplete print of the American serial 'The Green Archer' based on Wallace's novel of that name but deviating from it in several ways. Abel Bellamy the excellent Burr McIntosh has become a millionaire by ruthless and illegal methods. Apparently having nothing better to do with his wealth he purchases a mediaeval English castle and has it disassembled and shipped to America where he reassembles it in upstate New York. I would find this premise wildly implausible if not for the fact that William Randolph Hearst had pulled some similar stunts. This development not in Wallace's novel has clearly been added to the film so that American actors can enact the story in Stateside locations but with a Ye Olde Castle conveniently handy.Yet the castle appears to be haunted Bellamy and various other people keep spotting a weird cloaked figure armed with a crossbow and very real arrows which the archer uses for homicidal purposes. The intertitles inform us that the archer's robes are green although this movie is monochrome.This being a serial several characters in the movie are suspected of being the Green Archer. Although the archer is apparently male some of the suspects are women ... including marcelledblonde Allene Ray as Valerie a neighbour whose father Stephen Grattan has a grudge against Bellamy. Valerie is in love with handsome Jim Featherstone a local police captain ... or is Featherstone really the archer?Character actor Frank Lackteen a favourite of serial fans is on hand as a lounge lizard ... although Lackteen here wears a ludicrously obvious hairpiece. Lackteen parlayed his prominent cheekbones and unusual facial structure into a fine career in movie cliffhangers. IMDb's credits for this movie include an actor named Ray Allan but no such actor is in the cast list of the reels that I viewed I suspect that 'Ray Allan' is a typo for 'Allene Ray' the leading actress here.I'm not much of a serials fan as they tend to feature numbingly implausible plots spun out repetitiously to comprise the maximum number of chapters for the minimum amount of story. Based on the nonconsecutive reels that I viewed 'The Green Archer' appears to be more coherent and more intelligent than most of its brethren. The scenes in the mediaeval castle are more convincing than I'd expected. As I've only seen a partial print I shan't rate this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Edgar Wallace was an astoundingly prolific English author of the 1920s and early '30s who churned out so many novels  mostly crime thrillers  that two different movie studios one in Britain one in Germany actually specialised in producing lowbudget film adaptations of his works. A minority of Wallace's novels including 'The Green Archer' and 'The Terror' dabbled in the supernatural but usually offered a contrived 'natural' explanation. Ironically Wallace's most famous screen credit is for a story he did not write. Hired by RKO to script 'King Kong' Wallace accepted the assignment but died before he could begin the film gave him a story credit solely for the boxoffice value of his name. Although Wallace made millions from his bestselling novels and plays he died skint this was down to a combination of his personal generosity and his penchant for the geegees.I've viewed an incomplete print of the American serial 'The Green Archer' based on Wallace's novel of that name but deviating from it in several ways. Abel Bellamy the excellent Burr McIntosh has become a millionaire by ruthless and illegal methods. Apparently having nothing better to do with his wealth he purchases a mediaeval English castle and has it disassembled and shipped to America where he reassembles it in upstate New York. I would find this premise wildly implausible if not for the fact that William Randolph Hearst had pulled some similar stunts. This development not in Wallace's novel has clearly been added to the film so that American actors can enact the story in Stateside locations but with a Ye Olde Castle conveniently handy.Yet the castle appears to be haunted Bellamy and various other people keep spotting a weird cloaked figure armed with a crossbow and very real arrows which the archer uses for homicidal purposes. The intertitles inform us that the archer's robes are green although this movie is monochrome.This being a serial several characters in the movie are suspected of being the Green Archer. Although the archer is apparently male some of the suspects are women ... including marcelledblonde Allene Ray as Valerie a neighbour whose father Stephen Grattan has a grudge against Bellamy. Valerie is in love with handsome Jim Featherstone a local police captain ... or is Featherstone really the archer?Character actor Frank Lackteen a favourite of serial fans is on hand as a lounge lizard ... although Lackteen here wears a ludicrously obvious hairpiece. Lackteen parlayed his prominent cheekbones and unusual facial structure into a fine career in movie cliffhangers. IMDb's credits for this movie include an actor named Ray Allan but no such actor is in the cast list of the reels that I viewed I suspect that 'Ray Allan' is a typo for 'Allene Ray' the leading actress here.I'm not much of a serials fan as they tend to feature numbingly implausible plots spun out repetitiously to comprise the maximum number of chapters for the minimum amount of story.

	schema:reviewBody "Kids. They're everywhere. Always underfoot or out and about and it's only a matter of time before one spills the beans and unearths your family's buried secret. In this timely drama from the faroff Forties the secret in question is the past adoption of the oldest daughter played by the always capable Ann Blyth. She was an actress who was small boned with a porcelainlike face and a voluminously deep cadence. Afterall she was a trained opera singer. Although petite it was always difficult for me to view her as a teenager.Let me first say the extended opening sequence concerning the arrival and assembly of a spanking new television set is quite remarkable. First I found it difficult to believe that televisions came in pieces like your kid's bicycle. Second the rather tipsy and unstable relationship between the two oldest girls is on displayroofsidewithin full view of all the neighbors. And us. The man of their dreams just so happens to be the fellow who is installing the aerial on the family's roof. The entire scene teeters on the shingled seesaw of a colossal courting snafu. And third the youngest daughter's constant badgering of the other delivery man as he attempts to assemble the glowing box of fuses and tubes can only be described as fingernailsonblackboard annoying. But forgiven. Perfectly contrasted with the levelheaded Blyth Joan Evans the middle daughter is a revelation of bad intentions and devious schemes. But there is still something appealing about her. We don't root against her. Natalie Wood the youngest daughter has all of her acting ducks in a row. As usual. The best performance however is turned in by Ann Dvorak playing the woman who puts baby Blyth up for adoption. She's a bundle of raw nerves in her two pivotal scenes. She smokes like an incinerator paces back and forth and has her head on a spinning rotor. The meeting between her and Blyth is heartbreaking. The movie doesn't try to soft peddle the truth life is not always neat and tidy like a box of soap powder.".

But I stand corrected. Notwithstanding the negative comments posted by adopted IMDb members I found the film compelling on several levels. It touched me deeply. Several scenes brought tears to my eyes with the same effect on my wife who is the tough one in the family. They weren't melodramatic just done with the right dose of pathos to convey feelings and put the viewer in the characters' places. Each member of the family was successively portrayed and then relegated to the background to focus on Ann Blyth's character her adoptive parents and her birth mother. All these actors' performances were just right Dvorak's in particular.One scene stands out in my mind and I don't think I'm giving much away in retelling it after Blyth discovers she was adopted she asks the family maid Violet  played by Jessica Grayson in another memorable performance  if she knew. Violet answers Honey I was here when they brought you 18 years ago. Grayson delivered it with just the right amount of sensitivity to underscore to us and the deeply wounded Blyth that the circumstances of her birth had no effect on her status within the family. There were many more such vignettes when Blyth returns at 3am and gets yelled at by her father when Blyth and Wyatt get tangled up in the meaning of the word mother the morning after the revelation the look of fear on Wyatt's face when she allows her second daughter to look for her birth certificate. They showed us a strong caring family with patient intelligent and understanding parents capable of mistakes they were not afraid to admit and tackle. Nobody was all good or all bad just people with a full range of human strengths and frailties people like you and me.I could go on like this forever and give away the whole plot but I'll stop here and close with another memorable scene I feel rounds out this movie. It takes place before Blyth discovers she's adopted on the beach with Farley Granger. They come out of the surf draw close and Blyth reaches up on her tiptoes to kiss Granger. The camera draws away and looks down on them from high up as the waves approach them from both sides to merge where they stand. There was a raw sensuality to this scene. It was full of the passion that complements altruistic love.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1949 and adoption is a stigmaat least in some people's eyes. Anyway the Goldwyn studios continue their saga of America's middle class e.g. The Best Years of Our Lives 1946 by building a screenplay around this social theme. Of course the Macaulay family are a highly idealized version of the real middle class. For example note how unfailingly courteous and civilized family members are despite surging emotions. Sure daughter Joan's hormones get the best of her and she behaves badly but in a way that's still refined. And note Mom's unfailingly wise council and forbearance in Jane Wyatt's early version of Mother Knows Best. Despite obvious sincerity the film's Hollywood treatment guarantees a predictable ending from the very start. I just wish the screenplay had dealt with the more difficult aspect of adoptionnamely the factor of an unknown genetic inheritance among those contemplating marriage and who care about such things. And that could well apply to an upwardly mobile neighborhood such as the Macaulay's. But including a genetic factor would have resulted in a much more difficult and darker film.Still it's an entertaining movie despite the compromises. That opening sequence is a gem of youthful highspirits and frustration thanks to Natalie Wood and Gus Schilling even if he is doing schtick as one reviewer noted. The scene is not just a good one but also aims to persuade us that the Macaulay's are a real family like anyone else's. Anyway I agree with those reviewers who find Blythe and Granger a little longinthetooth to be playing teenagers though it's one of the movie's lesser compromises. Yes Ann Dvorak is good as the selfconscious birth mother. But I really like Joan Evans' turn as the jealous sister. Catch her subtle facial expressions as she goes through any one of her many emotional conflicts a fine unheralded young actress. Also standout is young Martin Milner. His totally unaffected teenager seems light years from his high school peer the maturely sophisticated Blythe.And speaking of Milner's gawky teen I can't help noticing the chuckles we get from his rather callous treatment of pudgy plainJane Gwendolyn Rita Hamilton. For a film otherwise sensitive within its limits that same concern apparently doesn't extend to an unattractive girl made the butt of mood lightening gags in a seemingly guiltfree manner. I'm not sure what the moral is but I don't think it's a good one. Anyway the movie remains an interesting if idealized time capsule of a period when apparently every teenage boy owned a hotrod.".

Just before graduation when she realises her best friend Zaza's Phyliss Kirk father will not be there for her graduation and is not even remotely interested in it does she start to count her blessings.This is an excellent tastefully made film on what was then probably a very touchy subject.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Post WWII America is Shattered by a Startling Revelation";
	schema:reviewBody "Our Very Own 1950 is one of those films appreciated today for entirely different reasons than at the time of its release. If there ever was actually a stigma to adoption it is long forgotten so the angst and overwrought melodrama associated with the film's central revelation seems way too extreme. On the other hand you would have expected people in 1950 to be shocked at the idea of a high school senior running around with a boyfriend who looks to be about 30 not to mention the sparks between this guy and the girl's 16 year old little sister. But most 21st century viewers will enjoy the film for its time capsule look at life in 1949 Middle America. Particularly entertaining is a relatively long opening sequence about the delivery and installation of the family's first television set. Younger viewers should note that most American households did not acquire one of these devices until the mid1950's so a 1950 audience would have found the sequence almost as novel and interesting as we find it today. This opening sequence includes a great routine between nine year old Penny Natalie Wood and Frank Gus Schilling the TV repairman. Precocious Natalie manages to hijack the film at this early stage and leave the viewer wishing she had more screen time. It is so entertaining and so 1950 that the rather routine events making up the remainder of the film are a considerable letdown.The Macaulay family has three sisters 18yearold Gail Ann Blyth 16yearold Joan Joan Evans and nine year old Penny Wood. The three actresses look enough alike to be actual sisters but it turns out their parents have an ugly secret Gail was adopted as an infant. Gail is writing a speech for her upcoming high school graduation and thinking about college when she is not busy keeping Joan from flirting with her steady boyfriend an aging television installer named Chuck Farley Granger. Joan is followed around by a depressed looking Martin Milner the king of the numerical television series Route 66 and Adam 12. On Gail's eighteenth birthday Joan accidentally discovers her parent's great adoption secret. During an argument with Gail she blurts out this new information and Gail goes into state of shock and anguish for the remainder of the film. It turns out that Gail's biological father was killed in an accident before she was born but her mother is alive. A meeting is arranged but it goes bad. This is the film's other great scene as the two Anns Ann Dvorack plays the biological mother play off each other quite well. Although there is a certain socioeconomic prejudice showcased it is nonetheless staged extremely well and is quite original. Dvorack must nervously pretend before her husband and their guests that Gail is the daughter of an old friend. Subsequent to this motherdaughter meeting comes another rather simplistic development as the father of Gail's best friend decides to skip his daughter's graduation ceremony. Thus does Gail come to appreciate the true meaning of family.Overall Our Very Own is full of solid performances but Blyth is clearly the star. She was not an actress with much emotional range and tended to specialize in women who were morose when they were not being serious. She handles the scenes of Gail's shock and depression quite well but doesn't really convey the happy prerevelation Gail. In fact I don't recall Blyth ever playing convincingly happy in any of her filmsnot even in a Snow White's Evil Queen sort of way.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

This must have been the movie that won Jane Wyatt her iconic role as the wife in Father Knows Best. By the time that series came aroundshe had it all down pat. My favorite character from the movie was ZaZa Blythe's shallow but affluent best friend. ZaZa actually made you feel more sorry for her than you did for the main character! And she was the rich pretty one! Did anyone else feel that Blythe was too old for this part? It's a perfectly fine melodrama with some surprises  not too many though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Behind the wellwoven plot of a budding high school graduate's family problems is an earthy though somewhat stereotypical examination of a Caucasion based middle class existence in suburban America of 1949. Ann Blyth earnestly portrays the vicissitudinous impact of a revelation about her character's childhood. The storyline backdrop comes complete with proper but sincerely well meaning parents and a beloved partofthefamily AfricanAmerican housekeeper and cook portrayed with gentility and grace by Jessica Grayson in her final film role without whose valuable understated contributions the family's daily routine would be reduced to chaos. Finally of course there's the obligatory family dog playfully shortcircuiting the household. As depicted in this typical period film people dressed more formally even in hot weather for whatever reasons! with air conditioning yet to permeate even modern well equipped homes. As a rule practical personal dress comfort didn't prevail over formality until the 1960's. The prolonged initial sequence showcases a wonderful nuisance of a girl scenestealing Natalie Wood helping with the installation of a new television the up and coming electronic marvel of the day whose commercial success was on the verge of becoming reality thanks in part to some price breaking discoveries that soon rendered TV sets sufficiently affordable for the masses. Boys and girls were portraying themselves while being quietly groomed for achieving good citizenship standards as defined by the generally conservative postwar period.In Our Very Own personal relationships expressed themselves in ways that depicted subtle yet significant differences from those of years to come revealing an overall interesting and introspective perspective of the fairly tranquil but brief period between World War II and the Korean War. The latter event broke shortly before the public release of this film in 1950. Meanwhile as the storyline reveals the cold war had already begun and for many people nuclear experimentation was beginning to command a scary center stage presence. Other hot issues of the day include McCarthy type antiCommunism or AntiAmericanism as it was in actuality! racial and ethnic equality and mixed sexual attitudes but in Our Very Own we are deliberately steered inward into family and personal matters with the broad and burgeoning concerns of the day kept at bay...almost. Issues such as those mentioned above are not directly infiltrating any aspect of daily life in the treatment offered here except for occasional inference. The period feel is thereby enhanced.As Our Very Own grapples its way toward the emerging central theme of adoption its still subtle stigmas of the times permeate the otherwise gentile facade of the featured suburbanite family. Ann Dvorak in character offers a fine portrayal as a birth mother as opposed to a rearing one. Her persona is carved from the other side of the tracks folks but a sensitive manner prevails. She exudes pathos yet maintains dignity for all concerned.Now some sixty years hence we are treated to a time capsule view of an earlier mostly bygone America complete with some focal points of its day plus those things eternal that seem to pass through generations oblivious to time and technology. The story line may be unremarkable although it maintains interest but the real and stylized adaptations of Middle American life at the time are enhanced by fine performances that lend a glimpse into aspects of our culture that were probably at least partly present at midcentury past.One acoustic footnote Our Very Own also concentrates on excellent sound and sensitive background music.

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1950 in middleclass America. Ann Blythe is the 18yearold daughter of a loving family. She pretty smart and is going to deliver the valedictorian address at her high school graduation. She has a handsome young boyfriend in the person of Farley Granger and with him sits on the porch swing and once in a while they get to sparkin' and aneckin' in the most chaste way.Then tragedy strikes. She discovers by accident that unlike her two sisters Joan Evans and Natalie Wood Ann was adopted as an infant. Her life which once seemed so sure is now a bindle full of uncertainties. She becomes sullen aloof resentful angry. She visits her real mother Ann Dvorak and finds that she was an illegitimate child. The goodnatured Dvorak lives with her goodnatured husband in a relatively shabby workingclass neighborhood where the men sit around playing cards and smoking cigars and the wives gossip on the couch. A train chugs along in the background. They don't even have a maid. That's how bad things are. Dvorak is a nervous wreck and though delighted to see her daughter for the first time in eighteen years she's kept her sin from her husband and friends and there is no room for Blythe in her life.Is Ann Blythe justified in feeling torn apart by the realization that she is not the natural daughter of her parents? Yes. Why? For the same reason that Hallie Berry and Barack Obama are black even though one of their parents was white. And for the same reason that marijuana should be illegal and fine singlemalt scotch should be legal and the same reason that being gay is unnatural and being straight is normal. It's why we measure our speed in miles per hour. It's why we have separate words for blue and green which isn't the case in many other languages.It's right because everybody says so.In my opinion the movie is a trumpedup tear jerker with a couple of good performances but it's an excellent demonstration of the operation of a force called the social construction of reality.

	onyx:emotionText "It's 1950 in middleclass America. Ann Blythe is the 18yearold daughter of a loving family. She pretty smart and is going to deliver the valedictorian address at her high school graduation. She has a handsome young boyfriend in the person of Farley Granger and with him sits on the porch swing and once in a while they get to sparkin' and aneckin' in the most chaste way.Then tragedy strikes. She discovers by accident that unlike her two sisters Joan Evans and Natalie Wood Ann was adopted as an infant. Her life which once seemed so sure is now a bindle full of uncertainties. She becomes sullen aloof resentful angry. She visits her real mother Ann Dvorak and finds that she was an illegitimate child. The goodnatured Dvorak lives with her goodnatured husband in a relatively shabby workingclass neighborhood where the men sit around playing cards and smoking cigars and the wives gossip on the couch. A train chugs along in the background. They don't even have a maid. That's how bad things are. Dvorak is a nervous wreck and though delighted to see her daughter for the first time in eighteen years she's kept her sin from her husband and friends and there is no room for Blythe in her life.Is Ann Blythe justified in feeling torn apart by the realization that she is not the natural daughter of her parents? Yes. Why? For the same reason that Hallie Berry and Barack Obama are black even though one of their parents was white. And for the same reason that marijuana should be illegal and fine singlemalt scotch should be legal and the same reason that being gay is unnatural and being straight is normal. It's why we measure our speed in miles per hour. It's why we have separate words for blue and green which isn't the case in many other languages.It's right because everybody says so.In my opinion the movie is a trumpedup tear jerker with a couple of good performances but it's an excellent demonstration of the operation of a force called the social construction of reality. You can probably Google it. I speak to you as your sociologist now. The fee is ten cents.What the loving family should have done is offhandedly let Ann Blythe know she was adopted from the moment she could understand English.

You never told anyone anything for their own good was just one of the tenets  that includes Gail's parents not telling her she was adopted and Mrs. Lynch not telling Mr. Lynch she had a baby that she surrendered for adoption. Also this was a private adoption done through an attorney which was very common in those days.Ann Dvorak has the strongest role as the biological mother and she's excellent creating a vibrant character without the class of Gail's adopted mother and with a lout for a husband. Her intentions are good  they probably always were  but she's lived her life under someone's thumb and has never been able to pull it together. Blyth does a complete turnaround from Veda in Mildred Pierce the role for which she will always be identified and plays a mature responsible young woman. Natalie Wood plays her brat sister  by the end of the first scene you want to slap her. Joan Evans and Phyllis Kirk are both very good Joan with her slutty moments and beautiful Phyllis a favorite of mine from the Thin Man television show is good as Gail's best friend. Was there ever a mother as ideal as Jane Wyatt? Like Margaret on Father Knows Best she's practical kind wise and lovely. Donald Woods doesn't have much to do but plays the loving father well. Handsome Farley Granger makes a great suitor and Martin Milner as a goof  a role he played often in his early career  is cute.My only objection is that Gail's mother is too good to be true her boyfriend is too good to be true and her best friend is too good to be true.

The best thing about this movie is that with one exception discussed below noone is deliberately trying to hurt anyone else and everyone in it wants everyone else to be happy. Everyone thinks about other people and tries to be considerate and thoughtful although their flaws and stupidities mean they make mistakes sometimes. Moreover the plot never depends on any of the characters being stupid. But the movie is a creature of its time and that creates some problems. First the character of the younger sister Joan is excellently conceived and acted  her jealous competition with the main character her older sister Gail drives the film to its crisis but then when Joan sees how upsetting it is to Gail to learn she was adopted all the jealousy disappears and is replaced by guilt love and concern. From that moment she stops competing for Gail's boyfriend. Second all the women characters are wellconceived well intentioned including Joan after she goes through what I just discussed and believable. Third the meeting of Gail's adoptive mother and her natural mother is very well done  I found myself thinking why are these two women so dressed and madeup and then I realized that that is exactly what they would do. And the tawdriness of the natural mother's attire and jewelry was really touching. Fourth the male characters are wellintentioned but annoying in their insensitivity  which makes them more realistic I suppose but stupid. The sequence at the beginning of installing the TV  they literally assemble the parts of the TV onsite which I found amazing  works well but the actor doing the assembly was doing a shtick  it probably worked in 1949 but it was very dated unreal and not in keeping with the rest of the picture. As to technical plotting the motivation and circumstances for Joan to discover that Gail was adopted works well and is very plausible but the way in which the movie engineers Gail's meeting with her mother during a raucous evening of cards and beer should have been re thought. The goal is for them to meet while the mother's husband is away  and that is easily done when Gail's adoptive mother comes calling at the natural mother's house during the day while the husband is at work. So why can't Gail also meet her natural mother during the day  the next day? A reason needed to be given why that wouldn't work. Second even if the meeting of Gail and the natural mother has to be at night and is to be the husband's bowling night his sudden change of plans and staying at home would not plausibly result in 30 people arriving at the house turning it into practically a crowded bar. At most he would have had his bowling buddies maybe 5 or 6 guys. But the drama of Gail encountering her natural mother under really raucous circumstances was a good idea so instead of keeping the abortivebowlingnight scenario it needed a more plausible setup such as Gail choosing to surreptitiously spy on her natural mother and happening to come on a night when the natural mother and her husband were hosting this noisy gang of friends. Imagine Gail stunned walking into the party and she and her natural mother lock eyes while the mother is carrying a tray of beers  like a waitress in her own home  and the mother realizes unexpectedly this is her daughter come unannounced  much more dramatic I think. Then back at Gail's house the youngest daughter spills the secret of Gail's secret visit that's how Gail's family has reason to worry  this would have worked better I think.".

I hated that Gail's parents couldn't bring themselves to tell her she was adopted how Gail's adopted mother told the birthmother that her other two children were their own Gail's look of icky disgust when her birthmother was lowermiddleclass Gail looked at the woman as if she had leprosy the fact that the birthmother was portrayed as common and the snippiness of both the adoptive mother and the 16yearold sister. Of course the father was a complete idiot. Had I been the housekeeper I'd have poisoned the whole bunch of them except well cute little Natalie Wood.Okay so I'm a tad sensitive so sue me. I know that few adoptees are as fortunate as I am to have found my birthparents and that they are wonderful people and my halfsiblings well most of them are sweet and accepting. I have an adoptive mother I adore and who never kept my adoption secret she is nearly 90 now and I worship the ground she floats above.Anyway movie plots back then were a bit different gross understatement. For those not adopted I guess it's a cutesypie little trip but I hate this movie and this is the LAST time I will ever watch it!".

I hated that Gail's parents couldn't bring themselves to tell her she was adopted how Gail's adopted mother told the birthmother that her other two children were their own Gail's look of icky disgust when her birthmother was lowermiddleclass Gail looked at the woman as if she had leprosy the fact that the birthmother was portrayed as common and the snippiness of both the adoptive mother and the 16yearold sister. Of course the father was a complete idiot. Had I been the housekeeper I'd have poisoned the whole bunch of them except well cute little Natalie Wood.Okay so I'm a tad sensitive so sue me. I know that few adoptees are as fortunate as I am to have found my birthparents and that they are wonderful people and my halfsiblings well most of them are sweet and accepting. I have an adoptive mother I adore and who never kept my adoption secret she is nearly 90 now and I worship the ground she floats above.Anyway movie plots back then were a bit different gross understatement. For those not adopted I guess it's a cutesypie little trip but I hate this movie and this is the LAST time I will ever watch it!";

	schema:headline " Fascinating background  turgid drama";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an unusual movie to watch in 2004. The central plot  a girl's disorienting discovery that she is adopted  that causes her eventual appreciation of her own nice adopted family  is probably now the theme of many television movies meant for children. The stigma of adoption dramatized in a rather over the top way with the sister of Greer Garson's character in the movie Blossoms in the Dust is truly gone  and thus so is much of the viewer's empathy with the protagonist's shock and agony.The movie also takes a terribly long time to get going  it's like watching a Father Knows Best with the same naturally elegant Jane Wyatt as the mother  she has one of the most beautiful upper crusty voices and pronunciations of any actress  except that the viewer keeps asking What's the story here? for the first fortyfive minutes. So it's terribly boring for a long time.However it's the strange background of the characters that is fascinating  because the strangeness is completely assumed to be in tune with the audience. For these reasons I'd recommend seeing this movie. SPOILERS A How often is it that a 17 year old bride Jane Wyatt and her much older husband adopt a child within a year  even IF told that it's unlikely that she can have children? She was THAT eager? She didn't even want to say try for a child of her own for a few years until she was the ripe old age of 20?B How often is it that the ageold line by one parent to another she's growing up dear you can't keep her a child forever refers to the fact that the daughter will soon be 18 and it's therefore time for her to marry and begin her family? This isn't meant to be a poor family in Appalachia.There is a biological imperative felt by these middle class teenage girls that one never sees in movies of the last 40 years  yet one is expected to see one's own family in this one to see it as the quintessential American family thus we are to see as normal that e.g. the father was about 30 when he married the 17 year old mothere.g. the 15 year old younger sister is driven CRAZY in lust whenever the handsome boyfriend of her older sister appears e.g. the middle class mother says of her daughter Well she'll be eighteen soon the time a girl wants to start her family. There's something very touching about a movie that assumes that the viewers agree that teenagers must make their lifelong choices and swiftly fulfill their natural yearning to begin their families. There's such an assumption of natural confidence in the future.If the studio was correct about its audience's sympathy with these assumptions which really aren't there in movies of the 1920s 1930s 1940s one suspects it was in part due to postwar prosperity the men were now present AND employed  in such sharp contrast to the Depression and their absence in a War  and could thus support families a reaction to the hundreds of thousands of Americans killed in war the desire to begin again after such losses and even women's lustful reaction to the presence of men after their absence in four years of war. The movie also makes clear the limited expectation of the middle class at this time about going to college. High school graduation the speeches by the students the family's attendance  have an enormous importance in this movie.The entire movie assumes a maturity on the part of 17 year olds  that they are now old enough to make lifelong decisions  that appears breathtakingly optimistic in this age in which a Seinfeld Show featured only 40 year old characters and Friends had its 30 something characters  all single none owning a home in their personal lives merely hoping to find dates on Saturday nights and in their work lives hopping from job to job at age say 46. In contrast to the wonderful optimistic willingness to commit oneself for life at 17 or 18 in Our Very Own it's as if our time had returned to the 1930s when to make a broad generalization many had such fear of the future felt such an economic uncertainty  that committing to lifelong plans was an impossibility a thing for fools. C How often is it that the middle class protagonist's shock and revulsion at seeing a working class family the family actually has friends over to play cards drink beer smoke cigarettes and they live near the tracks! is NOT expected to cost her any sympathy with the audience?We too are expected to feel her existential agony that she can somehow be connected to THOSE people! Though her biological mother is nice apologetic about the unexpected company welcoming eager to see her biological daughter again  this visit to a real life set of The Life of Riley or All in the Family is just dizzying to our heroine  she has to go out to get drunk at her wealthy friend's house  and somehow wash away the very image of the working class family. The drama relies on our utter shock that this nice girl would be connected to well lowlifes who would say such things as Gert get us some more beer will ya?! Thus the movie doesn't seem to consider  nor are we supposed to consider  the possibility that our nice girl would ask her biological mother  who has no other children  to attend her high school graduation  why the idea! That woman drinks beer when company visit!.Rarely has middle class selfsatisfaction been so fascinatingly evident  in that sense this movie's values are like those in some 19th century French novel portraying the smugness rebelled against by the protagonist.The movie also assumes a powerful link among economic means manners and moral character. The protagonist's family lives in a nice HOUSE  drinks its beer in glasses although it's amusing to see they also play cards  father and daughter's boyfriend while waiting for her to return  cards were BIG why they've just installed a television  and are thus a world away from those who would give up their children in adoption nor would any woman in THIS family ever say apologetically of the sexual liaison that produced an illegitimate child well you know it was just it was just one of those things  Good Heavens!. In fact the middle class selfsatisfaction includes its superiority to the wealthy family  whose widower father's shocking indifference to his daughter  he travels a lot  is shown by his failure to have participated in choosing her high school graduation dress and inability to attend her graduation. Luckily the wealthy teenage daughter  tragically an only child  realizes her deprivation and will return to the normal world with her plans to get married soon and have loads and loads of babies.One also wonders whether feminism was fueled by all the Jane Wyatt characters finding themselves with all their children long since grown at a mere 45 years old in the late 1960s  and suddenly without purpose. Thinking of Jane Wyatt  one wonders why she was always miscast as the embodiment of middle middle class wifemother  when her posh voice and manner seem clearly to the manor born  and why she's saddled with such a dull older husband in this movie.Finally our girl's speech about citizenship  a speech that is to warm our hearts by expressing appreciation for families like HERS our sisters may sometimes annoy us but we love them so... comes close to saying that families such as her biological mother's are well somehow not really citizens  after all her entire appreciation of our families comes from having glimpsed into the abyss of a real life Roseanne Barr sitcom family  and expressed our collective shudder. Now like the Philistine in the Old Testament she is apparently making a speech about citizenship at this high school graduation to express our collective appreciation to God that He has made us better than the others. Thus this movie certainly does NOT agree with St. Paul's admonition It is far better that you not marry but if you apparently the weak would otherwise sin then by all means marry and have your fleshly desireappeasing concessiontohumanfrailty family. In this movie a nice family  and the sooner the better  IS godliness. SPOPILERS END'sSo see this for the extraordinary assumptions about the proper life  not for the children's after school special plot.".
