Instead I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my seat. I've loved the movie ever since.Everyone knows the premiseMichael Caine and Joseph Bologna take their teenage daughters Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore to Rio for a vacation. Caine's marriage is in trouble and his wife is vacationing somewhere else. They're barely settled into the home they're renting when Johnson aggressively pursues Caine and he quickly succumbs like any man would!. Caine is guiltridden but cannot resist Michelle's considerable charms. Her father finds out about the affair and goes nuts trying to find out who her lover is.  He enlists Caine in his search and many hilarious scenes ensue.The setting for this movie is just gorgeous and the women are even more beautiful.  This was Michelle Johnson's first movie and it shows but she does project a sweet sincerity and her vavavoom body more than makes up for any performance shortcomings.  Zowie!  Catch the scene where the fathers find their daughters topless at the beachthis was well before Demi Moore had some enhancements later in her life and it is painfully obvious that she's extremely embarrassed by doing the topless scene.  Michelle is a trouper though lucky for us!The ultimate reason to see this movie though is Michael Caine.  He is extremely funny in this movie and I can only imagine how much fun he had making ita guy in his 40s getting to spend a few weeks in one of the most beautiful and exciting cities in the world and having all these love scenes with a girl half his age and getting paid to do it!!! Caine has made a lot of schlocky movies for sure but in an interview once he said that no matter how dumb the movie was or how cheaply it was done he would try to give the best performance he could so even if the rest of the movie was crap the viewer could at least appreciate that Caine did a good job. That dedication to his craft is what lifts what should've been a C movie like Rio into a B B movie instead and when he's in really good material makes it unforgettable.".

The most important and amazing consideration is it was intended as mainstream release. Its not a Troma shclock job. Its a very well made extremely well written film about a very naughty topic. Consider it a blooper an accident if you will but its great. Quick synopsis a middle aged dude messes around and falls in love with his best friends 18 year old daughter. And its not exactly tastefully told. There's a ton of gratuitous nudity which is what really dooms it and makes it just the sort of oddity and pariah people so love to hate. I'm old now but when i fell in love with it I was like 19 so wipe the perverted sanctimonious smirk off of your face! I like good comedy and well made on location vacation pics that inspire me to travel. So it's the PetersGelbart script and the wonderful scenery that have won it a place in my cold heart. Ok ok topless 18 year old girls are a decided bonus.".

	schema:reviewBody "A comedy where a middleaged man has sex with his best friend's teenage daughter would seem morally wrong on so many levels as to violate municipal zoning ordinances. So why my lack of shame in copping to really enjoying this movie? Watching Blame It On Rio back in 1984 when I was 18 the following items appealed to me. 1. Michelle Johnson naked. 2. Michelle Johnson in white pants. 3. Michael Caine's monologues. 4. Caine's chemistry with Joseph Bologna. 5. Michelle in her twotoned bikini.Watching it now doesn't change what I like so much as in what order. Michelle Johnson is an extraordinarily beautiful woman and an engaging presence when she doesn't have a crying scene and I think I have grown to appreciate her in other stages of dress but the person that makes this film work for me now is Caine whose level of commitment to this film is a thing of wonder.Blame It On Rio is a sex farce which skates around real human feelings with moments of slapstick and sitcom repartee. There are about 150 ways the film can go wrong but Caine sells it by keeping it light and silly.Caine's character Matthew Hollis is a sympathetic awkward type whose life gets upended when his wife Karen Valerie Harper decides she isn't going with him on vacation to Rio de Janiero. So it's just him his friend Victor Bologna Victor's daughter Jennifer Johnson and Matthew's daughter Nicole Demi Moore. Victor rides Matthew about making the most of his new opportunity Is tasting life creating a little magic is that cheating? You're a long time dead.Jennifer has her own ideas on what Matthew should be doing which she unleashes on him at an evening wedding festival at a beach Poor Uncle Matthew he never had a chance. Her nude scenes still pack a punch but its the stuff inbetween the nude scenes that excite me more now. Caine with anything in his hands whether it be grating a carrot or brushing his teeth is joyfully amusing and his oneliners as revealed Alfiestyle to the camera are just a lot of fun He needed my help...it's like asking an arsonist become the fire chief. Bologna also makes me laugh but something else too. In his own askew overemoting way he's the heart that makes the film work. When he discovers his daughter has been seeing another man he immediately settles on Matthew  for help finding the culprit. This accounts for the funniest scenes in the film but it also gives us something to care about. You laugh at Victor's blindness but you also feel a little between the giggles when he tells Matthew You're a rock.The main problem I have with Blame It On Rio is it is not all that sharp in the oneliner department. Coscreenwriter Larry Gelbart was the guy behind Tootsie and the best years of the sitcom MASH but he and Charlie Peters don't produce an especially witty script. There are funny lines but more duds than you'd expect. I've always had a problem with nudity. Sometimes when I'm getting undressed I almost wish I could leave the room know what I mean? Matthew asks us at one point. Fortunately the writing gets much better in the second half especially in the last twenty minutes when Matthew discovers he's not the only guy keeping a secret.Celebrated director Stanley Donen makes the most of the natural beauty and native music of his location while keeping everything as light and fizzy as a tropical drink. Blame It On Rio may be morally dubious but it's solid Hollywood fun of the kind Donen delivered for decades and as good a film as any for him to go out on. And thanks to Caine Blame It On Rio still holds up.".

The film has many funny twists and turns to keep you laughing and guessing until the end. Nudity is all over this movie especially Michelle Johnson and a little bit of Demi Moore. Michael Joseph and Valerie are pros at this comedy and the two amateurs do a pretty good stab at making you laugh your head off. Blame it on Rio starts off a little slow but soon it is moving at fast speed and you better hang on to your seatcushions. A serious topic is discussed in both a serious and funny manner allowing you to see different sides of a story. This movie is like a favorite candy or soda that you cannot get enough of and that you want to have more of immediately. So kick back and relax and enjoy all the wild antics abound for you in this crazy comedy and at the end Blame it on Rio.".

The film has many funny twists and turns to keep you laughing and guessing until the end. Nudity is all over this movie especially Michelle Johnson and a little bit of Demi Moore. Michael Joseph and Valerie are pros at this comedy and the two amateurs do a pretty good stab at making you laugh your head off. Blame it on Rio starts off a little slow but soon it is moving at fast speed and you better hang on to your seatcushions. A serious topic is discussed in both a serious and funny manner allowing you to see different sides of a story. This movie is like a favorite candy or soda that you cannot get enough of and that you want to have more of immediately. So kick back and relax and enjoy all the wild antics abound for you in this crazy comedy and at the end Blame it on Rio.";

While they are there the precocious Johnson pursues and ultimately seduces Caine and shenanigans ensue the main one of which is Caine having to help Bologna pursue the unnamed older man  ie. himself  who is having an inappropriate relationship with Bologna's daughter.This is bright breezy comical stuff with lots of nice scenery. Caine's performance with lots of directtocamera speeches is pleasingly desperate and Johnson's body is pleasingly and frequently naked and it must be said startlingly ripe.I'm not 100 convinced about the subject matter though.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was one major reason to watch this movie Michelle Johnson and that's about it. The film doesn't offer too much else. Basically it's a silly story.Michael Caine Matthew and Joseph Bologna Victor plays some middle aged guys who are going through marriage problems bad marriage and a divorce respectively so they go down to Brazil to spend money since they're rich. They bring their late teenyoungadult daughters? Huh? Well Victor's daughter is a knockout and they have a fling. Johnson plays the girl Jennifer who shows off her breasts as much as she can in this film. This is why I and a lot of other guys saw this movie. In reality there isn't much merit to this story regardless. This must have been a wonderful role for Caine to play! Caine an outstanding and likable actor keeps this film  along with Johnson's obvious assets  from being a total bomb. As Matthew his mind knows this a bad relationship and vows to end it but you know what else doing the talking for him so it ain't easy. Demi Moore by the way plays Caine's daughter in this movie.It's really not a horrible film but it's pretty inane and crude in areas. The real shocker might not be all the nudity or sex jokes and lying but who directed the film good 'ole Stanley Donen who also gave us Singin' In The Rain and Charade. How in the world did he get involved with this movie? Maybe Johnson was too much of an allure for him too!".

	schema:reviewBody "You read a plot synopsis for Blame It on Rio and immediately you think that this just has to be a terrible movie. And besides being terrible it's also going to be downright uncomfortable to watch as the story centers around some wildly inappropriate behavior. They'd never make a movie like this today you think and thank goodness for that. Yes those would probably be your thoughts before you watch this movie. But then you watch it and it's actually not that bad. Yes there is that uneasy feeling throughout due to the fact that the subject matter is more than a little icky. But the movie is entertaining. It's lighthearted fun. In fact you could even call it charming if not for the fact that there's nothing particularly charming about a middleaged man having sex with his best friend's teenage daughter.So our story is about this exceedingly inappropriate relationship. And the movie plays it for laughs. And it works? Ah the 1980s. A very different world from today that's for sure. Blame It on Rio is never uproariously funny but there are enough good comic moments sprinkled throughout to keep things moving along nicely. In playing Matthew the man who can't resist the charms of the teenage temptress it is Michael Caine who really holds the movie together. An awkward character to play no doubt and Caine makes it work. From the moment we meet him even before his wild fling Matthew never seems entirely comfortable in his own skin. Preying on that awkwardness is his own personal Lolita. She goes by the name of Jennifer and is played by Michelle Johnson for whom comfort in her own skin was apparently not an issue. Yowzers! Easy to see how it would be difficult for any man to resist her feminine charms. But Matthew you're fortysomething she's a teenager and she's your best friend's daughter! This can't happen! But it does and...hilarity ensues? Yeah you wouldn't think this is a particularly comedic situation but that's the direction in which this movie goes and somehow it kind of works.It's hard to fully embrace the movie as none of the main characters come off particularly well. The MatthewJennifer relationship is not the only inappropriate thing going on here not by a long shot. You'd think Jennifer's father what with his best friend sleeping with his nubile daughter would be the sympathetic character. But as portrayed by Joseph Bologna he's a sleaze too. Who in this movie isn't? Well there's Matthew's daughter Nicole. Demi Moore plays the role and it's a smaller part compared to Caine Johnson and Bologna. But if you sympathize with anyone it's her. She has an innocence about her. All the adults in this movie have lost their innocence long ago. And her friend Jennifer can't wait to lose hers...with Nicole's father no less. Poor Nicole. She even has to suffer in comparison standing next to the voluptuous Jennifer on one of Rio's famous topless beaches. At this point in her life Demi Moore had not yet embraced the wonders of surgical enhancement and that leaves Nicole bashful trying to cover up her modest assets with her long hair. Jennifer? She's not bashful. But somehow she's still sweet and charming. And there's still a vulnerability and touch of innocence to her even as she's taking off her clothes and seducing a middleaged man. It's hard to figure. The story shouldn't work the movie shouldn't work we really shouldn't be finding any of this funny. But somehow the end result isn't that bad at all. Go into this movie with low expectations and you may well be pleasantly surprised.".

But it is written as pure comedy and played for laughs. That takes some of the sting out of it. And........the scenery and I mean all the scenery is fabulous. Caine and Bologna an acquired taste stumble and stammer thru some funny dialog and no one was injured during the filming of this movie. Well possibly the insanely gorgeous Michelle Johnson's career. She was in her 1st film and asked to display her assets early and often. And she looks GREAT!! As pretty an 18 year old as you will ever see on film. But she had no acting skills and came off as such an amateur that I would Blame I On the director. It may have been hard to do retakes to get it right or he would have killed Michael Caine in the process.If you don't mind tasteful nudity of a tasteless situation a typically grating cameo by Valerie Harper and the most colorful and lush view of Rio ever take a watch. On edited TV its a 3 on cable it's a 6 or 7!!".

The vibrant cinematography by Reynaldo Villalobos provides plenty of striking shots of the sumptuous seaside scenery.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Caine simply never gets asked about his involvement in this film and that is a shame. In his career he has had limited success in comedies but this is the exception. Caine and Bologna make a terrific double act and I laughed myself stupid from start to finish.Admittedly the concept is rather weak but it is carried off brilliantly. Bologna steals the film for me with his protective father routine and is a joy to watch. The inclusion of just a few other cast members is very clever with each one delivering killer lines as the plot unfolds. The best scene in the film is when Caine employs a woman to use her skills in the occult to make his desires go away. One of the very best comedies I have seen . One tip if you like the film buy it on DVD as it is very rarely shown on television.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why blame it on Rio? Blame it on the scriptwriters who should have realised that a storyline about a teenage girl who goes on holiday to Rio de Janeiro and ends up having an affair with her father's best friend a married man more then twice her age would need to be handled sensitively if it were not to end up as little more than barely legal kiddie porn. Sensitivity however is a commodity in short supply in this silly sex comedy which is just as trashy and exploitative as it sounds. Although it is ostensibly a comedy wit and humour are nowhere in evidence either.Blame it on Stanley Donen. Donen was perhaps a director who hit his peak too soon directing his greatest film Singin' in the Rain while still in his twenties. Although he made some other good musicals and comedies in the fifties and early sixties he was left looking like a figure from the past by the decline of the Hollywood musical and the cinematic revolution of the late sixties and seventies. There were other directors around this time who were also left looking like dinosaurs but most of them were a generation older than Donen who was only in his early forties when that revolution began. Although he is still alive more than a quarter of a century later Blame It on Rio was to be his last film as both director and producer and I doubt if it is the one he wants to be remembered by. His penultimate offering Saturn Three was pretty awful too.Blame it on Michael Caine. He has always had the ability infuriating to those like me who admire for his best work to move effortlessly from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again. Every film star however eminent or talented has at the back of their wardrobe what I think of as a silver chalice after Paul Newman's disastrous screen debut which he later publicly disowned. Sir Michael has a whole shelf full of silver chalices on public display. Which explains why he is the star not only of fine movies like Alfie Get Carter and Hannah and her Sisters but also of The Swarm and Blame It on Rio. Here he plays Matthew the middleaged businessman who ends up being seduced by the amorous and hormonally overactive Jennifer. The only explanation for this bizarre choice of role is that after all the hard work he had put in on Educating Rita and The Honorary Consul two more of his best films he felt that he was in need of some rest and relaxation and could think of nothing more restful and relaxing than spending time with a beautiful nearnaked teenage starlet in the tropical sunshine. Donen borrows the device used by Lewis Gilbert in Alfie of having Caine speak direct to camera but that is about all the two films have in common. In terms of quality they are miles apart.Blame it on Joseph Bologna who plays Jennifer's father Victor. Certainly any character who takes as obsessive an interest in his daughter's love life as Victor does in Jennifer's is bound to seem somewhat creepy but Bologna makes Victor creepier than he need be. His fury on discovering that Jennifer has an older lover seems less like parental overprotectiveness than like jealousy.Blame it on the lovely Michelle Johnson as Jennifer. Blessed with the angelic looks of a Brooke Shields albeit with a more voluptuous figure than Brooke's slim boyish one Michelle was before the film came out hotly tipped for stardom. After it came out she wasn't. Although she was happy to display her charms to the world modesty obviously compelled her to keep her acting talents well hidden. The film also introduced another lovely young actress Demi Moore who plays Nikki Matthew's daughter and Jennifer's best friend. Demi however survived the wreck of this film much better than Michelle probably because hers was only a minor role and did indeed go on to become a major star.Blame it on the director the producer the scriptwriters the actors. Blame it on whoever wrote that irritating theme song. Blame it on anyone who had anything to do with this lousy movie. But don't blame it on Rio. Why should the blameless citizens of that fair city be held responsible for the crimes against art and good taste which are committed in their name? 310".

It even trumps I Had The Time Of My Life and She's Like The Wind from Dirty Dancing which is no small accomplishment. And not only that but the song is repeated several times throughout the movie. And oh what else is there? Michael Caine's horrible hair enormous glasses and that whacky blue underwear he wears. And Joseph Bologna's insane overacting! Demi Moore's insane attempts at acting! And Michelle Johnson's ample nudity ample bosom and insane attempts at being seductive! One could charitably call this film an awkward misfire but if you're up for it it's a fine helping of cheese and a good reminder that as bad as movies can be now the 80's were the true decade of crap!

Michael Caine2. the people the sights the culture and the music of Brazil The movie is almost completely carried by Caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semibelievable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fall short. Michael Caine is pure class as always. Besides being a gifted classical and comic actor Caine brings a blend of introspection mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in Alfie...and the reason why he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her Sisters 2 years later. In this farce he is tenderly beguiling...funny and vulnerable... melancholy and sentimental....and besides the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro the ONLY reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment.Well...maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But look is all you can do at Michelle though her look seems sorely dated....there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her try to act most of her dialogue seems overdubbed too. Demi's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her as is into any movie today she doesn't really look much different to be honest. Ms. Moore is surely underused especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. Save the fact that it is a silly farce at the end I actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation...that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair even with the underage daughter of your best friend could be forgiven and everyone can move on. The injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired but all works out for the best....a bit unrealistic for sure but surprisingly refreshing. Hope always is.".

While she uses her body to full advantage it's the only thing she's got. Michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.Friday January 7 1994  Video".

Any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either and perhaps director Donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation.Not a bad film but what really ruins it is Michelle Johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. While she uses her body to full advantage it's the only thing she's got. Michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.Friday January 7 1994  Video";

This goes beyond a middleaged male fantasy into something so delusional you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapy.There's not really anything funny here. There are some quick attempts at wit from Caine who often seems to playing Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard. Michelle Johnson is no actress  she has one crying scene that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play  but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off.

Yet the worst problem she had was that Ann did not accept her as a mother. After Ann got a Master Degree in UK she went back to Hong Kong. Kwei Dz had been feeling very homesick for her mother country and decided to take Ann and return to Japan.

It's a moving autobiography by one of the best Hong Kong film directors Ann Hui. This sentimental and nostalgic journey gives the audience a glance at prejudice hatred and wars between nations regrets desperation and hope between peoples. The film describes the misunderstandings relationships and love within a family. Despite the conflicts between politics and countries when it comes down to a human level can we put everything aside to embrace kindness to love one another? This film is beautifully shot and tells a universally recognised story of family relationship that will touch every viewer's heart.The story is set in the 1970s. Returning to Hong Kong with a Masters Degree from London a young Westerneducated Chinese woman Hueyin Ann Hui played by Maggie Cheung is involved in conflict and torn between her modern beliefs and traditional values. Through the mist of confusion she finally finds the key to a better understanding to achieve the long withheld approval of her nagging mother. A short trip to Japan her mother's homeland turns out to be a turning point in their relationship.During a visit to her beloved grandparents in Canton at the height of the Cultural Revolution she is saddened by the hardship her grandparents have been through. Yet even at the lowest point of their disappointment at an uncertain future her grandfather still has not given up on China hoping the best for his granddaughter and for the country a bright future. But in her heart she knows they are old. Will they live long enough to see this bright future?".

	schema:headline " Hollywood Reporter delivered an unfair bashing of this exciting sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Having watched the first Largo Winch movie just a few days earlier I was excited to view the sequel and it definitely delivered on many levels. The acting by Tomer Sisley as the unwilling billionaire heir Largo Winch is by far stronger than in the original movie and the other main characters such as the Burman villager Malunai and Alexandre Jung played by the now late Laurent Terzieff contributed to the storyline in an endearing and believable way.The Burma Conspiracy contains most of the elements of a great action movie. Strong acting colourful characters and as an extra bonus we're also introduced to a comical Eastern European villain.

The acting by Tomer Sisley as the unwilling billionaire heir Largo Winch is by far stronger than in the original movie and the other main characters such as the Burman villager Malunai and Alexandre Jung played by the now late Laurent Terzieff contributed to the storyline in an endearing and believable way.The Burma Conspiracy contains most of the elements of a great action movie. Strong acting colourful characters and as an extra bonus we're also introduced to a comical Eastern European villain.

I'm not sure if they had American backing or if the directorproducer or whoever was a fan of hers but she almost put me off the movie. And I quite like her in other movies but this one ...With that being said we get more of Largo and his backstory. While I'm not familiar with the source material haven't read anything only watched the first movie it seems like there is a rich story behind the character. I'm not sure if there will be another installment into the series could go even further back I guess but I do know that Largo made an impression on me overall.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved the 2008 first motion picture 'Largo Winch'. I will no doubt have a pro bias in my review unless the movie strays too far from the original over all genre and quality. Jrme Salle's direction and his collaboration with Julien Rappeneau for the script produced another action packed thriller. Sharon Stone figures in the top credit but it was probably to attract more of an American audience than the first movie did her role does not require much on screen time as the billing would have you expect. What part she had she performed as the professional she is. She has sex appeal for a 53ish like only a handful of Hollywood hotties past their prime they age better than us regular folks. Tomer Sisley shines once more and with no less acumen the French production syndicate has to be proud of their on screen hero Largo Winch. I hope we can be treated to a third part or over time even a series this second tome ends with so much promise. Again the quality and quantity of action output for the relatively low budget bodes well for more Largo Winch. I hope you read my review of the original 2008 release. The fight scenes are choreographed with max effect and remind me of the Banlieu 13 movies 2004  2009 they generate audience Ooohs and Ahhhs like nothing else. In fact Hollywood has been hiring Cyril Raffaelli to capture a little of that magic in films like Live Free or Die Hard   Kiss of the Dragon and The Incredible Hulk and countless more where if you pay attention you will notice a departure from the traditional ass kicking we now feel blas with. Look up Cyril's choreography credits and you will be impressed.Well everyone raved about the third Bourne movie with Matt Damon it's that type of action fighting I'm talking about here. Less special effects and more special training like circus people refined training. Having seen special features about the training the actorsstunt people go through over two three and four months even to perform a 4 second shot is what I call dedication and the results will attract new fan following like moi. My own reaction watching a particular scene performed by David Belle one I just referred as the 4 second shot in Banlieu 13  a champion also in the movement for more of this French in origin action sequences was a reaction with much surprise cursing. I mean numerous Holy Sht and Fck me and Damn he's good. Largo Winch has that feel and I liked it as much as the first.".

And it was a treat to have Thai heavyweight actor Nirut Sirichanya in the movie too as he always bring a level of authority to his movies.The Burma Conspiracy is a movie that grabs you by the throat and take you on an adrenalinefilled rollercoaster ride. I was more than genuinely entertained by the intricate storyline the action and the acting performances. The Burma Conspiracy is wellworth sitting down to watch and the almost two hours seem to just fly by.The only thing missing from The Burma Conspiracy to give it a higher rating is the lack of contents to support more than a single viewing.

Charming little movie that appeals to the kid in all of us.The predicament of the cows really did make me laugh out loud.The acting by one and all was excellent especially Richard E. Grant as the head of the vampire family. He brought a nonthreatening yet nerve wracking well for kids anyway presence to the movie. His charming powers over Mrs. Thompson were hysterical and the entire cast did very well with this movie.One for the kids that mom and dad will enjoy sitting through which is a rarity anymore except for the likes of Shrek.Oh and I can't omit Rollo Weeks as The Little Vampire himself. He was so charming so perfectly nailed the role of Rudolph. As well as the role for arguably the cutest kid in movies Jonathan Lipnicki as Tony Thompson. The crush Anna had on him was acted out adorably by Anna Popplewell as well. There was just great acting all around in The Little Vampire.A job well done by all involved. This will make my list of movies to purchase just to share with my grandkids that someday I'll have to spoil. Campy scary enough for the little ones and entertaining for their parents.

	onyx:emotionText "A very winning cast great location superb kids' story to work with good production make for some campy scariness for kids with entertainment for mom and dad as well. Charming little movie that appeals to the kid in all of us.The predicament of the cows really did make me laugh out loud.The acting by one and all was excellent especially Richard E. Grant as the head of the vampire family. He brought a nonthreatening yet nerve wracking well for kids anyway presence to the movie. His charming powers over Mrs. Thompson were hysterical and the entire cast did very well with this movie.One for the kids that mom and dad will enjoy sitting through which is a rarity anymore except for the likes of Shrek.Oh and I can't omit Rollo Weeks as The Little Vampire himself. He was so charming so perfectly nailed the role of Rudolph. As well as the role for arguably the cutest kid in movies Jonathan Lipnicki as Tony Thompson. The crush Anna had on him was acted out adorably by Anna Popplewell as well. There was just great acting all around in The Little Vampire.A job well done by all involved. This will make my list of movies to purchase just to share with my grandkids that someday I'll have to spoil. Campy scary enough for the little ones and entertaining for their parents.

At the end I found myself feeling good about it which is refreshing today. Even better it gave me an evening's entertainment without profanity sex or senseless violence. Lipnicky is as always cute and charming. I'd like to see more of Weeks on screen but don't know if that's feasible as he's a British kid actor.Don't expect a deep message  it's not there. For a delightful evening's entertainment with the ENTIRE family! it's highly recommended. Just sit back and enjoy!".

It is rated PG for some mild peril to which I would add that very young children would need to have some of the life and death issues explained.  Both my sons ages 11 and 6 just loved the movie  enough that my six year old wanted to see it again and I didn't mind taking him.  The lessons my kids learned were mostly about friends coming in a variety of shapes and sizes and the value of loyalty and dedication to a cause. There are enough plot twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat at least the first viewing! and although some of the dialogue is banal and predictable some of it is deliciously witty.  Last but not least the costuming and special effects are wonderfully well done and go a long way to making even some of the silly scenes very impressive.  All in all I would recommend it highly to anyone who doesn't have trouble with the notion that vampires are not minions of Satan as good clean amusing fun.".

Some of the best fantasy films come from the 80s and featured bad acting horrible continuity and rather icky special effects and cinamatography as a whole.The Little Vampire which stars mostly Jonathan Lipnicki but also his little fanged friend Rollo Weeks looks 1020 years old but it actually a new release by New Line Cinema. And while for many this sounds like the ultimate rip of the dark children's fantasy based on some pretty famous books at least in Europe in actuality I think it's this that gives the film class.I cringe every time Jonathan's character says dude and cringe harder when Rollo lays out the vampric lore dribble on why they don't bite humans. They dine on cows. But it becomes harder and harder to dislike someone so charming as either boy as the chase for the medallion continues.The medallion is most of the time gaurded by Rookery who may be one of the most complete characters in the film. From the moment one sees his vampire hunting contraption looking like something from either Mad Max or Tremors those who are not children in the audience know this isn't going to be your typical kid's flick. The dark creepyness continues throughout it's length and someone in Oscar town might want to think on giving some nods for costume and art direction. Nothing beats the expressions on Rollo Weeks' face when he takes Lipnicki for their flights.Alas the film lags and is generally one big chase. The vampires want the amulet the vampire hunter wants the vampires and Jonathan's parents just want thier son to be normal. A tricky thing a dark movie appropriate for children is. If they had added more action it wouldn't have worked. And in my opinion even with the scares present it probably only worked half way.But the attempt looks sooo good.The Little Vampire B".

	schema:headline " A movie young kids will fall in love with....a funny tale portraying that vampires are your friends";
	schema:reviewBody "The Little Vampire is a cute family movie that kids will want to watch again and again. The story is about 8yr old Tony who has moved into a new house new neighborhood and a new country all together. He has nightmares every night about vampires and a magic amulet that the vampires loose. Tony believes his dreams are true and has trouble making friends because of his obsession. One night while his parents are at a business party a little 9yr old vampire named Rudolph spots Tony with fake fangs in his mouth. He flys in hoping that Tony will protect him from a vampire hunter only to find out that Tony isn't a vampire at all! Tony then finds out that his dreams are real and decides to help his friend look for the amulet...Although this movie is too cute for teens and boring for adults The Little Vampire will put a smile on kids from the age 511. Stewart Little kid Jonathan Lipnicki adds the perfect touch to any kids movie while Rollo Weeks The Thief Lord gets his start before making many more movies within the years that have past. I was flicking through the channels when i saw it on abc family's 13 nights of Halloween. It was very cute and clever even though it took me a few minutes to clue in since i only started watching it when Rudolph is in the fireplace after being a bat. The Little Vampire is a great movie the whole family can enjoy!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Little Vampire is a cute family movie that kids will want to watch again and again. The story is about 8yr old Tony who has moved into a new house new neighborhood and a new country all together. He has nightmares every night about vampires and a magic amulet that the vampires loose. Tony believes his dreams are true and has trouble making friends because of his obsession. One night while his parents are at a business party a little 9yr old vampire named Rudolph spots Tony with fake fangs in his mouth. He flys in hoping that Tony will protect him from a vampire hunter only to find out that Tony isn't a vampire at all! Tony then finds out that his dreams are real and decides to help his friend look for the amulet...Although this movie is too cute for teens and boring for adults The Little Vampire will put a smile on kids from the age 511.

Sadly this Englishlanguage version of the story has ditched the dark humour and wild fantasy of previous incarnations in favour of a more bland Disneyesque reworking.The charm of the original lay in the development of the relationship between the little vampire and the mortal boy. In this film they meet and  become instant best friends and then some tedious plot involving a passing comet takes over the storyline. Likewise Rdiger's family or Rudolph in this version would be more interesting if they didn't accept his human pal almost instantly.So if we ignore the fact it is a poor adaptation how does the movie stand by itself? It is fairly good fun but its linear plot simplistic characters and acting from little Jonathan Lipnicki make it unsuitable fodder for adults. Kids will probably enjoy it but it won't become an obsession.That said much respect to the herd of flying vampire cows.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised at how much I liked The Little Vampire. It isn't exceptional but in no way is it terrible. Some of the special effects are a little ropey while I liked the story in general there may be those who may find the idea of having an American hero in a film set in Scotland a little contrived and I think it could have been a tad longer. That said the costumes are very nice and the scenery is a delight as is the cinematography. People may find it rather bleak but I liked the bleakness I think it suited the film very well. The film is well directed and written with some witty lines and a very amusing running gag about... wait for it... vampire cows. The acting is also surprisingly good. Jonathan Lipnicki is really cute Rollo Weeks is charming and bright Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige are campy delights as the parents while Jim Carter is suitably unhinged as the slayer. Another thing The Little Vampire is a rare film that doesn't patronise its audience. Overall very enjoyable while not being the best movie I have ever seen. 710 Bethany Cox".

Some of the special effects are a little ropey while I liked the story in general there may be those who may find the idea of having an American hero in a film set in Scotland a little contrived and I think it could have been a tad longer. That said the costumes are very nice and the scenery is a delight as is the cinematography. People may find it rather bleak but I liked the bleakness I think it suited the film very well. The film is well directed and written with some witty lines and a very amusing running gag about... wait for it... vampire cows. The acting is also surprisingly good. Jonathan Lipnicki is really cute Rollo Weeks is charming and bright Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige are campy delights as the parents while Jim Carter is suitably unhinged as the slayer. Another thing The Little Vampire is a rare film that doesn't patronise its audience. Overall very enjoyable while not being the best movie I have ever seen. 710 Bethany Cox";

Costner's portrayal of a highly complex sometimes tortured character is superb in that he is seemingly always in control always one step ahead of the challenges. One of the best stories in some time this one covers all of the bases in a satisfying way keeping the viewer completely involved from start to finish. There are just enough plot twists blended seamlessly with just the right amount of predictability to make this story completely believable and totally satisfying.Mr. Brooks Mr. Citizen is a soft spoken highly intelligent man of the community always in control of his job and family despite the adversities he faces throughout the movie. Very enjoyable is the intricacy detail and discipline he is able to maintain throughout the chaos that befalls him throughout the entire plot. His total control of all of the challenges almost makes him a super hero in terms of skill and control in the performance of his self assigned gruesome tasks at hand. The blending of his alterego bad conscience side Marshall is seamlessly accomplished in this psychological escapade to the point that one almost has to root for them. Marshall although the psychopathic side of Brooks is almost likable in a twisted sort of way. The ongoing dialog between the two is perfect in that almost everyone can relate to conscience issues at some point in their lives.The added subplots concerning detective Demi Moore the would be wanna be killer Mr. Smith and the exgold digging husband and his attorney are extra intriguing elements that are very well done. Though told with a considerable dark tonality because of the theme one finds himself cheering for Mr. Brooks and his incredible ability as a master craftsman. Ironically one can also cheer for the detective that is out to capture him.If you are ready for a story that is intriguing suspenseful gripping and present day then this movie is a good place to start. Costner Moore Cook and Hurt are all splendid. Each one is intense tormented fun and believable in his respective role. Another positive feature about the storyline and it's conclusion is that it lends itself to perhaps a very interesting sequel potential. Kudos to the directors producers and entire cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bruce A. Evans' Mr. Brooks deserves praise for at least bringing a certain degree of freshness to the wellworn serialkiller genre.Kevin Costner portrays Earl Brooks a devoted husband and father and the recent recipient of the Portland Oregon Man of the Year Award for his work as a successful businessman. He also just happens to be a coldblooded murderer known to the media and the law enforcement community as the Fingerprint Killer so named because he leaves that telltale sign behind at each of his crime scenes we must assume it is not his own fingerprint although the script never actually spells that out for us. As the movie opens Brooks hasn't killed anyone for two years having chosen to resist the temptation by attending AA meetings and focusing on his wife and daughter. However lately Brooks has begun to succumb to the pull of his addiction once again allowing his darker angel to lure and goad him into seeking out unsuspecting victims as a means of alleviating the pressure.What separates Mr. Brooks from all other previous serialkiller thrillers is that it has chosen to actually incarnate that bad angel on screen in the form of an unnerving William Hurt who appears by Brooks' side at strategic moments in the movie to advise berate and commiserate with Brooks as he contemplates his next homicidal action. Generally in these movies we rarely get a sense of the intense mental struggle taking place within the deeply disturbed psychotic mind of the killer. Through the use of Hurt's character referred to as Marshall however the writers Evans and Raynold Gideon are able to verbalize that conflict and show us the two warring factions coexisting within this single warped psyche. Despite the absurdity of it Brooks truly believes that his condition can be cured if he regularly and faithfully attends a selfhelp group for alcoholics. Thus against our better judgment perhaps we find ourselves almost feeling sorry for the man a position one rarely finds oneself in in a tale such as this one.The complex plot also includes a wannabe young killer Dane Cook who blackmails Brooks into taking him out on his next killing spree an expert homicide investigator Demi Moore who was investigating the Fingerprint Killer case until the trail turned cold and Brooks' own collegeaged daughter Jane Danielle Panabaker who may have inherited her dad's killer gene and might just possibly have a murder or two of her own to account for.The storyline may not always pass the credibility threshold particularly in the suggestion that psychosis might have a genetic component and can be passed down from generation to generation but the cleverness of the approach and the genuine creepiness of many of the scenes go a long way towards mitigating the imperfections. Moreover Costner Hurt Moore and Cook give spellbinding performances as the killer and the various persons and pseudopersons caught in the bloody web he has woven.Working as a team Costner and Hurt bring complementary opposing qualities to their roles which when taken together add up to a single wellrounded character. In a complex variation on the Jekyll and Hyde Faust and Mephistopheles dichotomy Costner conveys the poignancy and vulnerability of the good Brooks while Hurt shows us the steelyeyed coldheartedness of the bad Brooks. Yet there are times when even those roles switch as when Costner coldly laughs at the prospect of a victim's potential suffering and Hurt provides words of comfort to a hurting Costner.Together the two talented stars create a complex symbiotic relationship that lifts Mr. Brooks several rungs above the ordinary.".

With a thriller like this and 2 actors Cook and Costner who are playing extremely different roles the film could have failed. It doesn't at all. It is an extremely clever and intelligent film that is a great ride from start to finish.Earl Brooks Oscar Winner Kevin Costner is Portland's man of the year. He has it all a beautiful wife a wonderful company an awesome home and a daughter Danielle Panabaker in college. But Mr. Brooks also has a secret. A secret addiction. He loves killing mostly because of the maniacal representation of his temptations and desires Marshall Oscar Winner William Hurt. After one last killing Mr. Brooks is ready to quit but is quickly blackmailed back into killing by the young photographer known simply as Mr. Smith Dane Cook. Smith just wants to tag along for the ride to feel the rush of killing. But this murderous trio of BrooksMarshallSmith must be careful as toughasnails detective Tracy Atwood Demi Moore is on their trail.I know my description of the plot is thorough but it doesn't spoil anything as all this is introduced within 10 to 15 minutes of the opening. I give director Bruce Evans a lot of credit for moving the film along quickly because most of it is the selfinflection conversations of Mr. Brooks and Marshall. The acting is very well done and with a cast like this you should expect it. Costner has been everyone's hero the past 2 decades but Costner totally breaks the mold with a daring and riveting performance as the conflicted murderous yet loving Mr. Brooks. His performance really allows the audience to root for him even though he's a vicious killer. Costner effectively displays internal conflicts between the good side of him and the dark side. William Hurt is equally haunting as Marshall the figment of Brooks' imagination. No stranger to villainous characters there is no true villain but Costner Cook and Hurt's characters are all bad men Hurt will grab the audience's attention with his smooth and liquid delivery and cruel responses to Mr. Brooks's regrets. Demi Moore delivers in a role that is a type of character rarely seen in movies anymore. Moore gives us a very flawed yet strong woman who is the only truly good and moral character in the entire movie. Her character has a lot going on in her life and it is definitely conveyed in her impatience and quick temper but we always know why she is how she is. Lastly and the biggest surprise of the entire film Dane Cook steals the show in one of the better performances of recent memory. Cook goes tit for tat with Costner in every scene they share providing some pretty intense moments between the pair. Being the comedian he is Cook will get a couple of laughs but this role is completely serious. Cook looks like he had a lot of fun doing this as he gives us a very layered Mr. Smith who is very disturbed but at the same time we know he's a fragile guy who is just a pawn in Mr. Brooks' master plan. Cook will blow you away with his range and he does a great job displaying his character arc. Mr. Smith starts off as a sarcastic and overconfident guy who is looking to toy with a killer. By the end of the film Smith changes radically into a completely different person. Way to go Dane.Bruce Evans does a great job at the helm of the film providing a fast paced psychological thriller helped out by clever dialog and one of the most intelligent characters portrayed on film since Hannibal Lecter in Mr. Brooks. It's almost unreal how smart and clever Costner's character is. Another thing I liked was the symmetry between Costner and Hurt. The actors carry a lot of the same mannerisms into their characters and with the help of Evans it looks great. There are times where they will do the same movement at the exact same time. Mr. Brooks is a first rate thriller that any fan of the genre should enjoy. The plot has its twists and turns before the grand finale which reminds the viewer that...Mr. Brooks always has a plan...810 spy".

The acting is very well done and with a cast like this you should expect it. Costner has been everyone's hero the past 2 decades but Costner totally breaks the mold with a daring and riveting performance as the conflicted murderous yet loving Mr. Brooks. His performance really allows the audience to root for him even though he's a vicious killer. Costner effectively displays internal conflicts between the good side of him and the dark side. William Hurt is equally haunting as Marshall the figment of Brooks' imagination. No stranger to villainous characters there is no true villain but Costner Cook and Hurt's characters are all bad men Hurt will grab the audience's attention with his smooth and liquid delivery and cruel responses to Mr. Brooks's regrets. Demi Moore delivers in a role that is a type of character rarely seen in movies anymore. Moore gives us a very flawed yet strong woman who is the only truly good and moral character in the entire movie. Her character has a lot going on in her life and it is definitely conveyed in her impatience and quick temper but we always know why she is how she is. Lastly and the biggest surprise of the entire film Dane Cook steals the show in one of the better performances of recent memory. Cook goes tit for tat with Costner in every scene they share providing some pretty intense moments between the pair. Being the comedian he is Cook will get a couple of laughs but this role is completely serious. Cook looks like he had a lot of fun doing this as he gives us a very layered Mr. Smith who is very disturbed but at the same time we know he's a fragile guy who is just a pawn in Mr. Brooks' master plan. Cook will blow you away with his range and he does a great job displaying his character arc. Mr. Smith starts off as a sarcastic and overconfident guy who is looking to toy with a killer. By the end of the film Smith changes radically into a completely different person. Way to go Dane.Bruce Evans does a great job at the helm of the film providing a fast paced psychological thriller helped out by clever dialog and one of the most intelligent characters portrayed on film since Hannibal Lecter in Mr. Brooks. It's almost unreal how smart and clever Costner's character is. Another thing I liked was the symmetry between Costner and Hurt. The actors carry a lot of the same mannerisms into their characters and with the help of Evans it looks great. There are times where they will do the same movement at the exact same time. Mr. Brooks is a first rate thriller that any fan of the genre should enjoy. The plot has its twists and turns before the grand finale which reminds the viewer that...Mr. Brooks always has a plan...810 spy";

	schema:reviewBody "The main thing about Mr. Brooks that I love is that it is so convincing in its portrayal of the internal workings of a certain sort of mind almost as if it were an inside story. Mr. Brooks is a character who is completely unsuspecting to anyone observing him yet he is a completely different person beneath the skin. He is much more complex than a lot of mainstream audiences will realize upon first viewing. He has deep feelings for his family which means he's capable of deep feelings. Yet he is completely aware of his manipulative and destructive capabilities and intermittently cannot help himself and must take advantage of them. I think the script is a truly brilliant rendering of a very realistic sort of personality that is so secretive that they can be found throughout the range of all human activity.Kevin Costner having always been one of the most wooden actors in contemporary movies I am very impressed that he hit the nail on the head with this very challenging and multilayered character of Mr. Brooks and in understanding him completely knew just how much of him to reserve for William Hurt's share Hurt playing a figure nonexistent to anyone in the film other than Costner representing the deepest darkest thoughts of Mr. Brooks. The script and direction are very clearcut and discern the dialogue between Costner and Hurt as the same character and not a split personality.Demi Moore is affecting in her portrayal of a cop whose personal life calls upon the part of a personality that would urge with anger towards thoughts of murder and is able to suppress them. It's maybe my favorite of all the performances I've seen of hers. There is lots of subtext in what appears to be a token cop role.The most interesting casting choice aside from the impressive comebacks by two aging former boxoffice magnets is of comedian Dane Cook as a blackmailing witness to one of Mr. Brooks's murders. His character is a creative blend of voyeuristic and eagerly putzy and Cook pulls it off very becomingly.As well as being a very gripping and unpredictable celebration of evil I think a lot of extra credit is due to this film especially for holding its own at the box office during a summer of conglomerate boxoffice hogs like the second sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean Shrek Ocean's Eleven and SpiderMan when it is actually very edgy and takes a lot of risks as a mainstream film.".

The bad were Demi Moore and Dane Cook. When I watched movie it was not really what I expected. It had some other elements to it such as Kevin Costner's thought process and his family. The idea of putting William Hurt in this movie was great and very creative casting him as Kevin Costner's mind. This was very original in many way and displayed something different and unique that has not been really shown in serial killer movies. The best part of this movie was Kevin Costner's performance. His performance was probably the most unique and different compare to other serial killer movies making his character realistic. The movie was mostly based and revolved around him it allowed for his character to develop and open up. He showed something that I would never expect from Kevin Costner. He was perfect fit because he displayed exactly how many psychopaths are intelligent calm and precise. He also fit perfectly because it actually made sense that someone with a personality and status like Costner's could actually be like a Jack the Ripper sort of person. He displayed how he is fighting himselfWilliam Hurt on whether he should kill or not. But like most psychopaths it eventually becomes repetitive and automatic. He had this obsessive compulsion of just killing people. Costner shows how he is in constant pain and just cannot escape his temptations and paranoia. It was really amazing watching him and William Hurt together. I think the ending perfectly illustrated his performance.What really ruined this movie was Demi Moore. She just did not bring anything at all to this story. She did not seem into the character and was just too average. Dane Cook was just really not a fit at all. When I look at him I think comedy. He was not too convincing and kind weirded me out the wrong way. That could be a good thing though. Believe or not this movie does have a message showing how are temptations can eventually take over us if we give into them. It shows by giving in you are really going for the quick fix and not thinking long term.".

If you're going to do gore go over the top and make it cartoonish a la Sin City or any Tarantino. Then we can enjoy it. Mr. Brooks however fails as a cartoon and fails as a horror film. That just leaves us with thriller and this amount of contextless blood is out of place.

Guess what you are going to burn your hand baby!!! not to mention that the plastic bag would melt too. That was so stu.....d that the movie from there on was almost unbearable even more than founding a piece of plastic inside the corpses's heads from the same plastic bag after the first shoot??? Later on Demmi Moore is kidnapped in a van. Of course that in some scenes the lateral door is open then closed and then again open it doesn't matter at least for the filmmaker though. Anyway she flies off the lateral door after some bizarre fight and she fell on top of a car hitting it with her back sure hard enough to leave anyone of us simple mortals in a wheelchair for good. But not so for her who is taken to a hospital and while the doctor is stitching her head she keeps talking about the case whitout even blinking for pain!!! Really guys this movie is too much. The best part is about the last 10 seconds when our killer is having a nightmare that says everything. Absolutely not recommended.".

It has toooooo many and gruesome mistakes for instance how do you expect to fire a gun and keep the round inside a bag where your hand is? Guess what you are going to burn your hand baby!!! not to mention that the plastic bag would melt too. That was so stu.....d that the movie from there on was almost unbearable even more than founding a piece of plastic inside the corpses's heads from the same plastic bag after the first shoot??? Later on Demmi Moore is kidnapped in a van. Of course that in some scenes the lateral door is open then closed and then again open it doesn't matter at least for the filmmaker though. Anyway she flies off the lateral door after some bizarre fight and she fell on top of a car hitting it with her back sure hard enough to leave anyone of us simple mortals in a wheelchair for good. But not so for her who is taken to a hospital and while the doctor is stitching her head she keeps talking about the case whitout even blinking for pain!!! Really guys this movie is too much. The best part is about the last 10 seconds when our killer is having a nightmare that says everything. Absolutely not recommended.";

This was a wild two hours.I think that's the best recommendation I can give this is pure entertainment two hours of a story that grabs you right from the start and never lets go a very involving story. Kevin Costner and William Hurt are tremendous in here and worth the price of the rental alone. The whole cast was good but the dialog between those two guys  one real and one imaginary  have to be heard to be believed.There are a few parts I would have changed including the ending and I didn't particularly care for most of the characters but overall this is so fascinating a story and so entertaining it didn't matter what I thought of the characters.If you want something entertaining a little thoughtprovoking edgyyetmoralistic good acting and photography this is a pretty good value for your rental money.".

This is one of the stalest most unimaginative scripts I have had to sit through in a while. It's like Oh...this is a SERIOUS movie. About murder. With plot twists. CHEAP plot twists that don't really make you feel anything. Dane Cook tries hard to be mean and serious but just looks like a goon doing so. His acting is poor in this. See him in DAN IN REAL LIFE instead. Demi Moore gives it her best but isn't given any decent lines to work with. William Hurt is given the opposite  he was cast as the schizophrenic other personality of Costner and basically has to recite the most ridiculous nonsensical cheeseball ramblings. I feel bad for him. He's just plain annoying in this  and that's coming from me who's favorite movie of all time features him in the lead role Altered States. And Costner just feels like Costner reading memorized lines as well. STALE! Boring! Nothing makes this movie standout. The interesting ensemble makes you think want to check it out but in my opinion it is absolutely not worth it. There is one very cool surprising scene towards the end  but unfortunately it is not enough to save this stinker!".

I found myself drawn to Mr. Brooks Kevin Costner due to his fight with his darkness his internal evil nemesis Marshal played by William Hurt. He appears to have been able to control his demon for a spell and then collapses back into the darkness to return to his old ways.Killing for Earl Brooks is a form of art. He researches his victims he gets to know his victims he is an artist of the macabre.The relationship that Earle has with Marshal is one of the best lovehate relationships that I have seen on screen in a while. Marshal is like the worst best friend that anyone would need but yet Earl seems to need him around.Detective Atwood played by Demi Moore isn't a complete character in my books. I just couldn't identify with her and as such it was hard to care about her. Her drama with her divorce was a bit loose and flimsy and almost seemed to out of place.Dane Cook Mr. Smith took of his funny man hat and put on a serious role and it worked. This could be Dane Cook's Punch Drunk Love that makes him an actor...not just a comedian. I was really impressed how they under wrote his character so as to give Dane a bit of latitude to stretch his acting muscles and have a real presence on screen. There was a moment between Earl and Mr. Smith where Mr. Smith flashes this look ...and it was almost like seeing Dane's dark side.Emma Brooks Marg Helgenberger was almost like part of the set. She was window dressing.Danielle Panabaker's portrayal of Earl's daughter Jane is chilling. You could tell from her first moments on the screen that something is not quite right with her. The stories she tells her parents about why she left school are like incorrect math answers the numbers just don't add up. The undercurrents in Jane are almost a carbon copy of those of her father.There is one fantastic twist in the film that almost made me fall of my seat. You will know what I'm talking about if and or when you see this movie.I am thinking that there could be a bit of Oscar buzz about some of the players in this film. Kevin Costner William Hurt Danielle Panabaker and Dane Cook all deserve accolades for their performances.This film was well made. The cinematography was fantastic the editing was smart and tight and the soundtrack was perfectly matched to not only the characters moods but the mood of the film as a whole.I would highly recommend this film as one of the best thrillers of the year if not the past few years.

The aspect to the CostnerWilliam Hurt dynamic where it's a blatantly obvious contrivance of the script where almost every scene without Brooks with a different person in the room or other to talk to is with Hurt's character of Brooks's ego or Id or whatever Freudian ticktack may apply. Some of there scenes however stupid they might be including one where Costner cries have mercy show some interesting bits and pieces of psychological unease between the two as if it's been too long that Brooks has listened to his eggeron and doubting Thomas but still does as the two have wicked laughs at the possibilities of murder and deceit.However it's directorcowriter Bruce Evans's idea to make Mr. Brooks crammed with the typical elements of a mysterythriller involving a serial killer and in some equally expected and inane ways. Demi Moore's character is the given the tough pro who is saddled with her other motivation that she has to crack the case or else be fired due to a divorce case happening the same time this is a totally inexplicable plot line made so that Moore can act even more 'tough' and to eventually tie it into the Brooks killing line. Then there's Dane Cook who doesn't act so much as just use his sort of twitchy 'skills' at acting like he can act to play the almost blackmailing photographer who catches Brooks in the act of killing two of his latest and then is brought along by Brooks to see someone else get killed. On top of this we get the 'other wise' to Brooks's life which is that he's a legitimate businessman and a loving husband and father the latter of which to a girl who may turn out to be as dysfunctional as him in the worst ways possible.Instead of possibly giving the characters and developing situations much serious thought Evans and his cowriter make it all too ridiculous to take as something more interesting and at the same time tries to make it a conventional thriller to make it experimental. Although Evans isn't necessarily incompetent as a craftsman with the camera there are in fact many well done shots in darkness and silhouettes and other moody scenes of Brooks in his dark home or in thought or Moore swimming in the pool the story is just too stupid to really make it on either side with some minor exceptions the moment when Cook's Mr. Smith finds the newspaper in the car with the words circled to spell out instructions to his total anger is hilarious and the actors are left with material to flounder in. Cosnter can show his talents from time to time but again he's saddled himself to a work that might have at some point allowed him for extra room to challenge himself but in the end he almost challenges his audience to actually see if he has anything at all going on emotionwise which is next to none. William Hurt takes a nosedive following his smashing Oscar nomination a couple years ago. Moore is well the usual not bad but nothing more worthy of potential. And Cook is close to being a nonentity in a role that should require more chutzpah.In short wait for TV real late night I'mdrunkandthere'snothingelseon TV for this mainstream claptrap.".

	schema:headline " Here's a film that definitely deserves the mixed reviews...";
	schema:reviewBody "MR. BROOKS is the kind of suspense film that manages to hold your attention from the very start and then just when you think you know where it's all going you find out you've been duped. Midway through the film you realize you don't even know where the story is going with its many strands that don't seem to connect.In other words there's nothing predictable about the outcome but while that would ordinarily be a good thing here the effect is a handicap because there are too many unexplained elements in the script and too many loose ends. Nevertheless some of it is very clever and intriguing a sort of Dr. JekyllMr. Hyde story with KEVIN COSTNER struggling to be good and leave his bad deeds behind him but egged on by his alter ego WILLIAM HURT to kill again.What the screenplay fails to do is to connect the three main stories that are being spun into one cohesive whole. As a result at the end there's a letdown feeling that nothing has really been satisfactorily explained.It's taut and suspenseful and should satisfy most fans of this genre but it's a psychological thriller that would have been even better with a fully realized script.The performances are fine. KEVIN COSTNER is especially good in some of the climactic scenes after a rather dull beginning but it's DANE COOK as Mr. Smith the twisted and temperamental photographer who catches a murder on film and has a strange request that gives the film its most intense moments as he tries to outfox the clever Mr. Brooks.I've liked WILLIAM HURT in many other roles but find his character more annoying and repelling than merely evil.Summing up A psychological thriller that is sometimes dull sometimes riveting as it tries hard to rise above the level of a cluttered script and only partially succeeds. There's a Dr. JekyllMr. Hyde flavor to the whole story. The Demi Moore subplot is totally out of whack with the rest of the story.".

BROOKS is the kind of suspense film that manages to hold your attention from the very start and then just when you think you know where it's all going you find out you've been duped. Midway through the film you realize you don't even know where the story is going with its many strands that don't seem to connect.In other words there's nothing predictable about the outcome but while that would ordinarily be a good thing here the effect is a handicap because there are too many unexplained elements in the script and too many loose ends.

Kevin Costner in an interesting new turn for him plays Mr. Brooks a selfmade multimillionaire with a beautiful house and a loving wife and daughter. His business colleagues have nothing but respect for him. But he has a dark secret... he's addicted to killing people and has been for years. He fights his addiction by attending AA meetings at church and just calling himself an addict. William Hurt plays Marshall his twisted innervoice who eggs him on. I found Costner and especially Hurt to be quite a hoot in a very darkly comic sort of way they actually make quite a duo.

Although she's a cop she's not afraid to break the rules. She can take on a steroided super villain. She took down her own partner a black man jiujitsu style like it was nothing. She talks to herself while visiting the crime scene to give the audience usidea of what she's thinking. sudden corpse dropping from the ceiling doesn't faze her instead she just delivers pseudo cool die hard like line. And why does she do all this? Because her father wasn't happy that she was born a girl and made her quite aware of it. Really? So that's what you do. If you look close enough she comes off as a psychopath herself. Like when Bane or whatever had her in the van she screams shoot me m0therf0cker! And this guy who is supposed to be a serial killer who's escaped from jail and is out to get her for some reason stalls when she screams those words giving her time to somehow fight and escape. The only reason I can think off as to why he would do that is because he too must have been shocked like 'this b1tch is crazy !' Oh and when she gets flung out of the van onto another vehicle the next thing is she's just getting some stitches on her head. Mental...Mr. Brooks. I didn't like the whole bipolar thing right from the start. I mean it's done enough number of times Primal Fear Fight Club The Machinist etc. it's like Hollywood thinks Serial Killer  BiPolar. And BiPolar  Person who literally has two personalities and engages in full on conversations with his schitzo self. The other characters are useless or retarded. Atwood has an exhusband who the movie tries to make you feel deserves to be killed. I don't understand what's with Brooks' daughter. And Why would he want her to have a bastard son even after he knows that she has what he's got.The violent dream scene in the end was just gratuitous violence for no reason what so ever.Anyway this movie is nonsense.

	schema:headline " Solid and fairly original thriller with nice performances from Costner Hurt and Cook";
	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Brooks Costner is addicted to killing. He doesn't do it because he wants to he does it because he's an addict. Mr. Brooks derives sexual pleasure from the kill adding a disturbing element to the film. He's the Portland man of the year and apparently the CEO of a boxing company as well as the notorious 'thumbprint killer' an alias derived from his strange after murder acts in which he leaves the bloody thumbprint of each of his victims on a surface on the scene of the crime. Mr. Brooks hasn't killed for two years but is persuaded early in the film by his alter ego Marshall William Hurt to kill again. Not surprisingly he goes through with it killing a couple making love and conveniently not noticing that the curtains were open during the act. Again not exactly surprising that a Mr. Baffert Dane Cook was snapping photos of the couple for his own sexual pleasure when the murder occurred which gave him evidence against the Portland Man of the Year.In the first of many 'twists' which grow increasingly convoluted over the course of the film it appears that Baffert or Smith doesn't want to report the murder to anyone but instead wants in on the next kill. Demi Moore plays a determined policewoman going through a divorce worth noting that her soon to be ex husband is notably younger than her... get the joke? who has been working on the case of the thumbprint killer for what appears to be forever. There's a whole bunch of subplots which are poorly developed and quite unnecessary and disturb the flow of the film.The script is the main problem with the film. Costner has stated that the idea for Mr. Brooks was planned for a trilogy and this feels too openended too packed with twists turns and largely unnecessary subplots. There's no doubt that Mr. Brooks had the potential to be much better than the end result. However the film does look good a huge improvement visually at least over director Bruce A. Evans' only other directorial venture Kuffs. The performances are excellent Costner has only been better in Dances With Wolves and Open Range and turns in a very very good understated performance ast he title character. Though Demi Moore is miscast the most controversial casting choice Dane Cook goes far beyond expectations. Expecting disastrous results I was shocked to find Cook perform very well in the role of Mr. Baffert or Smith he accurately portrays his character's nervous anticipation. Mr. Brooks is a lot of fun. As entertainment it unquestionably delivers and it is a good thriller which breaks the Hollywood mold but it would have been a far better 150 minute film than how it currently stands. There are too many subplots and they're too confusing. This film would have easily gotten an 8 or 9 out of 10 from me had it concentrated more on the interaction between Costner Cook and Hurt and less on Moore's character. Costner wants this to be a trilogy and personally I'm hoping for at least a direct to video sequel because Mr. Brooks' story is a lot better than this film.610".

The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original Lone Ranger purists and some Western lovers as well for a rollicking action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. It's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of yore pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans pulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable the landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to past masters of the Western genre while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. This is an origin story a tale of how John Reid Armie Hammer became The Lone Ranger and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian sidekick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom Wilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain duties the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West in is own image the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for eating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some Grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with sexual energy. It's all very wacky and wild and rightly so but this is not at the expense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could have been trimmed but as the bromance builds between our two heroes and Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades there's nary a dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski throw all the action staples into the pot. Chases fights swinging from ropes shootouts people dangling from speeding train pic is bookended by awesome train sequences grisly deaths and on it goes from start to end. There's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the time from railroad magnates to the cavalry while the catchphrases and legends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale. It was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against those damning early critic reviews it's not something he does being as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer Hammer and Verbinski backed Depp up stating that some reviews were written before the film had even been released the big budget and production problems clearly making this a big stinker Not so it's certainly not flawless and those seriously into anachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it yet if you was put off by the venomous early reviews then give it a chance you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It also looks and sounds brilliant on Bluray where repeat viewings even show Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.510".

It is violent in certain scenes and may not be suitable for smaller children but for adults and tweens it is about right. I did think that the first 1015 mins or so were a little too slapsticky for me but once it gets going it gets good. To all of the naysayers out there what did you think you were going to see?

	schema:reviewBody "Is The Lone Ranger a great movie? Not really but it is relatively entertaining.Is the movie slow in the middle? A little but not as bad as most critics would have you believe.The Lone Ranger is a bit long and does ask you to be patient at times something that seems to be lost in the modern videogame world we live in.The strength of the movie lies squarely with Johnny Depp and his portrayal of Tonto. I seriously doubt that any other actor could have pulled it off. Depp deadpans through several oneliners which gives us much of the movie's humor. In Depp's capable hands the character of Tonto is both admirable and witty with a charm all his own.The first part of the movie definitely gets us started with a bang. It does jump around quite a bit in the first few scenes which seemed a little disjointed at times but things are tied together well enough as the movie progresses.The middle of the movie is slower but we are provided with many of the answers as to the back history of the characters especially with Tonto and the villains. I will agree that the movie could have accomplished the same with five to ten less minutes but that is certainly not an adequate reason in itself to skewer the film.And the last few scenes are the nonstop action sequences that most modern audiences love although they do almost come off as cartoonish at times.As stated Depp's performance is the single biggest selling point for this movie. I thought William Fichtner was very good as Butch Cavendish the film's main villain. Tom Wilkinson James Badge Dale Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter all lend excellent support.Of the movie's title character I'm not sure that someone else other than Armie Hammer wouldn't have made a better Lone Ranger. That being said the interactions and dialog between him and Depp's Tonto are enjoyable and occasionally laughoutloud funny. In many ways this is a buddy movie albeit with a bit of a twist.Perhaps one of the main reasons critics dislike the movie is its title. For all intents and purposes this is really a Tonto movie. It is more his story and told from his point of view. It probably should have properly been called Tonto. But I don't see that as being a bad thing at all.If you take it for what it is The Lone Ranger is a reasonably entertaining film with a very strong performance by Depp. And that was enough for me to give it a 7 out of 10.".

If they didn't have this challenge they would have no conflict whatsoever. It makes for a puzzle.Tonto takes center stage here but unlike the 2003 disaster he is a character instead of a symbol of a godlike race. Here no favorites are played. The most evil ones in this story are a pair of white men and other white men they enlist but we aren't given sermons about this.Depp is great as Tonto. The museum scenes are a bit too much for me but it is good for the kids. The out of sequence bits work partly because they aren't emphasized too much. Depp as Tonto craftily plays this with a subtle humor and that is just what is needed for this.There is the magic and mystique of the Ranger but also an explanation given for it as Nature out of balance. We are dealing with a supernatural chain of events which do allow the Lone Ranger to ride a horse through and on top of railroad cars.Great blend of humor and adventure and at the same time a crafty blend of Shakespeare and Indiana Jones. This is better than what meets the eye and what meets the eye is extra special in itself with plenty of eye candy for men and women.".

I remember some of the Lone Ranger comics and remember seeing small clips and my dad telling me stories about it but I never actually saw a show. I enjoyed this movie it reminded me of fun action with the family. The violence wasn't ridiculous where you couldn't bring children to watch it but authentic enough to know not to try it at home. I saw in an interview that Armie did all the stunts and you can tell. His work on making the character honorable noble and pretty much a decent human being was very well portrayed. Johnny Depp steals the show with his one liners a few times I just started laughing at the comments he would make. Overall i'd give this movie an 810. Well written excellent character development you actually care for them and a great job with the actors and the acting. What I really enjoyed about the movie was that the special effects didn't look too fake. Yeah a few scenes you may have been like yeah right in your head but unlike Fast and the Furious 6 the special effects people on this project do a great job keeping it looking realistic. Bring your family to watch this a great story of an iconic character. Hopefully this is the start to more because I wouldn't mind watching a sequel or two.".

The movie was lovely. It had action as promised a good plot and pretty generous doses of humor for a movie of this genre. Depp stole the show with his portrayal of Tonto but the other actors were great as well. The obvious comparison of this movie is with the Pirates of the Caribbean series because of Verbinski and Depp. There were parts of the movie especially those where Tonto's actions generated laughs from the theater which reminded me of the latter. Both have Depp in eccentric roles which provide ample comic relief. But since the themes are completely different I feel that a comparison is not exactly fair. All in all it is a good lighthearted entertaining way to spend two and a half hours and I am considering hitting the theater for it again soon.".

	schema:headline " Depp shines The Lone Ranger entertains!";
	schema:reviewBody "Quite frankly I was highly skeptical on attending the screening of the hugely anticipated Johnny Depp Arnie Hammer starrer The Lone Ranger primarily because I am not such a huge fan of western movies plus a runtime clocking almost 150 minutes seemed to long to handle. Nevertheless I decided to give it a try owing to the Depp factor and the director Gore Verbinsky who has a pretty neat track record as a director.I haven't actually seen The Lone Ranger T.V series which aired from 19491957 so I pretty much knew nothing about the characters as such and went in with a clean slate which in my opinion is a good thing as it removed unwarranted comparisons and biasness.Settling down in my seat and 10 minutes into the movie I was hooked on. A spectacular opening scene where the outlaws make away with their chief held captive and being transported on a train. The scene introduces us to the principal characters of the movie namely Tonto Johnny Depp John Reid Arnie Hammer and Butch Cavendish William Fichtner. Verbinsky establishes his characters smoothly and seamlessly throughout the narrative which is definitely one of the high points of the movie. The entire story unfolds as Tonto recounts the tales of his journey and how John Reid becomes The Lone Ranger. The two form an uncanny team to bring Cavendish to justice each in his own manner. John believes in nonviolence and the court of law and Tonto is just the opposite. The two share an electrifying chemistry and Depp gets his comic timing spot on as the quirky Tonto. Tonto belongs to a native American warrior tribe who feels responsible for the death of his fellow men and his family owing to a trade he made with two white Americans he saved from certain death when he was a child. John seeks revenge from Cavendish as he is responsible for the death of his illfated brother Dan Reid.James Badge Dale.Inspite of its length the movie never drags or feels lethargic at any point of time instead it provides a good dose of laughter at regular intervals and Depp shines in those scenes. The scenes where the Native American trades a feather or grains for everything he steals from dead people or the scene where the white stallion chooses John over his brother and Tonton repeatedly tries to force the stallion to switch the selection Depp is just fantastic.Depp rises above his costars with his impeccable comic timing and one liners. The best facet to his character is the fact that he is so unpredictable. You never know what is he going to do next. Arnie Hammer pitches in an earnest performance and nicely complements Depp. Despite all its triumphs it does have a couple of blemishes. It's understandable that the entire writing revolved around the two principal characters John and Tonto and I'm guessing due to the focus on these two characters some other supporting characters got sidelined. The sub plot involving Rebecca Ruth Wilson and her relationship with John is half baked and is not well developed. Similarly Helena Bonham Carter as Red Harrington is unconvincing as the deadly leggie and neither does her character get enough screen time leave a mark.Barring the two minor hiccups The Lone Ranger overall is a fine movie which is high on entertainment value. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone who seeks a good time at the movies. Fun guaranteed!".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently attended an early screening for the film at Disney's California Adventure and wow it was great. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a man named John Reid becomes the Lone Ranger who is brilliantly played by Armie Hammer. Johnny Depp obviously stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto I thought it was one of his best characters he's ever played. The highlight here is the two's chemistry throughout the film these are two very different people who both have different perspectives on life and they were just hilarious together. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast I thought some characters were a little under developed and not as enjoyable as the leads. I wished the villain were just as enjoyable like how Geoffrey Rush was for Curse of the Black Pearl. So in other terms the film is not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but more superior then the Prate sequels. Go see this movie you'll have a great time and people can learn from this movie it's got some good messages.".

When you watch a television show in black and white growing up you don't always know what to expect as an adult to see it as a feature length film. I enjoyed this movie tremendously. The storytelling and writing was excellent. The fact that Lone Ranger isn't a Disney character meant that I had no other reference but the television show to go on. This is one you have to pay attention to. Don't get up in the middle to get a refill on your popcorn because you may very well miss part of the story. Depp plays an older tormented Tonto sharing his experiences meeting the Lone Ranger with a young boy who attends the local carnival. And so the story begins. The element of greed in American history and what it can influence people to do is closely examined throughout the film. Therefore you get entertainment and a lesson and it's cleverly written so that even young adults will get it. No need to explain how dad and granddad use to watch it in black and white back in the day. This is one of the better reboots of the summer.".

	schema:headline " A reboot and a real hoot!";
	schema:reviewBody "What is wrong with these snarky critics? I just saw this film and I paid full price for my tickets all you lucky previewers! I thought this film was very good  far better than I had expected from reading all the criticism from the film critics and some of the comments from viewers. Did they just miss the point entirely? Listen it's not that complicated. This movie just takes the old Lone Ranger classics radio and TV serial and has fun with rebooting that story. It's Tonto who is the one telling the story this time and the Lone Ranger who's the straight man  and this actually works in my opinion. After all this is really a reboot  a how the Lone Ranger became the classic hero story  and having Tonto tell the story is a brilliant move to change the straightlaced Lone Ranger as infallible Western superhero into a believable character for a more modern audience. John Reid the guy who's eventually going to become the Lone Ranger starts out as a straightlaced stiff who takes himself and his beliefs far too seriously. Tonto clearly thinks he's pretty useless  and that's a funny premise to begin with. Armie Hammer is perfectly credible as John Reid  he's plays fish out of water in the bad old West but slowly with Tonto's help he starts to learn what he needs to learn to be effective in putting a halt to the evil done by the bad guys.Tonto is a great role for Johnny Depp. It's his deadpan humor that provides the story's most lively commentary on how the Lone Ranger is progressing in learning his craft. I think many people were startled by Johnny Depp's costume  but go look up Kirby Statler's I am Crow picture on Google images. There is an historical basis for how Johnny Depp decided to dress as Tonto. Besides historically speaking it was less likely that an Indian living in the canyons area of west Texas would be an Apache  which is the closest native costume to how Jay Silverheels the TV serial's Tonto dressed  than it would be for the Indian to be a Comanche. I've lived in Texas for decades and actually studied Texas and Comanche history enough so that I have no problem with Johnny Depp's outfit  and the crow on his head actually ends up involved in some pretty funny bits in the movie! They actually were pretty clever in how they did this.The point of the picture is both the individual journey that John Reid makes to become the Lone Ranger earning Tonto's friendship and respect along the way and the overall nature of the forces arrayed against them. During the course of the film the whole picture slowly becomes clear about what the bad guys are up to and who is helping them and why ... and the climax of the film the last 20 minutes or so is just a spectacular action sequence. Here the Lone Ranger is finally the hero we remember  and so it's fitting that when we hear the William Tell overture cut in it's funny but also it finally fits! The final battle is very very well done. It's a very complicated sequence with lots of different participants but Verbinski does a great job of helping the audience keep track of who's who and what's going on. It works! Finally I think some people had a problem with the frame story. I didn't. I totally thought that worked. If Tonto is telling the tale  the myth of the old West the myth of the Lone Ranger  to a kid then that leaves us the audience to decide what parts of the story are embellished for mythmaking and storytelling and what parts are the parts that a younger Tonto actually experienced. I think that's brilliant actually. How else other than through this kind of mythic lens could you tell such a classic hero tale to a modern audience? By the way about some of the earlier reviews that mentioned a bloody scene involving the bad guy actually eating a heart ... the theatrical release we saw today did not have this as an explicit action scene. That is you hear the bad guy say he's going to do it and he apparently does do it but you do not specifically see the bloody gory deed. I assume that maybe just for American audiences they edited that down to be more suggestive than completely depicted. I would say that this is a movie that kids down to the age of 8 say could tolerate without major trauma.HINT There IS a final bit over the last part of the credits that I think answers some of the questions about whether Tonto is who he says to the kid that he is.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the director writers and producer of the Pirates of the Caribbean films they attempt to repeat their success with a reboot of The Lone Ranger. But the film was plagued with production problems a bloated budget and poor critical response and it ended up being one of the biggest flops of 2013.In 1869 in Texas the idealistic young lawyer John Reid Arnie Hammer returns to his home town of Colby to bring in the rule of law. But when a notorious criminal Butch Cavendish William Fichtner escapes whilst journeying to Colby John has to team up with his Texas Ranger brother Dan James Badge Dale and seek to find Butch and his gang. The rangers are betrayed and John has to team up with a strange unhinged Native American Tonto Johnny Depp who also wants revenge. Soon the pair discover a bigger conspiracy that could lead to war between the United States and the Comanche tribe.The final 30 minutes was real fun romp offering an excellent action sequence that was lighthearted and adventurous whilst the William Tell Overture was playing in the background. It was a romp and this was what the whole of the film should have been. But The Lone Ranger suffers from a number of problems these range from the strange decision to frame the story as an elderly Tonto narrators it to a young boy in 1933 when the telling the story would have been stronger if it was told straight and the tonal shift being very comic with John and Tonto arguing and falling into slapstick whilst Fichtner is coming from another film where he is dark menacing and literally a cannibal.There was potential for a good romp but director Gore Verbinski does fall into the same traps of the Pirates films as Tonto and John Reid are basically Jack Sparrow and Will Turner with their buddy routine the long running time and the shifting tone. The idea of John Reid being a idealistic intelligential man who wants to bring law and order and only uses a gun as a last resort but Hammer plays the character too nerdy suffering both from the slapstick comedy and he is stronger when the character was played more straight. Whilst there has been a lot of criticism of Depp playing a Native America but the big issues are Depp is really playing another Jack Sparrow type character that has been his career lately being comically wacky. It would have served the film better if Tonto was played more straightlaced and he definitely should have been played by a younger actor someone in their early thirties. The shtick between John and Tonto just reminded me how much better it was done in the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films not helped with Hans Zimmer providing a similar score for both franchises.The Lone Ranger does have a excellent supporting cast Fichtner Tom Wilkinson Ruth Wilson Helena Bonham Carter and Barry Pepper. They are all at least solid and Fichtner does make an excellent villain but his gruesome actions should have been cut from the script he still could have been interesting coldblooded villain who killed on a whim without needing to be made into the complete psychopath. Wilson is a good actress but she was given the thankless damsel in distress role and Bonham Carter was underused in her role as a brothel owner.The screenplay itself is a mishmash of ideas having surreal supernatural ideas whilst also wanting to be a more grounded swashbucking affair with political and business conspiracies. It should have gone one way or the other but the film tries to play it both ways and it ends up leading to some big plot holesquestions. Questions that they properly wanted to answer in the sequel that is not going to happen. As you would expect from a Gore VerbinskiJerry Brockheimer production the action and special effects is of a high standard and the third act is what you would want from a Lone Ranger film. But this film should have been a lighthearted swashbucking film and not this product that wanted to be a comedy and a dark grim film.".

But the film was plagued with production problems a bloated budget and poor critical response and it ended up being one of the biggest flops of 2013.In 1869 in Texas the idealistic young lawyer John Reid Arnie Hammer returns to his home town of Colby to bring in the rule of law. But when a notorious criminal Butch Cavendish William Fichtner escapes whilst journeying to Colby John has to team up with his Texas Ranger brother Dan James Badge Dale and seek to find Butch and his gang. The rangers are betrayed and John has to team up with a strange unhinged Native American Tonto Johnny Depp who also wants revenge.

	schema:headline " Terrible Drivel";
	schema:reviewBody "The BruckheimerVerbinski team is at it once again and once again they have completely failed. This is so typical of the Disney Franchise....to take a legendary show write a mediocre script that has nothing to do with the actual Lone Ranger and get a big name like Johnny Depp to star in it. Let's face it with Johnny Depp starring people are going to see the movie no matter how terrible it is simply because he is in it. This is something that Disney does very well. They take a show that's more than 30 years old 1957 in this case and they remake it into a movie because the majority of their fan base is under 30 years old so they have no idea how accurate the movie actually is.First of all the real Lone Ranger was one of the bravest men alive not a sniveling little wimp as depicted in this movie. The characters including Tonto looked nothing like the actual characters in the original Lone Ranger. What's up with the thick crumbling face paint and the dead bird on his head? He looks more like a pygmy that just got off the first plane from the Congo in Africa. This movie is nothing but another 2 12 hour 'Pirates of the Caribbean' with characters dressed as cowboys and Indians. This is because Bruckheimer and Verbinski have one style and one style only. They are not talented enough to expand so all of their movies have the exact same recipe good guys fighting the bad guys for a damsel in distress. Let's face it we all know that Disney has completely lowered the criteria for talent in this country with all of these socalled new Disney stars such as Selena Gomez Miley Cyrus Demi Lovato Ashley Tisdale Hillary Duff Lindsay Lohan and Vanessa Hudgens. They can't sing act or dance their way out of a box if they wanted to.This movie is such a flop in the hugest way it saddens me that they spent 250 million dollars to make it. I'm guessing most of this money went to pay the salaries of the actors. This is definitely one of those movies that you will spend the last hour looking at your watch every five minutes waiting for it to end. Don't get me wrong I think Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor but the fact that he keeps accepting roles in these mediocre Disney films simply says that he is a complete sell out. It's hard for me to discern exactly what stereotype he's tackling with this oddball incarnation of Tonto which has all the eccentricity of Captain Jack Sparrow but only half of the wit. Depp has become another sellout who will take any movie role for X amount of money there is no artistic integrity involved. Armie Hammer who I also enjoy does not have the acting ability to pull off a lead role such as this. He is much better used in costarring roles such as his role in J Edgar.The most important aspect of the original Lone Ranger was that it always had a lesson that each episode taught us something of ethics and morality. This movie does nothing of the kind it is simply a western with people blowing stuff up. If you're a typical Disney sheep who will pay good money to see any movie that Disney throws at you you will probably love this movie. This is what they count on and is the reason they keep making these awful films. If you are a preteen you will probably love this movie. If you're one of those people who worship Johnny Depp and will pay to see anything that he is in you will probably love this movie. If you want to see a movie that has any artistic integrity or a movie that has a great story and plot you will hate this movie. If you grew up watching the original Lone Ranger you will be sadly disappointed once again at the mockery that Disney has made of a pure classic. I can understand why Depp is in disguise and Hammer wears a mask...I would be embarrassed to be in this film as well. Hi Ho Silver Away!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think Rotten Tomatoes finally got it right this time. Giving this film less than 25 approval rating is on the mark. I wasn't a fan of the original series but I knew that from the trailers I probably would not like this film. I still gave it a shot and boy did it fail to deliver miserably. This movie is essentially a Pirates of The Caribbean movie set in the Old West. Johnny Depp as Tonto is doing the same old shtick he did in Pirates Jack Sparrow basically wandering through the desert. His attempts at humor are the same deadpan expressions as he wanders through overly exaggerated and unrealistic special effects sequences. His sidekick sorry but that's essentially how the power relationship is set in this film is a scared gunshy lawyer John Reid played by Armie Hammer. Throughout the movie we are supposed to be cheering this guy on hoping he can avenge the death of his brother and bring the bad guys to justice. But all he does is whine and complain. They should have called him The Moan Ranger. Depps performance was quite bad and I would say offensive to native Americans of all nations. The way he talked his behavior I mean they tried to explain it away as him having been scarred emotionally as a kid but really it sounded more like an apology for Depp's stereotypical portrayal. There were also weird random things that left one's head scratching like the crazy rabbits that popped up. What the heck? Are we to believe that this stuff was based on reality or are just watching the fantasy laden recollections of an aged Tonto who's liberally adding these elements to entertain the little boy in the 1933 museum? The part about the movie that really bother me however was the fact it had an overall feel that it was geared towards families but there were scenes of such nasty brutality and violence it was a really upsetting juxtaposition. Now I'm all for gory and violent films I watch them all the time. But those films are rated 18A. This one gets away with a PG or PG13 rating but people die horribly and in many cases for no reason. I guess the fact that they don't show any blood spurting out is why the censors and ratings board gave it a pass. Overall this film is quite boring. I was taking power naps through many of the slow parts. It barely picks up speed and when it does you don't really care anymore. And why just have one locomotive crashing scenes when you can have two! Yes two train crashes in the same film talk about losing creativity. It felt very repetitive. None of the supporting characters or actors stood out. And quite frankly they felt just as annoying as The Lone Ranger himself. I think the white horse was the most interesting character on the screen. Avoid this movie just rent it for 2 out of your local movie dispensing machine. Send the studios a message so they won't make any sequels and they'll bury this attempt at a franchise for good.".

A Disney movie high production and actors weight like Johnny Depp? I'm not a fanatical fan of Johnny Depp but I generally like his movies. So what could go wrong? I thought.My Jesus I really hate this movie! I mean the film tries to be everything  tries to be funny epic dramatic tries to outline a novel but it does not seem to be a genuine western movie. Worse than that it does not remember anything the characters Lone Ranger and Tonto. It's as if they had created two totally different characters but with the same names.Lone Ranger here is a complete moron made a fool all the time and an annoyingly politicallycorrect character. The film was supposed to be about him but he did not have charisma enough to be the protagonist and is fully eclipsed by Johnny Depp.But if Johnny Depp steals every scene as Tonto even your character annoyed me. What the heck they did with Tonto in this film? What the heck was that stuffed bird? True Tonto was not a lunatic or a madman. He was not dressed in flashy clothes.In this film Tonto is not a real Native American he is literally Jack Sparrow tired of the pirate life that moved to the West and changed its name to Tonto.And what about the villains? All without exception seem pirates of the caribbean dressed in cowboy clothes which fell parachutes in the west. The unique character of this film that seems to have brain is the Horse and if the most intelligent character in a western story is an animal this mean there are problems.The plot is a spectacular mess jumping from action scenes to violent and heavy scenes for children's jokes for really trash moments. What the heck was the scene with the rabbits? And what was that scene with the character of Helena B. Carter shoots with a gun inside the boot? Worthy scenes to appear in any show or film of Seth MacFarlane no doubt.I mean really? What this film aims to be? An epic western for adults an Disney movie for kids or a parody trash like A Million Ways to Die in the West? They should have chosen only one of these alternatives because join all this in a quilt does not work.This film is a complete bullshit. I lost almost three hours of my life that no longer return. I give one star to the hair of the character of Helena Bonham Carter though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reasons to vote thumbs up for this film 1 You are in the age group that knows nothing about the LR icon story andor cinemaTV history 2 You like a mindless drivel script the kind of script that has the lone ranger pulled by a rope along the ground with his bare head dragged through horse s  t. 3 You are related to the movie 4 You have a skewed cinema value system 5 You enjoy seeing the LR slam Tonto in the head with a heavy metal shovel and then ride off and leave him to die???and this after Tonto saved his life I did say senseless 6 Script writers have the LR tell us he believes the saloon prostitutes are all 'dancers' 7 You are forced to watch scene after scene with a kid and cometo life museum exhibit Tonto that has nothing to do with the story except to interrupt it 8 See the LR make a mocking joke about his brothers death as he says in joking fashion  I guess I'm the wrong brother. Okay you get the picture. I did like the train wreck scenes since they truly represented the film which itself was a major train wreck. Very often when you see multiple screen writers in this case THREE you know a cinema train wreck may be heading your way. Horse Silver was mocked the endearing term Hi Oh Silver was mocked the LR is portrayed as a brainless air head the LR was so emotionless he shed not a tear when he watches from inches away as his brother was butchered in a much worse fashion then an effort by Dexter. A love interest was created and followed for hours even though we all know the LRs only real 'love' interest is his horse Silver.Johnny Depp has a strange sense of humor which often works. His close efforts and involvement in making this movie destroyed every premise of this cinema icon. Since Depp played Tonto as an emotional cripple that may explain what we are forced to view. Wow watching the LR accuse Tonto of being complicate in the deaths of 100's of his tribe's men women and kids when Tonto was shown as nothing worse then an innocent 1012 year old was again nonsensical.So long as some like nonsense hey look at the Adam Sandler following and have no 'feel' for the LR icon and history you will see many thumbs up. That does not turn a awful piece of cinema garbage into a deserving presentation.Pros Some awful nice scenery and special affects.".

Okay you get the picture. I did like the train wreck scenes since they truly represented the film which itself was a major train wreck. Very often when you see multiple screen writers in this case THREE you know a cinema train wreck may be heading your way. Horse Silver was mocked the endearing term Hi Oh Silver was mocked the LR is portrayed as a brainless air head the LR was so emotionless he shed not a tear when he watches from inches away as his brother was butchered in a much worse fashion then an effort by Dexter. A love interest was created and followed for hours even though we all know the LRs only real 'love' interest is his horse Silver.Johnny Depp has a strange sense of humor which often works. His close efforts and involvement in making this movie destroyed every premise of this cinema icon. Since Depp played Tonto as an emotional cripple that may explain what we are forced to view. Wow watching the LR accuse Tonto of being complicate in the deaths of 100's of his tribe's men women and kids when Tonto was shown as nothing worse then an innocent 1012 year old was again nonsensical.So long as some like nonsense hey look at the Adam Sandler following and have no 'feel' for the LR icon and history you will see many thumbs up. That does not turn a awful piece of cinema garbage into a deserving presentation.Pros Some awful nice scenery and special affects.";

Excellent story and character build up  the way a GOOD story should be told. Somewhat in the fashion of Little Big Man in that it is told as a reminiscence. Armie Hammer was excellent as The Lone Ranger  the seemingly only bastion of decency and honesty in the Old West. Filmed in magnificent John Ford country  no totally indoor sets for this movie!! Which this story really could not have been told well without it being on location. The little spoiler comes next so stop reading if you don't want to read it. Excellent decision by Verbinski to really racket the action up at the exact point the audience hears The Lone Ranger song for the first time in the movie. From there on out it's a wild ride!! Johnny Depp at his deadpan best. This one I will spend to see again while it is still on the big screen!!".

I'm glad the Indians are treated better in this than in many old westerns  I'm part Indian. But Tonto's tribe is in Utah so it should have been a Utah tribe not Comanche  and why would Utah Tonto have rescued the Texas Ranger in Texas? The 1933 beginning with Tonto alive but lifeless in a sideshow now at least 84 if 20 in 1869 was nonsensical and never explained.Cursing is mild compared to raunchiness in many modern movies but some of the curses are by the Lone Ranger! COMPLETELY out of character dishonoring his reputation for a new generation which does not know the radio or TV hero. IMHO the 1981 version was better  but I still prefer the purity of the TV series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start. I am a 17 and therefore have no right to compare this to the old Lone Ranger radio and TV show. However I have enough knowledge to gather that this was an utter failure of a movie when compared. From the beginning I was certainly intrigued. The framed storyline told by the leatheryskinned and broken Englishspeaking Tonto seemed like a great way to introduce the story. Soon after John's brother dies my attention span derailed much like the steam engine in the beginning. The tone seemed like it would be serious. And the director's couldn't decide if it would be.There were many intense almost dark scenes that could have made a great film about scandal and morality and the soundtrack did its job highlighting important moments. The betrayal of Tonto to his people the heart eating brutality by Cavendish the corrupt greed of the railroad and the horrifying conflict between Civilization and the Indians including a devastating massacre by Gatling gun all could have made a fantastic film with the same dramatic caliber as Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee but instead found themselves among illplaced jokes a painfully cowardly hero and so much CGI that I found myself trying to find what was actually real scenery. An hour could have been cut from this as well between a useless hint of a love interest between the hero and his sisterinlaw the captivity of the main actress whose escape is never explained and dry uninteresting humor that ruins any form of being a serious storyline. Did we really have to see CGI cannibalistic rabbits or Depp and Hammer buried long enough to joke and be licked by a horse? And even in its length the Lone Ranger still doesn't become the legendary hero or anything more than a overhonored weakling who shows up just in time to save the day. I do admit the classic train chase at the end did take on that feeling of a Wild West show but could have used a healthy dose of realism to make it not so outlandish.The Lone Ranger was a disastrous flop full of pointless scenes and plot changes weak and stereotyped leading characters and a despairing glimpse of what could have been a fantastic film. With its storyline balancing tediously between a RescueRevenge flick and a Moral Justice drama the script could not have possibly fulfilled both ideas to match the status of the legendary hero.".

	schema:headline " Politics Aside";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never been a fan of Canadian cinema because it was generally soaked with the sort of contrived politically correct sexual and social attitudes of which the conformist majority was already a proponent. Thus Canadian films tended to be popCanadianculture films about political correctness.Of course there were exceptions Atom Egoyan's Exotica or The Sweet Hereafter or some of Cronenberg's more experimental films like Naked Lunch possessed some of that existential starkness that attracted me to those films. Nonetheless my expectations generally remained low which is why Denys Arcand's great Barbarian Invasions was such a pleasant surprise.The film is about three things the disillusionment with socialism the growing disillusionment with capitalism and the death of a man who happened to have been a socialist professor in Montreal while his son a millionaire.Remy is dying of cancer. He is dying in a Montreal hospital which in a five minute scene is established as the horror of socialist Canadian health care. Remy's exwife calls upon his estranged welloff son Sebastien to come visit and take care of his dying father. What follows is both a comic and a touching critique of the achievements of socialism. The film also suggests that the increasingly nihilist capitalism or money seems to be the only way to get around in this world. Money gets Remy out of an overcrowded ward it gets him the most accurate medical tests and the painkillers he needs to survive. But Barbarian Invasions is critical of both systems there is a beautiful scene where an auctioneer visits an old Montreal priest who takes her to the basement where he apparently has statuettes and chalices he wants to sell. The girl examines them and tells him that they would be of more value to the people at the church than on the world market. The priest remarks starkly In other words they are worthless. Capitalism consequently is as antispiritual as socialism was. However there are far more levels to Barbarian Invasions than mere politics. In fact the film's goal is really to scream Politics Aside! so that we can make room for the man who is dying. Because Remy is not a quiet subdued man. He is a lusty man a la Sabbath from Roth's Sabbath's Theater who loves life women wine and radical socialism. But now that all those things are distant from him he is forced to question his life his relationships with his friends and his estranged children.What follows is a profound and touching elegy to the stupidities of youth the mistakes in life the regret and acceptance of old age  in other words of humanity. In the end though Remy may be disillusioned with socialism and definitely not alltoohappy with capitalism facing death somehow robs politics of their significance. Not to say that politics aren't significant in life because they pervade everything we do and see and so on but bare unadulterated life shines through for Remy. In the end Barbarian Invasions is about death and dying with dignity and how that dignity is achieved. While neither capitalism nor socialism offer it it can be found at a more basic human level. It's ironic as a sidenote that this film came out roughly at the same time as Bertolucci's The Dreamers which is essentially a contemplation on the idealism and romanticism of French socialism and the free love culture of the 60s. I found Bertolucci's film much less profound than his greater ones  it used an affair between two siblings and an American closed off in an apartment for several days as a metaphor for the sixties. It ended rather tragically but unrealistically  it tried to convince us that people got out from their cloistered apartments read mentalities and went to the streets to protest. What Barbarian Invasions tells us is that the protesters on the street were still really in that apartment cloistered from reality.".

I'm speaking for myself but my ancestor came here in Quebec in the 17th century from France. We do speak french though more than 7 million of us. Are Americans British? The Chinese woman named before the movie is Arcand's adopted daughter.Yes the health care is that bad here. But then again where is it perfect? The population is growing old hospitals are overcrowded our government spends most of our tax money for it and its still not enough. But at least we don't have to pay for health care. I'm happy to pay taxes that help elders and sick people get treated.I didn't think this is a masterpiece but it's the kind of movie that stays in your mind for a couple of days and makes you think about where we were 40 years ago where we are now and where we are going in the future. This is certainly one of Arcand's best movies with Jesus of Montreal and Le declin... He is an actor director and it shows. He deserved that Oscar if not for this movie for one of those 3 movies.".

The film is a lot about this generation that went through the sexual revolution and their quirky to us leftist ideals and a greatly intelectualized generation. My parents generation and the one before it are full of characters just like Remy the dying father of the film. Most of them still hold on to their principles and ideals just like Remy.     The film contrasts the different generations the apathetic junkie to the dying professor the warm blooded and lusty veterans to the son's cold and practical fiancee. The anguish of loss vs commemorating a life well lived. Parents that feel they weren't present enough and a Son that barely knew his father.     I heartily recommend this film... 910".

In the years since he made it though Arcand has learned how to direct. Instead of obvious camera setups there was a precision to what he did here. Instead of the ridiculous tracking shot at the beginning of Decline Barbarians was in control of the screen at all times. Arcand took the thinnest of reeds  a man dying  and made magic out of it.The story of a child reconciling with a dying parent is older than time. But this movie did it with unique touches of pathos and wit. No character was good or bad. They were both.This is a movie that was made for family viewing. Not children mind you. But grownup parents and their progeny. It will leave you with a lot to talk and think about.".

In the years since he made it though Arcand has learned how to direct. Instead of obvious camera setups there was a precision to what he did here. Instead of the ridiculous tracking shot at the beginning of Decline Barbarians was in control of the screen at all times. Arcand took the thinnest of reeds  a man dying  and made magic out of it.The story of a child reconciling with a dying parent is older than time. But this movie did it with unique touches of pathos and wit. No character was good or bad. They were both.This is a movie that was made for family viewing. Not children mind you. But grownup parents and their progeny. It will leave you with a lot to talk and think about.";

The story is a nonflinching and direct film that looks at the dying process. It is very rare to see a movie do this and it succeeded marvelously. This film also had some daring aspects as it talked about the use of heroin for pain control and the right to die. As a result it really made me thinkand that's rare for a movie! PSI was intrigued by how openly the film addresses the shortcomings in the Canadian health care system. I could definitely see why this man chose to go to a beloved place to die instead of hanging around the hospital. What a dump!UPDATEI just saw The Decline of the American Empire and BOY DID I HATE IT!! Watching these characters drone on and on and on and on and on about their sordid sex lives really annoyed and bored me.

Too bad.Now the script I don't know if people really talk like that but boy did they get on my nerves... The main characters are all socalled intellectuals but when they talk it looks like the actors are reading a script which I think is not a good thing o The story involves a dying man his millionaire son coming back to him and paying big bucks so he can get a nice room in the hospital.  He also finds a junkie so his father can take heroin which is supposed to be better than Morphine.  And that's where the only positive side of the film shows up MarieJose Croze.  She is beautiful and by far the best actress in the whole movie.

It is actually a film from the Frenchspeaking part of Canada and follows up on director Denys Arcand earlier film The Decline of the American Empire which I have not seen. The central figure of Decline Rmy is now an old man. Divorced from his wife and largely estranged from his prodigal son Sbastien he is also dying of cancer.Where Rmy has been a lifelong socialist son Sbastien is a very successful capitalist who probably earns more in one month than his intellectual father does in a year. Naturally both don't see much of each other and in fact Sbastien is now living in London.His mothers insistence brings Sbastien back to Montreal to take care of his ailing father. Being the capitalist that he is he is unable to accept the limitations of the Canadian public health system and starts a barbaric invasion of the weaknesses of the system to ensure his father is as comfortable as possible. He succeeds admirably in subverting the entire staterun system on a strictly cash basis to ensure Rmy spends his last days in comfort. He also makes contact with the world of drug traffickers to provide his father with heroin  800 more effective than morphine! In the process of ensuring his fathers comfort his efficient mechanical and largely unintellectual heart is converted.Rmy faces a more direct invasion  the barbarities of capitalist comfort and spends his dying days in relative happiness. He is the most interesting character of the movie  a failed intellectual a charlatan and a wayward father. His appetite for coeds is what destroyed his marriage although his exwife still loves him. He has regrets in his life but his wish is that his son should have a son as lovely as his.Apart from the barbaric invasions on the ways of life of the two central figures we also have references to political and military invasions like the Spanish and Portugese massacres of millions of Latin Americas was it really 150 Mn! and 911. The script of Barbarian Invasions is extremely literate  reminding me of another largely forgotten Foreign picture Oscar winner Babette's Feast. The dialog is acidic through much of the film. Unfortunately this film does not have the directorial flourishes that one would expect of a film classic. At times it almost looks like a made for TV movie. That is an unfortunate weakness in an otherwise brilliant movie.I don't wish to comment on my political convictions but I don't think this film is suitable for rightwingers and young audiences. The content is likely to offend most bigots and narrowminded people....".

Being the capitalist that he is he is unable to accept the limitations of the Canadian public health system and starts a barbaric invasion of the weaknesses of the system to ensure his father is as comfortable as possible. He succeeds admirably in subverting the entire staterun system on a strictly cash basis to ensure Rmy spends his last days in comfort. He also makes contact with the world of drug traffickers to provide his father with heroin  800 more effective than morphine! In the process of ensuring his fathers comfort his efficient mechanical and largely unintellectual heart is converted.Rmy faces a more direct invasion  the barbarities of capitalist comfort and spends his dying days in relative happiness. He is the most interesting character of the movie  a failed intellectual a charlatan and a wayward father. His appetite for coeds is what destroyed his marriage although his exwife still loves him. He has regrets in his life but his wish is that his son should have a son as lovely as his.Apart from the barbaric invasions on the ways of life of the two central figures we also have references to political and military invasions like the Spanish and Portugese massacres of millions of Latin Americas was it really 150 Mn! and 911. The script of Barbarian Invasions is extremely literate  reminding me of another largely forgotten Foreign picture Oscar winner Babette's Feast. The dialog is acidic through much of the film. Unfortunately this film does not have the directorial flourishes that one would expect of a film classic. At times it almost looks like a made for TV movie. That is an unfortunate weakness in an otherwise brilliant movie.I don't wish to comment on my political convictions but I don't think this film is suitable for rightwingers and young audiences. The content is likely to offend most bigots and narrowminded people....";

It's a tale of love without the overwrought drama brought to the subject by most modern movies and understanding without the Hallmark syrup ALSO brought to the subject by most modern movies. It's about death and the realization that sometimes even though you've lived that doesn't necessarily mean you've lived.  It's about how you can know someone and not know them at all...yet still be influenced and overpowered by them even as they do not recognize their influence.  I'm still in awe at how Denys Arcand pulled it off.The performances are magnificent.  Not one false note well...maybe the crazy woman who got in bed with Remy near the beginning but she's in just the one scene.  Remy Girard and Stephane Rousseau as Sebastien worked beautifully off each other revealing a life's worth of resentment and irritation with each other in a shorthand style of interaction that is startling.  And MarieJosee Croze's Nathalie is alluring and scary and concerned and selfinvolved and aware all at the same time.  Wow.I'm not the sort who believes that just because someone's a stockbroker or oil trader they have no soul anymore than I believe that just because someone's a peasant or been a slave they're spiritually pure.  We are all each of us complex and enlightened and loving and hateful and vile and simplistic and stubborn and stupid and smart and flexible and open and closed and any other adjective you can think of...and The Barbarian Invasions embraces that humanity in us even as it skewers how childish we can be because of it...and also celebrates how amazing all our contradictions can make us.

Those insensitive brutes get what they deserve nationally free medical care. Never mind that the people like the heroes and heroines in this flick could care less about free medical care for the mass of people. The heavy suspicion generated but not exactly articulated in this rightist attack film is that they either vote conservative or abstain from dirtying their hands in the political process. Who needs those uncouth prolotypes anyway? They get what they deserve a broken down underfunded free medical care which the richsensitive can easily skip over and continue to denounce as a tax burden.Okay so where does the heroin come in? It's a pain killer 800 times more effective than morphine says the French Canadian trained doctor who skipped the country to work in a civilized USA where they pay the doctors very handsomely and where medical care is just another commodity like pork and beans. A rich guy's professor father is dying of cancer. He needs pain relief. He needs the best pain relief. The best pain relief is heroin. He's going to die soon anyway. Who cares about the legality of heroin? This is the ONLY part of the movie which makes political sense. Heroin should be provided to the painfully ill terminal cases of the world. But it's not the world we're concerned about in this movie. We're concerned about a fairly privileged member of that society who happens to have a caring son who is rich and therefore powerful. The son skirts the law on heroin. He buys it from a dealer using a junkie to be sure a sensitive bourgeois artiste as an intermediary. He even gets a nod a wink and a pat on the shoulder from a friendly bourgeois wannabe cop. The cop is understood to be sensitive as well. Tough but sensitive. What can he do? It's the barbarians who are bringing heroin into Canada just like they flew airplanes into those vertical factories in NYC. If he arrests the Turks the Lebanese take over the Lebanese get arrested and are replaced by Iraqis. What can a pocop do? It's a barbarian invasion. You shrug and try to control the traffic at a low level.Meanwhile during the flick leftwing ideas are pilloried as the province of the naive and stupidespecially Canada's version of National Health Care. Hell the dying professor was a leftwinger in his youth. He eventually saw the lighthis copy of THE GULAG ARCHIPELIGO is prominently displayed in his old hideaway apartment for sexual liason. He and others ramble on about their stupidities during the sixties watching films by French New Wave directors reading Trotsky and Mao. The Situationistes even get derogatory mention. Thus a thousand ideologically leftwing strawmen fall on their swords.The acting in the film is good sometimes superb especially that of the heroin addict cum sensitive artiste. She falls in love with the sensitive rich stockbroking son who in turn will soon marry another woman. The implication like father like son resonates as their parting sorrow is reflected upon by the son who on the airplane contemplates his inevitable return to Montreal for his own sexual liasons with Madame l'artiste. The scenes shot in rural Quebec are beautiful. And the idea of friendship and solidarity to the end is one which has real moral substance. It is unfortunate that this ideal is put in service of a kind of faux aristocratic sensibility and the commodified romanticism of the current economic slump.".

Besides being more or less ignored by her family used that Tomlin simply have to take care of them she has other serious threats that don't involve cats and spiders but something far more dangerous  humans. Along with quite inane plot everything is exaggerated this is not a kind loving family but a bunch of spoiled brats throwing tantrums husband and his colleagues are more concerned with profit Mexican maid is non stop dancing and even neighbors are more concerned about giving interviews than actually giving Tomlin support. Any normal person would pack her bags long ago and run away but Tomlin  being good wife and selfsacrificing mother  totters on even as her steps became smaller and smaller. It sounded as a good idea on the paper but is not really funny perhaps because main character is simply not likable enough  Tomlin is great comedian when given chance to be wicked but as a perpetually serving housewife she is simply annoying only once she appears as rude telephone operator Ernestine and that minute lightens up the screen. Perhaps great fun for teenagers who delight in obvious jokes but not particularly involving as movie experience and sadly very far from thrill of 1957. original.".

Besides being more or less ignored by her family used that Tomlin simply have to take care of them she has other serious threats that don't involve cats and spiders but something far more dangerous  humans. Along with quite inane plot everything is exaggerated this is not a kind loving family but a bunch of spoiled brats throwing tantrums husband and his colleagues are more concerned with profit Mexican maid is non stop dancing and even neighbors are more concerned about giving interviews than actually giving Tomlin support. Any normal person would pack her bags long ago and run away but Tomlin  being good wife and selfsacrificing mother  totters on even as her steps became smaller and smaller. It sounded as a good idea on the paper but is not really funny perhaps because main character is simply not likable enough  Tomlin is great comedian when given chance to be wicked but as a perpetually serving housewife she is simply annoying only once she appears as rude telephone operator Ernestine and that minute lightens up the screen. Perhaps great fun for teenagers who delight in obvious jokes but not particularly involving as movie experience and sadly very far from thrill of 1957. original.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fun fact this was Joel Schumacher's directorial debut. Yep that's right way before we got ultra campy neon lit Batman movies we got this a campy excessively colourful romp based of course on the Richard Matheson novel 'The Shrinking Man'. Yeah I know exactly what you're thinking I'd never heard of this movie either well judging by the films poster it doesn't look like anybody gave it much hope frankly holy cheeseballs!So I think we know what's gonna happen here don't we. An everyday woman leading an everyday life falls afoul of a bizarre accident that causes her to slowly shrink down to a microscopic size. In this case its not a nuclearatomic bomb scenario its not a mad experiment and its got nothing to do with potions and magic. In this movie the protagonist suffers from a serve reaction to an experimental perfume her husband is working on along with various other household things. So yes...OK it is about a weird experiment but its not military based. Unfortunately despite the fact they have clearly tried to move away from the old formulaic notions that have surrounded previous movies like this this new concept is really quite daft. Sure the entire notion of shrinking to the size of an ant is daft but...as a result of a perfume?? couldn't think of anything a bit better? What's even more ludicrous is the fact that despite it being a perfumehousehold products related accident and perfumehousehold products being a relatively innocent and unexciting plot device they still manage to cram in a few nasty whitecoat scientist types because of course the perfume company gets taken over in part by dubious sources wanting to work out the shrinking mystery for their own dubious plans. Everything is entirely predictable of course you know once Kramer starts to shrink their will be the media hype to content with the humiliation the rubbernecking etc...Along with that you know at some point evil people will try to kidnap her for their evil ways obviously shrinking people around the world or their own armies and there will be some kind of adventurous escape from a nasty old lab etc...Didn't really expect anything too mind blowing in all honesty naturally this will take on many elements of the original source material they have tried to go in a new direction but I'm just not sure if this was the right way.I'm still not really sure what the colour schemepalette was about here either. All the sets costumes cars props everything is an array of soft outlandish pastel colours that range from anything and everything. Think 'Dick Tracy' 'Miami Vice' or the 50's suburban housing estate in 'Edward Scissorhands' but in really really extreme camp colours. The weird thing were the outfits everybody wears its was like some kind of retro 50's 70's 80's mishmash with suits in emerald green with bright pink ties etc...I'm guessing Schumacher wanted to create some kind of timeless hybrid that has never existed a fantasy America where everything is kinda perfect but scratch beneath the surface and its actually just like reality. Another odd thing was the usage of Lily Tomlin as multiple characters. Now I'm assuming this was down to her comedic background as others have done the same thing the problem is others have done it way better. The silly thing was you can clearly tell its Tomlin there is no real effort to not make her look any different so in that sense its not really funny or clever an Eddie Murphy challenge this is not. I might add her various characters aren't exactly very different from each other...and did I mention she isn't funny?Effects wise the movie does hold its own well and this is mainly down to the old old use of large scale props and sets. Tomlin looks great within the oversized sets and the forced perspective illusion it just never fails to win that old trick. Naturally there are some hokey bluescreen moments but that can't really be helped. The best thing about the movie effects wise is easily Rick Baker and his gorilla suit. Now if you know your movies and special effects wizards then you know Baker has a gorilla fetish a fetish he explores deeply here. Not only is his suit excellent in detail and movement but Baker actually plays the gentle giant too. Think the gorilla from 'Trading Places' only better. The only stupid thing about that along with all the other stupid stuff is at the end the Kramer family decide to keep the gorilla as a pet because that won't cause any problems will it do I see a gorilla based sequel with hilarious gorilla shrinking antics??..no.Yeah so this was a pretty mixed bag really. The visuals are undoubtedly lovely to look at in places very colourful and cheerful good designs and creativity but it doesn't really make much sense why its like that. The comedy is so so the action and adventure is so so the acting is unsurprisingly so so despite having a darn good lineup of old stars and the finale is too sickly. Everything gets wrapped up in a nice harmless bow with literately every character there to witness it because...I dunno. Why does she shrink so rapidly right at the end? and why or how does the chemical spillage bring her back to normal size?? Meh its a family movie heavy on lighthearted tomfoolery and nothing more don't question it.510".

	schema:reviewBody "If I were still a child I would perhaps give it a higher score but from what I remember it did get a bit lame at times and the effects while good for a kid would not stand up as well now. Still it was a funny movie about a woman whose husband is like with an ad office or with a company that makes a lot of different products. Whatever he was his job made it so his wife came into contact with a lot of different products which in turn causes her to start to become smaller and smaller. At first there are just a few subtle signs like her appearance at a window but soon it becomes very apparent. While she gets shorter and shorter she gains the attention of a rather dangerous person and ends up imprisoned. The film for the most part is funny kind of strange turns here and there such as the monkey but hey it was never meant to be a serious film. It does though get a bit to dark in the end for the type of movie it was up until that point. Still Lily Tomlin is great in the lead role as the shrinking woman and Charles Grodin does an admirable job as the father though it is a role he can do in his sleep.".

Whatever he was his job made it so his wife came into contact with a lot of different products which in turn causes her to start to become smaller and smaller.

	schema:reviewBody "The presence of the hysterically funny Lily Tomlin holds together this comic spoof of the 1957 scifi classic The Incredible Shrinking Man utilizing a stereotypical stayathome sitcom mom to be the victim of some chemically induced poison that makes her shrink away. Lily plays her extremely passive character with such gentility that you know she's fighting inside to not scream but with the presence of Lily as her more aggressive Judith Beasley character and a brief appearance by the hysterically obnoxious Ernestine Tomlin gets to unleash her inner strength that would never have her staying at home baking cookies and doing her kid's laundry on a daily basis. She's married to Charles Grodin who works for the local product factory that puts out products like canned cheese in an aerosol bottle. There's more questions than answers here especially since it is obvious that she gets a dosage of the chemical that shrinks her while in the car with her children and especially why as she shrinks nobody thinks to fire the stereotypically lazy Spanish maid Maria Smith who watches her novellas while Tomlin seems to do all the chores. If this succeeds in any ways it is through the calm manner that Tomlin holds in her frustrations as she shrinks to the size of a dollhouse is held captive in an underground compound and finds support in both a friendly gorilla and the stereotypical dumb assistant who can either help her prove how this organization wants to shrink the bulk of the world or report her and save himself at the expense of civilization. It is also a commentary on the number of artificial products America became used to in order to save time for the busy housewife or career woman and a warning of how industry can end up controlling our lives if we don't watch it. There are some very funny scenes of how Tomlin deals with her shrinking size being attacked in her children's closet of now very large toys especially a urinating doll that has more water pressure for her than any shower could ever hope to. At times it seems like it is also trying to be too much of a commercial for products that helped sponsor the movie although the scene of the babbity neighbors yelling commercial slogans at her as she drives down the culdesac is very funny. The conclusion indicated that there might have been plans for a sequel but that unfortunately never occured.".

Charles Grodin is cast as the harried husband struggling to accept his wifes' diminishing size as a fact of life Ned Beatty is Grodins' sleazy boss.Partly a spoof of the classic Richard Matheson story The Incredible Shrinking Man this wacky 1980s fantasy functions mainly as a satire of rampant consumerism. As such it's far from being subtle and is a little hard to stick with at first due to it being so chaotic. But Tomlin never more appealing is the glue to hold it all together. She's terrific her other roles are neighborhood busybody Judith Beasley and her classic telephone operator character. Grodin is in fine form and Beatty is a hoot. The villains are played by the likes of Henry Gibson Elizabeth Wilson and John Glover and they're all good. Shelby Balik and Justin Dana are cute as Pats' kids. But the man who deserves a special shoutout is makeup effects ace and multiple Oscar winner Rick Baker who hilariously endearingly plays a gorilla named Sidney.Written by Jane Wagner and directed by Joel Schumacher his feature filmmaking debut this was admittedly never quite as funny as this viewer would have liked but it was still hard to dislike. It does work towards a priceless farcical finale. The special effects are quite amusing throughout and those color schemes in Pats' house are offbeat to put it one way.Reasonably entertaining overall.Six out of 10.".

Here she has to carry the entire load and the results just aren't as satisfying. Tomlin plays a suburban housewife who suddenly begins to shrink presumably from a combination of household chemicals and products that her husband's firm has marketed. The whole thing is symbolic for how women are somehow diminished by the world around them. Excessive commercialism suburban sameness housekeepers taking over duties of parents etc... etc... etc. The whole concept ends up taking a backseat to sight gags involving Tomlin climbing around on expanded sets depicting household rooms and appliances. Some of these are quite interesting.The film tries but the message just isn't as sharp as we'd hope. Many characters also spend the majority of their screen time shouting and acting zany and this doesn't help. Satire sometimes slips into madcap comedy when the director this time Joel Schumacher doesn't keep a tight enough hold on things. And I don't think I can buy this premise on an idealistic level. How does an increased variety of consumer goods diminish the role of a housewife? I think it might do just the opposite. She may now be empowered to find just the right things her family needs. Now I do certainly get the part about the Hispanic housekeeper taking over the role of mother. You look at this house and it clearly doesn't seem big enough to need a housekeeper if the wife has no job. Was this a swipe at Californians who think having a maidhousekeeper is some sort of status symbol especially if they don't need one? Perhaps. Anyway the film is loud and the production VERY much a sign of the early 1980s. Charles Grodin and Ned Beatty provide their usual solid support and Tomlin does her best in multiple roles. The film just doesn't get its point across and maybe it doesn't have a very good point to make in the first place. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

The plot about a wealthy teen Yelchin goes to a new public high school and ingratiates himself into its social fabric by using his charm to become the school's resident psychiatrist is good its like a glimpse of how teenagers live nowadays. The cast composed entirely by young actors with the exception of Downey Jr. is good and they acted well. Robert Downey was good Anton Yelchin in the role of Charlie his performance was great. He was a excellent complement for Downey Jr. The rest of the cast like Kat Dennings and Hope Davis were a great support for the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're pining for a modern John Hughes type teen comedy such as Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off then Charlie Bartlett would certainly fit the bill. It's like an antiAmerican Pie. The teens are not obsessed with sex it has heart and even a few dramatic elements. It's not as funny as American Pie type movies but that's not the point. Charlie Bartlett is basically a goodhearted very smart rich kid expelled from all his previous private schools who wants to be popular and becomes a kind of psychiatrist for his fellow classmates in a normal public high school.The actor portraying him did a remarkable job showing his eccentricities while keeping him likable and sweet despite his less than legal actions. I'm not quite sure how likely such a character would be in real life but he's certainly interesting. I also enjoyed the other teens portrayed most being twodimensional instead of onedimensional caricatures and wish there had been more washroom confessionals. Robert Downey Jr is once again wonderful as a loving father and tormented principal who's not completely evil as in most movies of this type. I liked the understated uncomplicated romantic aspect and it kind of made me wish for first love again although I've seen this done better in several other movies. Overall it's a charming teen movie not overtly reallife melodramatic nor overtly overthetop ridiculous as we rarely see in this cynical 21st century. It's a good rental and a decent purchase if you like high school dramatic comedies.Rating 7 out of 10".

But Jon Poll directing from a Gustin Nash script takes on the task and turns in a hybrid of a film that is so incredibly engaging you'll wonder why few filmmakers take on such a challenge. The audience was so loud and boisterous at the World Premiere screening at the Tribeca Film Festival that it sent the laugh meter off the scale.Anton Yelchin is Charlie Bartlett a kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth and an enterprising albeit mischievous brain. His antics get him kicked out of one private school after another. But his clever and earnest sincerity is bound to hit the target sooner or later and it does when he is thrown to the public school wolves. The scheme he invents to endear himself to the student body is nothing short of genius and his performance fits the bill.Yelchin has made a name for himself playing the smart sensitive and innocent tortured kid. Here he gets the chance to stretch his acting chops in a completely different direction. He's confident and anything but vulnerable. The wide range of emotions and the talents he shows here are unsurpassed. He sings he dances he plays piano he does physical comedy and has fight scenes and romantic scenes and just about everything that could be thrown at him. And he looks to be so thoroughly enjoying it which comes across on screen and proves to be so central to the film. After all to enjoy a film one must identify somewhat with the protagonist or at least like him and Anton does that better than many actors twice his age.Hope Davis is a riot as his notquiteallthere mother. It's easy to see the source of Charlie's quirkiness. The relationship between mother and son is playful and mischievous the kind of mom as best friend scenario which often results in tragedy. Here it's played just for laughs and it works. She is everymom  with a twist of lemon.Tyler Hilton is perfectly cast as the bully who we know from the start is destined to soften up somewhere along the way. That's what movie bullies do. But he brings an especially charming quality to the role which plays perfectly against Charlie's leanings toward the dark side. It's a delicate balance but Yelchin and Hilton make it work.Robert Downey Jr. is ironically cast as the substanceaddled principal who also happens to be the father of Charlie's love interest. One has to wonder whether Principal Gardner or Downey is speaking in some of the more poignant scenes about alcohol and drugs. It's chilling. Perhaps for that reason alone he is a standout here.Kat Dennings plays the girl who is out to win Charlie's heart. The dynamic with Downey and Yelchin is a natural source of drama. This is the film's most heartfelt storyline and Dennings is admirably up to the task.At times it all feels so real and it's no wonder  writer Gustin Nash actually continued to write scenes and dialogue specifically for those actors after the film got underway and it shows.Charlie Bartlett has the look and feel of a studio film which should help it find an audience. The subject matter demands an R rating if only for its content. But it's a film kids need to see. The message is squarely aimed at teens even younger ones and parents need to take heed. In the guise of a comedy a good one at that Charlie Bartlett has something meaningful to say about the excuses we use to justify our behavior and the chemical coping methods so many of us cling to. And it's dmn funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Bartlett is a comedy film about Charlie a rich kid who drops out of a private high school and experiences culture shock after enrolling into a public school. After being an outcast for a few days he gains popularity by setting up a dubious enterprise that distributes medical drugs around the school. At the same time he discovers that he has an ability to counsel and give advice to other students. Their problems include substance abuse depression and identity crisis. It turns out that the adults also have problems of their own. Charlie soon learns that things are not as simple as he originally expected.The acting is the best aspect of the film. Anton Yelchin fits perfectly as Charlie. He has the ideal attitude and personality for the role. The gestures and facial expressions are spot on. This makes for an extremely likable and charismatic main character. For most of the film Principal Gardner serves as Charlie's opposition. Robert Downy Jr. does a terrific job as Gardner conveying a wide range of emotions that makes you truly sympathize him. The rest of the cast mostly other students in the school are likable in their own ways. Despite their personal flaws you can see a change in most although not all of them throughout the film.The plot has some good ideas in it. It carries some great messages about our personal and social lives. I would have liked to see some of the plot lines carried further. For example the story surrounding Charlie's father is very artificial and felt like it was tagged on simply to make Charlie look more imperfect. With a little imagination a whole lot more could have been done with it. Also it felt like the conclusion did not implement all the ideas together.The dialog and writing was a mixed result. Generally it was good and even excelled at some moments. But there were other parts that seemed too over the top or plain silly. Granted it was walking a thin line between comedy and drama but it could have felt more realistic.I hope I don't sound too critical because I enjoyed Charlie Bartlett and would definitely watch it again. The characters were good and the plot was interesting. It has more substance than the usual comedy. If IMDb's voting scales were more incremented it would perfectly fit in as a 7.510. A good comedy to start the year off don't hesitate to check it out.".

Still I trust that there are those of you have seen the movie on TV or DVD or even on the prehistoric VHS. Well the smallbudget diamond in the dust movie of the year borrows heavily from it taking both old and new material and making it into something fresh. This hidden gem is Charlie Bartlett. Charlie Bartlett is the story of a young high school student with roots in royalty. Seemingly destined for a posh life he constantly finds himself in situations involving expulsions due to fraud hundreds of fake I.D.s given to schoolmates for example. Soon Charlie has been kicked out of nearly every private school within 100 miles of his housemansion. With no alternatives left Charlie quickly finds himself attending a public school with regular everyday students. From here he decides the only way to fit in is to become a lord of sorts and begins handing out prescription drugs to those students truly in need with no way of getting them while playing the role of psychiatrist. Of course this bears consequences in the form of the principleAnd said principle's daughter.An intelligent and witty movie Charlie Bartlett is this generations Ferris Bueller. From the smooth careless main character to the parents being completely exaggerated in every manner it all fits. The dialogue flows well and is witty throughout. Many teens will walk out thinking That's not how teens talk! Well take it from a teen. There are those out there who would rather die than be seen writing out Lyke Omg I luv ur new shoez!.Now the acting. Easily the best part of the movie and also the weakest link. Up and coming actor Anton Yelchin Alpha Dog plays the role perfectly never missing a beat. He plays happy and carefree when he needs to but the next second he's so smug you want to smack him. It's perfection in the form of a teen. And of course we have Robert Downey Jr. Zodiac Iron Man gracing the screen in the form of Principle Gardner. The chemistry between the two hits every note and doesn't waver for a minute. But where perfection is seen flaws are even more defined. Next to the two leads many of the actors filling in the smaller roles seem to almost be trying to match them. And it doesn't come off well with overacting filling many scenes. Still do not let it perturb you as the powerful presentations easily overshadow the lesser ones. My only nitpick in the movie that really took anything out of the movie It was very obviously written by middle aged men trying to put themselves in the shoes of teens. In places it worked but in others it came across as very forced and unrealistic. The school is very paint by the numbers. Let blue represent jocks play out red as the airheaded cheerleaders and throw yellow in for the geeks and you can paint a portrait of clich.All this being said the movie has its up and downs. Depending on your mood this movie could be for you. If you're looking for a smart movie with witty dialogue and good acting and are willing to temporarily suspend everything you know of high school this movies for you. Otherwise for those more plot less action oriented movie fans Well there's always Jumper.4 out of 5 starsWords  599".

	schema:reviewBody "'Charlie Bartlett' follows 17 year old rich boy loner Charlie Bartlett Anton Yechlin. He doesn't have any friends and gets kicked out of numerous private schools. He is addicted to trouble and challenging authority. The main point behind that is that his father was arrested for tax evasion sending his mother into a manically depressed state. Charlie was then forced to take care for his mother thus having no one to look after himself he was an adult before he even became a teenager. You later find out that he hates his father for this stealing his childhood.Charlie is kicked out of his last private school the reason this time is for making fake ID's he is then sent to a public school. Right when he arrives you see the typical clicks in an all too fake montage the pot heads skaters jocks and outcasts. He is greeted by no one except a mentally unstable mongoloid named Len Arbuckle. He becomes friends with Len and people start to notice that Charlie is not like them. You are then exposed to other characters Principal Gardnes Robert Downey Jr. his daughter Susan Kat Dennings and the school bully Murphy Bivens Tyler Hilton. Charlie runs with an unusual crowd that is for sure.Next in the story is a loner named Kip Crombwell Mark Rendall who asks Charlie if he can get him prescription drugs after a fiasco involving a school dance and Ritalin. Charlie of course agrees all he really cares about is becoming popular and fitting in for once. The word then gets out about this little drug cartel Charlie has in his power. He and Murphy start to to get medication for all the kids at the school. Charlie runs a little psychiatrist office out of one of the boys' bathrooms. He asks the kids their problems then recites them to his own psychiatrist thus getting the drugs.The story is good it lacks certain qualities that just don't seem believable but then again this is a high school comedy those traits aren't required. Anton Yechlin is great as Charlie Bartlett it shows that this young kid has potential. I envisioned the film to be this dark teen comedy but it turned into a quirky film about the high school body and drug abuse. The two surprisingly worked damn well together.Hope Davis plays Charlie's neurotic mother. Her performance is the best in the film. She is so estranged from reality by her own medication that she seems like Charlie's daughter. She plays with the same quirkiness Kim Darby did as John Cusack's mother in the film 'Better Off Dead...'. The other adult in the film is Robert Downey Jr. He plays an alcoholic school principal. He also is a fan of boats. Look for some great scenes with him and Yechlin in the end of the movie.All in all this a great representation of what high school is like for certain kids in their certain clicks it tackles these topics with witty dialog and humor. For the most part it works but sometimes in the few serious scenes the shouldn't have flipped the humor switch back on so fast.See this movie Friday it's the first great movie of the year.MY RATING 8.010.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Bartlett is this generation's Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's a sweet uplifting comingofage film that had some social messages and can very well be a true story at most high schools. Granted this is not the best teen film but for what it is it's good and often compelling despite the story skipping around a lot.Jon Poll's film is about a rich guy who has been expelled from every private school so he is enrolled in a public school. Being unpopular at first he changes that once he becomes the unofficial psychiatrist in the bathroom stall administering drugs. There he receives the negative attention of Principal Gardner and the positive attention of his daughter Susan.The acting is pretty good. Anton Yelchin delivers a solid performance as Charlie and is pretty convincing. However the show belongs to Downey Jr. This is his last film before his complete comeback with Iron Man but he is excellent as the alcoholic Principal Gardner.Overall this is not the perfect teen film but it manages to deliver a touching story that will ring true to many high schoolcollege kids out there. It's smartly written and has some fine dialog. The story sometimes skips over the place but if you can catch up it's no big deal. I rate this film 910.".

	schema:headline " Young Anton Yelchin creates an interesting role.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about high school students but it isn't really a movie for kids that age. It has a bit darker theme and unfortunately treats sex among high school students very casually. I believe it gives a harmful message in that respect.But looking beyond that it is a very interesting and entertaining movie. Anton Yelchin is rich kid Charlie Bartlett and as the story begins he gets kicked out of yet another private school. This forces him to go to a public high school. His first day he decides to ride the bus so maybe he will fit in better but he goes dressed in his slacks blazer and a tie. Not too cool. So he gets picked on from the start.But all Charlie wants is to be popular and all of his schemes seem to revolve around that concept. At his new school he stumbles upon a way to become popular and off he goes. But not without more trouble ahead. Hope Davis is his mother Marilyn Bartlett. Interestingly she also played Yelchin's mother some years ago in Hearts in Atlantis with Anthony Hopkins. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as the high school Principal Nathan Gardner. He clearly struggles with trying to keep the students in line. He doesn't like troublemakers. And coincidentally he is the father of female student Kat Dennings as Susan Gardner. Charlie and Susan are destined to be together and that results in much of the drama as the story unfolds. Tyler Hilton is good as the bully Murphey Bivens who initially gives Charlie lots of grief but later teams up with him.SPOILERS Charlie seems to be a naturally gifted businessman and also a very good listener. His dad is not present serving prison time for tax evasion. But Charlie's business enterprises are illegal. In private school he was making very good fake IDs. In his new school he realizes he can become popular by holding office hours in the boys bathroom he and the patient sitting in adjacent stalls just listening and talking to them. But when he goes to various doctors with fake emotional problems to get various prescription medicines to sell to the students he went way too far and also illegal. The story plays out there is the conflict with the principal who gets fired in the process but Charlie it seems finally learns that he doesn't have to try so hard to be friends and that channeling his energy into legal productive activities is the best way to live.".

The principal played by Robert Downey Jr has his own mental health issues and this is an interesting plot twist rather like Ferris Bueller's Day Off.There are engaging performances from Anton Yelchin and Robert Downey Jr. They are fun to watch. I would like to see more from Anton. Kat Dennings and Hope Davis give interesting performances but their characters are not as rich.The first half of the movie where Charlie has problems and needs to solve them is far more interesting than when he is solving other people's problems. I did like the Kip Crombwell suicide episode. This movie could have used some punched up dialog. It makes me appreciate Diablo Cody's Juno. The end was embarrassingly sappy.

Honestly every aspect of it is done with intelligence care and humor. It is without a doubt one of the better films that is going to be released in 2007.You will not see a movie that is casted better. The performances are pitch perfect and there is not a moment that feels false. All the actors from the ones with just a few scenes to the leads are fantastic. The script is excellent moving from the hilarious to the serious with the kind of humanity that makes it all fit together. The director performs a brilliant restrained job of bringing this movie together in a way that makes himself invisible. Seamless.I think that this film will appeal to everyone from age 12 and up. Grandparents parents kids... everyone will get it. The themes and characters are that human and the humor is real and personal.See it.See it.There are so very few movies that are this good and this will probably be a small release. It deserves to be seen by all.See it twice.".

Ha ha. This is so funny.I gave it a three because it had some good moments  but the cruft around the good is just so awful.This should have been caught in the editing stage.

	schema:reviewBody "This film infuriated me enough that I'm not certain I can write sensibly about it. So forgive me if I begin to rant. The thing is this movie blatantly rips off several movies that I love including Harold And Maude Pump Up The Volume Some Kind Of Wonderful Sixteen Candles Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Rushmore. It is not an homage to these films. It's simple thievery. And not done by an adept thief but by an amateur. Meaning the thievery doesn't even work.The song If You Want To Sing Out Sing Out was written by Cat Stevens specifically for the film Harold And Maude one of only two songs written for that film the other being Don't Be Shy. In this film it's used twice the first time as a duet on the piano just as it's used the first time in Harold And Maude which is annoying enough. But the second time it doesn't fit at all. It's used to end a play  a play that is supposed to be controversial by the way but which clearly isn't  written by a student. So Gustin Nash has the student be a thief as well  this poor suicidal character the suicide attempt incidentally is straight out of Pump Up The Volume as is Charlie Bartlett's speech near the end and his subsequent arrest  in fact as he is put into the back of the police car in slow motion I couldn't help but turn to my friends and say Talk hard. So the play within the film ends with a song stolen from a much better film  but doesn't fit at all. Also they didn't get the lyrics right but that's insignificant when compared to the larger problems of this movie.If you do decide to see this film I suggest a way to enjoy it shout out the title of the movie each scene is stealing from. I'll give you a hint. When the movie begins  and I mean the second it starts  shout out Rushmore. You'll be ahead of the game.The first scene is the first scene from Rushmore. A teenager's fantasy about standing in front of his peers being successful and leading the way  and then getting shaken out of his reverie by a teacher. Actually the first several scenes are from Rushmore. The boy gets kicked out of private school ends up in public school but still wears the blazer with the private school emblem on it.But Gustin Nash is not content to steal from just Harold And Maude and Rushmore. We're soon introduced to the bully from Some Kind Of Wonderful and  surprise surprise  he and the main character become friends. And he like Elias Koteas in the better film has hidden artistic talent. He can act. So like in Rushmore the bully is in the play at the end of the film. We also have the scene from Sixteen Candles where a couple leave a dance to go sit in the backseat of broken car within the building. Of course before that we're treated to the school bus ride from Sixteen Candles. That reminds me. There is a school bus sign to let Charlie Bartlett know where to catch the bus yet no one else gets on at that stop. So why was the sign there? Did the bus always stop there even when there were no students? Or did they just put the sign up that day for him?Well this movie is not the worst film I've ever seen. There is actually some good acting in it especially by Kat Dennings as Susan Charlie's love interest and Tyler Hilton as the bully. And of course Hope Davis is always good. And Robert Downey Jr. an actor I love does the best he can with the material  but he does fall flat in several scenes particularly a horrible scene involving him waving a gun around next to his pool. I could go on for several pages about all that is wrong with that scene but I won't. Because I hope by now I've convinced you to stay far away from this film. Don't let this amateur thief have a hit. Let him fade quietly away.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought the ads for this film looked fairly promising and the fact that it was rated R seemed to indicate that it wasn't going to be another teengeared PG13 comedy. When I saw that Robert Downey Jr. was in the cast I was even more interested in seeing it.And in all fairness the first twenty minutes or so are really good. The film is a little too smug and indie for its own good note to aspiring filmmakers stop trying to imitate Wes Anderson he's not that good. But it quickly goes downhill once Charlie Bartlett the protagonist heads off to school.The problem is the characters  they're not very realistic and that hurts the credibility of the film. Charlie is meant to be precocious and a bit of an outcast but he actually just comes across as being very creepy  something about the performance by Anton Yelchin made me very uncomfortable. I liked it at first but as his character begins to become more confident he becomes incredibly unlikable and that's a problem when we're supposed to like the main character. The film is clearly inspired in this regard by Ferris Bueller and you can see the similarities in Charlie but he doesn't contain any of the charm or wit of Ferris he comes across as an imitator with a really demented side. And perhaps part of the awkwardness comes from Yelchin's distinctly unAmerican demeanor which doesn't contrast very well against the film's whole American message it's a comment on how fixated America has become on drugs and medication. There's just something off with Yelchin's act that I couldn't quite place my finger on but by the end of the film I really hated him and I was sympathizing more with Downey's character.Tyler Hilton gives a good performance as a school bully but he's dealing with an incredibly onedimensional and laughably unrealistic character he is introduced as a onedimensional bully who beats kids up but he has a rapid change of heart and suddenly becomes a nice guy. The message behind this transformation is admirable but it's hilariously naive and quite ridiculous.The rest of the high school is a blur of clichs and faceless masses  Charlie suddenly becomes very popular because of his psychiatric advice and prescriptions he hands out to classmates but apart from one character his eventual girlfriend and Downey's daughter all the high schoolers are handled poorly and there's never much of a gradual change in Bartlett's popularity he just becomes universally loved by his schoolmates overnight.Ultimately the film is amusing in parts but taken as a whole and because of its reliance upon an unlikable and frankly incredibly irritating main character it really falls apart. Downey's performance is great but it's buried by its surroundings he isn't given room to expand and all the clichs and faceless characters that comprise this film really dampen the impact of the better moments  because Charlie Bartlett does have moments of greatness but they're all too brief to excuse the uncountable flaws.".

	schema:headline " The little amount of good is spoiled by a horribly unbalanced and unoriginal whole";
	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Bartlett tells the story of a rich kid played by Anton Yelchin who seems to have problems staying at any one private school. After being thrown out from another one his mother Marilyn Hope Davis sends him to a normal public high school and there he continues to cause trouble only after becoming a pseudopsychiatrist and friend to many of the school's students.I was not expecting much from Charlie Bartlett and I did not get much. Right off the bat the film begins to feel like a rehash of every high school movie ever made only worse. It has a few clever and obvious homages here and there but for the most part it seems to have taken all of the best parts and mishmashed them together into an incohesive whole. The first time Charlie walks onto the public school campus we are thrown head first into every possible clich and stereotype of high school students there are and then some. And as the movie continues it never even bothers to address these issues or try to say anything new about them other than to tell the audience that even teenagers have psychologically traumatic issues they are not given a chance to deal with.What becomes worse is how ridiculous the film gets. I am not sure if I went to a sheltered or preppy suburban high school but I doubt anyone would get away with smoking in the hallways. There is a rather involving subplot about the issue of cameras being placed in a student zone and how upsetting this is to the students. But if we are to assume this story is being played out in contemporary times why are these students so upset? Why is one student so distraught that he feels the sheer idea of metal detectors and random locker searches is out of the ordinary? Is this school so violence and drug free other than the marijuana the stoners smoke and the pills Charlie is handing out left and right without any of the staff taking notice that they really do not already have at least some of these preventative measures in place? Its lack of realism in the current age seems to be a big problem and leads more credence to the film being an outright fantasy rather than an actual take on high school life like its much stronger brethren.The story is also a bit of a problem. The general storyline of the film is nothing too extravagant and really does not do much for it other than to help further make some of the events rather unbelievable and borderline ridiculous. The subplots that infest it however do even less. They seem to pop up and are either answered rather quickly or are left hanging waiting for a resolution that never comes or comes so softly and easily that you wonder why it was worth mentioning in the first place. It is not that the movie is confusing it just feels convoluted under the weight of what it is trying to accomplish and the point it is trying to make. Screenwriter Gustin Nash just does not seem to have an idea of what he wants the film to say. He compensates by adding some drama here and there but the poignancy that some scenes try to make seems to be lost among all of the uselessness at work here.I did like and was rather surprised by the film's language. When I saw the trailer I was expecting the typical PGPG13 teen film that has characters using language completely untrue to the typical high school. Here the students swear and smoke all they want and it actually felt a lot more true to what high school life actually looks like although my school never had a student lounge. That part of the film caught me quite off guard and I think for all the problems that plague it the language helps give the film a bit more of the realistic tinge missing from the story. There was a bit too much smoking I thought especially out of one specific obligatory rebel character but on the whole made it seem more like a real high school. The use of Cat Steven's If You Want to Sing Out Sing Out from Harold and Maude was a nice touch but probably a bit too obscure for the majority of these students.Yelchin as Bartlett is a bit of a convoluted piece himself. On one hand he does very well for himself making his character believable and genuine. But on the other he just does not seem right for the role. It works as a bit of a balancing issue throughout the entire film and it does not help that his character seems to be every bit of a blender mix of Max Fischer Ferris Bueller and Jim Stark all at once. It looks like Yelchin was given very little direction in how to make the character feel genuine and different for the entirety of the film as opposed to minuscule little sections.The rest of the supporting cast is rather mixed. Davis does really good for herself but her character is barely in the movie and her motivations are only briefly explored. Kat Dennings Tyler Hilton Mark Rendall and Dylan Taylor all do okay as Charlie's classmates but seem to be playing off of prechiseled archetypes done much better in other films Rendall's Murphy for one was a whole lot better when he was played by Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club. Robert Downey Jr. as the principal with problems of his own is probably the best thing about the movie but his work is clouded within the messy whole and is really hard to appreciate.Charlie Bartlett despite good intentions is just not that great. A lack of originality and offbalanced performances only weaken the film further.310.".

He's rehabilitated when he meets Maude an elderly Holocaust survivor.Directed by Jon Poll and based on a screenplay by Gustin Nash Charlie Bartlett references Harold and Maude several times. Like Ashby's film it also revolves around a depressed teenager with a wealthy but absent father. In this case his name is Charlie Anton Yelchin a mopey teen who moves into a new highschool. Here he meets hundreds of kids who like him struggle to cope with various pressures and problems. Charlie helps them all by starting a psychiatrist's booth in a school bathroom.Screenwriter Gustin Nash's father is a psychiatrist. Nash's script though uses psychiatry to make a larger point a damaged generation of adults have abandoned a damaged generation of kids. In Charlie Bartlett these kids metaphorically become their own therapists at best at worst their own selfmedicators. Adults remain on the sidelines watching as kids run damage control.Madness is not a natural but a political category philosopher Mark Fisher once wrote what is needed now is a politicization of much more common disorders. Whilst Charlie Bartlett is honest about teenage despair suicide addiction authoritarianism and the way in which society increasingly medicates for maladies it doesn't really touch upon the roots of such things. Where better teen comedies Ghost World Pump Up the Volume Harold and Muade delve into the systemic psychosocioeconomic causes of these problems Charlie Bartlett recoils. Teenage despair here is simply a result of being misunderstood andor unpopular.Charlie Bartlett stars Anton Yelchin in the titular role. Unconventionally cool his performance evokes the teen comedies of the 1980s Ferris Bueller's Day Off Say Anything The Sure Thing etc. Hope Davis plays Charlie's mother a woman who like all the adults in Nash's script hides behind addictions whilst her son is called upon to be an adult and so handle things which no kid should have to. Elsewhere Tyler Hilton plays a school bully his role subtly referencing 1979's Over the Edge another flick about abandoned teens. The film costars Robert Downey Junior  himself once an alcoholic  as an alcoholic school principal. A sultry Kat Dennings plays Bartlett's love interest.810  See Ghost World Pump Up The Volume The Spectacular Now The Perks of Being a Wallflower The King of Pigs Godard's Le Chinoise and Bresson's The Devil Probably.".

Cotton tells that when his wife Shanna Marcus had troubles in the delivery of their son Justin he prioritized the doctor help to God and since then he questions his faith. Further he tells that exorcisms are frauds but the results are good for the believers because they believe it is true. When Cotton is summoned by the farmer Louis Sweetzer to perform an exorcism in his daughter Nell Cotton sees the chance to prove to the documentary crew what he has just told. They head to Ivanwood and they have a hostile reception from Louis's son Caleb. Cotton performs the exorcism in Nell exposing his tricks to the camera but sooner they learn that the dysfunctional Sweetzer family has serious problems.";

	schema:headline " Score another one for handheld horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Cotton Marcus is a minister who performs fake exorcisms for money. Raised by his reverend father he has been doing this since he was a child but he has come to question his faith or whether he ever even truly had any at all. After reading about a kid who died during a botched exorcism Cotton decides to have a film crew document his final fake exorcism in an attempt to prove what a farce the whole thing is and prevent others from dying. The subject of the exorcism is Nell Sweetzer a teenage girl who lives with her father and brother in rural Louisiana. Things don't go as planned.I am incredibly fond of the handheld subgenre of horror that has become increasingly popular over the last decade. With the exception of The St. Francisville Experiment I have yet to see one that I've outright hated. Even George Romero's heavily maligned Diary of the Dead wasn't horrible though I did find it a disappointing effort overall. For me the first person point of view works like a charm in creating a more intimately frightening atmosphere. The Last Exorcism proves to be yet another example of this. The backwoods Louisiana locations are eerie enough to begin with but they're further magnified by the first person style. What we see is never said to be found footage either so the presence of a music score and the varying camera angles didn't bother me. I just see it as a film seen from the viewpoint of a documentary crew's camera not as if it were someone's found footage being shown to me.The Last Exorcism doesn't jump right into it's horror as it spends a fair amount of time on character development. That's always refreshing especially since the horror genre is so often devoid of it. It's also of particular importance here as Cotton's character arc really pays off in the end. The image of him walking towards the flames cross raised has been burned into my mind since watching this film. It's a potent moment all the more so due to the story's focus on character building. The acting is also most impressive and there isn't a bad performance in the bunch. Patrick Fabian truly reminded me of an actual preacher in spite of his character's stance for most of the picture. Ashley Bell was also fantastic as the girl possessed while Iris Bahr gives the film's most underrated performance as one of the documentarians. Louis Herthum does well as Nell's father but the fluctuations in his character bothered me. He seemed to jump from one conclusion to another too quickly and the scene of him chasing the crew around the house with his shotgun felt awkward. The writing for his character was my main issue with the film.When the horror does show up it's of the more subdued variety. Daniel Stamm focuses his film's scares more on the unnerving mood of the wooded area and the religious themes. Like the characters the mood is allowed to build. The exorcism scene in the barn isn't as overthetop as one might expect which is frankly something that I appreciated. The lack of outlandish effects and ridiculous hysterics was a plus rather than a minus. The quiet understated form of horror is almost always more effective than an in your face approach. As for the ending I'm firmly in the camp of being all for it. It was a wonderful little throwback to all the devil cult pictures of the 70's and it's clearly hinted at throughout the film. As mentioned earlier it also brings Cotton's character arc to it's pinnacle leading to that haunting shot foretold by Nell's drawing. Aside from the 70's cult influence you can also see shades of both The Blair Witch Project and Cannibal Holocaust in the ending.I must admit that I didn't expect much out of this one. It flew under my radar for a good while but I'm pleased to say that it wound up being a welcome highlight in a year that has been quite weak for the horror genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been reading the reviews and felt the need to clarify a few things in case you're reading these reviews debating whether or not to see this film.1. It is not the worst horror film ever. People who say something like that obviously have not seen enough horror films to know the worst ones. By no means is this movie a revolutionary breakthrough that will reinvigorate the horror genre but the film does a good job at making a decent exorcism movie documentarystyle.2. The video camera shaking is not that bad. Yes it shakes but that's the style of the movie. Get over it. If you don't like that style at all and are always made sick by it don't see it.3. To say the ending was ambiguous and left people missing the themes of the movie and therefore a bad choice is also a bit ridiculous. If you saw the movie Inception and still loved it despite the ambiguous feeling the film left you with and the obsessive pondering over what actually happened in the last dreams sequence then you can't complain at this ending which was NO WHERE near as complex. If you take a few minutes to work it out talk amongst your friends if need be the ending is not ambiguous at all.4. The filmmakers themselves never claim that this is actual footage. So stop worrying about how they found the camera footage in the first place. The filmmakers made a work of fiction and I'm sure they hope their audience understands this.I can't deal with all the critiques but to comment on the films good qualitiesIt does add a few different takes on the classic form of an exorcism film such as the documentarystyle the characters and particularly the ending.As far as scariness you have to understand the nature of what makes a good exorcism horror and good documentary horror the sluggish build up as many juvenile critics have termed it is everything. What makes these movies great is that you for a while forget you're in a horror movie and start to believe you're watching real events unfold. You can split hairs over how long the film needs to convince you that these people and situations are real but without it you have no movie or no good exorcismdocumentary horror film. With it's slower I wouldn't use sluggish beginning the film hopes to sincerely connect you with the characters and believable setups so that when bizarre events do occur you are more likely to sincerely accept them and be frightened by them. No the movie was not overwhelming scary. It doesn't go for cheap jump out moments maybe once or twice or CGI animations of demons popping out everywhere. But it does deliver a more realistic approach to child possession than most of its predecessors which is pretty scary.The ending is definitely a big moment for people's final judgment of the film because it goes in such a different direction from what the rest of the film points too. But as stated before it is not ambiguous. All I will say is keep an open mind and realize that this film though documentarystyled is still a work of fiction again as stated before. It took me a few moments to adjust once the ending was over but after some thought I didn't mind the twist. Could it have been better? Definitely. Am I outraged? No. The film makers just wanted to produce something a little different than the expected exorcism ending. Perhaps the biggest upset of the ending is that it detracts from majority of the film's atmosphere of realism.If you ARE a fan of exorcism movies and movies like the Blair Witch Project or even horror movies in general The Last Exorcism is a good watch to satisfy your boredom and keep you entertained for an hour and a half especially if you understand and like the construct of sluggish build up and if you have a few extra bucks that you're looking to spend.If your looking for a horror movie that will revive the horror genre for our time this isn't it. But the film isn't trying to be the next big name in horror so my rating is based off of the intentions of the film itself. Overall the movie did it's job in being mildly original having great acting considering that this is in fact a lowerbudget horror movie in staying true to the genre and in delivering an engaging story.".

What this turns out be is a fascinating suspense drama using exorcism as a narrative tool.I found the script to be very clever and entertaining. The main lead actor who plays the reverend is very charismatic and carries the whole movie. Admittedly the movie would be half of what it is without his performance. The other actors particularly the teenage victim who maybe possessed by a demon are very good too.What I didn't like most is the very end. It felt tacked on for the sake of living up to its misleading marketing. I can honestly say that if the film ended 10 minutes earlier I would have been totally satisfied with a complete film and was ready for the credits.However there are attempts to make you jump out of your seat but unfortunately these moments are too copy cat of the techniques used in Sixth Sense and similar. It may be effective to some but I feel it could have been done better and hence live up to the marketing hype after all! But those are small negatives. This is a movie very much worth watching if you don't hate mockumentary style films. Lower your expectations ignore the marketing and just enjoy a clever suspense drama. If you jump a few times then think of it as a bonus.".

	schema:headline " A solid frightener for Halloween if you let the film take you where it wants to take you";
	schema:reviewBody "Taking the pulse of a horrorloving film community in 2010 The Last Exorcism is like a document of pop culture history in its mix of marketing and aesthetics. Trying to outParanormalActivity Paranormal Activity 2 this Halloween will be a genuine challenge for the Eli Roth produced film but the fauxumentary's premise does have a few genuine thrills and chills going for it making it a decent doublebill screening for game fans of the genre. Appropriating the best narrative and visual tropes from its direct influences namely Marjoe The Exorcist and even the recent The Exorcism of Emily Rose in how it wrenches out a mystery element director Daniel Stamm uses the newly freshagain format of documented horror to elevate the drama inherent in an exorcism's taut chamber piece setting. There is a good chance here of being firmly disturbed if you let the film take you where it wants to take you.Armed with a genial personality and powerful charisma Louisiana's Reverend Cotton Marcus Patrick Fabian goes around the country performing fake exorcisms on the believing. Tired of his lifestyle he enlists a filmmaker Iris Reisen Iris Bahr and her unseen cameraman Adam Grimes to document his final foray into the fraud as he prepares a venture into real estate after a personal tragedy. Following the reverend's expos on the sham rituals of exorcisms the film crew finds the beginnings of a real case of demonic possession in Nell Sweetzer Ashley Bell a shy and gentle girl with a shotguntoting fundamentalist father Louis Herthum worried about the dark and heinous things occurring on the farmhouse.Fabian's depiction of the Reverend is terrific fun. He brings out so much of the character that it only enlivens the film and makes it feel all too real while newcomer Bell also shows some strong chops and flexible limps for this genre. The film takes its settings seriously and Stamm builds the foundation cleverly and patiently for powerfully unsettling moments. There's a good sense about the screenplay  not exceedingly smart for its good but not too detached from its conceit that the illusion is never broken. The single perspective thorough the documentarian's lenses helps focus the story into the visceral and direct scenes of terror almost taking on a life of its own. While the story does tend to falter till the end the strength of its conviction to juggle the various layers apparent makes its intrigue palpable.While never being a thrillaminute frightfest on the level of Rec 2 The Last Exorcism is a sophisticated and confident manipulation of the format is a treat. Its mockumentary aesthetics are refined and brought into fruition well enough to tell a tale of faith and disbelief the unknown and unknowable darkness that exists beyond our rationalities.".

Trying to outParanormalActivity Paranormal Activity 2 this Halloween will be a genuine challenge for the Eli Roth produced film but the fauxumentary's premise does have a few genuine thrills and chills going for it making it a decent doublebill screening for game fans of the genre. Appropriating the best narrative and visual tropes from its direct influences namely Marjoe The Exorcist and even the recent The Exorcism of Emily Rose in how it wrenches out a mystery element director Daniel Stamm uses the newly freshagain format of documented horror to elevate the drama inherent in an exorcism's taut chamber piece setting. There is a good chance here of being firmly disturbed if you let the film take you where it wants to take you.Armed with a genial personality and powerful charisma Louisiana's Reverend Cotton Marcus Patrick Fabian goes around the country performing fake exorcisms on the believing. Tired of his lifestyle he enlists a filmmaker Iris Reisen Iris Bahr and her unseen cameraman Adam Grimes to document his final foray into the fraud as he prepares a venture into real estate after a personal tragedy. Following the reverend's expos on the sham rituals of exorcisms the film crew finds the beginnings of a real case of demonic possession in Nell Sweetzer Ashley Bell a shy and gentle girl with a shotguntoting fundamentalist father Louis Herthum worried about the dark and heinous things occurring on the farmhouse.Fabian's depiction of the Reverend is terrific fun. He brings out so much of the character that it only enlivens the film and makes it feel all too real while newcomer Bell also shows some strong chops and flexible limps for this genre. The film takes its settings seriously and Stamm builds the foundation cleverly and patiently for powerfully unsettling moments. There's a good sense about the screenplay  not exceedingly smart for its good but not too detached from its conceit that the illusion is never broken. The single perspective thorough the documentarian's lenses helps focus the story into the visceral and direct scenes of terror almost taking on a life of its own. While the story does tend to falter till the end the strength of its conviction to juggle the various layers apparent makes its intrigue palpable.While never being a thrillaminute frightfest on the level of Rec 2 The Last Exorcism is a sophisticated and confident manipulation of the format is a treat. Its mockumentary aesthetics are refined and brought into fruition well enough to tell a tale of faith and disbelief the unknown and unknowable darkness that exists beyond our rationalities.";

	schema:headline " What An Exorcism!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Exorcism amounts to something more than the abysmal Blair Witch Project. This aboveaverage 87minute Lionsgate release doesn't rely entirely on wobbly camera movements for its impact. Indie Teutonic director Daniel Stamm lenses the action as if it were a straightforward documentary. Meantime a sense of irony permeates this unobtrusive epic that isn't entirely apparent on initial viewings. The chief difference between The Last Exorcism and The Blair Witch Project is its sophistication that I missed when I saw it the first two times. Stamm employs the cinema vrit camera style when he wants you on the edge of your seat. Mind you nothing scary happens up front. Audiences who crave blood and gore may feel cheated. Just when you think you might see something bloodcurdling Stamm cuts away to a reaction shot of people looking at what you want to see. Any shots in The Last Exorcism that would have required blood and gore as well as slashed up body parts were omitted. In one scene the demonpossessed girl kills an angry white cat and its remains look like a heap of bloody rags. Rated PG13 The Last Exorcism uses the singlecamera approach to accentuate its suspense and the tension. Nevertheless Stamm spawns a surfeit of suspense and tension by playing it cool. The Last Exorcism does pale by comparison with the mother of all exorcism movies The Exorcist and lacks a tenth of The Exorcist's impact. Meantime Stamm and his scribes create some genuinely creepy atmosphere in the remote backwoods settings where The Last Exorcism occurs and many of the homegrown performers are convincing especially Patrick Fabian as a minister who is having a crisis of faith. This one point eight million dollar film was a success earning over 40 million domestically.Indeed Broken Condom scenarists Huck Botka and Andrew Gurland establish the character of the protagonist Reverend Cotton Marcus of Baton Rouge Louisiana as a sympathetic fellow who wants to expose exorcism as a scam. In Cotton's own words he doesn't want to read about another unfortunate adolescent dying because an exorcist wrapped a bag around the child's head in his zeal to oust a demon. Cotton Patrick Fabian of Must Love Dogs has been preaching since he was knee high to a pulpit. He comes from a long family line of preachers who also served as exorcists. His father Reverend John Marcus John Wright Jr. of Waiting Room has performed 150 exorcisms and Cotton carried out his first exorcism when he was age ten. Cotton's father owns a 'who's who' of all the demons. He keeps this vintage leatherbound volume written in Latin locked up in an office safe. Nevertheless Cotton isn't entirely happy with his career as an exorcist and he wants to atone. Like the religious figures in all exorcist movies Cotton is wrestling with his conscience about what he has done in the name of God. Cotton confides in us that exorcisms are more popular now than ever. He brandishes a newspaper article about an exorcist academy that the Vatican has instituted to help combat the scarcity of exorcists. Cotton has a pile of exorcism requests stacked up on his desk. He selects an 'urgent' letter at random. A singleparent Louis Sweetzer Louis Herthum of In the Electric Mist of Ivanwood Louisiana who believes his 16yearold daughter Nell Sweetzer Ashley Bell of The Truth about Angels is afflicted with demonic possession. Of course Cotton thinks all the poor girl is suffering from is schizophrenia. Louis shows Cotton a disemboweled cow in his barn. When Cotton talks to Nell he finds some disturbing artwork but he believes he can handle this case with relative ease.Unfortunately Reverend Marcus finds himself in a bigger predicament. Initially he conducted an exorcismthat he faked with a magician's finesseand everything went off without a hitch. Nell recovered. Cotton counted Lewis' money. Cotton and his camera crew left the premises to spend the time in a motel. Cotton didn't tell the Sweetzers where they were checking in for the night. Imagine Cotton's surprise when Nell shows up at their motel. He carries Nell to the local hospital and they discover Nell is pregnant. When Louis learns the truth he swears that a demon has raped his virgin daughter. Earlier Louis' oddball son Caleb Sweetzer Caleb Landry Jones of No Country for Old Men had told Cotton that his father was a drunkard. Predictably Cotton suspects Louis may have raped his daughter. Meantime Louis demands that Cotton perform another exorcism. Louis is fully prepared to kill his own daughter with a shotgun to save her immortal soul if Cotton refuses. Cotton and his camera crew find Nell's latest art work and the unseen photographer doesn't like the idea that he is depicted in the picture as a man without a head. At this point things really begin to twist and turn.The genius of The Last Exorcism lays in its superb sense of irony. The firstact is flawless as we watch Cotton prepare his charade. By the second and third acts you realize this is more than just another found footage flick and that Cotton is battling more than simple superstition. This movie wallows in its own sense of irony because Cotton refuses to believe in demons. Since he rejects demons Cotton has lost his faith. Indeed he presents an expose of his own exorcism and demonstrates how he uses a sound system to frighten his clients. A local minister and his obese wife serve as comic relief but The Last Exorcism doesn't conjure up many laughs because it is so powerful. Stamm knows how to generate suspense without calling attention to his real agenda. This chiller boils down to a compelling an expose about a nonbeliever who confronts the reality of a world he abhors. The Last Exorcism succeeds as a memorable exercise of terror because the filmmakers shun blood and gore so we cannot take our eyes off the exorcism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ambiguity is a powerful tool for a writer filmmaker or any creative person. But there's a fine line between ambiguity and lazy storytelling. The Last Exorcism unfortunately makes use of the latter. The film poses many questions but doesn't feel the need to answer most of them meaning at the end of the film the audience isn't so much pondering the themes of religious doubt and the adverse effects of shame so much as wondering what the hell just happened. The lack of clarity is only made more frustrating by the overly shaky handycam cinematography. I normally enjoy this mode of filmmaking and it was proved to be effective for horror films in last year's phenomenal breakout Paranormal Activity but Daniel the cameraman has a bit too shaky of a hand for the style to work well here. I actually got a headache from some of the later jumpier scenes. It's a shame the film meanders to such a laughable conclusion because it starts with such promise. The first half hour or so is surprisingly funny effectively parodying the genre specifically exorcismbased horror films and presenting a religious slant to the proceedings that makes things interesting initially but ultimately seems cheap and even stupid. Two fine performances from Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell are wasted as the material goes from subtly selfreflexive to blatantly generic. The horror that unfolds along the way rarely generates any real scares settling instead for bursts of weirdness cheap jumps and ultimately an unattractive mixture of stupidity and discomfort.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only saving grace of this movie is that the majority of the actors gave it their all and pulled off great individual performances considering what they were given to work with. Don't get me wrong the ensemble did not work cohesively in the film at all.Like many of you have already seen the previews to this movie are misleading making this look like an attempt at an old school horror flick. The story is original in that Pastor Marcus is filming this documentary in an attempt to expose exorcism for the scam that it is but finds a genuine demonic possession. There was no need to 'trick' filmgoers by making the previews this way it just sets them up for disappointment.Personally I was completely surprised at the beginning of the film in a good way it seemed that I was going to get an original story line! But alas I was setting my hopes too high. Predictable twists came one after another and 30 minutes into the film I had it figured out.The film never developed an even pace and certain elements became increasingly frustrating by the end of the movie for instance the cameraman only using the camera's light a third of the time it would have been appropriate for him to do so the shakycam found footage technique executed without any originality and the fact that this film had a musical score all killed the escapism keeping me from believing a minute of the story.I'm not even going to bring up the details of the ridiculous excuse of an ending. I had hoped Eli Roth would have tried something other than the doesn't make any sense and takes everything away from the film ending that effects every movie he's attached to but even as a producer the ending has his fingerprints all over it.Mr. Roth you owe us all more. Get back to Cabin Fever  you showed so much potential and yet your skills have yet to mature.".

Don't get me wrong the ensemble did not work cohesively in the film at all.Like many of you have already seen the previews to this movie are misleading making this look like an attempt at an old school horror flick. The story is original in that Pastor Marcus is filming this documentary in an attempt to expose exorcism for the scam that it is but finds a genuine demonic possession.

	schema:headline " The Last Exorcism A Big SuperCreepy Surprise!";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Paranormal Activity I decided to take a break from the found footage horror film. That's right. I decided to skip The Last Exorcism when it was in theaters. However the critical praise poured in and the hype started to build. So I finally watched the film on DVD. And I gotta say I was so surprised.Reverend Cotton Marcus is an evangelist minister. He's done his fair share of exorcisms but he sees them as a bunch of bull. Cotton gets a letter to come down to another part of Louisiana to perform an exorcism. He accepts and decides to bring a camera crew with him to film the footage of what is to be his last exorcism. Enter the farm of the Sweetzer family Religious father Lewis his weird and rude son Caleb and his sweet 16 year old daughter Nell. Nell is the one that is supposedly possessed and could be the one killing the livestock. Cotton sees Nell's actions and he dismisses them as the behavior of an insane abused young girl. But what if he's wrong? We've had plenty of possession flicks ranging from the profane and disturbing classic The Exorcist to the recently welldone court dramahorror film The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Going into this one the audience gets a feel that they've seen this before. How wrong they were. The Last Exorcism is a possession flick but it's so much more welldone than you'd expect it to be. And it's scarier too.After such movies as The Blair Witch Project Quarantine and Paranormal Activity The Last Exorcism does follow the found footage formula like those before it. Like Oren Peli director Daniel Stamm has a keen and sensational visual eye offering up a healthy dose of suspense terrifying BOO! moments and the gutwrenchingly violent and frightening behavior of Nell Sweetzer.Screenwriters Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland have written a script that avoids the classic horror movie clichs and pulls out all the stops. Once the story gets going there's no stopping it. Nell's actions start off strange and grow increasingly more horrific as the movie goes on. I don't know if Hitchcock was a fan of demonic horror but he would be proud with the story Botko and Gurland have weaved.Next to the found footage concept what elevates The Last Exorcism above others is its music. Usually in order to achieve the raw home camera feel there is never any music in a horror film like this. However Nathan Barr composes some truly creepy music that gets under your skin as equally as the movie does.A mostly unknown cast of actors give performances to remember especially Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell as Cotton and Nell. Sure Cotton has faith but he doesn't believe in the devil. The character could have come off as extremely obnoxious. But Fabian gives the role a fantastic third dimension that allows you to care about Cotton. Bell's portrayal of Nell Sweetzer is absolutely unbelievable. Like Jennifer Carpenter in Emily Rose playing a possessed teen is not easy. Bell gives the role all of the layers it needs to look real. She is sweet when she has to be and the same goes for when she's pure evil. Also Nell's bodycracking movements don't come off as CGI. It looks like Bell is doing all the work making her performance just as good.During the movie I chose not to compare it to Paranormal Activity and it works better that way. The Last Exorcism and Oren Peli's film equal each other out. This film doesn't offer up a slow build up and just sends you on a roller coaster ride unlike any other. The Last Exorcism is one of the best nailbiters of 2010 and call me crazy but it comes pretty close to being the Exorcist of our generation. It is incredibly scary and for a PG13 horror movie it gets away with a lot of stuff. It will stay with you long after you've left the theater or turned off your DVD player and it will leave you with questions. Was God anywhere when needed? Was Nell really possessed or just crazy? You'll soon find out. And I don't care what anybody says. The ending is a stunner.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival on August 16th.I had a bad feeling before the movie began when they introduced Eli Roth  the two main actors including the leading woman who plays the possessed chick. Eli cracked way too many jokes humoring  hyping up the crowd. I thought this was a bad move as if we're supposed to treat this like a Screamtype experience. Fun but enjoy the 'boo!'like scares. I thought it would've been better off to just turn off the lights  start the movie setting the mood for something terrifying. It didn't help that we were introduced the actors first making it hard to buy into the story.There's way too much humor in this movie that it became impossible to suspend my beliefs  be involved in the story.After a suspenseful moment it would be followed up by another wise crack. The audience by far laughed more than letting out scares.It's supposedly 'found footage'...but it has a score?! During all build ups for the suspenseful moments you'll hear a note from a cello or eerie ambiance as if you were watching a film...but we're supposed to believe that this is documentary video? These were actors acting to a script there was no sense of improv a la REC  REC 2. The exchange in dialogue reactions appeared way too rehearsed.There's one camera man filming this thing. But the editingcamera work was amateurish. I.E. There's a shot of the main priest taking off his blazer then immediately cuts to the opposite angle showing him finishing taking off his blazer as if it were done in one shot. It looked like there were either 2 camera men or had another camera placed on a tripod capturing the shot. Way too many instances of this happening it looked too professionally done for a 'found footage' type documentary. The reason why REC was far more effective is because the actors weren't told much of the things that would happen during scenes. Also lot of the footage was done in one or just a few takes which mostly were long drawn out shots.The last 10 minutes of the movie made me wonder how many times they must have changed their minds how it should've ended. It was a mess  will leave you in disbelief for all the wrong reasons.I love my horror I really wanted to like this movie I'm not comparing it to The Exorcist my girlfriend treated me on my birthday to watch this  we were both immensely disappointed. Eli Roth introduced this movie saying they wanted to create something original I can only surmise that it did just that in showing how to deliver something so watered down  downright trailerpark movie trash.".

I think part of this is the reason that the pacing of the story is completely off it builds up slowly and then bam it's completely over the top.The movie starts off rather well with the pastor looking to expose exorcism as a hoax with a documentary team that lands them in a perfect breeding ground for the possessed. It is at its best when it slowly builds up the situation careening out of control not by supernatural forces but by the characters themselves. However at this point the movie itself gets too scared to make its way to a conclusion and takes the way out via ambiguity trying to appease as broad an audience as possible. The end is so rushed and muddled that it just ends up as confusing and unfinished someone in the audience actually said that a sequel better be made mistaking the ending for a cliffhanger.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's happened to horror movies these days? The Last Exorcism should be exactly as the title predicts the LAST of its kind.The movie follows a preacher Cotton and his small film crew as they try to document him performing an exorcism on a young girl thought to be possessed by a demon. You learn quickly of Cotton's dying faith and that his performed exorcisms are no more than scams he puts on so that his family can pay the bills. However Cotton may have taken on more than he bargained for as he reluctantly learns there may be more to this scenario than meets the eye...So when I first sat down for this movie I initially thought it was only me and my group of friends who had a hard time connecting with what was being displayed in front of us. Yes there were a few moments of panic in the theater a few quick jumps and screams made by all but in the end the most common noise heard was laughter... well laughter and outrage. EVERYONE seemed to be making jokes about this movie. The people behind us in front of us next to us... it seemed no one was able to really find any connection with any of the characters or what was going on in the film at all. It was for the most part predictable to the point where half way through the movie they pretty much just tell you exactly how it will end. And so with the end enters the outrage. Never before have I gone to a movie that ends with literally the entire theater crying out in anger at what they had just witnessed. It was almost as the people making the movie just gave up giving the audience anything but a thought provoking ending and instead just giving everyone an abrupt smack in the face. They give you no time to let what you are seeing sink in and you leave the theater so disappointed that you don't even care to fill in the holes. Even making the connections now I find myself more disappointed than anything that I had to sit through such a film.I give the movie 210. It would have gotten 110 except as I mentioned it did deliver I guess what you could call a few minor scares. Overall it was pretty bad... if you have any plans of seeing this movie you may want to reconsider you options.".

The introduction of the possessed girl continues the intrigue what am I complaining about!? But then it's all downhill clich after clich culminating in the big finale that seems very much tacked on like they didn't have and ending and rewriter 17 came up with this dung.Then the last guy to go is the cameraman and we get to view the found tapes!!!! I'm sick of it.The only time I saw this work was for 84 Charlie Mopic yes I thought Blair Witch Cloverfield et al stunk.It was a joke at our screening listening to the representatives of Alliance telling us to enhance our reactions for the infrared cameras because we might get in the commercial oh WOW just like Paranormal Activity another turd! This entire genre is way past it's shelf life all that's going on is studios following another template of past success and putting out inferior films to keep the bandwagon going.Hollywood came make truly great films but mostly puts out crap like this that with proper promotion insures box office boffo.Goodbye!".

The reverend Cotton Marcus never even performs a true exorcism he's a fraud trying to prove there are no such things as demon possessions. He just watches this girl be possessed by a demon and doesn't do anything. It ends up being that the whole town is a cult and uses the girl and yada yada. The Reverend and the two camera people end up getting killed and you find this out within the first 15 minutes because the girl draws pictures or her next victims and bam it's exactly what happens. Such a disappointment. This movie is worse than the Blair Witch Project at least there you have a some scare factor this was just a horrible plot line with nothing horror about it. Save your money it's not worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Feels Repetitive";
	schema:reviewBody "I could not shake the feeling while watching The Last Exorcism that I was watching a movie I'd seen before. The character POV format pseudodocumentary horror unfolding through the camera of a character was attempted by a low budget movie called The Last Broadcast in 1998. Perhaps the title of The Last Exorcism pays homage to The Last Broadcast for originating that trend. One can trace the pseudodocumentary horror back much further however such as with The Legend of Boggy Creek in 1972 which used the documentary style of its day  before the popularization of home video and prosumergrade video cameras.However most people didn't see The Last Broadcast. It had no theatrical distribution. The Blair Witch Project took the exact same idea and executed it better in 1999. They were fortunate enough to land a limited theatrical release with Artisan Entertainment who came up with a shrewd marketing campaign that drove an unprecedented amount of hype causing it to sell out a day in advance in some theaters such as at the Angelika in Greenwich Village New York City. The publicity turned the format into its own subgenre which got old just as fast as it started. It was popular originally because many people were duped or allowed themselves to be duped into thinking it might be real video footage left behind by victims of some mysterious murderer. Unfortunately once everyone understood it was fiction the genie was out of the bottle. It's like learning how stage magicians saw people in half. Once you know the secret the act is no longer so appealing.Nevertheless filmmakers have attempted to repeat the formula and apply it in different ways. Frankly I thought Paranormal was better than The Last Exorcism because even though everyone knew it was fakereality fiction. Paranormal was fun to watch unfold and was sufficiently spooky to sustain disbelief. The Last Exorcism's marketing team wisely didn't promote the movie as being lost footage or anything like that because not only has the novelty run out it's become more of an insult to the target audience. The filmmakers simply told their story through the camera held by one of the characters. Which is not as easy at it sounds  you have to look for excuses to keep that camera running without being contrived so we don't miss important dialog or plot points.The actors in The Last Exorcist did a fine job especially Patrick Fabian who carried 90 of the movie on his back. If he couldn't sell us on the right mixture of ignorance charisma and genuine empathy the movie would have been a dismal failure. The real problem with The Last Exorcism was that the setup took too long. Things didn't get horrifying until about the last quarter of the movie and that didn't leave enough time to play it out. The other problem is that the sense of peril was forced. The only reason our main character Reverend Cotton Marcus put his team into danger is because he insisted on helping young woman and her family at all costs even when he didn't know what was really going on knew he was over his head and wouldn't  despite all rational thinking  call the police. Unlike The Blair Witch Project they weren't lost in the woods and helpless to get out of their situation.I was also confused by the ending. I wasn't exactly sure of the motives behind the cult around the campfire. Were they against the demon or not? If they were against the demon why did they attack our characters? I feel like I missed something.A little more work on the script would have helped this movie.".

HIGHLY Recommended. Be assured that the Inca Roads portion of this DVD is edited to include claymation during most of the song this is an important part of the DVD where I would have loved to see the band play.

	schema:reviewBody "I was quite surprised that Massive Attack's Angel was chosen to accompany the opening credits which consisted for mostly CCTV  voyeuristic shots of a team conducting surveillance on the movements of Harrison Ford's Jack Stanfield and his family. I know it's a cool track but Angel is perhaps becoming one of the more overused tracks in Hollywood pictures already.But it hints well at what Firewall is going to become. Clich and overused sequences which will probably make you scream haven't I seen this somewhere before? Firewall offered nothing very new in terms of plot outline as it contains modified scenes from even Ford's own works like Air Force One the family's survival being threatened and it's up to one man to save the day and The Fugitive the frame up and one man's run from the law. Ford has already become comfortable in the role of an allAmerican one man hero that this role offered no surprises at all.It's basically standard fare with the usual chases and action fight sequences. Stansfield is a VP of network security of a bank and has designed the bank's software with other operational duties like making sure the bank can respond to external online threats. However as the saying goes almost 80 of intrusion are committed knowingly or unknowingly from the inside and with a head honcho part of the act you can be sure that he has the knowhow to siphon out cash if he wants to.In comes Bill Cox Paul Bettany scheming con man who with his team of merry men take Stanfield's family hostage and lapses into the usual psychomumbojumbo routine. With the family's antics at escaping you really wonder if Cox as a villain has what it takes to call the shots in a hostage situation. While he might have the upper hand it's his weakness in being ruthless to the hostages that proved his downfall and make him a very weak cinematic villain. Here's someone who would rather shoot at his own men than to teach them hostages a lesson. Probably he has this noble subscription to women and children first. And it doesn't help when there's the usual good guy amongst his merry men who offers the family sympathy points.Word of caution though for those who might think that this film offers some cool technology on screen. Leave the technobabble at the door there's no firewall to hack into in the first place and the hacking is actually a nobrainer. And unless the USA offers wireless internet access like everywhere it's pretty incredible with what a laptop can do in the movie.It has your expected twists and seemingly smart moments but nothing that will truly make you go wow. The fist fight choreography can get pretty intense however there's no need to reach the end of the road before you know who's gonna emerge tops. It isn't exactly a bad movie but one which doesn't even have a single sequence that can redeem this picture from really bad mediocrity.".

Name Ford's character Jack and you'd think that would narrow it down to a good one. Then again you could just be suckered into seeing Firewall which borrows and doesn't add from the Ford postJones collection.In a playitsafe campaign to show the world that he isn't too old Harrison Ford is pushed into Firewall. It's been fourteen years since Patriot Games in which Ford played a man that seemed over the hill then and here he is today in the same situations. To jog your memory Ford has been making a living playing essentially the same character in similar situations for years thanks to the aforementioned Patriot Games The Fugitive and Air Force One.Firewall directed by Richard Loncraine concerns the tale of Jack Stanfield played by Harrison Ford being forced through the methods of Bill Cox Paul Bettany into electronically stealing from the bank he keeps hackers out of on a daily basis. Cox has a bargaining chip the Stanfield family. Eventually Cox and his team babysit the hostages and circumvent there own success. Jack then hunts them down and none of this comes as a surprise due to the formulaic structure of the picture.Some may find Firewall a difficult film to dislike because it plays all the clichs. It isn't artistic but rather commercial filmmaking. Borrowing from every film mentioned above it uses elements from what worked and safely combines them in a coherent yet unexciting manner. The action scenes don't come till the end of the picture and those five minutes offer little more than stunt work put on by actors half Ford's age. This is a vehicle for Ford and as the audience we are supposed to subconsciously see this as a practice run at a fourth Indiana Jones film. With such blatant disregard for a plot and even unique action you can view this movie as the precursor to Indiana Jones and the Gated Community.There is an element that seems realistic and that is the acceptable number of henchmen who are employed by the leader. If they are trying to steal money then having less people to divvy up the bounty would result in a greater payday. Cox has a modest four men working with him. Unfortunate for both him and the viewer their lack of common sense is staggering. For example the family dog Rusty plays a prominent role when the bumbling fools take him hostage. There should be a logical reason for taking Rusty. With his family already held captive in an unknown locale I'm sure Jack Stanfield was ready to walk away from them and start a new life. But wait Rusty is missing too now I have to comply with their demands. This ultimately destroys the credibility of the screenplay.Performances in the film are convincing. Virginia Madsen is good as the relaxed wife considering the situation her character is put through. My favorite role was of Paul Bettany as a sometimes caring villain that flips a mean pancake. Despite this director Richard Loncraine has crafted a film that is best described as what a computer would spit out if the command was thriller. Everything functions to drive the story on its merry way. Lacking character nuances rich emotions and beautiful scenery is OK for a suspense film about robbing a bank. Where Firewall betrays the genre is in not providing twists originality or an intriguing story.".

	schema:headline " Solid thriller despite being mostly unremarkable stuff";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack Stanfield may be an old man but he has a young wife couple of young kids AND is pretty hot on the old computers working as he does as head of systems security for a small bank chain that has recently merged with a larger firm. His comfortable life is thrown into disarray when a group of armed men led by the distinguished and cruel Bill Cox seize his house and his family. The deal is simple  unless he helps them transfer millions of pounds from many of the banks accounts by accessing the system they will kill his family one at a time. Given that none of the men are masked Jack suspects that this will happen anyway and while going along with them frantically tries to work out a way to safety.This film did reasonable but unspectacular business at the box office and perhaps that is only fair given that is also a very adequate on the film itself as it is solid but nothing special at all. The plot is a bit of the problem as the computer world and the house both act as constraining factors that do not allow for a great number of set pieces to get the heart racing. Nor does it provide much in the way of mystery although it is clever enough to provide distraction and a general sense of peril. Much of this comes from the performances though which despite not being brilliant are at least functional for this film. I didn't need a fourth Indiana Jones film to tell me Ford was getting old because he demonstrates it here with an absurd fight scene at the end. Up till then though he is not actually too bad and age doesn't prevent him from doing anything in particular. Bettany is pretty good alongside him and plays a bit of a cookiecutter character with a bit of class. Madsen is lumbered with the wife in peril role but fills it well better than the two kids anyway. The support cast features very minor turns from faces such as Forster Patrick Arkin Rajskub and a few others of note  not sure what attracted them but they add a bit of class to the film anyway.Ultimately director Loncraine cannot make the most of all these bits and while doing a good job he doesn't really ever get the tension ratcheted up to the level of any of the many better normal guy in peril type roles that Ford has done over the last few decades. It is OK but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't manage to make the house feel smaller with the gang in it or that he never really got anything crackling between Bettany and Ford. It is a reasonable film nonetheless and it distracted me but only that  it will certainly fade in my memory quickly and certainly doesn't do anything for Ford other than keeping him busy.".

Given that none of the men are masked Jack suspects that this will happen anyway and while going along with them frantically tries to work out a way to safety.This film did reasonable but unspectacular business at the box office and perhaps that is only fair given that is also a very adequate on the film itself as it is solid but nothing special at all. The plot is a bit of the problem as the computer world and the house both act as constraining factors that do not allow for a great number of set pieces to get the heart racing. Nor does it provide much in the way of mystery although it is clever enough to provide distraction and a general sense of peril. Much of this comes from the performances though which despite not being brilliant are at least functional for this film. I didn't need a fourth Indiana Jones film to tell me Ford was getting old because he demonstrates it here with an absurd fight scene at the end. Up till then though he is not actually too bad and age doesn't prevent him from doing anything in particular. Bettany is pretty good alongside him and plays a bit of a cookiecutter character with a bit of class. Madsen is lumbered with the wife in peril role but fills it well better than the two kids anyway. The support cast features very minor turns from faces such as Forster Patrick Arkin Rajskub and a few others of note  not sure what attracted them but they add a bit of class to the film anyway.Ultimately director Loncraine cannot make the most of all these bits and while doing a good job he doesn't really ever get the tension ratcheted up to the level of any of the many better normal guy in peril type roles that Ford has done over the last few decades. It is OK but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't manage to make the house feel smaller with the gang in it or that he never really got anything crackling between Bettany and Ford. It is a reasonable film nonetheless and it distracted me but only that  it will certainly fade in my memory quickly and certainly doesn't do anything for Ford other than keeping him busy.";

Turned out to be a disappointment as I found the movie to be less on computer security and more of action and drama.Harrison Ford has been in the movie business for around twenty years read grown old and so he fit into the character of Jack Stanfield perfectly. He is well backed by Paul Bettany who excels in this role and Virginia Madsen who plays his wife.Besides these three there isn't much acting by the other characters. Some do play substantial roles but being sidekicks don't gather much attention to them.But I will be honest to point out that the storyline turned out to be really interesting in the second half. Well it didn't diverge from the existing theme but Paul's entire plan makes it interesting and makes you appreciate its ingenuity.One spectacular scene was the fight in the end. I say spectacular because it didn't appear artificial as can be seen in a lot of fights in a lot of movies. This was a fight of a civilian fighting back in desperation.Enough said.

I have to say I was fairly entertained by the film. The plot is not so much different from the other films of this genre but what stands apart from the rest is Harrison Ford's and the antagonist Bill Cox's very real performances and some clever twists.Computer security specialist Jack Stanfield Harrison Ford works for the Seattlebased Landrock Pacific Bank. A trusted topranking executive he has built his career and reputation on designing the most effective antitheft computer systems in the industry protecting the bank's financial holdings from the constant threat of increasingly sophisticated internet hackers with his complex network of tracers access codes and firewalls. His regular life is put into turmoil after his family taken is taken hostage by Bill Cox and his cronies.Even though most of the story was predictable that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining. It has everything you can ask  big explosions smart thinking actors great acting only by Harrison Ford and Paul Bettany. Cox played by Paul Bettany was very unnerving as the calm cold collected and clever villain. He was ruthless in killing his own men to make his point. I mean that is fairly common in this genre still it was pretty good. Jack's repeated attempts to try and save his family along with the money was good to see. You could look at his eyes and you can see how much he loves his family and how scared he is for them and really wants their safety more than anything. The little kid Andy with the allergy and Jack's secretary Janet Stone played by Mary Lynn Rajkub are also very good. The climax with the burning car was not so believable. But even so this is a more than average thriller that you would want to see. A rating of 5.6 on IMDb? I am shocked. Come on people this is so much better than that. I really enjoyed the movie immensely.710".

I just never thought I would leave the theater laughing at one of his films!I expected the usual sneering leave my family alone performance and I got it but with each film he makes he just looks worse and the acting gets just a bit hammier. There is also this plot  with holes you can drive a truck through  starting with the mastermind criminals. Yes they are thorough  they staked out Harrison's house know the family's routines planned and executed a perfect home invasion  it's all quite smooth until....THE PHONE RINGS! No one knows what to do when the kid answers that dreaded telephone so they all flip out point weapons and look scared. Unbelievable.Then there is the bank heist  again these seemingly prepared criminals somehow overlooked the fact that Harrison's bank just completed a merger. Oops  the computer terminal needed to actually steal the money is now gone and housed in Wisconsin at the new bank headquarters. In true Macguyver style Harrison still manages to steal the dough using part of a fax machine and his daughter's iPod! The exposition in this film is so obvious  like the family dog who appears in the beginning of the film and is gone again until about 13 through when the mom seemingly needlessly points out the dog's special GPS tracking collar. The son tries to remove it and the mom tells him not to  even though they are held captive in their own home and I'm not sure how the dog would run away to need a GPS tracker anyway. But of course this bit of exposition sure does pay off in the end when the kidnappers take off with family in tow. Harrison overhears the dog barking during a cell phone call. Yes these evil thugs would give a peanut butter cookie to a peanut allergic boy but they are not so heartless as to leave the family pet behind while abducting the family cross country!So in his desperate attempt to reclaim his family from these brutes he breaks into the home of the secretary he had recently fired and convinces her to assist him in his quest to rescue his loved ones. Conveniently they have a laptop along for the ride and Washington State has such a strong wifi computer signal that they can track that GPS tracker on the dog practically to the kidnappers doorstep IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!A very physical battle ensues between 65 year old Ford and a man half his age but Indiana Jones triumphed again and his family was saved. Unfortunately Virgina Madsen is totally wasted in her follow up to Sideways and Paul Bettany puts in a pretty standard bad guy performance. If you are a big HF fan then you need to see this but it was hard to watch him try to keep up his action hero persona as he actually stumbles and falls in some of the scenes. I am not sure if this was intended but it made me wince. I wish he could do another film like Witness and be a little more picky about the scripts he chooses. Just my 2 cents for all that is worth!".

Further only those of us who have actually seen the 12000 or more films required to maintain a mental database of what has already been done in film can appreciate their basis for phrases like tired cliche' retread etc. The almost universal panning of Firewall may be the best example to date of this trend.OK I'll admit it...I must be a typical braindead consumer who plays right into the hands of the studios who attempt to regularly pry my hard  earned money away from me by pumping out formulaic films designed to optimize profit at the expense of art. The simple truth though is this films like Firewall are sometimes exactly what I am after...an escape! Firewall manages to put the viewer into the shoes of another everyman...or at least into the shoes of a man that an average Joe would like to someday be. Is it fantasy? Yes. But is it plausible fantasy and this is precisely what makes such stories so exciting. In this case the 'normal guy who has started to arrive' at the rewards of his life's work is played as perfectly as he has in so many similar roles by Harrison Ford.The plot them revolves around placing this character into a situation that we if given the same stakes would like to believe that we could also work through. Suffice to say that there are heroes and villains and a number of characters in  between who serve to help or hinder Ford's character...and in the process some of the complexities of our world land right in the lap of a man who would have preferred to not know about them to begin with. However faced with the realities of the situation Ford's 'Jack' rises to apply his own measure of right and wrong as best as he can.To identify with this goal is not something that we should be ashamed of as viewers.In the end of course sacrifices are made but the unwilling hero finds some measure of closure...no doubt with a more broad view of his world. The price to be paid the extent to which his journey ends nicely if at all and the lessons learned at least by the viewer would require spoilers to disclose....suffice to say that some are predictable and some are not.In the end as long as we the average viewers continue to watch the 6 to 36 movies per year that we do and as long as our lives continue to only cross the path of Hollywood on occasion films like Firewall will continue to be an excellent escape for us and I hope we will continue to reward the studios for producing them without apology.Unfortunately the career critics will continue to become more and more distanced from the sensibilities of regular people and they will continue to discount such motion pictures as below them.For me this is just fine....in a strange way the critics are still serving their purpose providing guidance as to what I should or should not view. The difference of course is that I believe now more than ever that I will be happy with the results if I do exactly the opposite of what they suggest.In this case viewing Firewall against their advice was absolutely the right decision to make.".

Usually I would say plotturn but that would suggest angles approaching 90 degrees.There is nothing here that you haven't seen before in countless better movies. You know the setup by now a bank security chief Ford is coerced by a bad guy Bettany into stealing money from said bank in return for his kidnapped wife Madsen. Will the crooks get the money? Will Harrison Ford save his wife and kids? Will there be a lot of impediments put in our hero's way that 5 minutes of conversation would solve but won't be because we have to believe that our hero's actions are heroic? Yeah it is that kind of predictable cliff hanger.If my comments seem harsh for such a marshmallow I'm sorry. But let me list a few of the problems 1  Virginia Madsen has the sort of part and turns in the kind of performance she did before Sideways. If you find her believable in her first scene with Ford I have a bridge in Brooklyn available for lease. This may not be her fault but her agent should be shot.2  Alan Arkin Robert Forster and Robert Patrick fine actors all are treated like window dressing and are in this movie only to collect a paycheck and contribute to a pension fund. Anyone with SAG credentials could have been inserted in their parts.3 There is a cute dog that none of the heartless kidnappers harm even though it is as irritating as a cell phone.4  Harrison Ford did the same movie nine years ago Air Force One with the gravitas to actually make you believe he was the President. Get the hell off of my plane! In this one you are supposed to believe he is a welltodo physically fit bank geek who lives in a house worthy of Bill Gates. Credible? No.5  This movie sets some sort of record for product placements. The producers are shameless. Not only are theaters showing commercials before the movie now the movie itself is a string of commercials.6  There are technology leaps that are as farfetched as anything you have seen on the TV series 24.Speaking of 24 one of the bright spots in this movie is the appearance of Mary Lynn Rajskub. Don't recognize the name? She plays computer genius Chloe on 24 and plays essentially the same character here. Not a whole lot of additional acting is needed even her boss is named Jack but she brings some of the only intentional fun to be had in this film.The only other bright spot is a wonderfully choreographed fight scene between Ford and Bettany. According to those involved it took three days to film and stunt men were used for maybe 2 seconds of the finished product. Admirable but just not enough.Save your 9 and don't encourage Warner Brothers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firewall puts Harrison Ford between a rock and a hard place. Here's a man who's a powerplayer in his field forced to sabotage his career by moneyhungry men with no regard for his profession. These men wear suits and inhabit the boardrooms of the biggest studios in Hollywood. But what about the movie?In this secondrate action flick Ford plays computer security specialist Jack Stanfield a loyal bank executive and serious family man who lives in a stunning house with wife Beth Virginia Madsen and two kids. But a bigger company is about to buy out Jack's bank and as a result his company is under more surveillance than usual.We learn early on that Jack's family is being watched also. The film opens nicely with footage of the Stanfield family going about their daily business  and it's footage obviously shot in secret from a distance. After the montage is over however the voyeuristic thrill of stalking an unwitting target is never again recaptured. Instead we are treated to the achingly slow process of Jack being introduced to and later cornered by villain Bill Cox Paul Bettany.Cox is a straightfaced criminal plotting to use Jack's technological knowhow to break the codes and circumvent the firewalls built to protect Landrock Pacific Bank's millions. He and a group of young guntoting mercenaries barge into Jack's life and take the family hostage  a persuasive tactic one would think but it takes Jack a surprisingly long time to understand the gravity of this threat and take appropriate action.Cox's crack team doesn't exactly have a lot of crack left in its whip. These amateur goons are obnoxious and bumble around not at all invested in what they're doing. Much of the movie shows them cloistered in the Stanfield household eating food and watching TV while their prisoners wander around more or less undisturbed and certainly not imprisoned.In fact nobody seems to care about the situation  not the kids not Jack not Beth. So why should director Richard Loncraine expect us to care either? Madsen was brilliant in Sideways but in Firewall her performance is lacking. There are no hysterics no tears and no signs of any inner emotional struggle when strangers threaten her with guns. Instead Beth is calm which in the context of an actionthriller is a counterintuitive choice for the actress to make. Nevertheless it's Harrison Ford who seems to be making most of the bad choices these days.As I watched Jack sit on the couch in one scene the deep crags in his face twitching as he tries to figure out how to get out of this situation I wondered if what I was really witnessing was the actor behind the character trying to figure out a way to get out of this movie. Ford's effort is admirable but unfortunately the halfbaked script and meager direction undermines any positives brought to the table.It's a shame too because Firewall also features the talents of veterans such as Robert Forster Jackie Brown Alan Arkin Slums of Beverly Hills and Robert Patrick Terminator 2 Judgment Day. Mary Lynn Rajskub of 24 fame also stars reprising her role as the only girl you can trust at the office. Stick to Jack Bauer Mary and I'll stick to television when I want a good thriller.Incidentally guess what's up next for Keifer Sutherland actionthriller The Sentinel with oldtimer Michael Douglas in the lead. It just keeps getting better doesn't it?Copyright c 2006 by Lauren Simpson".

Harrison Ford is getting older and should outgrow these kind of parts. Newcomer Paul Bettany was outstanding as the villain of the movie. There were a lot of in and outs but the movie 2 hours in length kept you fully interested. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the run time. If you like Harrison Ford go see this movie which is one of few released lately that is worth the price of admission. This movie is not for kids as there is a lot of violence so go see it and enjoy!!!!".

As film satires go it's not quite as cunning as Bunuel's best work which it seems it could have been influenced by but it's still a funny sharp and brutally honest jab at the crumbling Soviet government and bureaucratic ineptness in all its forms. Ramaz Giorgobiani's expressionless lead performance is an interesting and eventually necessary realist counterpoint to the often wild and intentionally bloated performances of the bureaucrats. The aforementioned Bunuel is an obvious cinematic connection as is Fellini's ORCHESTRA REHEARSAL but as I was watching it I kept thinking this is what might happen if Preston Sturges filmed a Kafka story.

This explains my interest in the film Das Blaue vom Himmel German title Golubyje Gory which was produced in the Soviet Union of 1984 so just before the onset of Perestroyka. It concerns the efforts of a writer in order to get his manuscript published. Everybody knows that the Leninist states suffered from a rigorous and rather absurd censorship. I hoped that this film would elaborate on this theme particularly because it is a comedy. Unfortunately my hope is idle and censorship is not mentioned except for one single allusion about a disappeared manuscript Stalinistlike orders from above. So if the story was meant to be about censorship then the censors have done a good job. The whole narrative turns on the rigidity and ineffectiveness of the state bureaucracy. If you suspect that this is a covert criticism on the Leninist system then you are wrong. For it is not the system that is incriminated but the workers that constitute the system. In fact the Leninist elite loved to complain about the laziness the ineffectiveness and the lack of moral of the common people. If only the people would have the Leninist attitude then the system would definitely work. Here are some of these official jokes from the EastGerman German Democratic Republic GDR comics magazine Eulenspiegel. The day will come that our products will be so good that we will need gate controls. Or Waiter! Wouldn't it be better if you help your colleagues instead of making music? REAL joke waiter  one who thinks money grows on trays. Or Turned on and immediately out of order? All costumers who come here claim that defendant accused!. It is a bit like blaming the victim. There was cabaret in the same style for instance Distel in Berlin. In spite of my disappointment it is still an amusing film. The colors have an unpleasant shade of grey but that may be on purpose. My version of the film has been dubbed by DEFA in the former GDR. This creates some problems male organ is translated into mine shaft etc. But although I prefer subtitles in the Netherlands we hate to disturb our neighbors I can live with this. After all they were all Leninist comrades  Russian or not. Nevertheless if you really prefer a film about censorship try Feigenblatt fuer Kuhle Wampe about censorship during the German Republic of Weimar. Oh and don't forget to check off the useful yes ballot. I love comments.".

A civil project by nature it might be abused as an offensive weapon since it could deliver devastation to any potential adversary simply by creating natural disasters such as storms and floods.

We're following the main protagonist Billy Hayes an astronaut aboard the station as he wades through a plot of secrecy and sabotage trying to tell friend from foe in the process. This film is the first real movie by Roland Emmerich and knowing his later works it is simply speaking surprisingly good. First off it was and is a visual treat by any standard with wellcrafted models and a setdesign that made a point in trying to look as realistic as possible. At that it is visually reminiscent of many other movies from that era Star Wars or Moonraker to name some but doesn't fail nearly as badly as some of them do it simply looks good. And what's more this movie has a story that makes some sense and won't let you leave your seat until it is resolved. The acting is good the characters are well drawn and partly are in for some surprise. The general mood is by no means optimistic this is definitely a Cold War scenario which nowadays of course has the tendency to make you chuckle considering that 1997 looked totally different than portrayed in the movie.Bottom line if you know later Emmerich blockbusters such as ID4 and Godzilla you definitely notice his handwriting in this one and seeing the path he took from here on makes sense. But much unlike said later works this movie excells not only in the audio and CGI department but also has something like characters and storyline. People liked ID4 as a cineastic lollipop but as a film this one is far better than most".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Arche Noah Prinzip or The Noah's Ark Principle is a West German Germanlanguage film by writer and director Roland Emmerich still one of Germany's biggest stars in Gollywood more than three decades later. This is actually one of his earliest works as a filmmaker and he was not even close to famous at that point. Not surprising though as he was still in his late 20s. This 100minute movie is probably the most known work from actor Richy Mller. But it's nowhere near Emmerich's most known of course as he was still pretty young here and also because this movie is in German language so not as easily accessible for Hollywood. It takes at the end of the 20th century and looking at how this movie was from the 1980s it wasn't even that far away actually. But I never thought that this was a realistic example of what life may be like 15 years later which means that the film is almost worthless in terms of realism. It is more of a dark vision and fantasy mostly. I may be a bit biased as I never liked SciFi too much but I still expect better quality than this. I also found most of the actors really forgettable but can you really blame them looking at how poorly their characters were written. A good way to describe this film would be sciencefiction for the sake of it. I cannot say I enjoyed the watch at all and there is really nothing memorable about this one. I also would not call it a disaster or a failure but it lacks in way too many areas to let me recommend it. Pretty boring and only for the most hardcore SciFi fans. Everybody else should skip.".

This is actually one of his earliest works as a filmmaker and he was not even close to famous at that point. Not surprising though as he was still in his late 20s. This 100minute movie is probably the most known work from actor Richy Mller. But it's nowhere near Emmerich's most known of course as he was still pretty young here and also because this movie is in German language so not as easily accessible for Hollywood. It takes at the end of the 20th century and looking at how this movie was from the 1980s it wasn't even that far away actually. But I never thought that this was a realistic example of what life may be like 15 years later which means that the film is almost worthless in terms of realism. It is more of a dark vision and fantasy mostly. I may be a bit biased as I never liked SciFi too much but I still expect better quality than this. I also found most of the actors really forgettable but can you really blame them looking at how poorly their characters were written. A good way to describe this film would be sciencefiction for the sake of it. I cannot say I enjoyed the watch at all and there is really nothing memorable about this one. I also would not call it a disaster or a failure but it lacks in way too many areas to let me recommend it. Pretty boring and only for the most hardcore SciFi fans. Everybody else should skip.";

But he likes football has fun with it and simply wants to play a good honest game.  If the team wins good.  If it doesn't so what.  He has a good locker room speech at the end of the movie.

You know how the story's going to end but you're not always sure how it's going to get there and that's what keeps it interesting.Van Der Beek is very good much better that I ever thought I'd give him credit for.  Also good  Paul Walker as the original starting quarterback and Amy Smart as Van Der Beek's smart girlfriend.  They played real characters as opposed to stereotypes and I thought their performances really made the movie.  Surprisingly I thought the weakest link was Jon Voight as the head coach.  He was a cardboard villain no substance to him whatsoever.  I kept waiting for the film to explain why he wanted to win so bad why he'd push his kids with such inhuman cruelty . . . and besides because he wants to win an answer was never given.  Too bad although I think this was more the fault of the script than of Mr. Voight.It's certainly not the best movie ever made  for that matter it's not even the best football movie ever made  but it's still good.

	schema:headline " Varsity Blues tells the story of a high school in a small town in Texas where football is king.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure we've all known of or at least heard of places where nothing is bigger than high school football. The starting quarterback runs the town the coach is considered a God as long as he's winning and the parents all live vicariously through their children. And most of the time the kids actually playing football love the game too. But in the small town of West Caanan the kids are running rampant and the coach Jon Voight doesn't care. James Van Der Beek stars as Jonathon Moxon Mox the backup quarterback of the high school football team. And he's happy with his situation. He gets to sit on the sidelines and read hang out with the cool kids and basically just wait until he can get out of this one horse town and head off to Brown University. But one day he sees the coach injecting pain killers into the knee of the starting quarterback. Then one of his best friends Billy Bob seems to have a concussion but the coach makes him play. When the starting QB goes down Mox is handed the team and is forced to decide whether to be the King of West Caanan or to live his life the way he wants it to be lived. I guess it wasn't a bad movie. The football scenes were done extremely well and I generally liked the people I was supposed to like and didn't like the people I wasn't supposed to like. But the movie lacked a certain focus. There were too many other things going on that didn't seem to have anything to do with the movie. The whole stripperteacher thing didn't do anything but make me think back to my high school years and realize I didn't want to see any of those teachers naked. Then there was the black running back who claimed that the coach was a racist. He said that whenever they got near the goal line the coach would always give the ball to a white guy so he could soak up the glory. While that may have been true there was nothing in the movie to show that the coach was a racist. The only thing in the movie that said he was a racist was the black player saying he was. The whole race issue seemed to be thrown in there just for the sake of having it rather than serving any purpose. Some of the characters were too stereotypical. Mox's girlfriend for instance. As soon as Mox became the starting QB his life started to change. In the town of West Caanan starting QB was a position of popularity. But instead of letting Mox enjoy himself even for a second she started telling him he had changed. I figured that was going to happen but don't you think a girlfriend would allow her boyfriend to enjoy his moment in the spotlight for just a few minutes before telling him he's not the man she fell in love with? Jon Voight's character was another one. I never played high school football so maybe that's the way a coach is but actually willing to ruin a kids life by making him play with a serious injury? And actually choking another player? I thought that his character went a little too far. It made him look extremely bad when that point had already been made.My last rant has to do with the character of Darcy. She was the cheerleader who was dating the starting QB. As soon as he got injured she started hitting on Mox. When she finally got him to come over to her house he resisted her. Then she broke down and cried and Mox solved all her problems in a few seconds. Much too quick a resolution for her. But I must say I'll never look at whipped cream the same way again. Overall I did enjoy Varsity Blues. It was fun to watch even though it had a lot of script problems. The actors seemed to be having fun with their roles and that made the movie better. So even though it had a lot of problems overall it was enjoyable. And now I'm off to find some whipped cream.".

	schema:headline " Excellent film and that whip cream bikini!";
	schema:reviewBody "May contain spoilersEven though my experience differs in the type of sport I can completely relate and appreciate what the core of this film is about.  And that is the compulsive hereditary obsessive behavior that peers and parents have towards their kids playing sports.  I have lived in Canada all my life in what would be considered somewhere in between a city like New York and a town like West Canaan.  Take a look at Springfield Illinois pop. about 300000 and that is about the size of the cities that I have grown up in. And when I have been to and played hockey at local small rinks parents become stupid.  They yell at the refs there is sometimes the threat of violence and really it is sheer luncacy that prevails at events like this one.  Is it that they try to live vicariously through their kids?  That they want to see their kids do something that they never could?  Besides Kilmer being an idiot and a control freak in the film I thought Varsity Blues' central issue was to show how obsessed we all are when it comes to sports and our kids achieving greatness at any level.Varsity Blues is a great film.  And what I enjoyed most about it was the acting and the football scenes.  James VDB shows that he is capable of playing someone other than Dawson Leery.  And his range in here is perfect. It also has to be mentioned that if this film was taken more seriously than it was then I really think that John Voigt would be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as the control freak Bud Kilmer.  He is the embodiment of an American football coach that seems to care only about his reputation and not his player's welfare.  His southern red neck twang his pretencious gum chewing his snarl when he barks orders and his domination of the entire town just by a simple comment made in a local diner shows how versatile and understanding of an actor that Voigt is.  Coincidentally I had just rented Anaconda two days before I saw this on Viewers Choice and I was truly amazed at the range by Voigt.  He really is terrific in this film. I also have to mention Ron Lester who plays Billy Bob the guargantuanly over weight line backer with a heart of gold.  At first when we meet him he is a caricature of every other over weight star athlete.  He eats fatty foods like they were going out of style he is the life of the party as he pukes and then comes back for more and he is one of the guys.  But later in the film we see his character grow.  There is more to his character than we initially see and when he is given an opportunity to act he is perfect as we see how he feels and how hurt he is.  This really should be a breakout role for him.  Varsity Blues has some of the best football action I've ever seen filmed. The plays are realistic looking the hits are violent and the symmetry of the completed plays are awesome to watch.  This is a film that makes you feel like you are really watching a high school football game.There is really nothing wrong with Varsity Blues and if you enjoy highschool themes like relationships and humour then you will probably love this film. And there is one more thing to love about this film well two actually if you are a guy that is.  Ms. Davis and Darcy Sears.  That whip cream bikini is something I'll never forget.  What a dish.".

After he becomes the starting quarterback he resists the comeons of his predecessor's beautiful girlfriend and he will sacrifice his own scholarship to Brown University an Ivy League school in Rhode Island for those of you not familiar rather than let another player be used and potentially physically damaged by the unscrupulous coach.Some of the scenes are reminiscent of other football films The Longest Yard All the Right Moves North Dallas Forty and so on but I guess there are no real surprises these days after decades of the same essential stories in Hollywood.

	schema:headline " 'Varsity Blues' 1999";
	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed the MTV Films era and it's sad that it didn't last longer than it did and 'Varsity Blues' feels almost like one of their more special endeavors because it is a far more serious effort than anything they had laid on us before. This definitely isn't 'Beavis And Butthead Do America' or 'Jackass The Movie'. The serious approach never really feels like it is taking itself too seriously there is still obvious satire and blatantly crude gags littered about. 1999 was a long time ago now and just taking a fast glance around this film we see a whole bunch of recognizable faces nowadays. Jon Voight who we all know from his seemingly endless slew of good performances Paul Walker of 'The Fast And The Furious' fame Ali Larter Amy Smart Scott Caan. But what about James Van Der Beek? This guy is a decent enough actor he really gives off the right vibe as the kid who would rather read Vonnegut on the sidelines rather than play football and I think it's quite shameful that he isn't in more films like this he was almost generationdefining with his fame garnered from 'Dawson's Creek'. I guess the fact that he pretty much disappeared from the face of the Earth after he made 'The Rules Of Attraction' just helps to ensure the cultstatus of films like 'Varsity Blues' in the first place. We have two people working on this project who also worked on 'Good Burger' a few years prior our director Brian Robbins and Ron Lester who plays one of our more memorable characters here and it's nice to see them all stepping up the maturity level a little bit. They went from graduating middle school Nickelodeon to graduating high school MTV in just two years.I remember when this film first appeared in 1999 and I remember it being quite a popular teen movie at the time and I'm only slightly disappointed in myself for having not watched it for a good 13 years after it was made. The film doesn't make you dig deep it can be slightly predictable but you are sure to walk away from this one feeling good about what you've just seen.Also every time I see Jon Voight I can't help but think of Jerry Reed from 'The Waterboy' one year earlier.VARSITY BLUES 810.".

While I like that film better this is not a bad film at all. I was still able to root for and against some characters. This movie does a good job at holding my attention and bringing back some good high school memories.Brian Robbin's film is about a Texas football team in the town of West Canaan. After the star quarterback is injured the back up guy Moxon is forced to deal with his relentless coach Kilmer his disapproving girlfriend and his footballloving parents while starting in his new role that is all strange for him.The acting is pretty good. This is the first time I saw James Van Der Beek on film because I refuse to watch Dawson's Creek but he does a pretty good job. Jon Voight gives a masterful performance as Kilmer and he just made me despise the character. Paul Walker does a good job and he does not even drive any cars! Overall this may be a clichd sports film but there are some subtle differences such as scenes involving whipped cream religious little brothers and a health teacher who is much more than that. Despite some flaws I couldn't help but root for the Moxon kid. I rate this film 910.".

Having never had the 'pleasure' of visiting Texas I have no idea if a society that is so shallow and frankly stupid could actually exist. All the wellworn clichs are here along with the pathetic ethos of sexual ethics and substance abuse that will only continue to carry American society further down into the gutter of selfdepravity. The context of football is seemingly irrelevant any kind of activity that attempts to distract such lowlife people from the sad reality of their empty lives would suffice. The intermixture of patriotism religion sport and heroworship is so confused as to further weaken and destroy any sentiments that may be engendered within the viewer. Although the final scenes are vaguely heartwarming the trollop that has preceded them only ensure that the viewer really can't give a stuff about any of the characters... In conclusion really  don't bother.".

It kind of has to do with the same idea of a great book called Friday Night Lights by H.G. Bissinger. Not totally the same but close.This movie was one of the greatest movies yet! It was perfect for me. Probably the best thing about Varsity Blues was that it was about football. It had the greatest football game scenes such as their fifth game versus Bingville. Also the game where they played their second to last game where they got killed had the greatest hits. Wow! When I saw some of these hits I just went ouch!Varsity Blues was also nominated to be the best movie I saw all summerwas because it had a killer soundtrack. I mean it had a lot of great bands including Green Day and Foo Fighters. Some of the songs during games got you pumped and there was soft songs when there was a little unhappiness going around. I especially liked the preview with Jon MoxonJames Van Der Beek running the ball with the song My Hero playing during the slow motion clip. That just stuck in my head forever.And in conclusion I believe that Varsity Blues was the best movie that i saw this summer. Not just because it had to do with football and a great soundtrack but because it had meaning. If you have ever played football on a team you know what I mean.By SRVH StudentSerg".

	schema:headline " Very entertaining sports movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1999 Varsity Blues is a sports film about football in Central Texas where high school football is virtually a religion. I was surprised at how engrossing and entertaining Varsity Blues is much more so than similar films like Remember the Titans 2000 Woodlawn 2015 and scores of others.The story revolves around a secondstring quarterback Mox James Van Der Beek who doesn't take football too seriously because he's consigned to the bench but when the team's starquarterback is seriously injured Paul Walker Mox rises to the challenge and begins to experience all the perks that come with being the football hero of the town.I'm not a huge fan of sports film unless they successfully tap into other genres. Varsity Blues does this and is part high school dramedy. The movie features everything you'd want in a film of this ilk  the sexpot cheerleader Ali Larter wild schoolmates Scott Caan Ron Lester the smart girl Amy Smart no pun intended wild parties miscellaneous comingofage antics megalomaniac coach Jon Voight and everything that goes with intense sports competition.Some people complain that the film's unrealistic because of all the extreme things that occur but the team in Varsity Blues represents the typical champion high school football team and therefore they experience the various crazy things these types of teams encounter in real life. It was the same thing with Platoon. Veterans of Vietnam say no one platoon would undergo all that this platoon experienced but the group is a microcosm of all platoons throughout the Vietnam war. Also movies like Varsity Blues and Platoon may come across as too much because filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame.Others complain about the lack of assistant coaches in the second half of the final game but we'll have to assume that they went with a certain person and the film just doesn't show it. I rate Varsity Blues as high as I do because it's a standout sports film and high school dramedy that heavily influenced the more realitybased but IMO less compelling Friday Night Lights which came out five years later. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Austin TX area Georgetown Elgin and Taylor. DIRECTOR Brian Robbins. WRITER W. Peter Iliff. GRADE A".

Once again I guess most movie goers would rather not handle the truth.I must admit when I was watching Love Ranch I was reminded of the movie Papillon in which they tried to fit a two week read into a two hour movie. I thought I was watching the same kind of movie making from a book being made into 2 hour script reducing it to bits and pieces of condensed scenes. But I guess it was merely a rushed screenplay and not a condensed book when I read about it on IMDb. I suppose part of the problem could have been the spontaneous direction in the seemingly rushed storyline. Other than that I would give this movie with better editing and direction of script a 9 or 10 rating because the intense reality and grip of the characters like between Helen and the boxer. This was incredibly well done... may sometimes been kind of unbelievable but in the end their impeccable acting crafts both pulled together a gripping story.I think without a doubt it could and should have been handled better through production but the movie itself is infinitely more meaningful than a teeny love triangular crap as in the movie I spoke of earlier. All in all a great movie that needed to be nurtured a lot more to be made into a fantastic movie.GT".

	schema:reviewBody "The film has two sags One very early on in Act I and another late in Act II. In observing a small private audience that was viewing this film they were all very much engaged in the drama and the action throughout but they were nearly lost during the two sags. If it were not for those the film might have attracted a larger audience.This is not the story of the Mustang Ranch per se but rather the story an ambiguous love triangle. I am thoroughly aware of the Mustang Ranch story and know Joe Conforte's attorney and best friend Virgil Bucchanieri quite well. For example the film does not use the gimmick of trying to exaggerate the characters that inhabit the brothel and resists the temptation of trying to replicate the exotica of the Star Wars bar scene.The real test for a film with this class of story arc is the degree to which we care about the characters midway through Act II. Do we care what happens to them in Act III? I and the other audience members all agreed that we did and we shed the expected tears in a tense moment between the dreamer played by Joe Pesci and the determined pragmatist played by Helen Mirren in the penultimate scene. None of the central or supporting roles were in any way cardboard characters.The production values were quite high and the number of technical errors were minimal three errors with production sound that really should have been fixed in post plus a couple of continuity errors. Music was very subtle to the point of vanishing at times. There was no attempt at creating a photographic theme it was all shot colorbalanced at neutral without any exaggerated focuspulls odd camera framing or moves but a lot of crane rentals were involved Promist filters or too many magic hour shots. That is the cinematography did not draw attention away from the drama.The film resolves unambiguously with a shock ending that is well worth waiting for. My final test of entertainment value is Are there any scenes in this film that I will remember and repeat in my mind's eye the next day? I would say that there are such scenes and I therefore give this picture a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "LOVE STORY is a peculiar movie. It is based on the true story of the notorious Mustang Ranch just outside of Reno Nevada a brothel that was world famous run by a couple by the name of Joe and Sally Conforte who had chutzpah and an ongoing runin with the IRS and the law in bringing in boxer Oscar Buenovena as an addendum to their game of wealth. The facts of the brothel's existence are true as are the characters portrayed in the film but a considerable amount of artistic license as to dates and chronology of event were taken by writer Mark Jacobson. The result is a strange conglomeration of a story boring as roadkill during the first half but awakening into a rather tender melodrama in the second half. And it is worth the wait. Taylor Hackford directs his wife Helen Mirren and as we have come to expect anytime Mirren is in a film there is at least a modicum of fine acting. The Confortes become the Bontempos for LOVE RANCH aka Mustang Ranch of history and Joe Pesci as Charlie Bontempo is an excon with a potty mouth who married Grace Helen Mirren 20 some years ago and together they have built the world's largest brothel  the first legal one in Nevada. Grace at first is cheap and tacky walking with a cane and constantly reminding Charlie of her importance her character changes a it when she is diagnosed with terminal cancer by her doctor Broadway singing star Harve Presnell in a tiny and last role he died in 2009 . Charlie beds all the women who work at Love Ranch and Grace is aware of it. Grace befriends her 'staff'  Gina Gershon Ling Bai Taryn Manning Scout TaylorCompton Elise Neal among others  and Charlie tends to the business of promoting the Ranch as well as taking chances with other projects such as tempting famous Argentine boxer Armando Bruza Sergio PerisMencheta to move to the Ranch for training in preparation for a fight with supposedly Muhammed Ali. Bruza arrives and insists Grace be his manager and she reluctantly accepts out of a sense of being attracted to Bruza. Her girls especially Irene Gina Gershon encourage Grace to live for the moment and give in to the desire for an affair with Bruza. Grace and Bruza do indeed find each other's soft core and fall in love. Bruza is prepared for a fight but in the fight he staggers through the first rounds only to win by a late surprise knockout Grace rushes Bruza to the hospital because of his unstable status and there she discovers Bruza suffered a previous brain injury years ago resulting the placement of a metal plate in his skull. This discovery and the events that it initiates bring the film to a tender but tragic end  on many levels. The cinematography by Kieran McGuigan is splendid when surveying the beauty of the land around Reno but uncomfortably monochromatic through most of the rest of the film. The musical score by Chris Bacon who has many fine credits for other films is almost unbearably bad. Joe Pesci made up to look very old is in this viewer's opinion miscast he rarely gets beyond being a screaming filthy mouthed moron. Helen Mirren transforms Grace from a tawdry Madame to a truly beautiful but tired partner for Charlie opting to spend her few final days with one who can demonstrate his care for her. Sergio PerisMencheta manages to make his blustering character one of compassion and vulnerability. In all this is a movie that once over seems well worth watching as the credits reveal all the facts about the destinies of everyone involved in the story. Get past the first half hour or so and you're in for a fine film. Grady Harp".

Almost every outdoor scene could be the vista for a postcard. The story itself seems to drag in places and then suddenly rush to a conclusion with narration to tidy up the ending. The acting by Helen Mirren and Joe Pesci is terrific as expected and a small scene with Harve Presnell a pleasant surprise. What is not a surprise is the tale of the Mustang Ranch on which the movie is based. It's tough to overcome the familiarity of a story often aired on cable over the last two decades.  MERK".

	schema:reviewBody "Love Ranch fooled me but good. For some reason I was picturing a raucous raunchy comedy about a legal brothel run by Joe Pesci and Helen Mirren. But it's not really that way at all no this is a standardissue melodrama about an abusive misogynist who runs his part of the world his steely wife who runs the business side of the things and the hapless pro boxer who gets mixed up with them. It's not funny because it's not supposed to be and that's kind of sad there's potential for laughs but in the end all you get are clichs and bad character choices.Charlie Pesci and Grace Mirren Bontempo open up the first legal brothel in Nevada. She's the daughter of a prostitute he's done a stretch in San Quentin. It's the 1970s. They have a pretty good setup for themselves goodlooking women steady clients and the law on their side and in their pockets. They don't want for much seemingly. Then Charlie a hotheaded tempest in a teacup if ever there was one gets the idea that they'll garner more respect or more accurately he will if they own a successful professional boxer. So he buys the contract of one Armando Bruza an upandcoming Argentinian much to Grace's chagrin. Charlie's banking on his guy doing well in his next fight based on the rumor that Muhammed Ali would take on the winner.Here Pesci plays a slightly watereddown version of Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas. He's foul mouthed ill tempered not very bright about a great many things and seems to survive on chutzpah and the good grace of well Grace. Naturally being the proprietor of a brothel has its privileges and Charlie samples the wares with some regularity an occurrence that Grace idly tolerates. When she's asked to become Bruza's manager  as a felon Charlie can't get a license  she's reluctant but the swarthy boxer has other ideas. And so it goes.Now there's nothing inherently wrong with predictability. If I expect A to happen and A happens that's okay  as long as A wasn't spelled out as a fait accompli. If I expect A to happen but B happens that is also okay  as long as B is plausible. Here I expect A to happen and A happens and it's obvious from almost the start of the movie that A will happen. This extends to character development as well. If a character does something say out of character ! that's fine  as long as it propels the plot AND makes some bit of sense. Otherwise it's just a ploy to get me to keep watching. In this movie Charlie's character is so onedimensional that when he makes an attempt to be loveydovey with Grace it's not even remotely believable. I can blame Pesci a little for this but it just seem as if he had much to work with.And for a movie that uses a brothel as its main background there's very little naughty stuff going on they may as well have set it in a video store if those still existed. There's a side plot about some highandmighty moral compass waging a war against the legal brothel but it's barely touched upon pardon the pun. The other puns are unpardonable. The plot just bounces around from issue to issue circling the main story threat of Bruza Grace and Charlie. The result is sometimes maudlin and hackneyed and other terms writers use to describe crappy writing.".

Joe gives a great performance and steals every scene he is in and is the key performance in the movie. this movie is about a short tempered business man Charlie running a prostitute organization with his wife grace. being very controversial Charlie Joe decides to find a boxer to sponsor and make money off of. Sergio Peri'smencheta plays the boxer. soon after gracefeels Charlie doesn't love her anymore ignores her and uses her. she then falls for Bruza and haves an affair with him. now in this movie at least in my opinion don't really feel that bad for grace. she is very depressed in her marriage but at the same time shes a character that you wouldn't like. she can be very stubborn. and Sergio's character is the one character that you feel sorry for. Charlie is a character that makes your emotions go wild. sometimes you like him and sometimes you don't. but Joe makes every character he plays likable. at least to me. so the whole movie i was rooting for Charlie. even when he had his anger moments. this is a well acted interesting story highly entertaining straight to DVD movie. I'm happy to see that Joe is back in Hollywood and going back to mob films. he will be doing a mob film called the Irishman starring himself AL pacino and Robert deniro.directed by martin Scorsese. Joe pesci is also doing a movie called got ti the next generation also starring himself AL pacino. also starring john travolta Lindsay lohan and Kelly Preston. directed by martin Scorsese. which i cant wait to see. back to this movie. you wont regret buying this. see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Picture a caricature of everything that America at some level holds dear yet despises. Think bling brash frantically optimistic and determinedly selfish and you have the main character typecast by a weathered Joe Pesci. Add to the mix an insecure yet intelligent and reasonably efficient brothel madam who is trapped by economics and an irresponsible hyperactive and deliberately delusional husband and. you have a marriage which must resonate across the globe. The film opens with an ironic and trite hope for the future. Auld Lang Syne is sung at a New Year's Eve party which Robert Burnes no stranger to joys of the flesh himself would possibly have avoided. A stark naked man who has transcended the bounds of good taste and possibly the law is driven by the Madam Helen Mirren into the waiting furniture wielded by her husband Pesci. The tame police in attendance remove the problem and the party continues. Gradually the dynamics of the PesciMirren relationship are revealed. She actually likes her charges and comforts herself in the knowledge that she is keeping them off the streets. He struts around like a dove with an overinflated breast a disgustingly showy car with the vanity plate LUV SEX and the nickname of Mr Good Times. He is a man whose very posture suggests violence and he has only to threaten to smash the home telephone her link to the outside world to ensure that her timid attempt at rebellion turns into a whimpering desire to please him.Pleasing him in the only way he understands is not that easy as she is older than the available nymphets and is very aware that his sudden business calls are not to any office block. The marriage of financial and social convenience could theoretically have lasted for years as many convenient couples will attest but reality has the unpleasant habit of intruding. A visit to the doctor and plastic convenience is stripped away. The selfishness of her husband is expertly conveyed in his answer to her questioning his love for her. I  love you he says I could have never found a woman as loyal as you to take my s. It says everything that he is totally unaware of the egocentric nature of his declaration of love. Later when their world is falling apart and she is experiencing loss and almost claustrophobic griefhe rails at her that she doesn't know what the  he went through all night. The tragic moment which announces the end of the film is justified by the quality of the acting. Yes this could happen and be a small article on the front page of the morning newspapers but the film has made its point before the actual violence. It is all about self the need for selfvalidation at the expense of others the need to be desirable the need to be in control and even the need to be physically dominant while all these have inevitably and irrevocably been taken away by time. It is a film worthy of a second viewing if only to enjoy the performance of Pesci which he has reprized from Goodfellas and the revelation which is Helen Mirren. That she could go from the ultra British role as the Queen to this without a trace of genteel accent but retain all the pathos of a woman who wants to love her husband and her life is remarkable. Even the director gives her credit in an in joke. When her husband dons a hat in keeping with his personality she asks him who he thinks he is 'Clint Eastwood'. He replies Who do you think you are? The Queen of England?Eminently watchable characterdriven and filmed with an understated slickness this is a film which might regrettably not set the box office alight but which is very worth viewing for so many reasons. True there are elements that echo events in some wellknown films which my spoilerconscience prevents me from naming but it is safe to say that this film strips the sentimentality from such and is the better for it. Taylor Hackford I look forward to your next.".

A visit to the doctor and plastic convenience is stripped away. The selfishness of her husband is expertly conveyed in his answer to her questioning his love for her. I  love you he says I could have never found a woman as loyal as you to take my s. It says everything that he is totally unaware of the egocentric nature of his declaration of love. Later when their world is falling apart and she is experiencing loss and almost claustrophobic griefhe rails at her that she doesn't know what the  he went through all night. The tragic moment which announces the end of the film is justified by the quality of the acting. Yes this could happen and be a small article on the front page of the morning newspapers but the film has made its point before the actual violence. It is all about self the need for selfvalidation at the expense of others the need to be desirable the need to be in control and even the need to be physically dominant while all these have inevitably and irrevocably been taken away by time. It is a film worthy of a second viewing if only to enjoy the performance of Pesci which he has reprized from Goodfellas and the revelation which is Helen Mirren. That she could go from the ultra British role as the Queen to this without a trace of genteel accent but retain all the pathos of a woman who wants to love her husband and her life is remarkable. Even the director gives her credit in an in joke. When her husband dons a hat in keeping with his personality she asks him who he thinks he is 'Clint Eastwood'. He replies Who do you think you are? The Queen of England?Eminently watchable characterdriven and filmed with an understated slickness this is a film which might regrettably not set the box office alight but which is very worth viewing for so many reasons. True there are elements that echo events in some wellknown films which my spoilerconscience prevents me from naming but it is safe to say that this film strips the sentimentality from such and is the better for it. Taylor Hackford I look forward to your next.";

Reopened without IRS they operated for a few years until the second and final IRS closing.

	schema:reviewBody "Love Ranch is a fictionalized biopic loosely based on the true story of Joe  Sally Conforte. The Conforte's were the first people to open a legalized brothel in the state of Nevada and for a while became local celebrities until it all came crashing down. It was an interesting story following the lives of two people that most of us don't know anything about. As for the film while it overdramatized a lot of the events it really fails to make much of an impact. There are scenes that make these two look like gangsters others that make them look like royalty and several that just makes them look like trailer trash. The truth is that it was hard to really decipher the true character of these people and figure out what they were really like. I was mildly interested in the story but what I really wanted to see was the return of Joe Pesci. Since retiring in 1999 Pesci had a cameo in one film but this is was his first leading role since Lethal Weapon 4. For the living legend it was as if he had never stopped giving a terrific performance. The only disappointing thing was that they kept Pesci's classic profanity laced tirades to a minimum but other than that he was really terrific. Helen Mirren on the other hands kind of annoyed me in this film. She's always been an amazing actress but her performance was really all over the place. I guess it has to do with the emotional state of the woman she was playing but to be honest I was very unimpressed by what I saw from her. While it was great to see Joe Pesci back on the big screen the Love Ranch was really just a mass of confusion that was all over the place. It was nearly impossible to separate the truth from the Hollywood bull when personalities and situations are changing so rapidly. If you love Joe Pesci you won't want to miss his comeback but the film that brought him out of retirement really isn't anything special.".

	schema:reviewBody "After enjoying some success with the surprisingly enjoyable  cheesy Spy Kids  Director and all around good guy Robert Rodriguez now brings forth a sequel Spy Kids 2 The Island of Lost Dreams which is far less enjoyable and far more cheesy.   As a matter of fact you'd be hard pressed to find more cheese anywhere outside of a Wisconsin dairy farm.Juni and Carmen Cortez Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega are back now officially a part of OSS and officially recognized as Spy Kids.  But the OSS just like every other government bureaucracy cannot resist expanding upon a good thing so now there is an entire army of spy kids at their disposal but Juni and Carmen are of course the most renowned. Within in the first opening minutes of the film which takes place in a truly inspired theme park we quickly discern that Juni and Carmen have rivals the Giggle kids Matthew O'Leary and Emily Osment who dearly covet the Cortez' fame and status.  With help of their conniving father Mike Judge the Giggles do what they can not only to surpass the Cortez family but to humiliate them as well.Once again we find the greatest threat to the OSS is the OSS itself along with the internal politics and treachery which played a small but significant part in the plot of the first film.   It seems as if the OSS is more of a threat to world peace than a help and one wonders why Uncle Sam doesn't just shut the operation down and call it a day.  Perhaps it would prevent the making of any more Spy Kids movies which I'm beginning to think would be a very good thing.The plot revolves around a device known as a transmooker   which can be best described as the ultimate cloaking device even able to cloak entire islands off the map.  It also has the wonderful ability to render all electronic devices useless which is quite a thorn in the side of the intrepid Spy Kids who's reliance on James Bond style fancy gadgets is only a shade less than an alcoholic's dependence on his next drink.  Of course the transmooker itself is an electronic device but somehow is immune to its own nasty effects.  Only in Hollywood....So our two heroes Juni and Carmen locate the cloaked island where the stolen transmooker was taken and attempt to find it before their rivals the Giggles kids do.  The island turns out to be a retirement resort for every single monstrous creature ever created by Ray Harryhausen Jason and the Argonauts 7th Voyage of Sinbad etc..  Except we are told that they were created by the socially insecure and somewhat troubled scientist Dr. Romero Steve Buscemi who was looking for some companionship and a portable zoo.  But of course those of us who've seen a few movies in our time know better.  During the same time there is a completely boring and totally unnecessary subplot involving Carmen  Juni's parents and grandparents.  The only reason the subplot exists is to cloak this poor homage to Harryhausen as a family film.  Yeah right.  I certainly fell for it.Hollywood films especially actionadventures and scifi flicks often  ask the audience to suspend logic and rational thought while the plot thickens. It is the price we pay beyond the ticket price for the pleasure of being entertained.  But Spy Kids 2 doesn't just ask for a suspension of belief but a wholesale slaughter of anything remotely resembling intelligence. That's a big price to pay and one I was unable to justify. If Daniel Rodriguiez is such a fan of Harryhausen then he should make The 8th Voyage of Sinbad or some such thing rather than trying to find a way to incorporate Ray's creatures into a movie allegedly about espionage.  The CGI recreations of Harryhausen's monsters was one of the more enjoyable aspects of this horrid film but not enough to pull it out of the slimy pit in which very poor writing knocks it into.  The dialogue is stupid even for kids to listen to.  Most of the jokes fall as flat as the acting.   Much of the cuteness and fun of the first Spy Kids film is completely lacking in the sequel.  Instead we have a very disjointed plot an adventure that leads to nowhere and a subplot that should have been locked in the submarine where it mostly takes place. My Rating 410".

I also appreciated the references to the original   and the special effects were even better than the first.The hardest people to please in this case would be my 2 daughters 4  7 who own the first Spy Kids on DVD and have seen it so many times they can act out the scenes down to the facial expressions and body motions.  When they saw Spy Kids 2 this past weekend they were transfixed and left the theater excited about seeing Carmen and Juni in their latest adventure.A great movie for adults and kids... I cannot recommend this sequel highly enough!".

I also appreciated the references to the original   and the special effects were even better than the first.The hardest people to please in this case would be my 2 daughters 4  7 who own the first Spy Kids on DVD and have seen it so many times they can act out the scenes down to the facial expressions and body motions.  When they saw Spy Kids 2 this past weekend they were transfixed and left the theater excited about seeing Carmen and Juni in their latest adventure.A great movie for adults and kids... I cannot recommend this sequel highly enough!";

	schema:reviewBody "To its credit Spy Kids 2 does indeed display a lot of creativity and imagination and that makes it a lot better than most family movies Hollywood makes. However while the first Spy Kids was a fun romp that kids AND adults would enjoy this sequel isn't as much fun.I think the biggest flaw is that this sequel is missing heart. We don't feel the warmth between the family members as we previously did. Yes the youthful siblings did fight and disagree a lot in the first movie but you could still sense a solid bond between them. There's no sense of the characters feeling danger excitement and a sense of adventure as they did the first time around. Instead there is a coldness a mechanical feeling this time like they are very familiar and almost bored with with what they are experiencing even with each other. The presence of two snotty and selfish rival child spies just furthers this somewhat sour tone.While kids might not mind this too much I think even they will agree with the second problem I found  the story here is VERY confusing at times. For one thing the movie seems to start at chapter two jumping ahead of itself before the audience is set and ready. Then after that there are a number of moments where we keep thinking Huh? How did this character get there all of a sudden? and Huh? What on earth happened offscreen to make what we are now seeing happen? Very annoying. It's all made worse by a pace that is MUCH too fast even for an adventure of this nature.Note to Robert Rodriguez I understand you will soon start Spy Kids 3. Please not only take notice of what I've said above but take note of Daryl Sabara Juni. Though not a bad actor there were a number of instances where he didn't enunciate his dialogue clearly enough which lead me to rewind back a few seconds and use captions. Please take care of this on set or at the very least patch it up during postproduction looping.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Spy Kids is an incredibly over the top but entertaining film for younger audiences and even though I still recommend this sequel I think that its just a little too over the top. Story is of course about Carmen Alexa Vega and Juni Daryl Sabara who have become top spies for their agency but now they are in competition for the best jobs by another brothersister spy team. A gadget called the Transmooger that can shut down any defense system is stolen from the President and Juni is blamed for his carelessness. The Agency sends Gary Matthew O'Leary and Gerti Emily Osment who are the children of Donnagon Mike Judge who is in charge of Operations so Carmen hacks into the computer and has the mission changed so that she and Juni are sent instead. They travel underwater to an island that is invisible and inhabited by strange looking creatures but they have to hurry because Gary and Gerti will be showing up eventually to get the Transmooger that they are trying to find as well. The meet Romero Steve Buscemi who is hidden underground because he was the one that created all the creatures and he thinks they want to kill him. Meanwhile Gregorio Antonio Banderas and Ingrid Cortez Carla Gugino are in pursuit to find their children along with the help of Grandfather Ricardo Montalban and Grandmother Holland Taylor. Not only did Robert Rodriguez direct this film but he also wrote edited produced scored and did the production design. I'm sure he did other things as well and this shows that he remembers his days as a poor independent filmmaker with this type of self reliance. Rodriguez has a wild imagination and its not uncommon in his films for him to throw everything at an audience but the kitchen sink. This film is chock full of digital effects and at times it bordered on being more animated than live action. As much as I enjoyed the first film I always told people that I thought it would be even better if the story was more simplified. Have the kids in more realistic situations like James Bond but instead we got a cartoonish film with walking thumbs and gadgets that even Bond himself would laugh at. Here in this sequel it goes even more over the top with such outlandish situations that even Indiana Jones would be clueless. I couldn't decide which was more incredible the giant monsters on the island or the fact that parents were sending their small children out on dangerous missions to save the world! Another thing I noticed was the sister of Haley Joel Osment who plays one of the other spy kids. It may be too soon to judge her but after watching Emily Osment's performance in this film she should beg her brother for acting lessons. She has an eternity to go. I am recommending this film for its wild imagination and high tech energy and their are some nice tributes to the great Ray Harryhausen but if they continue to make these sequels they might want to think about simplifying the stories.".

But then a backup Spy Kids team of Gary Matt O'Leary from Frailty and Gerti Emily Osment sister of Haley Joel Giggles are sent in as well. The situation becomes competitive with the Cortezes rescuing Alexandra while the Giggleses retrieve the dangerous device the Transmooger that she had stolen from her father's office.As in the first film Carmen and Juni's parents are Gregorio Antonio Banderas and Ingrid Carla Gugino who are also spies working for OSS. Gregorio is up for a major promotion but like his children he is also competing with the Giggles family. The dinner at which the winner of this promotion is announced is the launching pad for the heart of the film.Other key characters returning from the first film are uncle Machete Cortez Danny Trejo and Felix Gumm Cheech Marin. And then there is Doctor Romero Steve Buscemi who is a very interesting character.The film was actually shot using high definition video which looked good enough to never be a distraction. It had been transferred to film for exhibition so the normal film wear and tear issues applied especially since I saw it near the tail end of its theatrical run.Besides using digital video the director Robert Rodriguez also used another trick to save money he did almost everything himself. He was the writer cinematographer editor production designer and visual effects supervisor and also helped produce and score the film. Apparently he did much of this work in his garage in Austin Texas.The first film was very fun and unexpected. This one feels a little too much like more of the same and it also adds a touch more gross humor than I think it needed to. It's still fun and definitely worth at least a rental but it's not quite up to the level of the first film.Seen on 1092002.".

This one felt even more artificial than the first! The visual fx were fairly were decent in parts but also very fake in others but the overall artificiality remains in the world of the Spy Kids themselves.In the sequel we see an established Spy Kid network which our heroes Carmen and Juni Cortez Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara find themselves having some competition from the Giggles children Matt O'Leary and Emily Osmont in the field of saving the world. The plot involves the Cortez kids heading to a mysterious island to retrieve a stolen weapon while encountering genetically mutated very fake looking creatures as well as a scientist named Romero Steve Buscemi. Now Romero is falsely advertised as the villain of the film but from the onset he befriends the pair. Meanwhile the Spy Kid's parents Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are looking for them with the grandparents Ricardo Montalban and Holland Taylor assisting them in their search. Now the problem with sequel is the overall storyline is not as good as the first film. There isn't a moment where I am drawn into this bizarre universe nor am I ever afraid for the characters or feel they are overcoming major hurdles in the adventure or amongst themselves. It is this sort of artificiality that bothers me about 'Spy Kids 2 Island of Lost Dreams'. I've seen plenty of kids movies in my time and many feel like they are genuinely overcoming a hurdle or uniting a family rift or having a character reach a point of enlightenment. The subplot with the grandparents and Gregorio Antonio Banderas just didn't work for me at all although the outcome was decent the lead up to it was rather formulaic and uninteresting. Similarly the fatherson rift subplot was extremely tame and bland. 'Spy Kids 2 Island of Lost Dreams' also lacked villain power as if the bad guys were doing their thing for the sake of doing it rather than establishing some madness behind their methods. The overall plot was generally disappointing.However there is some decent moments. The interaction between Alexa Vega and Darly Sambara work very well and they are an extremely likable but the writing and Robert Rodriguez's direction are just having them going through the motions and the pacing of the film even seems awkward. Cheech Marin Alan Cummings Tony Shaloub and Danny Trejo all return in limited roles to further the plot. Mike Judge of 'Beavis and Butthead' fame returns in a bigger role as Donnagon Giggles and their is another decent cameo which I won't spoil. Overall for the reasons stated the film lacks the magic of other kid's films and this is partly due to the artificiality of the storycharacters and some of the visual effects. out of !".

Instead of naive agents who SOMEHOW defeat evil the oncecute kids are now James Bond Juniors with super gadgets and powers!!! And to make things worse the movie is even more special effects drenched than the first. It's a total mess with unlikeable characters a muddled plot and hackneyed writing. Adults or anyone with an IQ larger than their shoe size should stay away at all costs! If you LIKED seeing a good film followed up by a HORRIBLE sequel you might also try watching Babe Pig in the City. Somehow it manages to make an even better original movie and transform it into an even more unwatchable sequel! Only masochists should watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "After becoming the first kid agents Carmen and Juni are now just part of a much bigger OSS Juniors agency and are not the toast of the town anymore. When a secret device is stolen from under their noses Juni and Carmen are suspended from the OSS and their main rivals sent on a mission to a mysterious island to recover their loss. However Carmen and Juni learn the details of the mission and gazump Gary and Gerti Giggles by hacking the computer system. They head to the island but can they redeem themselves or will they only make it worse? Although the film has lost the novelty value of Carmen and Juni's adventure into a new world and this film has made everything bigger and more exaggerated if indeed that was even possible. This is a bit of a problem in terms of the story and the spectacle of the film but it more or less holds it together by having the same sense of fun just about holding it together. The story is just as silly as the first film but the effects are bigger but not better and in a way this takes away a little from the fun  the spectacle is not good enough to carry the film but at times that exactly what it feels like it is trying to do. It still has a good dose of humour and is certainly not boring for adults but it must be said that I did not find it as enjoyable as the first film.The overuse of average effects is one problem that I didn't expect with Rodriguez but there it was. Other than that the film is well directed with the silly tone of the film in mind and still moves along well enough. The cast are not as much of a help as they were in the first film. Vega and Sabara are both still good and avoid all the traps of the cute kids in films. Banderas and Gugino are less well used this time although they do share some amusing scenes with Montalban and Taylor. Cheech Trejo Buscemi and Cumming all show up but don't add that much  although I laughed out loud at McDonald's doomed line early on in the film.Overall a colourful and noisy film that will please slightly older kids but is not as much fun as the original Spy Kids. The humour is still there and it doesn't take itself too seriously but the refreshingly different sense of amusement in the first film is not quite the same while all the problems are just repeated again but louder. Still distracting though.".

And what we get is the same mismash of the first film.Plot It is upto OSS agents Carmen and Juni to recover a Transmooker device from a mysterious island.Story and direction As usual there is nothing much interesting to the story. BUt the way Robert decides to go with the story is very conventional. He follows the same old route that he followed with the first film. Even we have some new characters that are added to this venture but none of them seem very likable. That may be because Robert Rodriguesz liked to do everything in the film but doesn't excel in any part. Although the visual effects are a wee bit better than the first film but still it is a pain to the eyes considering the film's that came before this one employed much better VFX. And the implausibilties are so much that you cringe in almost every scene at the stupidity that happens. I am not saying that I have a problem with stupidity. But there is always a way to make it presentable where this film fails the most.Performances Alexa Vega and Carla Juni were again adorable as the Spy Kids agents. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino were likable. Why were Alan Cummin and Tony Shalhoub asked to return for this is still not understandable to me. Danny Trejo is will be always rememberede as Machete. The other rival kids were kind of irritating. I don't know whether it was their acting or characterization I hated them.Verdict Stepping down from the first film Spy Kidfs 2 was not a great watch for me. I kept seeing my watch as to when this film will be over. Again this film will bring some smiles on the kids' faces but nothing for teenagers or adults.I am going with a 410.".

I don't know whether it was their acting or characterization I hated them.Verdict Stepping down from the first film Spy Kidfs 2 was not a great watch for me. I kept seeing my watch as to when this film will be over. Again this film will bring some smiles on the kids' faces but nothing for teenagers or adults.I am going with a 410.";

The story revolves around the Italian woman Safiye who with the help of the black eunuch Nadir rises to become the Sultan's favorite wife. The old servant's tale is interwoven with Safiye who weaves her own story to another Italian woman at a train station.Do we always retell our stories as they happen to others? Stories are interwoven within stories not only of what happens but also what it is we would liked to have happened and wished we had done differently. As the Empire finally falls and the Sultan escapes to Europe leaving all the concubines behind the stories will unfold. What will happen to the ladies of the Harem to Safiye and to Nadir who deeply loved Safiye? The story is intelligent. The film is beautifully photographed.

The importance of Toledo to Jose Bello Dali Buuel and Lorca is explained and what impact Velazquez Goya and Cervantes had in Buuel's films. Also explained is why the acting in his films is always sober and never overacted i.e. use of eyebrows and nodding etc.. Although it is in chronological order from birth to death it somehow does not feel complete. But a documentary can't really fathom ALL essential factors in the life and work of such an icon in cinema in 98 minutes when 8 minutes are spent on how Buuel used to drink his Martini's.'I discovered cinema in 1908 as an attraction at the carnival a simple technical discovery. But it was the invasion of something totally new in our Medieval universe.'More than twenty friends actors cinematographers family and writers are interviewed and there are many excerpts from most of Buuel's films. Luis Bunuel even has some screen time as he is interviewed that must be at least 18 years before the making of this documentary. I was disappointed that neither cinematographer Edmond Richard who shot Bunuel's last three films and Le Proces Welles 1963 wasn't interviewed nor Fernando Rey. Another flaw is that Buuel is made into a hero while he made mistakes too e.g. why was it that he never worked with Dali again after l'Age d'or? Wasn't that because of major differences in the visual ideas of Buuel and Dali? The riot over l'Age d'or is illustrated though. I was delighted to see that the emphasis in this documentary is on Buuel as a person and on his surrealist freedom. If you like one or more of the films by Buuel you will want to see this twice.910".

However the President himself requests Juni return to service as his sister is in danger.  She has entered and become trapped in a deadly video game called Game Over which has been designed by the Toymaker.  In it he ensnares children's minds forever.  Juni is sent in to rescue her and team up to stop the Toymaker's evil plot.  Enlisting his grandfather's help Juni sets out to win the unwinable level 5.I usually don't enter a film series in the middle simply because it is often difficult to appreciate the third instalment of anything without having seen what has gone before.  However when it comes to a kids' film I was pretty sure that I could managed to battle through the labyrinthlike plotting of the Sky Kids series!  I started watching this film in 3D I had a 2 dvd set but the glasses were a little uncomfortable and the colours looked funny all the way through.  After seeing a few items sort of float vaguely around my television I was quite unimpressed and decided just to go with the 2D disk.  The plot is pretty thin it's never really clear what the attraction of the game is or what the Toymaker even wants but it sets up a colourful and enjoyable little ride through a computer game  which is delivered pretty well despite all it's silliness!The main weapon in the Spy Kids' cannon is it's stars  both actors and director.  Rodriguez is a very good director when it comes to style and action and his influence makes this film a lot more fun than others likely would.  He is slick but also fully aware that he needs to make it fun' and not just colourful and noisy.  It's all a bit silly of course but the 3D gimmick is a little bit heavy at times like the old films in the 50's that had actors punching at the screen but it isn't that bad.  The reason the silliness doesn't really damage the film is because the actors seem to play to it  and a very fine series of performances these are.  Pretty much all the cast are good fun and their performances are about as hammy and fun as you can imagine.  Sabara is great fun  a cool kid without any of the horrid cutesy stuff that can happen.  I found Vega less fun as she was a little too smart for my liking but she was still fun and the rest of the kids were suitably fun with not a bad performance between them.  The adult cast will provide much of the fun for the adults watching  there is a large number of Rodriguez regulars in the cast who all overplay to suit the sense of fun the film has.Montalban is great fun. Forever Khan in my mind he has a great voice and screen presence and he heavy makes the message of forgiveness work reasonably well and not just being mawkish like it should be! Stallone hams it up and has good fun even if his multiple personalities don't totally work.  Clooney has fun in his small role but the rest of the cast are all cameos some of them are used pretty well and got a giggle but others just show their faces.  However they don't detract from the film and it at least will amuse parents to see people like Martin Trejo Cumming Shalhoub Buscemi Paxton Wood and Hayek.  The out takes at the end made me realise how good the performances were  it just never dawned on me that although I knew it wasn't real that 95 of this was shot on greenscreen  making acting to anything that little bit harder.Overall this is a silly film but it is one that kids will love.  The sheer sense of fun that Rodriguez brings to it is infectious and makes for a great 90 minutes with the kids.  The star cast made it more enjoyable for me and helped the sense that everyone was just enjoying themselves.  It is hardly a great film but it does just what you expect it to do and who can ask anymore than that? On the basis of this I will definitely be watching the first two films when I cross their paths. Sad  but true!".

	schema:reviewBody "Get your little ones ready for the game of their lives cuz Spy Kids 3D Game Over' will tickle their little bitty funny bones. This third installment of the popular Spy Kids' series is like its predecessors in that it's hightech highenergy highfun and high on the profamily moral messages. What's more it's in 3D which requires disposable glasses handed out at the theater. On the downside the Spy Kids theme seems worn out the actors have outgrown their roles and the strong familyvalues messages are disingenuous and schmaltzy. In short the cow's been milked for all its got.But anyway back to the fun.In this new adventure Juni and Carmen Cortez find themselves on a mission to stop the release of a virtualreality video game aptly titled Game Over'. It is purported to be the best video game ever and lines outside toy stores are growing around the country.

This third installment of the popular Spy Kids' series is like its predecessors in that it's hightech highenergy highfun and high on the profamily moral messages. What's more it's in 3D which requires disposable glasses handed out at the theater. On the downside the Spy Kids theme seems worn out the actors have outgrown their roles and the strong familyvalues messages are disingenuous and schmaltzy. In short the cow's been milked for all its got.But anyway back to the fun.In this new adventure Juni and Carmen Cortez find themselves on a mission to stop the release of a virtualreality video game aptly titled Game Over'. It is purported to be the best video game ever and lines outside toy stores are growing around the country. But the ISS has learned that the infamous level five' captures the mind of the player entrapping him eternally within the game.

There are clever ideas here and there a few laughs the occasional decent special effect I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive but the lame tossedtogether script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable. This movie seems to just be going through the motions you can't even call it formulaic because it barely attempts to even stick with any formula it's more like random stuff thrown in here and there. As for the ending well it's main purpose was to create an excuse and not a very good one to have cameos by everyone who was in the first two movies allowing them to list Bandaras first in the credits even though he's on screen for only a couple of minutes and the final showdown is so utterly moronic that words fail me.At the same time I didn't actually hate it. I wasn't in pain watching it. It was a mindless Saturday afternoon movie and I watched it as mindlessly as I could and occasionally enjoyed it. But after the very fun second movie which I thought superior to the first this was a great disappointment. I'd advise skipping it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spy Kids 3D Game Over is a weak conclusion to the very entertaining Spy Kids franchise. Agents Juni and Carmen Cortez set out on their most mindblowing mission yet journeying inside the virtual reality world of a 3D video game designed to outsmart them as the aweinspiring graphics and creatures of gaming come to real life. Relying on gadgetry bravery family bonds and lightningquick reflexes the Spy Kids must battle through tougher and tougher levels of the game in order to save the world from a power hungry villain. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution wasn't very good. I really don't have a problem with 3D but just because it is in 3D doesn't mean everything else has to be bad. The first two had good stories and were entertaining to watch. This one had a poor story and at times was too painful to watch. The acting took a drop from the previous film as most of the performances were bad. Sylvester Stallone did the worst out of everybody and I was wondering why he was even cast as his career is pretty much over. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play the two kids Juni and Carmen. In the first two they give decent performances but in this one they were awful. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino don't really appear in the film which is probably better for them. There are also a series of cameos including Salma Hayek and George Clooney. Robert Rodriguez does a rather bad job of directing as the film looks like a mess. The script is terrible and predictable. The ending is really bad as it just seemed like some cheap way to include everyone in the film. The entire film felt rushed and they should had spent more time on it. The 3D isn't even that impressive and they focused on that then more than anything else. The film is also not very enjoyable to watch. When the film isn't in 3D it gets really boring and most of the dialog isn't very funny either. The special effects were cheesy and looked really bad. The running time was a brief 90 minutes yet that felt a lot longer with the dull story. There is just very little to like here and I think they blew it as they could had made a very successful franchise in terms of quality not money making. In the end this is a poor film and its better if kids and adults alike just skip it. Rating 310".

	schema:reviewBody "I just came home from watching it and everyone is running for the Advils it seems that the 3D gave us all headaches. Anyways here is my review.I have had a 3D book since I was a kid and it came with it's own pair of 3D glasses. You know the old fasioned kind the red and blue shaded glasses that gives everything the red  blue tint. It is a very cool book with the old kind of 3D.Now I remember in the 80's all the NEW 3D movies had a whole new 3D. No longer were 3D movies limited to the red  blue tint that required the red  blue shaded glasses the glasses that were needed were clear  POLORIZED....it kept the movie in FULL color and gave the 3D film a cleaner and sharper image.I heard that this movie was a whole new approach to 3 demention so I was excited about seeing this. But imagine my surprise when I bought the tickets when they handed me red  blue shaded 3D glasses.The only new approach is the computer graphics used in creating 3D images. Instead of throwing real items towards the camera to make you duck in your seat now there are computer generated items floating around and flying towards you. The special effects were as always top quality...but honestly...there was nothing new or special about the special effects. In reality you feel as though you've seen it all before.As for the 3D effects. I must say how disappointed I was. The color in the film during the 3D scenes seemed dull and almost a sepia tone except for the red  blue tint used to make the images in 3D.I REALLY expected at LEAST a POLORIZED image for a bolder color and clearer 3 demention. Instead all I got was a trip down memory lane with the old fashioned 3D.Now if you have never SEEN a 3D movie dont get me wrong it STILL is a spactacular thing to see and you SHOULD experience it. The kids will LOVE it.As for the storyline in this film....well forget it. This wasn't created to carry a plot it was created to become a cashcow in the Spy Kids series and used 3D to draw you in. It worked but this plot didn't.And if THIS film doesn't KILL Sylvester Stallone's movie career then it's ALREADY DEAD! I was never more embarressed for an actor before than I was for him in this one. This was almost like seeing him wave a white flag and admit to being an aging Hollywood castaway who is grasping at ANYTHING to stay on screen. Think Bette Davis's charactor in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?Oh well. Your kids will love this 3D mess and if your easily amused you might also.".

	onyx:emotionText "I just came home from watching it and everyone is running for the Advils it seems that the 3D gave us all headaches. Anyways here is my review.I have had a 3D book since I was a kid and it came with it's own pair of 3D glasses. You know the old fasioned kind the red and blue shaded glasses that gives everything the red  blue tint. It is a very cool book with the old kind of 3D.Now I remember in the 80's all the NEW 3D movies had a whole new 3D. No longer were 3D movies limited to the red  blue tint that required the red  blue shaded glasses the glasses that were needed were clear  POLORIZED....it kept the movie in FULL color and gave the 3D film a cleaner and sharper image.I heard that this movie was a whole new approach to 3 demention so I was excited about seeing this. But imagine my surprise when I bought the tickets when they handed me red  blue shaded 3D glasses.The only new approach is the computer graphics used in creating 3D images. Instead of throwing real items towards the camera to make you duck in your seat now there are computer generated items floating around and flying towards you. The special effects were as always top quality...but honestly...there was nothing new or special about the special effects.

AS I type this i can't remember what even happened. Anyways the 2nd one was garbage made no sense green screen sucked effects sucked and why are they call spies? was there even a villain in this movie because the Giggle guy was also in the 3rd one without any punishment it seems. 2nd spy kids movie is awaste of time. The 1 thing that baffles me is that Juni get the blame when he didn't really do anything but do the right thing.3rd spy kids movie would work if they didn't call them spy kids. Iunno why they call them spy kids when they don't do anything spyish. His sister was barely in the movie. They always go from evil guy to respecting him without punishing him for what they have done. This movie was garbage green screen even in those days looks bad.Inconclusion only movie of the 3 worth watching is the 1st one even so all movies are a waste of time. only good of the movies were the mom and dad but even after the 1st one they are portrayed as clumsy wash ups.".

The plot is predictable the acting is deplorable and the visuals are downright awful.

The noir style opening would have gone completely over the heads of the main target audience. Sylvester Stallone was good as were the cameo appearances by George Clooney Elijah Wood Bill Paxton and Steve Buscemi.The computer generated sets looked tacky.

	schema:headline " Stunning and wittyShakespeare at his best";
	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth Branagh has done so much for Shakespeare...I've almost become a complete zealot of his work. This screen adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesserknown comedies is absolutely divine. The lovers Claudio and Hero are completely and wonderfully upstaged by Benedick and Beatrice the most perfectly mismatched pair in the history of love exactly as they were meant to be. The chemistry between Ken and Emma is so believable after all this was filmed before their marriage ended the lines are so cunningly delivered and the plot is so beautifully twisted and resolved that this movie is at the very top of my list of favorites. The setting is absolutely gorgeousItaly in all its Summer glory. You can fairly taste the sunshine. Each part is completely delightful Michael Keaton is perfect in one of the most bizarrely comedic roles I've ever seen and as far as Keanu Reeves' performance all I can say is that the part was written to be played in that manner. Don John was a bad guy of necessityevery comedy must have a foil. I found the entire production to be beautifully done and quite up to the professional standards that I've come to expect under Branagh's excellent direction. The wit sparkles and cracks between Beatrice and Benedick a direct counter to the more traditional and borderline sappy form of Elizabethan love exhibited between Hero and Claudio. This is how the wise woo and no it is never peaceably! A smart funny and visually stunning gem of a film to add to Branagh's already distinguished repertoire. I'm waiting for his MacBeth.".

This screen adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesserknown comedies is absolutely divine. The lovers Claudio and Hero are completely and wonderfully upstaged by Benedick and Beatrice the most perfectly mismatched pair in the history of love exactly as they were meant to be. The chemistry between Ken and Emma is so believable after all this was filmed before their marriage ended the lines are so cunningly delivered and the plot is so beautifully twisted and resolved that this movie is at the very top of my list of favorites. The setting is absolutely gorgeousItaly in all its Summer glory. You can fairly taste the sunshine. Each part is completely delightful Michael Keaton is perfect in one of the most bizarrely comedic roles I've ever seen and as far as Keanu Reeves' performance all I can say is that the part was written to be played in that manner. Don John was a bad guy of necessityevery comedy must have a foil. I found the entire production to be beautifully done and quite up to the professional standards that I've come to expect under Branagh's excellent direction. The wit sparkles and cracks between Beatrice and Benedick a direct counter to the more traditional and borderline sappy form of Elizabethan love exhibited between Hero and Claudio. This is how the wise woo and no it is never peaceably! A smart funny and visually stunning gem of a film to add to Branagh's already distinguished repertoire. I'm waiting for his MacBeth.";

	schema:headline " Truly Wonderful! A great movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant!  Kenneth Branagh's version of the timeless William Shakespeare classic is a great rendition of the film making it accessible to everyone even those who do not like Shakespeare.Let me first say that I am a great fan of Shakespeare's works.  In college I was an English literature major with a minor in theater and so Shakespeare is found in both.  Theater people state that Shakespeare was never literature at all which in the purpose of the plays is true however because of the prose that he wrote in is a poetic form he is literature as well.  Whatever you do never get in between two people arguing this point your head might blow up!Reading the comments on this page the basic attack on this movie is that Branagh cuts lines and shaved parts.  Yes of course he did.  Nothing is sacred not even the works of Shakespeare people.  I myself was in a Shakespeare play and over half the script was cut from it.  With a Shakespeare play the question is what to cut.  If this play had been presented in it's entirety it would have been close to five hours long. And today's movie audience just does not have that kind of patience.  Titanic was stretching it a little in terms of time.  Shakespeare's original audience would have had no problem because they made a day of it.So when Branagh did this play he had to shave off a great deal of the script and he had to decide what to focus on.  He had to focus on the main characters being Beatrice and Benedict and their romance and of course the drama concerning Hero and Claudio but also keep other characters incorporated as well.  For those attacking the whittling down of the script why didn't anyone bring up the point that Benedict is supposed to have shaved his beard while in attempt to woo Beatrice.  Why?  Because it really isn't a major plot point that is needed at all.  So Branagh made great choices in his direction of the film and in the end he made sure that everything tied together logically and that there were no loose ends.The performances by the actors were great as well.  There was nothing wrong with casting Denzel Washington as the prince though people seem to have a beef with it.  He pulled it off very well.  And Keanu Reeves did a great job as well.  It was a treat to see him as a villain.  I happen to be a fan of Reeves and I do see him as great casting though why people also have a problem with him I'll never know.  Branagh was going for acting ability not just names.  Reeves has the goods and he can speak Shakespeare very well it's his character that's supposed to be moody.  And Keaton was a wonderful choice for the Constable making me laugh whenever he was on the screen. And the other actors all did very well in their roles.If you're a lover of Shakespeare or not this film is a great treat and it appeals to all audiences who love the classic masterpiece.".

I admire his imagination and ingenuity which he applies to his work. He created beautiful picturesque entertaining amusing and hilarious movie with awesome actor's work and fine music. Some cuts of the original play were essential to make the movie dynamic and the play was not considerably damaged. All members of the starring cast make Shakespearean text sound natural alive and very funny. Emma Thompson shines as bright gingerhaired Beatrice. It goes without saying that she's an actress of unique talent and in this film she does an amazing job being lively sharp and witty sparkling with energy humor and cheerfulness or sometimes vehement and passionate when her cousin is offended. Branagh as Benedick is up to her. Other notable performances are given by imposing Brian Blessed seigneur Antonio and Richard Briers seigneur Leonato. Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckinsale as Claudio and Hero are adequate and beautiful pair. Keanu Reeves is really good in the part of grim villainous Don John notwithstanding opinions of many reviewers here. Michael Keaton's Constable Dogberry and other comic characters makes me laugh a lot through the film. Definitely this is an excellent film for enjoyment. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "The arrival of Don Pedro and his men at the home of Seigneur Leonato in Messina brings about much celebration.  The spirit of love and happiness is alive in the party and Count Claudio and Leonato's daughter Hero make woo and engage to marry within a week.  To pass the time Don Pedro makes a pledge to engage confirmed bachelor Benedick and the bickering Beatrice together in a tower of affection.  However Claudio's brother Don John conspires to break up the wedding by making accusations against young Hero. Will it all be much ado about nothing?If anyone has done more to bring Shakespeare to a modern audience of multiplex dwellers I'd like to meet them.  Here Branagh yet again adapts a Shakespeare play to good effect trimming the dialogue of some important sections with the aim of creating a lighter feel worthy of the title.  I make no mention of the plot suffice to say that Branagh has done well to keep the essence and feel of the work very true but without forcing the tools that Shakespeare readily used but may not work on modern audiences easily i.e. not being able to recognise someone easily when they wear a mask veil or moustache!.The dialogue is very sparky as you'd expect and Branagh has done well to interpret the humour from the words on the page.  I think of the dialogue around the police officer.  Reading it from the page I never realised how much humour could be drawn form this characters scenes in terms of how the other characters view in.  Of course the praise of lies with Shakespeare but Branagh knows the Bard well.The cast is international and allstar probably to a greater extent than it needed or deserved.  Branagh is pure wonder in the lead and really brings out the whimsy in many of his scenes.  Thompson too is wonderful and the two play off each other well.  The film lost a little when the two begin to woo but it is still enjoyable.  Briers is excellent and Blessed is a bit hammy and underused forcing big background laughs.  Reeves is OK in a small role  the lack of significant dialogue helped him.  Washingon fits in very well Leonard is good but straight.  Of the Hollywood stars I think Keaton  does the best.  When he is onscreen he is a little OTT but he is simply hilarious as the fool of the piece and Ben Elton is an interesting sidekick. Beckinsdale is good but again is not given much meat to work with outside of her perfect love for Claudio.Overall this is a very enjoyable version of the play.  Those who find Shakespeare difficult could do well to start here with something light and bubbly.  Those who enjoy Shakespeare will enjoy it as another version.  Only those who feel that the Bard should not be put onscreen for the masses and there are some who think this way  I have met them they laughably call themselves purists  elitists I think will find fault here because this clearly has mass appeal.".

Although I am a dedicated admirer of Laurence Olivier the legend who's reputation Brannagh is often set up against I must admit that nobody would ever suit the role of Benedick as Brannagh does He was perfect fun natural and wittily amusing to watch. As for Emma Thompson she gave a fantastically fiery performance as Beatrice of the untamed tongue watching she and Brannagh go for each other in their satirical arguments was fantastic.  Then there was Kate Beckindsale one who I really would not have expected in a film such as this but she did an exemplary and satisfying job as the fair Hero although put completely in the shade by Emma Thompson. Keanu Reeves the film star who I reckon NOBODY would have expected in a film such as this was surprisingly very good as the schemingly dark Don Jon he suited the hisshiss villain's role deliciously. One who I thought could have been cast better was Robert Sean Leonard as Claudio who although fine in scenes of wit and amusement became forced in scenes of anger and sadness. Despite this I thought he too suited the part well. I highly recommend this film to all who enjoy shakespeare great English actors or just good fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much Ado About Nothing is a real summer movie. Director Kenneth Branagh who also adapted the Shakespeare play has assembled a talented gallery of British actors along with a couple of American stars who really gel together and bring the film to life. The result is a film with plenty of wit chemistry and gusto.Opening in the sundrenched fields of Messina in reality Tuscany where the picture was filmed a quiet prologue gives way to a stirring credits sequence as the Prince Don Pedro Denzel Washington and his men return from war and Messina's Governor Leonato Richard Briers and his family prepare to greet them. This is the setting for a series of comical romantic shenanigans.The brave but naive soldier Claudio Robert Sean Leonard immediately falls for Leonato's virtuous young daughter Hero Kate Beckinsdale and it takes a little matchmaking by the Prince in order to get them together. Elsewhere the Prince observes that the witty banter between his friend Benedick Kenneth Branagh and Beatrice Emma Thompson conceal a much deeper attraction and he conspires with his friends to trick the pair into falling in love with each other. Skulking his way through all of this is Don John Keanu Reeves Don Pedro's illegitimate brother whose bitter envy of Claudio leads him to sabotage the courtship between him and Hero...The original text of Much Ado contains a lot of poetic references to baldricks toothaches and sheepskins. Branagh in adapting the play has thankfully clipped most of this out though many of the play's better lines are still included. Only people who hate Shakespeare with a passion will fail to be enthralled by what is going on.The talented cast excel in their various roles. Branagh and Emma Thompson still married when this film was made have a spiky chemistry together as Beatrice and Benedick. Denzel Washington lends a quiet nobility and dignity to Don Pedro while Richard Briers turns in his usual fine performance as the feisty but savvy Leonato.Kate Beckinsdale radiates innocence as the gentle Hero although Robert Sean Leonard has a harder job as Claudio. He's fine being witty or enthusiastic but is very awkward and forced when trying to portray anger or sorrow. Keanu Reeves much mocked at the time for his lacklustre performance in Bram Stoker's Dracula is surprisingly effective as the scheming Don John and is a really hissable villain.The only actor who disappoints is Michael Keaton as Constable Dogberry the policeman who instructs and supervises Leonato's nighttime watch. Keaton unfortunately goes far too overthetop and plays the constable as a demented drunkard. A more laidback performance could have better accentuated the humour in the role. The whole film is framed within Patrick Doyle's rousing music score which gives the film a lot of its spirit and atmosphere.All in all a lighthearted and witty picture and a fine example of a really good summer movie.".

Reeves is indeed the one substandard thing about this film but even so it somehow works Reeves' role I mean. This film is about rapt joy and ebullient vitality and Reeves' flatness creates precisely the contrast that makes his character stand out as totally unfit for the world presented in the film just as the beginning of Richard III establishes Richard as unfit for his times only he had enough cunning and opportunity to really foul things up!. There is no mistake neither on the Bard's nor Branagh's part in casting Reeves as Don John.Having gotten that out of the way I'd just like to say that this is my favorite Shakespeare film ever. It is perfect in virtually every way and I think Branagh displays a marvelous and rare understanding of the textual material. This is an immortal classic that I've seen a dozen times and that I am certain I will continue to watch on a regular basis for the rest of my life.10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A Film about Everything that Makes Life Worth Living";
	schema:reviewBody "Prior to Much Ado About Nothing most memorable cinematic Shakespeare adaptations were based upon his tragedies or histories. Thus we had Olivier's trilogy of Henry V Richard III and Hamlet Welles's Othello and Macbeth Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet Heston's Antony and Cleopatra something of a rarity but still worth seeing and the BrandoMasonGielgud version of Julius Caesar. Shakespeare's comedies were less common in the cinema probably because so much Shakespearean humour is based either upon puns and wordplay which worked better in Elizabethan English than they do in the modern language or upon topical references to the events of the 1590s and 1600s lost upon today's audiences. There was that old Midsummer Night's Dream from the thirties and Derek Jarman's rather eccentric version of The Tempest but generally the cinema took the view that the comedies were best left to the theatre and television.With his own version of Henry V wellreceived by most critics when it came out in 1989 Kenneth Branagh inherited Olivier's role as Britain's leading cinematic Shakespearean. It was perhaps something of a gamble for him to choose a comedy as his second Shakespeare adaptation but it was a gamble that paid off. The film was shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and in the beautiful sunlit surrounding countryside. The costumes are vaguely nineteenthcentury but the clear intention was to set the story in a timeless nevernever land a sort of rustic earthly paradise. Those claiming supposed anachronisms as goofs therefore have rather missed the point. It does not matter whether they had pianoaccordions in sixteenthcentury Sicily as this film is obviously not aiming at an accurate recreation of sixteenthcentury Sicilian life.Just like the original paradise this one contains a serpent in the shape of Don John the evil brother of the Prince of Messina. What is technically the main plot of Shakespeare's play concerns Don John's spiteful machinations to frustrate the marriage of the young soldier Claudio to the beautiful Lady Hero by making false accusations of unchastity against her. I say technically because this storyline often has to take second place to the subplot about the wooing of Beatrice and Benedick. Benedick starts out as a confirmed bachelor and Beatrice an ardent protofeminist but in a plot development which has been copied in thousands of romantic comedies ever since they end up by falling in love with one another. Their verbal duels were so popular with audiences that at one time the play was better known as Beatrice and Benedick than by its official title.In the late eighties and early nineties Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thomson Ken and Em were the golden couple of the British acting profession. Like a number of other golden couples Larry and Viv Richard and Liz Jude and Sadie their relationship was eventually to end unhappily but while they were together they were cast opposite one another in a number of productions and it is they who take on the roles of the feuding pair. Both were practised Shakespearean actors and they speak their lines with great clarity and simplicity bringing out all the humour and drama in their parts. Richard Briers is equally good as Leonato Hero's aged father. Hero herself despite her central role in the drama is on the page a rather colourless figure but the lovely Kate Beckinsale in her first major film role makes her a delightful and unaffected heroine.Besides a number of leading British stage actors Branagh also cast several Hollywood stars doubtless with an eye to the American box office. He was criticised for this in Britain but in my view given the unreal idealised world in which the film is set the mixture of British and American accents does not matter. Nor does the fact that Messina has a black Duke with a Hawaiian brother although all of his subjects are white.The most criticised of the American stars seems to have been Keanu Reeves. Although he is perhaps not the greatest speaker of blank verse I must say in his defence that psychologically he seems just right for the role of Don John. Whereas the other characters are full of high spirits and good humour he is a saturnine figure who seems to radiate gloom and illwill a man whose malice arises from his envy of the happiness of others. Of the others Denzel Washington is appropriately dignified as Don Pedro. Robert Sean Leonard rather struggles with Claudio but it is a thankless role a man who is technically the romantic lead but whose jealousy and credulity make him a rather unsympathetic figure. The one actor I did not like was Michael Keaton who overacts frantically in a weird accent as the drunken constable Dogberry but even he did not spoil the film for me.A special mention must go to the wonderful theme music by Patrick Doyle essentially a single theme which is heard in a number of guises throughout. Figureskating fans like me will always recall this as the music to which Tonya Harding skated at the 1994 Winter Olympics while under suspicion for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan rumour had it that the choice of music from a film about a woman wrongly accused was a quite deliberate gesture to protest her innocence.This stirring theme fits the mood of the film perfectly. It is a film about love laughter happiness friendship sunlight and the beauty of nature in short a film about everything that makes life worth living. In my view the greatestever film of a Shakespeare comedy. Perhaps the bestever film of s Shakespeare play. 1010".

For sure the list would include It's a Wonderful Life The Godfather Star Wars Casablanca Schindler's List L.A. Confidential and American Beauty. But my alltime favorite is and has been for several years Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing. I've heard the complaints  that Keanu Reeves is a stiff that Denzel Washington was miscast that Michael Keaton's Dogberry is too over the top cartoonish Monty Pythonish. But I've seen MAAN 10 or 12 times and each time my appreciation for it has grown. I guess what it comes down to for me is that no movie is perfect. Every film has its flaws. I just really really like this one  warts and Keanu and all. I would venture to philosophize that the same is true for anyone's favorite film  for your favorite. If you like it that much it's not just in spite of its flaws but because of them. Much Ado is my No. 1 mainly because of the writing hard to beat Shakespeare and the acting of the leads Branagh and the amazing Emma Thompson but also because of some of the other performances are accidentally perfect. Keanu unwittingly nails his role as the brooding and soulless Don John. Denzel plays Don Pedro as though Don Pedro realizes he's in a movie adaptation of a play by Shakespeare which seems just perfect to me. And I don't know if Michael Keaton was on drugs or channeling an Elizabethean theater clown or what but I think if Shakespeare could see Branagh's movie he would say that's the best Dogberry he's ever seen.".

	schema:headline " A terrific Shakespeare story of love betrayal and the battle of the sexes";
	schema:reviewBody "William Shakespeare a man ahead of his time who wrote some of the world's most beautiful and wonderful plays. He wrote tragedies romances comedies and one of his best comediesdrama that's personally my favorite Much Ado About Nothing. Kenneth Branagh directs another wonderful Shakespeare movie about love reputation and the battle of the sexes. His chemistry with then wife Emma Thompson was so wonderful that made the movie just a delight. You can't help but smile with Much Ado About Nothing making you just love life and to remind yourself that sometimes the good guys do win.Don Pedro and his noblemen are visiting their good friend Leonato in Messina after having quashed the uprising led by Don John the prince's bastard halfbrother. Among the victors are Benedick Leonato's niece Beatrice and Benedick's sworn brother Claudio a young count. Claudio has been thinking fondly of Leonato's gentle and lovely daughter Hero since before he went to war and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro learning of his young friend's feelings arranges the match at a party. Despite Don John's best efforts to foil it the Prince's plan works out perfectly in the end. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding day Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick. Of course both parties being so stubborn to the opposite sex this match will take a little more ingenuity. The night before the wedding Borachio arranges to meet with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. John shows Claudio the rendezvous and makes them believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity. He breaks up the wedding and now it's a battle of the sexes and what damage you could do with a woman's reputation.Of course the questionable choice of having Keanu Reeves as Don John as usual a wooden performance that I'm sure would make Shakespeare cringe. However there was more than an exceptional choice with having Michael Keaton as Dogberry he was too funny and exactly who I would picture for the role. Him freaking out because the prisoner kept taunting him and calling him names was just classic he brings it up later while trying to charge them with lying about Hero got a good chuckle out of me. The thing I absolutely adore about Much Ado About Nothing is that it shows how easily a woman's reputation could be ruined. It's so sad to see how quickly Claudio turns on Hero when he mistakes that she's having an affair. We don't blame him as it was an evil trick but just tragic to watch as he disgraces her in front of everyone and they all look at her with judging eyes including her own father. Brought in with the proper balance of drama and comedy Kenneth Branagh brought in a great cast and crew to make this play into a wonderful picture. I love Much Ado About Nothing Shakespeare may not be for everyone but in my opinion he's still one of the greatest writers of all time.1010".

Reminds you of just WHY Denzel Washington deserves both the love of audiences and fans and an Academy Award. Kenneth Branagh is an actor one either likes or dislikes and I happen to like him. He is well matched here with Emma Thompson. Both are excellent in the principle roles of Benedickthe Bard's spelling and Beatrice. The supporting cast is outstanding. I particularly like the marvelous Brian Blessed as Hero's uncle Antonio. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly good as the villainous Don Jon it is possibly one of his very best screen performances. Robert Sean Leonard is good but not quite up to the others as Claudio and Kate Beckinsale is somewhat better as the slandered maiden named Hero. Michael Keaton is hilarious as the constable whose language is so filled with circumlocutions that no one can understand him.This Branagh Shakespearean production is considerably more edited for length than Hamlet or Henry V with a run time of just under two hours which is just about right for most movie audiences. The trimming is judiciously done and the play hangs together very well with the main plot points largely intact. His direction is crisp and the staging is very good. The language is not too difficult to follow despite the fact that it was not modernized. I found this film vastly entertaining and particularly enjoyed Denzel Washington in it. Locations are beautiful and costumes attractive. I found almost nothing to complain about by the end despite doubting whether Keanu Reeves would hold up in his role. He is fine. Overall this is a wonderful film a good introduction to the Bard for younger audiencesthough they may wish to review the plot beforehand and a most pleasant choice for someone looking for a romantic comedy for a date night. I found it just delightful.".

It is filmed simply as a costume drama making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina Sicily.The comedy is played up  especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the overeager Constable Dogberry Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this  Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive Washington  always brilliant  is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance is exuberant and jubilant sexy romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line Would you have me lady? or all the men coming riding over the hill...Wonderful film lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour great musical score the song Pardon Goddess of the Night is stunning and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award as is Thompson  they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.".

Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.".

Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse Hey Nonny Nonny about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany the white bodices of the women the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!!The banter between Benedick Branagh and Beatrice Thompson is perfect I loved all the American actors particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany the music is very good there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not into Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.".

What could go wrong? Well nothing to be honest. All the cast did well I've heard minor qualms about the casting of Reeves as the villain but personally I think he pulled it off superbly. Kate Beckinsale not a big name at the time is able to cope admirably in the role of Hero her shining moment in the film is her reaction to the disastrous wedding scene. The stars of the film are unsurprisingly Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson who are truly wonderful as the sparring Beatrice and Benedick. They convey a magnificent chemistry in every encounter.Much Ado has to be one of my favourite plays a fresh relief from the doom and gloom of Branagh's other works. This is a film to watch which is guaranteed to leave you with a satisfied smile on your face by the end. There are plenty of highlights the main one of which is the hilarity of Beatrice and Benedick each overhearing from their scheming friends the one's supposed love for the other.I have nothing bad to say about this film  except that it took me too long to find it on DVD.".

Denzel Washington very cool I felt so sorry for him when Beatrice refused him though he is a little too good for her. I love his character though how he likes to fix everybody up and make them happy. Robert Sean Lenord was a little sappy but it was pretty fitting for who he was. He needs more roles like this and Dead Poets Society. Micheal Keaton and his little sidekick poor guy! stole the show! Hilarious! Hero didn't do anything for me though. She was pretty but didn't have much to say it seemed like she was watching the others most of the time. The best part of this movie is when Benidick and Beatrice hear about the other's love and realise they love each other. The photography is best when Beatrice is swinging and Benedick is splashing in the fountain! I'm hooked on Shakespheare now I'm planning to watch the version of A Midsummer Night's Dream coming out with Michelle Pfeiffer not to mention any Shakespeare movies I see with Kenneth Branaugh in them!".

	schema:reviewBody "Monte Carlo is a charming movie for tweens andor teens. Several other reviewers disliked the movie calling it predictable and boring but I have to vehemently disagree. If you are looking for a cute adventurous movie with NO SWEARING NO NUDITY NO SEXUAL SCENES or INNUENDOS NO SMOKING and NO DRUGS then this is the movie for you and us!! This movie reminds me of some of the 1960's Disney movies that were plotwise too old for little kids but still 'safe' for the not quite teenagers.This is a classic movie about mistaken identity and learning to get along. The 3 main characters in the movies are all very different personalities but they grow and learn to accept each other by the end of the movie. They also have very different 'happy endings' but seeing how different they are the characters should end happilyeverafter differently.There are some funny moments some thinking 'would I do that?' moments and some 'good for her' moments. You genuinely like each of these characters except the mean girl by the end of the show whether you liked them at the beginning or not.This movie is perfect for its target audience of tweensearly teens and I wish more movies like this were available with today's stars!".

I'm regretting that I actually went to the movie theater to watch it. This movie's quality was on par with many of the TV movies that Disney has made. The actual plot seemed like it was hastily done and had a few plot holes. Also I found that each girl's romance stories were unrealistic underdeveloped and mostly boring.However while watching the movie I did find myself enjoying myself and even chuckling a bit. But maybe it's just because of my age. I don't suggest watching this movie if you're over the age of 15. Or if you aren't female.Viewed on July 8 2011".

	schema:reviewBody "Selena Gomez stars as an optimistic teen from Texas in this comedy...now I use the word comedy loosely since unless you're under the age of twelve it's doubtful that you'll ever physically laugh while viewing this film. Gomez's Grace has been saving pennies for years while working a thankless waiting job and attending her high school classes. Finally a graduate she and her best friend Emma played by the strikingly beautiful Katie Cassidy are off to Paris for a vacation of a lifetime. But no fairytale is complete without the unwanted stepsister tagging alone this time portrayed by Leighton Meester.In what could have offered some comedic moments but somehow failed to the girls realize their tour of Paris just doesn't live up to expectations. Add that with the fact Grace and Emma aren't exactly fond of Grace's uptight stepsister the vacation is a nightmare to the girls. Luckily this is where the magic comes in and it is discovered that Grace has an identical lookalike who happens to stroll into the hotel where the girls are. Add some cheesy contrivances and a few unbelievable plot twists and bam! The girls find themselves on a private jet to Monte Carlo where Grace will be posing as her snotty doppleganger Cordelia.The girls then go into romantic individual story lines each one more dull and pointless than the next. Grace's romance with French socialite Theo evolves at a rapid and completely unrelatable pace. He literally dislikes her one second and then decides that because she likes horses that she's different and the one for him. They briefly check out some fireworks and fall for each other without exchanging so much as an email address. Emma must decide between a snooty guy she meets who rarely speaks and is played by an unknown actor or her sweet Texan boyfriend played by popular Glee heartthrob Cory Monteith. Gee I wonder who she will choose in the end? The most intriguing relationship as far as romance goes to Meg and Riley. Riley is a forward Australian mate who manages to open up Meg's hard exterior and help her come to terms with her mother's passing while they fall for each other. Their romance has a slight adventurous quality to it that's somewhat redeemable.The thing about Monte Carlo is that while it's not horrifically offensive it's hardly passable for entertainment. It's dull long boring and stretched out over practically two hours in a simple and cheesy story that could've been handled in 90 minutes. Gomez who has a great sense of comedic timing and charisma that she showcases on her poorly written Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place won me over on a show that's just not good so it's unfortunate that she has yet to find a film that will truly utilize her skills and allow her to showcase her true star potential to the world. Hopefully she'll be given further chances after this failure. Leighton and Katie are also very likable in their roles but the film's weak script and lack of comedy can't save this dull film. Despite all of the above the scenery is gorgeous and the three young actresses are not to blame for this poor excuse for a romantic comedy. Especially when there are great family films out there featuring female leads that cover all agegroups such as Disney's Tangled.".

If not for attending Justin Bieber's 3D documentary film being intrigued by his internet fueled meteoric success and inevitably feeding off the tabloids on his career I would not have known who the lead actress was but now I do. Based loosely on the novel Headhunters by Jules Bass the release of Monte Carlo this week in the US and Singapore would probably be deemed suicidal if not for its appeal to the intended demographic left out of the testosterone filled Transformers and the more mature movie going audience who would likely flock to Larry Crowne starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts opens in Singapore next week to avoid a threeway battle.And appeal to that group it does playing up to its favourite things that if I were a girl I would gobble this up hook line and sinker. There's travelling to Europe Paris no less with a BFF and a sister you'd love to hate in tow meeting attractive and more importantly single guys at every turn travelling in luxury from being ferried in private jets and limousines rubbing shoulders with royalty and the rich and famous as well as having an arsenal of gorgeous outfits to get into topped off by million dollar jewellery participating in exotic games and attending the coolest parties. Sounds like fun doesn't it?But that's about it with the film very much set in territory already explored in countless of films dealing with coincidental mistaken identity where the Prince and the Pauper switch places  this one being one sided and without permission  for the pauper to experience the high life leading onto moralistic questions such as whether one will be enticed by things superficial and materialistic or will one return to one's humble roots with morals principles and values intact. It's the same old usual themes about wanting to fulfill personal objectives and dreams whatever they may be whether done so through hard work or just by meeting the right people.Selena Gomez takes on two roles here although her role as the mean British heiress Cordelia Winthrop Scott looks like she's suffering from a constant PMS. Her other main role is of course as Grace the simple waitress from Texas who had graduated and is taking her graduating trip to Paris with best friend Emma Katie Cassidy only for her parents to get her halfsister Meg Leighton Meester to tag along despite their hating of each other's guts. So begins the journey of selfdiscovery for all  Grace to decide whether she should keep up with the charade she and her pals find themselves in at the risk of being a fraud to Theo Pierre Boulanger of the Hotel de Paris Emma to try and figure out if the high life and potentially rich royalfamily linked acquaintance can be anything more than friends as compared to her troubled boyfriend Owen Cory Monteith and Meg learning to becoming less uptight while getting swept off her feet by Aussie tourist Riley Luke Bracey.Yes that's all the romance lined up as they zip around the different places in luxurious Monte Carlo having the second act centered around closure in and around a million dollar necklace meant for a charity auction. In some ways that was the best part of the film as finally there is a sense of purpose and urgency to try and resolve everything amicably and set their identities straight as their charade comes to the inevitable close with well timed expected comedy to pave the way to a finale that ends all too conveniently.Naturally the landscapes make up the film with its far flung beautiful locations that would just make you want to save up enough to jet set in the same fashion trying very hard to make you forget the many plot conveniences and coincidences for the very obviously predictable way this teeny bopper film is appealing to the teenage female population through the latest It girl making that transition from music to film. Strictly or the fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with Disney Channel stars like Selena Gomez is they're a piece of product placement themselves. They almost come branded with a Disney logo on their forehead and they present themselves like Disney is always watching them making sure they maintain the prettygirlwhoisalwaysclean persona every one of their actresses has.Speaking of Disney Channel I'm curious why this film was so special it had to go theatrical. This is Disney Channel ABC Family TV show movie quality. Not summer blockbuster quality. Nothing in this film is remotely special for it to go theatrical. Some points I was trying to pick and choose where commercials would've gone. This will likely end up on the network sometime in 2012. I'm sure parents might be forced by their eight year olds to watch this and I'm sure they'll think I'm glad we didn't have to pay money to see this in the theaters. Monte Carlo is about Grace Gomez a teenage girl who has just graduated High School and plans to go on a big trip to Paris. She's been saving money for this trip for a while but her stepdad Cullen announces at the dinner table that he has paid for Grace her friend Emma Cassidy and Grace's half sister Meg Meester. The three girls go off to their destination and realize soon after that the trip has been a bust. That is until Grace is mistaken for Cordelia WinthropScott also played by Gomez a British heiress. So the three girls now travel to Monte Carlo where they are living someone else's life.No doubt that little girls still amused by Disney Channel's antics will find this film perfectly acceptable and Selena Gomez to be a rolemodel. For someone like me this isn't the kind of film I find good or unique. We also get contrived love stories for each of the three girls and this winds up feeling more like Sex and the City than a Disney Channel film.The message is be yourself not someone else as if we hadn't heard it before the soundtrack boasts bubblegum pop much like every other teenage film and by the end of the film nothing is learned from the girls or even hinted that they even found what they did was wrong. They suffer no consequences.

	onyx:emotionText "The problem with Disney Channel stars like Selena Gomez is they're a piece of product placement themselves. They almost come branded with a Disney logo on their forehead and they present themselves like Disney is always watching them making sure they maintain the prettygirlwhoisalwaysclean persona every one of their actresses has.Speaking of Disney Channel I'm curious why this film was so special it had to go theatrical. This is Disney Channel ABC Family TV show movie quality. Not summer blockbuster quality. Nothing in this film is remotely special for it to go theatrical. Some points I was trying to pick and choose where commercials would've gone. This will likely end up on the network sometime in 2012. I'm sure parents might be forced by their eight year olds to watch this and I'm sure they'll think I'm glad we didn't have to pay money to see this in the theaters. Monte Carlo is about Grace Gomez a teenage girl who has just graduated High School and plans to go on a big trip to Paris. She's been saving money for this trip for a while but her stepdad Cullen announces at the dinner table that he has paid for Grace her friend Emma Cassidy and Grace's half sister Meg Meester. The three girls go off to their destination and realize soon after that the trip has been a bust. That is until Grace is mistaken for Cordelia WinthropScott also played by Gomez a British heiress. So the three girls now travel to Monte Carlo where they are living someone else's life.No doubt that little girls still amused by Disney Channel's antics will find this film perfectly acceptable and Selena Gomez to be a rolemodel. For someone like me this isn't the kind of film I find good or unique. We also get contrived love stories for each of the three girls and this winds up feeling more like Sex and the City than a Disney Channel film.The message is be yourself not someone else as if we hadn't heard it before the soundtrack boasts bubblegum pop much like every other teenage film and by the end of the film nothing is learned from the girls or even hinted that they even found what they did was wrong. They suffer no consequences. So instead of telling us to be ourselves Disney is possibly saying go ahead and lie about who you are and fake your identity the consequences won't be as serious as long as you say you learned something. Most illogical.Monte Carlo's problem doesn't stem from the three leads. They are beautiful women with lots of potential.

While it is obvious that Gomez has great potential as an actress she doesn't exploit her talents here. There is little chemistry between her Grace and Theo Pierre Boulanger and her portrayal of Cordelia borders on 'campy'. Meester fares better as the cautious Meg at least her relationship with Aussie Riley Luke Bracey has its sparks. Glee's Corey Monteith is largely wasted as Emma's boyfriend Owen.

Grace's parents Brett Cullen and Andie McDowell newly married decide that older stepsister Meg Leighton Meister must go along to keep everyone safe. Neither Grace or Meg is happy with this arrangement but decide it will be preferable to no trip at all. Once in Paris the tour and the hotel are far short of expectations for all of the girls causing disappointment. But the trio of gals has a chance eavesdrop with a young British aristocrat Cordelia also Selena Gomez that changes their vacation. Grace discovers that Cordelia is breaking commitments she made for a fund raising in Monte Carlo and going undercover for a few days. Thus an opportunity arises for Grace to step into Cordelia's shoes for they resemble identical twins. Once landing in Monaco the girls are treated like royalty with fabulous hotel accommodations and a closet full of designer clothes. Holding her breath Grace finds that no one suspects that she is an impostor not even the handsome son of the charity's director. He serves as her guide and date. Emma too finds herself the object of affection for the local guys although she is practically engaged to her boyfriend Owen back in Texas. Finally reserved Meg also comes out of her shell when she meets a dashing Australian tourist. Thus for a few days it is a slice of royal heaven for the vacationers. But will the deception be discovered and what will be the consequences if it is? This is a lovely looking film with a beautiful talented young star Gomez. A natural performer with a sweetandsaucy air she makes the most of her duel roles. Cassidy Meister and all of the other cast members do nice work too. Naturally the costumes and sets are quite lovely. But and its huge issue the script doesn't contain nearly enough comedy or cleverness to sustain a complete film. The premise yes is good but the execution is lacking. Then too the direction doesn't help matters with its complete dirth of energy. Therefore the film plods along and has some boring moments. Thankfully the finale makes a splash but its almost too late. Girls young and old will like the film and patiently overlook the dull bits. But any others forced to watch it will be scowling up a storm.".

Selena Gomez Katie Cassidy and Leighton Meester's performances are absolutely fantastic! I really enjoy this movie it is funny romantic and extremely entertaining. One thing I find a bit disappointing is that the story line is pretty predictable however it is made up for by the wonderful acting. The cinematography is excellent and vivid. It truly shows off the beauty of Italy and Monte Carlo. My favorite character is Grace played by Selena Gomez. Grace is so determined to have a great time in Italy and make sure her friends are having a blast. She stays cool and calm even when life takes an unexpected turn and I admire that about her. My favorite scene when Cordelia Winthrop Scott Grace's lookalike comes to the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo and Grace and her friends have to scramble around trying to make her hotel room look perfect again so they don't get caught. This scene is very funny and enjoyable. I recommend Monte Carlo for ages 10 and up because there aren't any sexual scenes or inappropriate language but younger kids may not enjoy the story of young adults traveling to Italy. I give Monte Carlo 4 out of 5 stars because it's a great film for you and your friends! Video review here httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vnJq6ZKY7zU".

	schema:reviewBody "Did you ever have to make up your mind?Say yes to one and leave the other behind...Rob Salinger's life becomes a Lovin' Spoonful song when the television reporter hooks up with a friendly cellist and they make a baby. Rob a frustrated wannabe father figures he will never get a child with the careercentered woman he is married to and decides to divorce her. But he is hit for a wallop when a rapt Mrs. Salinger tells him that she is pregnant too and eager to embrace a new domesticity with him. It's tough enough making up one's mind when there's two people involved let alone four and so Rob decides to make a go of it and tough it out by marrying the cellist supporting his wife and juggling like mad.A charming Blake Edwards comedy struggles to get out of the gate with some tedious exposition and some disturbing insights into the central characters. Rob's devotion to parenting is mitigated by his deceitful way with women who love him. The cellist Maude doesn't seem bothered about picking off a married guy. Wife Micki is so selfish she even goes to an abortion clinic without telling her husband who in turn has no qualms keeping her in the dark about Maude so he can use her as his personal incubator. Here's a couple both sides of the Roe v. Wade debate can agree on disliking.But a funny thing happens as the film progresses. It gets funny. Very funny. Dudley Moore plays Rob with comic abandon and flair playing off his character's monomania in such a way we not only enjoy it but come to root for it. There's a great scene with Richard Mulligan playing Leo his boss at work where Rob ponders how to tell Micki the truth only to find he can't. Leo says just tell her the truth he knocked up another woman and she's having a baby.Rob demurs. That's a little rough.Tell her We're naming the baby after you Leo suggests. Ouch.Also helping a lot are the women in the story Ann Reinking as Micki and Amy Irving as Maude. Neither are natural comediennes and Reinking gave up filmwork after this but both are terrific foils setting up laughs for Moore and generating some of their own like with Micki's druginduced hysteria while in labor and Maude's way of playacting with monster movies on TV. Both also establish a believable intimacy with Moore's character which makes his dilemma understandable if not heroic.For his part Moore delivers a stellar central performance full of heart and conviction and many painfullooking pratfalls. Only praying mantises sacrifice more in pursuit of fatherhood than does poor Rob.Moore won a Golden Globe for his performance here a pretty amazing feat given the four other comedy nominees that year were Bill Murray in Ghostbusters Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop Steve Martin in All Of Me and Robin Williams in Moscow On The Hudson. That's a Murderers Row of talent each a career role in great careers and while I'd pick Martin myself I think Moore deserved something for his great work. I'm glad he got it.Like many Blake Edwards comedies this one rolls to a fine finish actually an amazingly sustained one with two big payoffs one at a doctor's office where the two women both show up and the other of course at the hospital while both are giving birth. In addition to Mulligan there's fine supporting work from Lu Leonard as a suspicious nurse and Gustav Vintas as a prickly Germanic doctor. But it's Moore's baby or babies and he carries them to the finish line in fine form.The movie's not perfect. The beginning is weak and overlong as said and there are some silly bits of Moore at work which feature some labored comedy. Frankly one reason I'd've give the Globe to Moore is that he had less of a script to work with than the other fine actors that and Moore never really had any great comedies of his own like they did. It seems fair the underdog won this one time. MM is a solid charmer and a nice way of remembering a fine actor at his apex.".

It's tough enough making up one's mind when there's two people involved let alone four and so Rob decides to make a go of it and tough it out by marrying the cellist supporting his wife and juggling like mad.A charming Blake Edwards comedy struggles to get out of the gate with some tedious exposition and some disturbing insights into the central characters. Rob's devotion to parenting is mitigated by his deceitful way with women who love him. The cellist Maude doesn't seem bothered about picking off a married guy. Wife Micki is so selfish she even goes to an abortion clinic without telling her husband who in turn has no qualms keeping her in the dark about Maude so he can use her as his personal incubator. Here's a couple both sides of the Roe v. Wade debate can agree on disliking.But a funny thing happens as the film progresses. It gets funny. Very funny. Dudley Moore plays Rob with comic abandon and flair playing off his character's monomania in such a way we not only enjoy it but come to root for it. There's a great scene with Richard Mulligan playing Leo his boss at work where Rob ponders how to tell Micki the truth only to find he can't. Leo says just tell her the truth he knocked up another woman and she's having a baby.Rob demurs. That's a little rough.Tell her We're naming the baby after you Leo suggests. Ouch.Also helping a lot are the women in the story Ann Reinking as Micki and Amy Irving as Maude. Neither are natural comediennes and Reinking gave up filmwork after this but both are terrific foils setting up laughs for Moore and generating some of their own like with Micki's druginduced hysteria while in labor and Maude's way of playacting with monster movies on TV. Both also establish a believable intimacy with Moore's character which makes his dilemma understandable if not heroic.For his part Moore delivers a stellar central performance full of heart and conviction and many painfullooking pratfalls. Only praying mantises sacrifice more in pursuit of fatherhood than does poor Rob.Moore won a Golden Globe for his performance here a pretty amazing feat given the four other comedy nominees that year were Bill Murray in Ghostbusters Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop Steve Martin in All Of Me and Robin Williams in Moscow On The Hudson. That's a Murderers Row of talent each a career role in great careers and while I'd pick Martin myself I think Moore deserved something for his great work. I'm glad he got it.Like many Blake Edwards comedies this one rolls to a fine finish actually an amazingly sustained one with two big payoffs one at a doctor's office where the two women both show up and the other of course at the hospital while both are giving birth. In addition to Mulligan there's fine supporting work from Lu Leonard as a suspicious nurse and Gustav Vintas as a prickly Germanic doctor. But it's Moore's baby or babies and he carries them to the finish line in fine form.The movie's not perfect. The beginning is weak and overlong as said and there are some silly bits of Moore at work which feature some labored comedy. Frankly one reason I'd've give the Globe to Moore is that he had less of a script to work with than the other fine actors that and Moore never really had any great comedies of his own like they did. It seems fair the underdog won this one time. MM is a solid charmer and a nice way of remembering a fine actor at his apex.";

The plot in itself works thanks to a knockout idea Dudley Moore  2 wives  Bigamy x Pregnancy. Any theme like that alone would be funny. Handled by one of the all time great American directors Blake Edwards and starring Cuddly Dudley it soars. Amy Irving as Micki and Anne Reinking as Maude are both very enjoyable and frothy charcters essential to a romantic comedy. One imagines that if he wanted to Edwards could have made this a straight sequel to his hit 10 with Dud reprising his role as George Webber with Julie Andrews as Micki and Bo Derk as Maude. But Amy Irving and Anne Reinking do just nicely. Michael Le Grand's themes and songs are nice and the film amounts to a funny and fitting climax. Edwards employs in the fianl scenes lots of Laurel and Hardy imagery and Dud handles this well. Edwards should be proud because not only has he emulated the greatest work of Stan and Ollie with this film he has created something that in turn will influence generations of Comedy directors. Why on earth this didn't win any Academy Awards i dont know. I can think of an Actor and a Director who thoroughly deserve them.".

So what does Rob do now? Easy. He still marries Maude stays married to Micki and becomes a bigamist. Micki  Maude has lots of big laughs especially the scenes in the doctors offices and hospital. This is one of director Blake Edwards' best films. The performance by Dudley Moore is a comic tourdeforce. He won a Golden Globe for his work here. Amy Irving and Ann Reinking are terrific too as the women in Moore's life and there's a great supporting performance by Richard Mulligan of TV's Soap and Empty Nest as Moore's boss and best friend who Moore comes to for advice. Micki  Maude is a very funny movie for fans of Dudley Moore and Blake Edwards. Only the silly ending keeps this movie from being a 10.12 out of four".

	schema:headline " Dealing with the problems of two great women.";
	schema:reviewBody "Why Dudley Moore would want to cheat on his attorney wife Ann Reinking goes beyond comprehension but why he would reject musician Amy Irving is another question. Reinking balances a successful career and a happy marriage and is very grounded as far as being the perfect wife a seemingly great employer and obviously a terrific mother to be. On the other hand easy going Irving is equally as wonderful. In any other situation these two women would be the greatest of friends but here the only things they have in common is that they are both married to Dudley Moore and both about to give birth to his children.From the synopsis you'd think that Moore is the snake of all snakes but he's a basically decent guy who makes one childish decision Getting involved where he shouldn't and risking hurting two wonderful people in the process. It's obvious to me that in the feminist society we live in now a comedy like this would end with him being strung up by his balls but in this it's difficult thanks to a witty screenplay to not understand how he got into such a precarious predicament. The script makes it clear that it is not man bashing but simply explaining how love really is a much confusing thing and that if society wasn't so uptight it would see the ideals of love fidelity and commitment quite differently than the puritanical views brought over on those European ships.Through the hands of director Blake Edwards this situation is explored in a way where you know he's eventually going to be exposed but in a sense you feel sorry for him yet want the two women to end up liking each other. A very funny scene has the women at their gynecologist's office at the same time and severe nurse Lu Leonard at first bewildered then morally outraged over Moore's involvement with two women. He only gets married to Irving illegally because he has no real choice forced into a corner and at the wedding almost exposed by the sudden presence of Reinking's parents who obviously adore him. Then there's Moore's best pal Richard Mulligan who at first warns him to tread cautiously but slyly palm slaps him over his involvement with two gorgeous women.I remember Moore's Golden Globes acceptance speech where he looked bewildered over winning for a part he obviously didn't think required much of a challenge but he's very funny in this and at the time was the hottest comic outside of Eddie Murphy working in film. If I had to work for an attorney I'd pick one like Reinking who never looses her cool in the office even when barged with phone calls and office visits all the while simply trying to settle into her day. Irving's character isn't as well developed as Moore's or Reinking's but she does a great job with the material that she's given. I give this an A for uniqueness in that it doesn't make a cheating husband a villain or cad but simply someone who had a brain fart when confronted with a wonderful woman whom he could really talk to when unlike other husbands already had that waiting for him at home. It's the level headed attitude of the lack of finger pointing and perfect timing combined with the intelligence and likability of all three characters that makes this work giving this a nice ability to comment on the state of relationships of men and women which hasn't seen any improvement and has in fact worsened in the 32 years since this was first seen in the theaters.".

It's a thrilling western with exciting showdown between the starring Jorge Martin  Alan Scott and their enemies . Average action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly deadly crossfire .

By the dead of night they steal a car and head for the towns of their youth...Geirri and Stella are running form the law leaving the home without permission and more importantly car theft but there is no 'Bonnie and Clyde' feeling to this story. They return to the towns they knew and remember the years together. There are spirits in their mind and spirits of the ocean who meet them along the way. You get an excellent sense of their strength knowledge and experience.All in all this movie is very touching  until the end.I really appreciated the journey and the experiences Geirri and Stella have but the plot twist that brings the viewer to a final scene which is in my opinion brutal disturbing and to be frank confusing end. Yes Geirri running from the law and yes he is trying to maintain his freedom but...the rocks and the feet...?Confusing and jarring. There was a fascinating mystical feel to the way the movie plays itself out and one could theorize that the ending was more symbolic than realistic. But why throw that kind of symbolism onto the end of such a touching and realistic movie?Even so I highly recommend this movie. There's to much to be gained from the movie as a whole to allow the oddness of the ending to stop you from seeing it.".

I know we loose a lot in translating from one language to another guess when we have to go through two translations! So I am taking into consideration that I lost a lot from the original idea of the director. My feeling was that he had an excellent material a road movie with two elders who don't't have any longer the right to leave their own lives as they wish well one the other was somewhat resigned to his fate. The film could be more profound as it is a problem faced overall the world but he chose to make it naive. I don't't blame his choice otherwise the two nice couple wouldn't walk one meter before been stopped and probably arrested. I congratulated with the director because he was audacious enough to bring up a subject that many people rather ignore. I am not an expert in Icelandic filmography and I surely will look forward to watch Cold Fever mentioned by one of the reviewers and I would like to emphasize that he used elements of Icelandic folklore in order to help those fugitives who believed in such elements. It was just a matter of tradition and culture. My guessing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cinderella has been retold far too many times to even count what made this version stand out is the way it was delivered how the events are arranged and the inclusion of an aftermath after prince charming found his one true love.The movie was directed with great attention to character development. The story kept the balance between realism and fantasy. We all know Mary in the story is just studying due to school privileges and doesn't have the money to go to dance school so what does she do? She sneaks in and through the mirror emulates the dances of the more privileged kids we always see in movies the line Try your best but in this story Cinderella finds a way to make her dreams come true she is strongwilled and kind at the same time. When her sisters show her video as a kid dancing she fought back with getting the tango tape and letting prince charming know she is the one. A very different approach to the meek and kind Cinderella we all know.With regards to Joey the prince of the movie very well played by Andrew Seeley. Makes you wonder why he didn't land the role in High School Musical his dance moves are not the best out there but very far from average. His acting is subtle but at the same time very convincing. His expression when he touched the mirror during the dance rehearsal was spot on and very indicative that he felt that the person of his dreams are on the other side of it. The chemistry of their characters is undeniable.The evil stepmother has a lot of dialogue that pokes at pop icons wash out artists and teenyboppers if you can keep an open mind it is hilarious. Jane Lynch really got into character you want to hate her but you can't help but love her in the movie.The choreography is great especially the mirror scene which I reckon will be happily remembered and Andrew Seeley's final stage performance was very professional it looked like a real concert of a pop icon. Whoever thought of those deserves a pat in the back.Overall do not look for depth in this movie. It is meant to entertain us not make us think nor try to be smarter than it really is. It is a fresh take on an old classic and does so beautifully.".

However the update of the Cinderella fairytale is also delightful with enjoyable dances and choreographies and the chemistry between Selena Gomez and Andrew Seeley is amazing. Selena Gomez really impresses with her beauty and charm and it is a pleasure to see her dancing.

They do a great job at portraying a very strange take on the evil stepsister role. I definitely prefer this version to the one with Hilary Duff.

Overall it was a pretty good movie a modern day Cinderella story. They replaced the Prince with a Celebrity Drew Seeley they replaced the servant with a maid Selena Gomez and replaced the slipper with an MP3 player.At first I thought it would be like all other movies similar to this the entire movie leads up to the buildup where the boy will find out who the girl is and they will fall in love but this one is different. I thought it was a great idea that they finished that in the first half with him finding his girl and filled the second half with modern day drama. This movie was more than just a Cinderella story it wasn't just the prince finding his princess and an endless love it dealt with insecurity and different social rankings and everything. They had a premise built around dance and stuck with that premise throughout the movie which was another big positive.Overall i thought it was a very enjoyable movie compared to all movies it probably would not be higher than 6 because it wasn't anything close to the best thing ever but compared to many Disney Movies I'd rank this as the 2nd best movie right behind High School Musical 1.It is a good movie very enjoyable and very satisfying. The main concern many people have would be the romantic interest between a 26 year old guy and a 16 year old girl but in the movie they sort of build off the same vibe with an older guy and a younger girl. It is said that they are not the same age in the movie as she was admiring him and loving him when she was only 10. Disney did not ignore the age gap and i think that it just made the film more powerful as it was yet another obstacle that they had to overcome in addition to everything else.".

Okay it did have the same story line as the first one but we are talking about A Cinderella Story here. That is why it is called Cinderella and yes she will have a mean stepmother and two silly stepsisters so you can't really change on that. The dancing was great. It was fun light entertainment and definitely better than I expected.

Not one I would recommend if you think. with Many convenient plot twists and completely unbelievable scenes the story was likely written by a 9 year old. The cast couldn't have been much worse either with a 50 year old pop diva. Jane Lynch plays some great characters but this wasn't one of them. This take offers nothing new on the all too familiar tale of Cinderella and in fact is a very poorly done rendition of that classic tale. On top of that there are some scenes which are simply not believable and pointless such as the masquerade ball where nobody could tell who anybody was even though they wore masks over only the tops of their faces. The only two blacks in the entire movie didn't even recognize each other moronically. Yet for some reason when Selena Gomez entered in a rather poofed out concealing dress all eyes were on here as if everyone thought she looked beautiful even though her body was completely covered her outfit was not form fitting and they supposedly could not see enough of her face for even her step sisters to recognize her. This movie is entirely forgettable. Absolutely nothing about it stood out even slightly. It is probably the worst take on Cinderella I have ever seen.".

What Dominique didn't know was that Mary loves to dance. After school Mary follows dance lessons at the other side of the mirror. The pop star Joey Parker wants to go back to school and finish his last year. At the ball he danced with a girl but she ran away a bit for midnight and left her IPod. With her IPod he wants to find that girl. That girl is Mary. Mary is trying to tell him but he won't listen. At the birthday of Mary's twin sisters he found his mystery girl. The twins are very angry at Mary and are going to ruin their love. Joey is trying to get Mary back on a dance contest for his next video clip. What happened? Check out the film!Why did I like this film? I liked the film because there is a lot of music and dance in it. Also the actors are great. They are funny pretty and young. I liked the way they compare this film and the fairytale. If you like funny comedies I would recommend it. Also if you like music and dance than this is a perfect film.".

It was also refreshing that the main characters Selena Gomez and Drew Seeley really had a great chemistry on screen.Jane Lynch adds the comical relief to the movie. Her character has her serious moments but most of the time you are let wondering what or at least I was left thinking that during some of her lines or comments because they were just so far out there. I did enjoy the Baby Got Back Commerical though that was very funny. It still makes me laugh every time. They couldn't have cast anyone better to play the role of the step mother in a sense she was the step mother.".

The choreography is pretty good especially the tango and Selena Gomez is a surprisingly impressive dancer. Some moments are cute enough and a few jokes I laughed at. This is a nice enough movie to watch and enjoy with girl friends where you can try and figure out with character represents which element from the actual Cinderella story.However there's a lot more that I think the movie could've improved on. Not only was it the most predictable thing on earth a talented young underdog rises to the top blah blah and I could figure out the rest of the plot from the first ten minutes but it was also pretty much exactly the same as A Cinderella Story with different actorscharacters. Some rich conceited stepmother and her two dimwitted daughters with some whiteknight goodhearted heroine who has to cook and clean while she sighs and waits for her celebritystatus Prince Charming to rescue her. You might say that its being predictable is expected but this isn't Disney. With some of its jokes and slightly suggestive dance moves Disney wouldn't lay a finger on such things for the screen. The movie should've at least tried to be a little more original.I'm a little sad that they didn't elaborate on Mary's past with her mother. All we hear is a quick passing comment from her stepmother about how she used to be her backup dancer. But I guess that wasn't the point of the movie so I won't complain too much.Finally Miss Gomez needs some work on her acting. I really appreciate her taking two months of dance class for this film and it shows and entertains but all she can do is stick to her preppy girly version of acting she acquired from Wizards of Waverly Place. In fact spoiler there is a part where she supposedly runs home crying. Her stepmother says something along the lines of You look like you've been crying or are your eyes naturally puffy? She is met by a blank nonexpressive stare without any tear stains on her face or at least some ACTUALLY PUFFY EYES. I guess that the age target of this movie wouldn't mind that much though.

I actually watched it the first time for two reasons 1 the trailer looked good 2 there were too many extremes in the iTunes reviews. Everyone either thought it was the best movie made and gave it 55 stars or hated it beyond description and gave it 15 stars. So I didn't feel either end was a correct perception given that apparently only Lovers loved it and Haters hated it. Thought I wonder if these people hate Selena Gomez or Drew Seeley so much why they even bothered watching it? Anyway I took a chance and actually liked it. It wasn't perfect but it has a certain charm and it grew on me so I like it more now than I did originally. The music is fun the dancing amazing and Drew Seeley and Selena Gomez have real chemistry. Yes there's an age gap in real life but I think it shows more on SG's side. DS may be 26 but he looks 17. And SG is 16 ish but can passably play a jr. in high school. And I remind everyone that they're actors. Rarely anyone on TV especially in High School roles plays their real age. As to predictability if you want a mind bender to see a Shamalamalan or however you sayspell his name movie. This was not meant to be anything totally surprising. It was supposed to be a cute fun little escape from everyday life story where boy and girl meet dance and fall in love. Thuh. End. However that said there were a few surprises in this one. For one thing Joey found out her real identity about half way through the flick  quite a bit sooner than these movies usually do saving that big reveal for closer to the end. For another Joey didn't care about her real status he still liked her and had no qualms saying or showing it. There are other moments but I don't think I need to go on however it was these choices by the makers that made me give it an 810. I think they at least tried to move away from some of the same old same old cookie cutter moments in movies like this. I thought it could have been well enough for a theater release but at least this way I got to buy my copy and not have to pay 8 bucks every time to see it.".

I've finally discovered something there are three kinds of people in the world. First the people mostly preteens really who are absolutely obsessed with anything Disneychannel or Disneyfied related and therefore are oblivious to the talent of the actors. Second are the people who always put down Disneychannel or Disneyfied related items simply because of this generation's obsessiveness and therefore also are oblivious to the talent of the actors. Then there is a small minority of people who treat these movies like any other and evaluate them without any prejudice or affinity toward the Disneychannel or Disneyfied film franchise. And if you belong to the third group you'll truly appreciate this film. Selena Gomez is simply divine  she has mastered all the dancing in this movie in just three weeks! And these are no simple moves. She has added her own personal and signature style to the movie perfecting each and every dance routine to the point of brilliancy. And Drew is likewise staggering  not only is he smooth on the dance floor but he stays in character perfectly throughout the entire film. It's true this movie has the same follow your dream formula but this is revealed through a sumptuous blend of beautiful characters especially the protagonists who spark some beautiful cinematic chemistry stunning dance sequences dazzling songs and unpredictable twists in the Cinderella storyline. Now I've noticed that many people have problems with regards to the age differences in the two lead actors. However one has to keep in mind that some of the most timeless classical romances  Jane Eyre Memoirs of a Geisha Emma to name a few  have characters who don't allow their ages to stand in the way of their love and who try to teach that love exists without any barriers. It's also important to keep in mind that in the actual film the characters' ages are not supposed to be that far apart Mary may look very young but Selena does have a childlike face . . . but a beautiful sweet face. I know I said I wouldn't judge according to the Disney franchise but it's safe to say that compared to all the other Disney Channel movies I've seen including High School Musical Jump in! and Camp Rock this is the absolute best! It's passionate and endearing and nothing short of amazing!".

First the people mostly preteens really who are absolutely obsessed with anything Disneychannel or Disneyfied related and therefore are oblivious to the talent of the actors.

Lynch has two daughters as well whom she encourages to dump all over poor Selena. Gomez was the daughter of one of Lynch's backup dancers who died and whom Lynch took in.Nevertheless Selena has two dreams a career in the business and a relationship with former boy band pop star Justin Timberlake like Drew Seeley. So if at some point in your life you've heard the story of Cinderella at any time from the age of two on up you know exactly how this film will turn out.Too make up for a most idiotic plot there is some really nice singing and dancing with Gomez and Seeley. Drew Seeley was the touring company standin for Zac Efron when the Magic Kingdom sent its High School Musical stars on the road. The young man has a lot of good notes in his voice and Selena Gomez is a very pretty and talented young lady.Would they had got a film more worthy.".

While Cinderella is played admirably the prince Charming role is a stiff wooden block. Drew Seeley doesn't have the charisma. He definitely can't match the importance of the role. Jane Lynch is the evil guardian and an aging pop star. It doesn't fit her. She has the comedic chops but they need to fit the role for her better. She looks nothing like the expected Madonna figure. It makes no sense. The stepsisters are played by the reunited costars from 'Ginger Snaps' Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. There are some good crazy comedic turns from Jane Lynch and Emily Perkins. And Selena Gomez has that sweet charisma. It makes for a watchable wacky teen comedy but nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strange Days is a truly astonishing science fiction offering part scripted by James Cameron and directed with relentless panache by maverick ladydirector Kathryn Bigelow. It presents a depressing and bleak yet worryingly probable view of the near future and hooks its story threads upon the impending millennium eve celebrations. Although December 31st 1999 has been and gone since the making of this movie it is a credit to the makers that this film still offers a plausible viewpoint about where the world might be at in the next decade or so.Ralph Fiennes seems initially miscast but soon wins over the audience as Lenny Nero a sleazy racketeer who sells memories captured on some form of disk similar to virtual reality but recorded from real experiences rather than computerised ones. He is desperately trying to get back with his exgirlfriend Faith Juliette Lewis but she doesn't want him as she has hooked up with a music producer named Philo Michael Wincott. Lenny acquires two disturbing tapes one showing the rape and murder of a woman the other showing a racially motivated slaying and before he knows it he is on the run from the culprits who want to kill him before he exposes their crimes. The only person he can trust is his best friend lady bodyguard Mace Angela Bassett. To complicate matters further his exgirlfriend Faith seems to know something about the disks and may either be involved in the crimes or at great risk from those responsible.Bassett is the real star here in the role of a lifetime as a morally strong and physically stronger heroine. Lewis plays the same old white trash girl she has played many times but at least she has the experience to bring total conviction to the role. The production values are incredibly high especially the party at the end which seems to realistically convey an entire city celebrating in the streets. The plot unfolds slowly but this is a strength rather than a criticism. Each new development slots into place beautifully and the audience is given time to get into the characters and the situations which in too many movies we are not allowed to do since the pace is often too frenetic.Strange Days is challenging and aggressive and frequently disturbing. It is also inventive and exciting and ingeniously staged. It is simply a terrific science film which any devotee of the genre absolutely must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The answer being of course yes I am impressed.What a thoroughly enjoyable film Strange Days is. Fastmoving and occasionally violent it's not high art but then neither is it dumbeddown fodder and it has much to commend it. The central plot revolves around an excop Fiennes doing a  to my ears anyway  convincing American accent peddling FBI technology on the black market. The SQUID technology Super conducting QUantum Interface Device electronically absorbs information from the central cortex and allows users to experience the thrill of another's sensations  be it murder sex robbery etc. Of course this central idea while fascinating does derive pretty much directly from a Twilight Zone episode. Were this a classic Zone episode from the bw era then people would have picked it up straight away and the game would be over. As it is the inspiration comes from one of the colour Twilight Zone episodes which had even less viewers than Strange Days and so the movie can rest assured it is safe in obscurity. Give up? Okay it was episode 23 season three 1989 The Mind of Simon Foster. I'm an anorak I know these things.But whether such were intentional is pretty much irrelevant as the magpie technique of this film takes from many texts and builds something greater than the parts. One of the two greatest science fiction films of the 90s  the other being the excellent Twelve Monkeys  both have builtin sellby dates by fixing their time period in a very near locale. Hence while the supposed date of Monkeys is long past at 98 this film now becomes a historical document as of New Year's Eve 1999. But then does it follow that we will stop watching 2001 in 2002? Hopefully not and Strange Days is one that too deserves to be revisited in years to come.The reason why I commend it most is its rewarding political stance. The development that gets adhered onto the Squid plot directly references the beating of Rodney King. Such contemporary referencing may again date it as quickly as the '99 setting but then we also have Angela Bassett as a very empowered yet caring black woman. Note how she and Lenny have exchanged traditional gender roles in this film yet this feels not like some macho woman schtick but genuine characterisation. Lenny is a likeable wisetalking street peddler who spends the film as a human punchbag. Gone is the cliched jawbreaking action man role for him instead his only retort to violence is I'll give you my Rolex. This sense of if you like PCness can also be evidenced with the lesbian couple kissing as the year 2000 breaks or the one scene only admittedly appearance of a disabled man as a central character.However the boundarypushing elements of this movie are tainted by the appearance of Juliet Lewis in the film. A capable actress her only role appears to be as a receptacle for various men's sexual needs or to gratuitously expose her breasts on multiple occasions. This is a great shame and a pity that a film which has such high intentions in almost every other area should fall back on unfortunate portrayal.The dialogue is pitched just about right without being particularly clever though occasionally it stalls. You're like a goddamn cruise missile targetted on making it Fiennes tells Faith Lewis at one point managing to keep a straight face. Later Bassett must endure having to say These are used emotions. It's time to trade them in and not use her gun on the scriptwriter. When the credits do roll it's perhaps no surprise that James Cameron was the cowriter as its slight perfunctory bythenumbers stance often reminds one of the machinations of Titanic. Tom Sizemore as Max is every inch the onedimensional Cameron character while plot twists sometimes feel heavily engineered. Maybe Jay Cocks is responsible for the script's more human feel with particular note going to the moral debate of whether or not to expose the LAPD's murder of an influential black rapper. The two leads debate internally as well as verbally a first for a Cameron movie the implications and the possible consequences of such an action. Despite its flirtation with the mainstream Strange Days is a film that dares to pervert the traditional course of Hollywood into a future that is worth seeing. Perhaps predictably it made little impact at the box office.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic scifi thriller with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife?Set in an alternate but totally recognizable Los Angeles of 1999 the world has seemingly gone completely to hell due to rampant poverty and classracial tensions which are pushing society towards an allout state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger other than possible addiction. So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology.However other than this particular device and general state of social affairs the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 very much to it's credit. No flying cars no wacky fashion no aliens no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard as it would have distracted from a very solid story.The films weaknesses are few but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so but to me it's a minor issue.The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog which really added nothing to the plot and honestly made no sense they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place even if it's purely for entertainment.Additionally in my opinion a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that the look of the movie is quite dated which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon Rodney King riots 90's hip hop culture rave clubs... things like that... just something to keep in mind although if you did live though it you'll appreciate the depth that these references add.But really I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely underappreciated piece of work and one of the best scifi thrillers out there.".

Angela Bassett is one of the toughest women cinema has ever seen and Juliette Lewis Tom Sizemore Glenn Plummer William Fichtner  every single role is casted perfectly...Strange Days is thriller drama and big city ballad in one piece. I cant remember any movie that reflects the philosophy of life of Generation X better than this one. Lenny deals with the Squids which are the experiences and emotions of men saved on a mini disc. Emotions as a product a drug  a compensation of modern life for the growing loneliness and anonymity. The only possibility for weak persons like Lenny to feel real. A movie like Fight Club woulnt have been possible without Strange Days other releases like The Cell or even Scorseses Bringing out the dead copied the incomparable make. Although this film is older than six years it hasnt lost anything explosive effects what is connected with the video clip style this movie has which gives Strange Days a touch of being ageless. The two most brilliant scenes are the opening sequence  the robbery in the Chinese restaurant  and the showdown down in the streets at the millenium party. Also the soundtrack Deep Forest Peter Gabriel Skunk Anansia Strange Fruit... is one of the best Ive ever heard what makes Strange Days an unforgettable experience for every watcher. 1010".

There is always something going on someone getting arrested or stealing something or burning something... all of it enhances the doomsday feeling you get when watching.I also find Fiennes' acting just short of perfect. His face his gestures and his entire being reeks of the sordid life his character leads. To cast him was genius. Lewis Sizemore Bassett and Wincott perform excellently as well  but it's really Fiennes that just makes this film happen.Do you want to see something unusual for a change?

	schema:reviewBody "Strange Days is an interesting film with a great premise. It also happens to be wellexecuted for the most part. The LA of the future well future back when it was released in 1995 is quite dystopian in nature and Strange Days manages to present all facets of that using Taxi Driverinfluenced car rides through the city while observing the chaos on the streets. In many ways Strange Days manages to create a reallife and convincing future and it feels like a true place with things going on independently of the events in the movie rather than feeling like a movie set. Atmosphere aside though the movie has many strengths. The plot is intriguing and it flows quite smoothly. A lot of the dialogue is really quite interesting and gives the movie a nice feel not to mention the actors do a pretty good job with the material. The characters are threedimension and interesting. While the beginning parts were somewhat disjointed at least in terms of plot they did serve as an excellent setup. When the movie was its best during the middle parts there is a frantic sense of urgency that really drives the picture along. It's a very entertaining movie and it managed to form an emotional link with me  always a good sign.Unfortunately it kind of goes downhill after that. Strange Days ends up resorting to awfully cliche ideas complete with plot elements seen a million times in movies before. All of this mars what could have been a real classic film. It's too bad that Cameron and Cocks had to resort back to this since the movie has so many strengths and so many great things that it could have built on. While the movie is still above average it just isn't as superb as it could have been. Nonetheless Strange Days succeeds on many levels and is well worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Strange Imaginative Underrated Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Strange Days' one of many films made in the mid to late1990s that chose to dabble in the near future of the year 2000' not only still looks good in the year 2001 but holds its own as a darn good film.   A mix of Blade Runner' film noir and uncomfortable realism Strange Days' has the audacity to tackle some disturbing topics and to actually tell an interesting tale in the process.Lenny Nero Ralph Fiennes is a black market peddler of VR films  memory implants that are downloaded directly into the brain allowing a person to vicariously sample someone else's experiences. The VR chips are like drugs as people find the shared virtual experiences far better than those they find in their own lives.  Lenny who's both dealer and addict is jarred back into reality when one of his friends is killed in vicious fashion  and the experience is captured on a VR film.  Lenny comes to believe that his exgirlfriend Faith Juliette Lewis may be next on the killer's list so he begins his own search for the killer partly to prevent anything bad from happening to Faith . . . and partly to impress Faith and possibly win her back.Visually Strange Days' is terrific  it's hard to see how this film could be better in that department even if James Cameron had directed the film himself.  Some of the shots are astounding such as a pointofview clip of a man running along a rooftop and jumping to his death then another simple clip of a woman on a date . . . it's part of a VR film sampling' one that gives the audience a taste of why the characters in Strange Days' think the films are so real and so voyeuristic.  Combine that with the way other things are filmed in Strange Days'  the closeup look of Lenny's face as he samples past memories through VR films the utter sweeping chaos of a riot as shot from high above  director Kathryn Bigalow creates a film that's visually mesmerizing.  The designers and special effects guys really went to town and should be given full credit for creating an outstanding memorable look for Strange Days'.Ralph Fiennes is awesome as Lenny  he's scummy and underhanded enough to keep himself from ever being a true hero but he imbues Lenny with enough affable charm and backbone to make him likeable nonetheless.  The rest of the cast falls short of Fiennes' great performance though  Angela Bassett is decent as limo driverarmed muscle Mace but Juliette Lewis is forgettable as Faith and considering that she's supposed to be the love of Lenny's life that drags the film down and Tom Sizemore is more annoying than menacing as villain Max Peltier.  The story while highly original is uneven as well  certain plot points get abandoned for no reason and sometimes the characters' motivations really don't make any sense at all save to advance the story into the next scene.  The quick pacing of the film and its imaginative look help to gloss over these weaknesses but they're still there just the same.Inventive and daring Strange Days' is a solid movie falling short of true greatness only because of the awkward execution of some brilliant ideas. Still it's very entertaining and definitely worth viewing especially if you're a fan of scifi films.  Grade BB".

	schema:headline " Strange Days........and a WOMAN directed this?!";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess James Cameron made action films better for all of us. Not just for the audience but for the actors and the people involved in the movies too. He even smashed the gender barrier in the world of action movies and gave us the toughest females ever Sarah Connor Ellen Ripley Helen Tasker and Lindsay Brigman. And in 1995 he wrote up a screenplay that had a really fascinating story about the impending millennium and he called it Strange Days. But instead of directing it he decided to hand over the directing duties to his exwife Katheryn Bigelow who made Point Break a few years before. And I've gotta say women have really earned their place in action cinema and we owe it to good ol' James Cameron.Strange Days tells the story taking place at the turn of the millennium from the 1000's to the 2000's and from 1999 to 2000. And due to the fact that it's a science fiction film it features an outlawed device called SQUID that people can use with inserted discs to see feel and experience an event that someone else already recorded. And a former cop named Lenny Nero Ralph Fiennes who is now a hustler and seller of this device frequently uses the thing that he devotes his life to in order to experience the old memories of his exwife. And two other subplots emerge when he gets a disc that reveals corruption in the LAPD and another that shows a serial killer stalking raping and murdering women. And it all finally converges at the end.Two years after playing the heartless Nazi Amon Goeth in Schindler's List Ralph Fiennes shows a completely different side of him in here. His character Lenny Nero is basically a vulnerable weak guy who happens to be a lying deceiving and vain hustler and due to his occasional silliness it's almost impossible to see the negative aspects of his personality. He's also quite stubborn and a fool for love since his exwife chose fortune and fame over him. And Fiennes was perfectly cast here due to his skill of conveying several personality traits into a character. Also his character is somewhat unique since he isn't really as macho and he seems to be more feminine due to his clothing style of silk and spandex. And we all know we can't keep rippingoff other movie characters to be make a profit and Strange Days does the opposite. It does what it should do to get originality.My favorite acting performance in here was without a doubt Angela Basset as Mace. We all know that James Cameron constantly puts tough female characters in his films but Mace in Strange Days takes the cake! She serves as Lenny's bodyguard and provides a couple cool fight scenes. Mace used to be an average woman and then her husband got arrested and when he started doing time Mace completely changed and became more masculine kinda like Sarah Connor between the first two Terminator movies.Tom Sizemore who is a Bigelow regular is great as Lenny's best pal and Juliette Lewis is great as Nero's exwife and she provides a realistic portrayal as the hot woman who wants nothing but money and could care less for morality and love. She also does some great singing in a couple scenes when she's performing with her band. And the dirty cop Steckler played by Vincent D'Onofrio before his Law and Order days is played flawlessly and he's a pretty scary guy and he's willing to do anything to cover up what he and his partner did although I'm not gonna tell exactly what in this review you'll have to watch and find out.Strange Days has got it all action science fiction suspense and romance. The SQUID things were really something cool original and creative and it would be even better if it was really invented someday. This isn't really as actionpacked as James Cameron's movies tend to be like since it's got a different director but the vision of Los Angeles is just remarkable there's arson fires and riots packed in almost every scene and its just horrifying. Even though it hasn't happened yet it makes you think and it makes you worry especially if you're foolish enough to be living in LA.And remember a woman actually made one of the greatest action adventures of all time. Katheryn Bigelow we salute you.".

If you haven't figured out who done it within a half an hour try something a little less complicated say Little Red Riding hood. The premise that by slapping on the mind meld machine usually worn under a wig is promising. Have an orgasm vicariously. Why not? But the plot abuses the idea to the point it becomes ludicrous along with the acting which is at all times ludicrous except for Angela Bassett. She acts her heart out trying to make this laughable movie work. To no avail. The continuity is nonexistent. In the final scenes people are beaten stabbed shot and go on like little has happened. A good part of the movie is spent driving around in a Taurus limo. You know that car's gong to get blown up for sure. Who would use such a car unless they were on the cheap and didn't want to blow up a Caddy or Lincoln. Juliette Lewisthe temptress attempts to be seductive as she sings but it's more a tribal squat than a sexual gyration. Mr Feinnes normally a fine actor just looks either pained or pathetic as he tries to make us believe he's having an epiphany while wearing the brain beanie. Of course it's hard to look post apocalyptic in 1995 when making a movie about 1999. We know what happened the night ushering in 2000. Nothing much. They have tired crews in the street waiting for riots. The same poor people in the streets day after day. D'Onofrio's death scene was totally unbelievable but that fit in. This thing dragged on for 2 12 hours. There wasn't enough substance for 30 minutes. Looking for a late night movie to put you to sleep? This will do the trick.".

The former cop Lenny Nero Ralph Fiennes is a dealer of illegal recording in CDs that gives the memories and sensations of the recorder to the user. He buys the recordings from the supplier Tick he misses his former mistress Faith Juliette Lewis who was a hooker and now is a singer his best friend is the private eye Max Peltier Tom Sizemore and the limousine driver Lornette 'Mace' Mason Angela Bassett who has unrequited love for him. Two days before the turn of the century the black rapper Jeriko One Glenn Plummer is murdered. The hooker Iris Brigitte Bako seeks Lenny out but there is an incident and they do not talk to each other. However she drops a recording into Lenny's car while he unsuccessfully tries to meet Faith at a nightclub. However her boyfriend Philo Gant Michael Wincott does not let them talk. When Lenny learns that Iris was sadistically raped and killed he gets involved in a sick scheme and discovers dirty hidden secrets. Strange Days is a strange action film with a weird story. Lenny Nero is a complete loser and noncharismatic character. Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes do not have any chemistry. Despite the confused screenplay and the flaws the story is intriguing. My vote is six.Title Brazil Estranhos Prazeres Strange Pleasures".

The hooker Iris Brigitte Bako seeks Lenny out but there is an incident and they do not talk to each other. However she drops a recording into Lenny's car while he unsuccessfully tries to meet Faith at a nightclub. However her boyfriend Philo Gant Michael Wincott does not let them talk. When Lenny learns that Iris was sadistically raped and killed he gets involved in a sick scheme and discovers dirty hidden secrets. Strange Days is a strange action film with a weird story. Lenny Nero is a complete loser and noncharismatic character. Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes do not have any chemistry. Despite the confused screenplay and the flaws the story is intriguing. My vote is six.Title Brazil Estranhos Prazeres Strange Pleasures";

	schema:reviewBody "Bombastic assault on the senses disguised as a brainy scifi action film. Set in 1999 the film follows former cop turned fasttalking street hustler Ralph Fiennes who specializes in selling disks containing the memories and emotions of people which is apparently the drug du jour. When he stumbles on a disk containing the murder of a prostitute he becomes embroiled in a police conspiracy rape murder and assorted sordid elements in order to rescue former girlfriend Juliette Lewis from peril.The premise for the film sounds a lot better than the execution and there is enough promise implicit in the material to give one the idea of what may have been if it had a director who could fashion a coherent narrative and sympathetic characters. As it stands it is impossible to tell which element of the film eviscerates it first or whether it is a cooperative effort. The film employs an earshattering soundtrack chronic noise and flashing lights and assorted irritating visual flourishes apparently believing that everyone in the audience suffers from ADHD.The storyline is convoluted to say the least and director Kathryn Bigelow seems to be on only a nodding acquaintance with it. Bigelow whose entire directorial output could conceivably have been directed by a testicle in the throes of puberty simply does not exist in the same zip code as logic or common sense and often sacrifices it for the next big bang which is never as exciting as she apparently believes it to be. She seems uncomfortable directing women and thus the misogyny is laid on with a trowel. The female characters in the film are on hand only to strip be raped be beaten or murdered. Even Angela Bassett's tough chauffeurbodyguard is subjected to a graphic beating which tastelessly draws parallels to the Rodney King beating of the era.The acting is a real mixed bag. Tom Sizemore and Vincent D'Onofrio trot out their stale sleazeball routines for another goround. Fiennes who seems to be jacked up on too much caffeine has rarely been this aggravating on screen. Bassett fares best despite being badly directed but still cannot make the last act attraction between her and Fiennes even remotely plausible. And just when you think things cannot get worse Lewis comes on screen with a teethgrindingly wretched performance that could singlehandedly derail far better films.Bigelow and company try to tie up the film's voluminous loose ends in an unsuccessful final orgy of violence and exposition but your patience will have long vanished before then. Despite attempts by Bigelow groupies to rehabilitate the film's image it was both a critical and box office bust at the time it still remains a shallow unwatchable mess with entire passages so unappealing that your first instinct is to take a very hot shower and scrub away anything that might linger from having experienced it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some promising aspects to the setup and the plot but it doesn't hold up for the entire film. The whole big revelation at the end is not a worthy compensation and much too obvious. Fiennes' character work is fine but the way the character is written makes him generically likable in a Spielberg kind of way and it put me off. Fiennes and Bassett just do not have any chemistry I appreciate that it was pretty daring for them to have an interracial leading couple but these particular actors didn't have it together. Bassett is one of those characters created in a petri dish by action movie screenwriters  the single mom who takes care of her family and is also an expert at martial arts and killing people.As the movie proceeds at its agonizing pace towards the obvious and overblown ending you can't help but suspect that the producer Jim Cameron probably planned to direct this film but bailed on that because he could tell that it just did not have the fundamentals of a good film. But much of the ephemeral stuff attached to the movie is equally onerous. I never saw the appeal of Juliette Lewis as an actress but this film not only put her past her ability in that department but exposes us to not one but two solo performances of her bland alternarock singing. Combined with the weak flow by the supposed superstar rapper Jeriko Glenn Plummer that would have seemed stale in the early 80s the movie is very terrible in terms of the music. In fact the strangest thing about the movie really is that it is set in 1999 so that it was outdated almost the moment when it came out. Yet it promised crazy technological advances in that 3 year span not to mention riots and craziness that never happened on 123199. So again you have to think that the movie was supposed to be made in the late 80s or the early 90s and that it just took forever to produce it to the point where they just pooped it out at the last minute. And that's about all you can say about the movie in the final analysis. Horrible supporting performances from Lewis and Tom Sizemore miscast leads in Bassett and Fiennes playing characters far less interesting than they're capable of a pointless and hackneyed cyberpunk story  it's a major dud.p.s. not sure if anyone mentioned here but the original script title for Blade Runner was Strange Days. Perhaps that was an homage I don't know.".

Is it the ridiculously outdated premise? The ugly misogyny permeating the whole project? The constipated acting from an embarrassed looking allstar cast? The whole silly Y2K hysteria? The overdone overthetop pretentious nihilism? Aside from Ralph Fiennes everyone's career was derailed permanently or temporarily after this fiasco certainly Angela Bassett who probably wants to erase the existence of this film from her resume along with SUPERNOVA. She was a rising star in the mid90s. Hyped as the next big thing. She even had a couple of successes between this and SUPERNOVA but her bad choices in starring in overblown Bmovies like this one rapidly deflated her starpower and she never became the leading actress everyone thought she would become.The funniest thing of this overdone film is the sciencefiction aspect. The concept of recording one's memory and experiences via technology is nothing new BRAINSTORM and the potential addictive effect of this technology is also nothing new VIDEODROME. So the science in this neonoir wannabe is not even remotely original as it think it is. But the whole VR stuff as shown in STRANGE DAYS is so outdated now that in 2007 no one and I mean no one even considers the whole VR trend as something remotely serious. This doesn't mean that in the near future there won't be some sort of VR technology but the kind shown in STRANGE DAYS is by now resoundingly silly. There's nothing sillier than outdated sciencefiction and STRANGE DAYS surfers immeasurably from this affliction. Because the sciencefiction aspect is now totally risible the superserious tone of the movie makes it look that much sillierAside from the look of the film which has that James Cameron look and few OK moments STRANGE DAYS is best forgotten as an overblown sleazy misfire.

But the whole VR stuff as shown in STRANGE DAYS is so outdated now that in 2007 no one and I mean no one even considers the whole VR trend as something remotely serious. This doesn't mean that in the near future there won't be some sort of VR technology but the kind shown in STRANGE DAYS is by now resoundingly silly. There's nothing sillier than outdated sciencefiction and STRANGE DAYS surfers immeasurably from this affliction. Because the sciencefiction aspect is now totally risible the superserious tone of the movie makes it look that much sillierAside from the look of the film which has that James Cameron look and few OK moments STRANGE DAYS is best forgotten as an overblown sleazy misfire. Erase this.";

	schema:reviewBody "Strange Days is a unique science fiction and mystery film. Set in Los Angeles during the last two or so days prior to the new millennium the cast is helmed by Ralph Fiennes as the charming brave but shady Lenny Nero. Lenny is a former LAPD officer who loses his job for mostly unknown reasons. He then becomes a black market hustler who sells people's recorded memories for profit. For the most part these recorded memories are either violent or sexual in nature.Angela Bassett does a great job complementing Fiennes' Lenny character in her role as Macy Lenny's close friend who makes a more legitimate living as a limo driver and security specialist. Lenny and Macy soon become embroiled in a murder mystery involving corruption within both the LAPD and the music industry. This seemingly everdeepening mystery also involves Lenny's other close friend Tom Sizemore's character Max. Max is a private eye who despite seeming to be very wellintentioned is just as shady as Lenny. Juliette Lewis rounds out the cast as Faith Lenny's troubled and devious rock singer exgirlfriend.Besides the awesome and wellacted performances what made this movie stand out to me is just how on the nose some of the background references are in it. References to an economic collapse increasing gas prices and strained relations between the police and minorities make this a very odd foreshadowing of the actual reallife future.In conclusion great acting a very deep and interesting storyline and great cultural references make this a very highly recommended film.".

	schema:headline " Strange Daysthe most underrated film of the decade";
	schema:reviewBody "Strange Days is a visionary science fiction masterpiece one of the best films of the decade and probably the most underrated.The film takes place in an alternative now a slightly more futuristic Los Angeles on the brinkthe very brinkof the new millenium.  As midnight December 31st 1999 approaches tensions are running high.  An altogether new kind of drug is taking over the streets.  A narcotic of technology it enables people to live someone's recorded experience.  This isn't like 'TV only better.'  The user experiences the action as if they were living it.  This allows the user to experience everything from sexual fantasies to the adrenaline rush of charging into a convenience store weapon in hand without any of the consequences.One of the wonderful things about Strange Days is that it succeeds on so many different levels.  First it is an intelligent and thoughtprovoking science fiction film in which the technology doesn't serve merely as the backdrop for a stylized action film but is integral to the plot and the theme.  The technology concept wasn't new to Strange Daysvisionary scifi writer William Gibson used the idea of recorded memories as entertainment in his groundbreaking brilliant and extraordinarily influential Cyberspace trilogy but the film handles it with great intelligence.  It poses the questions What is the value of real experience vs. memories or movies? And how are we as audience members complicit in the actions and events we witness?Secondly the film is a gripping mix of action and mystery directed with a terrific sense of momentum by Kathryn Bigelow.  From its tourdeforce firstperson perspective opening sequence until its poetically beautiful final image the film never ceases to propel its story forward and remain visually inventive and interesting throughout.Thirdly and of course most importantly the film is populated by fascinating characters who are played by wonderful actors and the film never loses its human element amidst the technology and action.  The film's antihero Lenny Nero is played with great intelligence and complexity by talented British actor Ralph Fiennes.  Lenny is a dealer in clips as the discs containing the recorded memories are called.  A wonderful introductory scene shows Lenny cruising down Hollywood Boulevard in his Mercedes eating a sandwich and conducting business on his carphone a la Typical Uncaring Movie Drugdealer oblivious to the acts of violence he's cruising past or the calls of panic on the talkradio station he's tuned in to as the new millenium is less than two days away while the effective technoglobal Deep Forest soundtrack serves as counterpoint to the action.  Later on though in a priceless scene we find that Lenny hasn't completely lost the kindness he possessed as a police officer as he gives a friend who has lost both legs a clip he had specially made of running along the beach and getting a smile and a hi from an attractive woman.Lenny is a rather pathetic man an addict as well as a pusher of his drug. Rather than living his real life he chooses to constantly relive his own recorded memories of happier times with his exgirlfriend Faith played by Juliette Lewis.  Faith an aspiring singer has left Lenny for bigtime music industry executive Philo Gant bad guy in every movie made 19911997 Michael Wincott whose record label represents rapper JerikoOne an angry and powerful voice for the black community who proclaims as the new year approaches 2K is upon us.  History will end and begin again.    Angela Bassett gives a pressure cooker of a performance as Mace Lenny's friend who struggles to snap him out of the past and Tom Sizemore a consistently interesting actor best known as Tom Hanks' friend Horvath in Saving Private Ryan is great here as Max a buddy of Lenny's from his days on the police force.Strange Days is in a sense a mystery and to say too much about the plot would be to give some things away.  Suffice it to say that the characters become entangled in a web of murder and deceit and by the time the truth of the crime is revealed it is also revealed that almost everyone's desires and motivations are more complex than we initially thought.  The scene in which Lenny finally tracks the killer down and the truth is revealed is a doozy a nifty verbal sparring match between two skilled actors in top form. Ultimately the film carries us over the brink and into the new millenium providing us with an image of poetic beauty that nicely ties up the film's ongoing concern with issues of race.  The film goes into darker places than most films go and still manages to be positive and uplifting in the end a story of hope and redemption and miraculously thanks to the skill with which it's written directed and acted it doesn't feel the least bit cliched or forced in its journey.A word of warning Strange Days has disturbing moments and one crime is particularly chilling.  Some people argued that this particular scene was overly gratuitous.  I don't believe this is the case.  Rather I think it is through this scene that the film explores one of the most interesting and complex issues it poses.  In the scene Lenny as well as the audience watches a clip a first person record of a particularly brutal murder. Lenny is positively repulsed by the clip and we are meant to be as well. Typically when we go to an action film we are allowed the luxury of feeling distanced from the loss of human life occuring on screen if we're not meant to downright cheer and rejoice.  In this scene in Strange Days by putting us in the killer's position James Cameron the film's story developer and coscreenwriter and Bigelow are implicating us in the onscreen action preventing us that luxury of feeling distanced and forcing us to consider the action in a much more direct and immediate way.  Why does Lenny refuse to deal in blackjack clips snuff films?  Probably because he believes that the purchasers and viewers of such clips are not completely free of responsibility for the crimes they are watching.In a way it's a shame that Titanic looms so large because while that's certainly a fine film Strange Days is Cameron's true masterpiece of the decade but in the public eye it will always be obscured by the big boat.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to start a review but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It's an absolutely lifeaffirming tribute to beloved characters and memories that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity and if you care at all about movies you need to see this as soon as possible. Jason Segel along with cowriter Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams with affection towards the Muppets and that love and passion has instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes to long history of Muppet shows movies and even viral videos. The film is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and accomplishes this without being crass or cynical it's smart witty and most importantly completely heartfelt. Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is by all accounts the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself. The original Muppet Movie will always be a timeless classic and it's charm and legacy will likely never be topped by another Muppet movie. However The Muppets is the closest it has ever come and due to the timeliness and poignancy of the story I would argue that right at this moment it is more relevant and moving than even the 1979 classic. I was unable to stop smiling during the entire running time of the movie even while tears were coming to my eyes. I know I'm not really reviewing the movie right now and I'm more just beaming about how much I loved it but really I feel it would be a disservice to go into details about this movie. Simply put you need to see it and if you don't you're robbing yourself of a truly extraordinary film experience. This is the most sensational inspirational celebrational Muppetational movie of the year. Go see it. Right now. I mean it go buy tickets for this weekend and you can thank me later. A".

This is the most sensational inspirational celebrational Muppetational movie of the year. Go see it. Right now. I mean it go buy tickets for this weekend and you can thank me later. A";

	schema:headline " A loving take on the Muppets";
	schema:reviewBody "There are very few of us twentysomethings who grew up without the Muppets. Between Sesame Street Muppet Show reruns and videocassettes of the various Muppet movies we saw these guys all the time. We even had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the '90s. My personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol which is still annual holiday viewing. In recent years since the very underwhelming Muppets from Space we've seen them pop up now and again mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short yet hilarious! YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that in this newest movie the Muppets are back in a big way! The movie starts by introducing us to a new Muppet Walter and his strangely human brother Gary. Gary has planned a trip with his girlfriend Mary to Los Angeles and he is taking Walter along to visit the home of his heroes Muppet Studios. They find the studio to be in disrepair and hear of an evil plot to destroy it. Can the Muppets and everything we hold dear about them be saved? To get my one complaint out of the way I do feel that this movie was a bit rushed in places. I wanted more time with these awesome characters and it did feel as if they were trying to get from one place to the next a bit too quickly.That said I spent nearly the entire movie with a smile on my face. These are the Muppets that I grew up with doing what they are best at doing with that gently edgy humor at which they have always excelled. While there are some moments that are very touching it is mostly very funny with lots of nods to The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie. While new little Muppet fans should enjoy this it will be much more meaningful to those who have a history with Kermit and Co.Clearly made with love for Jim Henson and his creations of fur and felt The Muppets is the most delightful movie I've seen in theaters this year.".

	schema:headline " Not Sensational Inspirational Celebrational or Muppetational";
	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets plays the music and lights the lights but it's not sensational inspirational celebrational or even muppetational and that's the most disappointing thing of all. What we have are two movies vying for the same space neither emerging victorious because they're not handled particularly well. On the one hand we have a soppy innocuous love story between Jason Segel and Amy Adams which is occasionally interrupted by musical numbers that have plenty of singing and dancing but hardly any life. On the other hand we have the Muppets themselves which would be fine except that they're almost completely reduced to background scenery and aren't given anything much to do. For all the effort that was put into the sets the costumes the special effects and of course the puppetry the film lacks the imagination and heart that made most of the previous Muppet films so enjoyable.In the earlier efforts human actors were essentially supporting players. The filmmakers had enough sense to let the stories unfold from the perspective of the Muppets all of whom were allowed to develop as characters. This is not the case with this film which gives ample time to Segel and Adams. They play Gary and Mary a wholesome sunny couple from the allAmerican hamlet of Smalltown where the population number on the welcome sign fluctuates due to the buses crossing the city limits. Much of the film is spent on their being deeply in love  and of course on the circumstances that test their emotional fortitude. We know right from the start that their relationship is silly but the real problem is that it's also unnecessary. It doesn't help that neither Segel nor Adams gives a noteworthy performance. Adams in particular is surprisingly out of place spending most of her time mugging girlishly.For their tenth anniversary as boyfriend and girlfriend Gary decides to take Mary on a trip to Los Angeles. Along for the ride is Gary's brother Walter who for reasons wisely left unexplained is a puppet performed by Peter Linz. Mary doesn't mind ... as long as Gary makes time for a romantic dinner. Naturally Walter is not seeing this from their perspective. Being only three feet tall and made of foam he always felt like an outsider. He found solace only in watching The Muppet Show and in due time he because the Muppets' biggest fan. His sole purpose in joining Gary and Mary is to take a tour of the Muppet Theater in Hollywood take note Angelinos The Muppet Theater is actually the El Capitan  which incidentally is where I saw this movie. It turns out to be a shadow of its former self a dilapidated tourist attraction no one is interested in.In due time Walter overhears the wealthy Tex Richman Chris Cooper who says he wants to turn the theater into a Muppet museum but has in fact discovered oil underneath and plans on taking it all for himself. The only possible way to save the theater as stipulated by the Rich and Famous contract Kermit the Frog signed in 1979 is if Kermit raises 10 million by a certain date. And so Walter Gary and Mary find Kermit performed by Steve Whitmire who now lives in an old decaying mansion in Bel Air. He decides that his only hope is to track down the rest of the Muppets and in the tradition of the Judy GarlandMickey Rooney backyard musicals put on a show. But is such a thing possible? As a TV executive Rashida Jones eventually makes abundantly clear the Muppets just aren't popular anymore. Under her orders they must have a celebrity host.We see some of the Muppets being found. Fozzie performed by Eric Jacobson performs in Reno with a mean tribute band called the Moopets Animal again Jacobson is undergoing anger management Gonzo performed by Dave Goelz has become a successful plumbing tycoon and Miss Piggy Jacobson yet again has made a life for herself in Paris as the editor of Vogue magazine. The rest are gathered during a montage. What bothers me is that just about none of the Muppets are given their fair share of screen time they're not characters but objects for the audience to point at and recognize nostalgically. The only exceptions are Kermit and Miss Piggy and even then something is missing. For the first time in their decades of being paired together they have absolutely no chemistry.Like most Muppet movies we're treated to a slew of celebrity cameos. These would include Jack Black Mickey Rooney Alan Arkin Neil Patrick Harris Sarah Silverman Whoopi Goldberg John Krasinski Selena Gomez Zach Galifianakis Rico Rodriguez Jim Parsons Judd Hirsh Emily Blunt and Dave Grohl. If you can think back to 1979's The Muppet Movie you'll recall that all of the guest stars were given more to do than flash their faces for a starcrazy audience. They played actual characters. Remember Steve Martin as the irritated waiter? I can count on one hand the guest stars in The Muppets who are given a purpose and are developed into anything resembling a personality. There's no reverence only hype and a lot of onenote jokes. The Muppets may find an audience through its harmless tone bright colors and broad humor but its thin plot shoddy soundtrack and badly developed characters are unlikely to appease diehard Muppet fans  or anyone in need of a good story.

I won't spoil them but there was some good fan service in the cameos.On the bad side  Jason Segal. Frank Oz didn't want to be involved because of the horrible script and I totally see his point. The movie isn't a Muppet Movie. It's a Jason Segal film staring Jason Segal produced by Jason Segal written by Jason Segal and utterly dominated by Jason Segal. Jason Segal takes up more than 50 of the film which is horrible considering there were about 40 other more interesting characters all competing for the remaining 50 of screen time. I've never heard of him before and I never want to again. Jason Segal so utterly dominates the film that the Muppets themselves are reduced to mere cameo performances in the film.With no Frank Oz the voice of Fozzy was just peculiar. Not only unrecognizable but occasionally slipped into being a woman's voice. Weird.The introduced character of Walter basically a Muppet clone of Jason Segal is just not interesting. I didn't care about him at all and hated the fact that his story dominated the Muppets to the point that we just don't get any story development about the Muppets themselves.Amy Adams usually entertaining is so dominated by Jason Segal that her character has no reason to be other than as a romantic object for Jason Segal. She's a bit of a nonentity in the film sadly.When Jason Segal isn't on the screen this film is quite good. Sadly he wasn't off screen all that much.".

In the end I just couldn't bring myself to think positively about this film. Here's why...First of all this is the first Muppet movie where the Muppets aren't the stars. Not only that it's not filmed from their perspective. Let's face it who really cares about Segel's character and the relationship with Amy Adams? This is a Muppet movie. Let the movie be about them. If Segel really wanted to bring the Muppets back he would have stepped to the side and let them shine.Way too much cheese. What is up with the high brow cheesy punlike songs? Segel looks at the camera and sings songs like a Saturday Night Live skit. Is he making fun of the movie? Is he just too overly excited? There's a level of dare I say it? integrity to the Muppets that is deeply missing in the movie. The Muppets always were able to blend in with the human world seamlessly without drawing too much attention to the fact that they were well.. Muppets. The line is very much more defined in this movie.It doesn't feel like a Muppet movie. All the old voicespuppeteers are either dead or were not involved with the movie. I'm not just talking about how bad the new voices are some of that can't be helped but the way the Muppets moved and interacted as Muppets. To me it was as if the original puppeteers stopped put all the Muppets down and then a whole bunch of new people picked them up and did their own interpretation of how the Muppets should act. The result? You get Muppets you don't recognize. Not only that it makes you sad because you wonder where they went. There was hardly a trace of the Kermit we all came to know and love in this movie. Same goes for Fozzie. Instead of feeling like close friends you love they felt like strangers to me.The movie wasn't all bad. Walter was a very endearing new character and really added to the story. All of the elements were there. They just weren't executed the right way.I think it all goes back to my first point. The Muppets were the supporting cast in this movie. Everything just falls apart as a result of that.".

	schema:headline " The Greatest Possible Addition and Tribute to the Series";
	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I don't just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on  it was clever entertaining adorable heartwarming and absolutely hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases everybody  average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike and that I believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy chock full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing their favorite puppets reunite for another big show literally.Funnily enough the movie treats the Muppet characters as if they were real life actors with The Muppets shows and movies being their past careers. The Muppets haven't seen any action in years a fact also true in real life and each muppet has taken hisher own path in life with varying degrees of success. When crisis arises the old troupe is forced to find each other and give it another go.It is all weaved through a fascinating metanarrative that begs the question what happens to the Muppets when they aren't The Muppets? After all this time away can The Muppets make a comeback through a reunion and relive their former glory days?  a question ultimately answered by the movie itself. The film opens with a common puppet named Walter whose childhood consists of watching The Muppets and dreaming of joining them. His older brother Gary Jason Segel extends the invitation to come with him and his girlfriend of 10 years Mary Amy Adams to Los Angeles so that he can visit the Muppet studio. Much to his disappointment the Muppet theater is abandoned and Walter even overhears an oil tycoon's Chris Cooper plot to tear down the place. Walter and Gary quickly seek out Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppet crew and remedy the situation but all the while Mary is upset that the turn of events is ruining her 10 year anniversary with Gary.As you can imagine from the premise alone the movie is a tribute to the Muppets in every sense. It travels respectfully through the old Muppet history and relives it instead of trying to replace it. In fact seeing how each one branched off from the group like members of an old band and grew up gave I would say substantially more character to each Muppet than they ever had before. I think fans will agree that this is the best possible way the muppets could have returned.Simply put I can't imagine anyone with a heart not enjoying this film. There's something in it for everybody especially if you're in the mood for laughter and catchy musical numbers. The creative humor was a breath of fresh air. There is plenty breaking of the fourth wall and oh so much of that lovely deadpan irony and absurdist humor reminiscent of old comedies like Airplane!

	onyx:emotionText "The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I don't just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on  it was clever entertaining adorable heartwarming and absolutely hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases everybody  average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike and that I believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy chock full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing their favorite puppets reunite for another big show literally.Funnily enough the movie treats the Muppet characters as if they were real life actors with The Muppets shows and movies being their past careers. The Muppets haven't seen any action in years a fact also true in real life and each muppet has taken hisher own path in life with varying degrees of success. When crisis arises the old troupe is forced to find each other and give it another go.It is all weaved through a fascinating metanarrative that begs the question what happens to the Muppets when they aren't The Muppets? After all this time away can The Muppets make a comeback through a reunion and relive their former glory days?  a question ultimately answered by the movie itself. The film opens with a common puppet named Walter whose childhood consists of watching The Muppets and dreaming of joining them. His older brother Gary Jason Segel extends the invitation to come with him and his girlfriend of 10 years Mary Amy Adams to Los Angeles so that he can visit the Muppet studio. Much to his disappointment the Muppet theater is abandoned and Walter even overhears an oil tycoon's Chris Cooper plot to tear down the place. Walter and Gary quickly seek out Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppet crew and remedy the situation but all the while Mary is upset that the turn of events is ruining her 10 year anniversary with Gary.As you can imagine from the premise alone the movie is a tribute to the Muppets in every sense. It travels respectfully through the old Muppet history and relives it instead of trying to replace it. In fact seeing how each one branched off from the group like members of an old band and grew up gave I would say substantially more character to each Muppet than they ever had before. I think fans will agree that this is the best possible way the muppets could have returned.Simply put I can't imagine anyone with a heart not enjoying this film. There's something in it for everybody especially if you're in the mood for laughter and catchy musical numbers. The creative humor was a breath of fresh air. There is plenty breaking of the fourth wall and oh so much of that lovely deadpan irony and absurdist humor reminiscent of old comedies like Airplane! The audience in the theater was cracking up almost every other moment myself included. And while humor is its strong suit the movie is also an incredibly heartwarming tale of friends that go their separate ways but are still connected through their hearts. Moviegoers and Muppet fans alike go see this movie!910";

	schema:headline " All you sceptics have no fear! I was once like you but the Muppets are here!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "For all of you who are wondering if this will even come close to capturing the magic of the original Muppet movie I just have one thing to say to you go see this movie!!!!! I was a little worried myself that this movie would not be great but tonight I gave it a chance. And I left with a smile on my face.  The story is that Gary Jason Segel Mary Amy Adams and Walter the new Muppet decide to take a trip down to Los Angeles Walter wants to see the Muppet studios but Mary and Gary are going for their 10th year anniversary of dating. There they discover the oil tycoon Tex Richman's Chris Cooper plan to tear down the Muppet theater. That's when they decide to get the Muppets gang back together and to put on one last show to raise enough money to save the theater. I'll let you put two and two together now.Warning This just might be my longest review so far on this website. That's right I loved this film so much that I have to ramble on and on about how much I love it.Let me first start off with the behindthescenes work. Jason Segel I applaud you. You believed in this movie more than anybody else and it is why they trusted you my man. Thank you so much for everything you have done on this film the result is that kids are now laughing at the Muppets while adults are reminiscing about the old days when Kermit Fozzie Miss Piggy Gonzo and the rest would come into their TV's and bring laughter into their homes. Both generations are coming out with smiles on their faces. As for the rest of the crew thank you so much for doing your job right. I am so happy that cgi and 3d was not used here so thank you for not incorporating those elements.Now to the actors the human actors. Jason Segel and Amy Adams are perfectly corny in this but it works here because it's the muppets! Their little story on the side was great it was not overplayed it was just right. I won't spoil what this sidestory is but trust me you'll enjoy it. Chris Cooper was perfectly evil here. I would say that he was one of the most evil characters in the history of the Muppets but even he gets a song in this movie.Speaking of the songs they are all so great and corny here. From the new songs like Life's a Happy Song to the great old ones like yes you are hearing this right The Rainbow Connection. They even have the celebrities in this movie singing Mahna Mahna in the credits. Loved every bit of it.And finally the stars themselves the Muppets. The trailers did emphasize Jason Segel and Amy Adams but make no mistake this is a Muppet film and the whole entire gang was back. Kermit is still the normal Muppet trying to pull it all together Fozzie still has a bad sense of humour Miss Piggy is still very selfish Gonzo is still trying to perform dangerous stunts Animal still plays the drums Rowlf still plays the piano and all the others are doing their thing. But let's not forget the newest addition to this wonderful gang Walter. If you guys are wondering if whether or not he is worth watching guess what he is worth it! He is a really likable character who grew up watching the muppets and therefore has found them to be his place in life. He is a very nice addition to the family and I welcome him aboard.Simply put I can't stress on how great this film is. Forget about Twilight The Muppets is where it's at! Everything about this film is great! Honestly I don't know why Frank Oz said that he felt like this film did not focus on character development of the Muppets. Um Frank I believe that the Muppets have been around for around 35 years now I don't think they need that much more character development. Simply put this movie is great. Kids will love the Muppets and Adults will remember why they loved the muppets when they were growing up. My only complaint is that this movie should have been longer but that's barely a complaint since I enjoyed the movie so much that I will give it a 1010. That's right a 1010 for me! Welcome back muppets!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a little bit very disappointed in that Segel Muppets movie. And he was so devoted to the 'original' Muppets creativity in his interview. The problem is the movie spent way too much time on bad tacky musical moments. Bad tacky not just tacky but purposefully bad chosen to be bad but done anyways while making jokes in the middle of it about it being bad songs. When they finally got to the Muppets stage performances all the stuff was mediocre as if that part of the movie was written as an afterthought. Don't get me wrong I am still a kid at heart and have an appreciation for fine immature humor but there was very little of that going around in The Muppets 2011. Lame immature humour was more like it. I got way more laughs watching 2 minutes of the Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody clip. This movie contains not one good Swedish Chef joke. Any Muppets fan I know can spontaneously spew a Swedish Chef moment just give em an axe and prop chicken. The 'celebrity host' was nothing more than an unwilling prop. The manahmana card was played in lame fashion. The old farts did not even have opportunity to make sarcastic puns and jokes because there were hardly any acts to joke on. Everyone had a bit part while the screen time was gobbled up with lame song and dance bits. AND to top it off the final act just plain sucked. Some mankid ordinary Muppet discovering his inner talent? Lame! Though if that performance was real in the sound booth that was some damn good ! ....or maybe it was the 6 small bag of popcorn that got me irked...".

	schema:headline " The Jason Segel  Walter Movie featuring the Muppets...";
	schema:reviewBody "While the We Built This City number really stands out amongst a few others in capturing the essence of classic Muppets overall Jason Segel and his puppet creation Walter simply wear out their welcome. Jason Segel Gary and Walter Gary's 'brother' usurpupstage and prevent the Muppets from rightfully ever taking center stage as opposed to eventually settling in and complimenting Jim Henson's life work. At some point the film stopped being The Muppets and more so The Jason Segel  Walter Movie featuring the Muppets. This awkwardly overbearing sentiment was cemented in one of the borderline self congratulatory final scenes of the film where Segel's new 'reluctant' hero Walter is lifted up by the 'thankful' Muppets the image on screen is brought to a still and framed in black and white...Whatever the motives were the resulting film begins with a 'tired' Kermit who never seems to become fully rejuvenated by films end and a Fozzie who is... a 'fuzzy' figment from Reno of his former self. Additionally neither of the two aforementioned lead Muppet characters is appropriately voice cast. For the sake of full character comparison voice mannerisms personality role etc. please take the time to watch or rewatch one or a few of the films this one is supposedly intended to capture the spirit ofpay homage to in addition to the original show itself of course! such as The Muppet Movie 1979 The Great Muppet Caper 1981 or even The Muppets Take Manhattan 1984. Had the Muppets really become that pathetic? Were they really long since forgotten and discarded to the ash heap of history only to be saved with a gueststarring role by Jason Segel who's passionate about both puppeteering and writing granted but is a little hard to actually connect with on screen... and his puppet creation Walter? Or is this more possibly a case of initial good intention having crossed the line into a wee bit too much self indulgence and become a vehicle for a little ok a lot of self promotion? Unfortunately it seems the answer to that question is the latter.".

	onyx:emotionText "While the We Built This City number really stands out amongst a few others in capturing the essence of classic Muppets overall Jason Segel and his puppet creation Walter simply wear out their welcome. Jason Segel Gary and Walter Gary's 'brother' usurpupstage and prevent the Muppets from rightfully ever taking center stage as opposed to eventually settling in and complimenting Jim Henson's life work. At some point the film stopped being The Muppets and more so The Jason Segel  Walter Movie featuring the Muppets. This awkwardly overbearing sentiment was cemented in one of the borderline self congratulatory final scenes of the film where Segel's new 'reluctant' hero Walter is lifted up by the 'thankful' Muppets the image on screen is brought to a still and framed in black and white...Whatever the motives were the resulting film begins with a 'tired' Kermit who never seems to become fully rejuvenated by films end and a Fozzie who is... a 'fuzzy' figment from Reno of his former self. Additionally neither of the two aforementioned lead Muppet characters is appropriately voice cast. For the sake of full character comparison voice mannerisms personality role etc. please take the time to watch or rewatch one or a few of the films this one is supposedly intended to capture the spirit ofpay homage to in addition to the original show itself of course! such as The Muppet Movie 1979 The Great Muppet Caper 1981 or even The Muppets Take Manhattan 1984. Had the Muppets really become that pathetic? Were they really long since forgotten and discarded to the ash heap of history only to be saved with a gueststarring role by Jason Segel who's passionate about both puppeteering and writing granted but is a little hard to actually connect with on screen... and his puppet creation Walter? Or is this more possibly a case of initial good intention having crossed the line into a wee bit too much self indulgence and become a vehicle for a little ok a lot of self promotion? Unfortunately it seems the answer to that question is the latter.";

Well the thing is that I went to watch the movie to the movie theatre and I really thought it would be funny or at least as Sesame Street. I went with my sisters and my mother I really had good expectations. When the movie began and I was reading the credits I started to worry when I noticed that the movie had been written by Jason Segel. Then the movie began with that annoying puppet named Walter. At first sight the movie seemed boring and I said to myself Let's give it a chance maybe it gets better when the muppets appear. I was wrong because all the muppets appeared and the movie was still boring and ridiculous. I don't care what people think this movie is so boring my mother and my sister fell asleep and I was almost about to and even my 9yearold sister was kind of mad and bored. I really don't understand what you find funny or charming about the movie.On the other hand the stars seem to be Jason Segel his dumb replica Walter and of course the ridiculous and boring Amy Adams not The Muppets as it should be. I really got disappointed because I thought it would be lots of fun but instead it was boring and simple. I just can remember myself watching the movie at the chair with my hands on my face sad mad and bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a huge fan of the Muppets for decades. Somewhere Jim Henson is turning in his grave or should be. This is just awful. The most immediate criticism that comes to mind is reduced to one word pacing. This drags like a corpse through the slowest zombie apocalypse movie ever made and as much as you hope it will pick up the pace you cannot eventually help hoping that someone will put this zombie to rest with a quick head shot. I wanted to like this movie. After all how can you go wrong with Muppets right? You expect formula maudlin music to tell us how we're supposed to be feeling and incongruous shots of glee in the midst of a terrible situation that you know will somehow be fixed in the last reel. You hope for better but you know how the predictable sells but this? This is a movie that didn't know what it was. It could have been  emphasis could have been  a meaningful yet light and entertaining criticism of being left behind and forgotten. You know like the middle class people who used to have enough income to waste money buying tickets and renting videos for movies like this. Instead we get a feel good Capitalist fueled commentary about combating cynicism.Amazingly there is also bitterness painted over as humor. Miss Piggy and Amy Adams' Mary have men who've done 'em wrong. They weave as much I am woman hear me whine mononormativity and passive aggressive co dependence as you might expect from a 1950s advice column white gloves included. It sends the wrong message to young women and the tacit expectation that men should tow the line and give them whatever they want no matter what they might want is simply appalling. It has NO business in a movie that children might see. The one ray of hope in the movie was Chris Cooper whose acceptably obvioussounding character Tex Richman Rich Man get it? provided a little Scroogeesque energy to this latter day Christmas Carol sans Christmas of course. Those hopes were quickly dashed though as he managed an even more puppet like performance than his costars. The one legitimately funny moment of the film came when the gang caught up with drummer Animal at an anger management meeting. I won't spoil it but watch out for it because it produced the only giggle in two hours. Cameos were dismal and apparent from an early appearance of Mickey Rooney to Zach Galifianakis' Hobo Joe to his Hangover costar Ken Jeong. The sole bright spot among the alsoran list was Jim Parsons as Human Walter. Maybe they'll let him come back in some future installment and actually show people how funny movies are supposed to be made.I only have two thumbs but if I had more I would give this ten thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult not to get swept up by the hype of the first theatricallyreleased Muppet movie in 12 years. The preview trailers have been going viral since this past summer and the Muppets  their human costars have been hitting the talk show circuit like never before. Audiences who don't catch on to this Muppet fever will be missing a refreshingly entertaining movie.The Muppets lives up to most of its hype. It's a solid standalone movie with a great storyline. While the film may be considered a tribute which in many ways it is very rarely does a tribute make a great movie. Any TV show can put the Muppets on proverbial pedestals using archive footage. The Muppets succeeds by breathing new life into characters we've known for years and bringing them back down from their high pedestals so they're easier to see.It really takes a Muppet fanatic to reintroduce these classic characters about whom the movie alleges everyone forgot. In the movie that fanatic is Walter who is himself a Muppet that the world treats like a human being albeit a very short human being. When Walter accompanies his best friend and roommate Gary Jason Segel and his longtime girlfriend Mary Amy Adams to Los Angeles Walter's ultimate goal is to take a tour of the famed Muppet theater. He soon finds that the theater's glory days are long gone and the Muppets themselves have since gone their separate ways.In reality it's Jason Segel who is the Muppet fanatic. Segel cowrote the screenplay with Nicholas Stoller director of Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2008 and also served as executive producer. He does a good job acting in the movie knowing precisely when to take a step back and have the film's real stars take center stage. As a screenwriter he also allows virtually every classic Muppet to have their screen time as the Muppets are brought together the same way Jake and Elwood reunited the old band in The Blues Brothers 1980. Each character's appearance reminds us why they were so revered way back in The Muppet Show days.The plot involving a Texas oilman wanting to demolish the Muppet theater because there is oil underneath has been done before but Chris Cooper as villain Tex Richman lives up to his clever name. He's funny while also being a convincing villain. He performs a rap number yes Chris Cooper raps that is desultory but amusing if only for its randomness.If the thought of Cooper rapping alone makes you cringe there are plenty of other highly original songs that will wash out that memory quickly. All the songs most of which were written by Bret McKenzie one half of the bandcomedy duo Flight Of The Conchords are wellwritten. My favorite was Man or Muppet sung by Segel and Walter which was funny and poignant.Pictures In My Head sung by Kermit is also surprisingly touching with Kermit's walking through a hallway of Muppet paintings adding to the sentiment. It could rank as the best Muppet movie song since Together Again from The Muppets Take Manhattan 1984. The aforementioned songs and perhaps even Life's a Happy Song have strong possibilities to be nominated for Best Original Song at the upcoming Academy Awards.With all these original tunes it's a wonder why they wasted precious royalty money on the terrible Starship song We Built This City. Alas this is the chosen song the Muppets sing while renovating the Muppet theater. While the songs add heart to a movie that makes the term franchise reboot seem too myopic the movie would not be worth watching if it was not funny. Fortunately most of the Muppet gags are gutbustingly hilarious. Some gags are selfreferential with characters breaking the fourth wall without even have to look at the camera. Others are the zany gags you'd expect from seeing The Muppet Show but are clever and hilarious too.While the trailers had their share of recent movie parodies the film fortunately eases up on them. There's one reference to Kill Bill but it's slight and capricious. I also laughed at the 80's Robot.All the classic Muppet characters make their mark in ways they haven't done since The Muppet Christmas Carol 1992 the last great Muppet movie. The few newer Muppets that are allocated screen time happen to shine fortunately. Walter is a great new Muppet and has a lot of heart of which the late Jim Henson would wholeheartedly approve.Dozens of celebrity cameos abound here but the film's strength is knowing who the real stars of the movie are and why we love them. I just hope younger audience members get the same message.".

	schema:headline " A heartfelt and hilarious tribute to The Muppets";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the best Muppet Movie since 1981's The Great Muppet Caper which is saying a lot because I hold that film in very high regard.The Muppets have been rather hit and miss since Jim Henson passed away. The Muppet Show was originally started by Henson and Oz as a more adult oriented yet still family friendly comedy variety show as an outlet for gags and bits that wouldn't work on Sesame Street. It worked too both kids and adults loved the show and the first three films are classics in their own right. But sometime in the 80s The Muppets started to cater more towards Kids rather than adults. The Muppet Babies were first introduced in the third feature film which eventually spawned its own series. Henson then sold the franchise to Disney and sadly died shortly thereafter. It seems that after the success of Muppet Babies Disney decided to continue to move The Muppets in a more kid oriented direction ... one with a decidedly Disney flavor to it. This didn't really help the Muppets legacy in the long term. Kids grow up and eventually grow out of kid shows and movies. And with very little if any appeal to adult audiences The Muppets were soon forgotten by the generation who grew up in the 90s and 2000s.But the generation that that grew up in the 70s and 80s had not forgotten the old Muppets in fact they missed them dearly. Jason Segel is one of those people and it is clear from this film that his enduring love of The Muppets and the influence they had on him as a child was the driving force behind this movie.This is a comeback movie. The Muppets start off in a bad way. People have forgotten them their abandoned studio is about to be torn down and they just aren't popular anymore. This is reflecting the actual situation The Muppets franchise was in at the time they were making the movie. And thus the plot lends itself to fourth wall jokes that were so prevalent in the early films.It is for the most part a return to form. This is old school muppet humor at its best. You have the silly and catchy musical numbers mixed in with a bit of sincere songs celebrity cameos fourth wall jokes pop culture humor a self aware plot that frequently pokes fun at itself Fozzie's bad jokes Statler and Waldorf's heckling a Kermit and Miss Piggy romance plot and just general wackiness and slapstick.Still as similar as it is to the old Muppet formula it's also quite different. After Disney took over human characters often played larger roles in the Muppet films. That is the case with this one. In fact much of the plot and humor in this film is not centered around the muppets at all but are centered around the two human characters and the new muppet. While some may be disappointed by this change I have to disagree and say that for this film it works and works quite well. Still it's clear that Disney doesn't have much confidence in The Muppets holding the film together on their own like they did in the original and best Muppet Movie.As a result there are times where the movie feels less like a Muppet Movie and more like a tribute to the Muppets. In some ways this is the film's strength in other cases it is a weakness. Also some of the bits in the second half seem a bit awkward and fall flat often on purpose but usually it isn't worth the payoff. Nevertheless this film hits on an emotional and nostalgic level especially for those who grew up with The Muppets. There were times when I actually felt a tear come to my eye. It's that moving.The film's success so far has been warranted and I'm hopeful that Disney will do the right thing and green light The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made a project Henson and Oz had been pushing for since 1985. There were even plans to make it in 2009 but the project was set aside for this film instead. Hopefully this last idea by Jim Henson will be the next sequel the premise certainly looks like it has potential.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was the best Muppet Movie since 1981's The Great Muppet Caper which is saying a lot because I hold that film in very high regard.The Muppets have been rather hit and miss since Jim Henson passed away. The Muppet Show was originally started by Henson and Oz as a more adult oriented yet still family friendly comedy variety show as an outlet for gags and bits that wouldn't work on Sesame Street. It worked too both kids and adults loved the show and the first three films are classics in their own right. But sometime in the 80s The Muppets started to cater more towards Kids rather than adults. The Muppet Babies were first introduced in the third feature film which eventually spawned its own series. Henson then sold the franchise to Disney and sadly died shortly thereafter. It seems that after the success of Muppet Babies Disney decided to continue to move The Muppets in a more kid oriented direction ... one with a decidedly Disney flavor to it. This didn't really help the Muppets legacy in the long term. Kids grow up and eventually grow out of kid shows and movies. And with very little if any appeal to adult audiences The Muppets were soon forgotten by the generation who grew up in the 90s and 2000s.But the generation that that grew up in the 70s and 80s had not forgotten the old Muppets in fact they missed them dearly. Jason Segel is one of those people and it is clear from this film that his enduring love of The Muppets and the influence they had on him as a child was the driving force behind this movie.This is a comeback movie. The Muppets start off in a bad way. People have forgotten them their abandoned studio is about to be torn down and they just aren't popular anymore. This is reflecting the actual situation The Muppets franchise was in at the time they were making the movie.

Statler and Waldorf.For the last two months of attending films an ad has preceded each movie. Instead of the obligatory please don't spoil the movie by adding your own soundtrack narration a cute lively spontaneous Muppet skit was shown where Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy were trying to attend a peaceful movie with the remainder of the Muppet characters making loud and disruptive noises. At the end the quote above was said by Statler and Waldorf and it will forever sum up my thoughts on the film.To effectively experience the rambunctious Muppets you should see their liveliness in the theater. It seems a screen as big as a theater's can't contain their actions. But I'm sure that once The Muppets hits DVD and BluRay many parents will be forced to watch the film again and again on replay. It's a better choice than Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Zookeeper for sure.The Muppets is an extremely selfaware revival to a franchise that will never die. Jason Segal who also worked on the screenplay of the film clearly is a superfan of the movies and the Television series and wanted to give the series a much needed return to the big screen. He doesn't try to parody the formula or rework it in any way but instead glide along with it in hopes of achieving the best film possible. He doesn't put his usual goofball spin on his character he's done in the past.Set in Smalltown USA Gary Segal lives with his Muppetbrother Walter voiced by Peter Linz and is dating the lovely and adorable Mary Adams. Walter has grown up with Gary for years and is one of the biggest Muppet fans of all time which leads me to believe he is reflecting Segal's personal love for The Muppets. Upon going to The Muppet Theater Walter overhears Statler Waldorf and Tex Richman Cooper discussing plans to sell the theater to Tex. But Tex is secretly planning to tear down the theater and drill for oil underneath it.So the only plausible situation in Walter's head is to talk to Kermit the Frog who appears in a glowing light at the nic of time and convince him to reunite the old Muppet crew to put on a Telethon. Then they're off getting back every character in creative and inventive ways.In the time of gimmicky and useless 3D madness leaching onto every children's films here is a movie that doesn't believe it should subject itself to dimming its colors and its actions just to garner in a higher revenue. The Muppets are such an eclectic and effervescent bunch that the 2D world can handle them perfectly fine.There are a few things that I noticed here and there. The main one is definitely the voices. If you're a Muppet fan you may be disappointed to notice that voices like Kermit the Frog aren't on par with the voices from the series and the previous films. Still it doesn't take long before you forget that fact. Also the lack of cameos astounds me. There are quite a few but the ones edited for time constraints like Danny Trejo Mila Kunis Ricky Gervais George Clooney Lady Gaga sounded fun and enlightening but also limitless in possibilities. Of course we do get pleasant cameos like Zach Galifianakis Jack Black and Alan Arkin but it feels like that for once the cameo portion wasn't focused on a lot like in previous Muppet films.I also have to say I was a little disappointed that popular Muppet characters like Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog after all these years still gets brought to the foreground leaving many secondary characters in search of a time to shine. One character that needed a musical number was the Swedish Chef personally one of my favorite Muppets next to Statler and Waldorf. The Chef needed at least one musical number but the film just incorporates him very vaguely and rarely. Along with other Muppet characters like Gonzo and Fozzie Bear.There is still plenty here for amusement and The Muppet character never cease to put a smile on your face whether you're old or young. Although targeted to families I'm not sure many kids would get the references but immediately dive into the bright colors in this unique world. I don't think the film really cares if you get the joke or not. I think the idea is just happy to be back on the screen one more time.Starring Jason Segal Amy Adams Jack Black Zach Galifianakis and Alan Arkin. Directed by James Bobin.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Disney's major release for the holiday season they went with an old stand by the Muppets in a film simply called The Muppets. It's a strange blend of humor nostalgia and satire. Here we meet Walter who we know just by looking at him is a little bit different. He is well for lack of a better word a Muppet. The only thing is he is a Muppet living in the real world and not I stress not a member of the Muppet gang. At a very young age he fell under their spell through television and video rentals. Walter's dream was to walk through the studio that his beloved Muppet's walked through. He gets his chance to meet them when his brother Gary Jason Segel who also cowrote the script takes his girlfriend Mary Amy Adams to Los Angeles.Walter finds out that the Muppets aren't as popular as they used to be. He finds only remnants of the glory days in a dusty studio but winds up uncovering a sinister plot intending to bury the Muppet franchise for good. With so much at stake Walter goes to great lengths to find his idols and bring them back together. With the help of Gary Amy Kermit Fozzie and the rest of the gang Walter sets in motion a reunion scenario where if the Muppets put on one last show they can raise enough money to stop the maniacal Tex Richman Chris Cooper from ending the Muppet's hopes of survival.It's almost like The Blues Brothers where if the band gets back together all will be saved. The only difference is that for the audience it's like a reunion too. We haven't seen the Muppets together save for a few commercials and music videos here and there. I would be lying if I said I didn't get goosebumps seeing Gonzo with his chickens or the Swedish Chef and his manhands. Without even trying this film grabs you right in the heart squeezing every ounce of childhood you have left in there.It is really evident that Segel took the task of acting and more importantly writing very seriously. His heart really comes through. He didn't want to do an injustice to the franchise that gave him so much pleasure as a youngster. It's as if he wrote Walter as a Muppetization of himself which really comes through during one particular musical number. He follows the Muppet formula of combining cultural references with the power of celebrity and the importance of silliness and childlike inhibition.Has any of the magic left the Muppets? I don't think so. I must admit that some of the story points were a bit ridiculous and sometimes a little too on the nose yes I am aware that it was trying to be but doing it too much becomes tedious. I wasn't entering the film expecting completely revamped Muppet style. It was by the book aimed appropriately at both children and adults without ever stepping too far in either direction.The BIG question remains...now what? The whole point of the movie is to show that the Muppet's have basically become an afterthought. A fond memory that quickly fades. Will this film attract a slew of Muppet followers? Will there be another film? Television show? Who knows. The movie ends optimistically but how could it not? The thought of a world without the Muppets is scary. It's nice knowing that somewhere Kermit and the gang are waiting for their next queue. To light the lights put on make up and all that jazz.So go treat yourself to a little taste of your childhood. It will do the soul good.".

I held back any hope so I would would not disappoint myself but even doing that didn't stop me from being completely deflated after seeing this film. What really sucks about it is that people think this actually good. This isn't a Muppet movie this is a crappy film with some familiar looking puppets and few mediocre songs.The story is based off of some ironically generic plot that really is more dull then smart. Kermit was a shadow of himself he was just another puppet pushing the one dimensional storyline. There were no sincere relationships in any two seconds of this film except for the new Muppet Walter and his human brother. Where was the funny banter between Miss Piggy and Kermit their relationship in this film was so trite and uninteresting. Hardly any of the characters had time to shine. The cameos were sad and forced mere plugs for Disney's other shows on ABC and Disney channel.Grant it this is suppose to feed off of The Muppet Show so the Muppets in the film are already claimed celebrities but part of the situational humor in their films is that 'real people' characters are usually surprised by the Muppets as being curious talking animals but never quite believe it to be impossible.The songs were whatever not bad not great but what I love is when they actually get around to singing Rainbow Connection they take you right out of it. This film is banking on your nostalgia they barely give you a moment to feel it. But they do want to make sure they quench your thirst for crappy 80s songs that are incessantly plugged every 15 minutes in the movie probably to solidify what ever continuity they think this one note story has.Now for nit picking the Muppets themselves were poorly created puppets. Miss Piggy does have phases of quality throughout her career but this is the poorest of them all. They also made sure you saw this film as they are puppets. Every shot in the film was framed the same waist up. Yes I know they are puppets but usually film gives allowances to be creative and give opportunities for fun life like illusions. You can count on one hand the shots where you saw a Muppet standing. This film highlights minimal imagination and franchise dependency.I am not accustom to bashing anything but this is a heartbreakingly bad movie. And not even as a Muppet movie but as a movie in general. If you don't believe me watch The Great Muppet Capper. Sorry Jason Segel.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets is one of the most gleefully smashing movies of 2011. It's one of those pictures that is not only charming and clever but does not smugly rub its accolades into the faces of the audience so that they may just sit back and enjoy the show. Watching the picture with an auditorium full of persons from all ages and joining in with the unanimous laughter and cheers and shameless eartoear grins was one of the great experiences that I have had in a movie theater. It's like one of those classic Broadway shows where even though you've seen it a dozen times and have a general idea of what to expect you get never tired of. I personally loathe the idea of the Muppets ever disappearing from the screen. But never fear this movie is proof that is not about to happen any time soon.This movie starts not with any of the old gang but instead a brand new sockpuppet character by the name of Walter voice of Peter Linz who looks sort of like a tan tuxedoed Kermit the Frog with a tuft of hair on his head. He's the brother adopted? of a human Jason Segel who is also his best friend but has always longed to be one of the Muppets who have sort of fallen out of their pinnacle as they have in real life until now. And just like until now their fame is foundering until Walter and his brother and his brother's fiance Amy Adams journey to Hollywood. There they not only bump into Good Ol' Kermit the Frog but discover that an evil oil tycoon a perfectlycast Chris Cooper is planning on demolishing the Muppets' old studio. The only thing that can stop him as Statler and Waldorf point out in a comically oncamera acknowledgment of a plot point is if the Muppets can raise ten million dollars. And the only way they can do that is come back together again and put on a big show.The first half of the movie spends the appropriate amount of time collecting all of our beloved characters. The movie devotes enough space to each and every one of the primary characters so that they don't feel like just points pushing the plot further along. The second half of the movie is where it really really gets good. It is completely devoted to the revival of the Muppet show in which they try new tactics and also reuse the familiar but never tiring gags that they have done for decades. Here the movie really scores strongly by diving right into the hearts of the audience. Just watching the performances by the Muppets was soullifting it was like being a kid once again watching earlymorning shows on the weekend or before school as I did a lot growing up. Simultaneously the movie works with a 'struggle for success' kind of suspense plot and frankly waiting to see if the Muppets will succeed or fail in saving their studio and the results may surprise you! is much more intense than seeing which side of Michael Bay's frighteningly personalitydevoid robotarmies will triumph over the other or whether at least one emptyheaded college kid will survive getting gobbled up by a shark. I really do not want to give away the ending but I will say this much. It reminded me a lot of the ending of the underrated classic A Boy Named Charlie Brown which also found just the right note about the difference between success failure and the importance of never giving up.What also makes The Muppets such a great moviegoing time is the way it kids around with itself with the characters acknowledging plot points and mentioning the budget of the movie. Furthermore it makes great moments in drawing in celebrities such as Whoopie Goldberg Selena Gomez Alan Arkin and Jack Black who steals all of these cameos in some of the most hilarious moments of his upanddown career for appearances that are not mere throwaways. Cap onto that some wonderfully earworm musical pieces. Three of the classic Muppets songs are reused the rest are brandnew. The opening number is particularly good reminding me of the musicalcomedies of Hollywood's golden era. The best and most funny of them being when Walter and Gary are duosinging Man or Muppet along with reflections in the mirror. The gag is that the reflection is a character who is the opposite of what they are.What do I mean exactly? Well rather than give it away I'll let you go see the movie.It is a wonderful thing to be surprised by movies but it is even more glorious to go in with high expectations to have them all met to the hilt. The Muppets is one of those movies. Hollywood has made countless revivals spinoffs and remakes in recent years and some of them have felt absolutely unnecessary and tiring but not this movie. This is a revival that deserves to go on and on. And it is so clever and smart and charming with the way it handles itself that it deserves to be seen by people of all ages regardless of how much or little they know about the Muppets or their creator the late Jim Henson. But whether you are a longtime devotee or newcomer this new The Muppets will leave you hungry for more. There is also a key moment midway through the movie when a TV producer is describing to the Muppets their onair competition the violence and pseudohip garbage that children have been flooded with. And in the end the scene proves to be a commentary on an element of American culture today and reminds kids and parents that something like this is more pure and important in a child's life than what they usually find on the television today. And there is still magic to be found at the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez are exspies who were at the top of their game until they met married and decided to retire for their own mutual safety. Years later they have normal lives and have children who know nothing of any of this. When Gregorio learns of former colleagues vanishing he looks into it only for him and Ingrid to be captured by the evil Floop whose children's television puppets are really mutants developed as part of building a private army for Lisp. With their parents gone and the alarm raised Carmen and Juni learn the truth and are suddenly faced with having to rescue their parents.You shouldn't come to this movie expecting it to be serious or logical because it really isn't. Instead it is silly goofy and really very daft but still quite good fun for slightly older children and also for adults. The plot is pretty much summed up by the title insofar as you really need to know what is going on because it doesn't make much sense. The film is really about the kids becoming spies and playing with gadgets etc on their way to becoming heroes of a sort. It never takes itself too seriously and it draws humour from this approach well making it easy to relax and watch because yes it's silly but at least it knows it is silly. The Floop creations are too silly to appeal to adults but will probably provide some laughs for kids but generally the film gets the tone right for both groups.Rodriguez directs with his usual approach and I quite enjoyed the effect it had here because it does suit the silly hyper material which he also wrote. The effects are mainly good and it should work for most kids in the way that older boys like their gadgets and fantasy video games. The cast did it for me as well featuring as it did a lot of people who've worked with Rodriguez before. Banderas and Gugino are both sexy and cool in the parental roles but it is Vega and Sabara who lead the film. Neither of them are typically cute kids and it helped me enjoy the film for them to be quite natural and buy into the material. Support is surprisingly classy and most of them work. I didn't like Cumming at all but that was more to do with his character Shalhoub was OK Hatcher was fun Cheech pops up briefly Patrick has a small role Trejo is ever reliable and George Clooney puts in a small but amusing appearance.Overall this is not a great film because it all nonsense but then as a kids' film it doesn't matter so much. The energy pace and sense of fun covers up for the daft central plot and nobody seems to be taking it seriously. Surprisingly fun to watch even for adults and worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPY KIDS  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchIf James Bond married another secret agent had kids privately continued his life as a spy became captured and left his rescuing to his offspring we would have the formula for Robert Rodriguez's new action adventure Spy Kids. Rodriguez normally directs harsher more brutal movies like Desperado and The Faculty but accustoms a slick style of adventure and humor in this film that exceeds past the level of any of his recent work. Spy Kids really does belong in some kind of James Bond picture.As the film's writer director and co producer Rodriguez does a lot more with the material here than we expect. The film has a stunning array of special effects ranging from walking thumbs to a particularly imaginative experience in the villain's headquarters. Even the introduction has zest and intrigue we meet a seemingly normal family of four consisting of Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez Alexa Vega and Antonio Banderas and their children probably middle school aged Juni and Carmen Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega. As the movie opens Ingrid tells her children a nice bedtime story about two daring spies assigned to kill the other but fall in love get married and retire. She prepares her offspring for bed and turns the lights off walks to her husband and explains she thinks it would be a good idea to tell Carmen and Juni their real identities as topsecret spies the story Ingrid enlightened her kids with was true. Rodriguez quickly sketched his characters but his method is surprisingly effective the movie starts out with fastpaced action and captures our attention abruptly and does not really lose energy throughout its running time. We learn the two married spies have retired from the business nine years prior but their fellow OSS agents are disappearing all over the world and thinks it to be the work of a kids TV show host named Fegan Floop Alan Cumming in a very whimsical fitting performance and his assistant Minion Tony Shalhoub. The agents have been converted into claylike animated characters held captive at his mega tech laboratory.  Imaginative and interesting if a bit cheesy. Ingrid and Gregorio call their Uncle Felix over to watch the kids while they go out on their latest mission. Unfortunately this mission could be their last they walk right into a trap and are snared from beneath their toes. Felix receives a distress call sends the kids to a safe house but is captured himself leaving the responsibilities to the younger members of the family. The story isn't cheap or silly although some of the material tests our tolerance for farfetched science fiction. The underlying motives here are also legitimate. The movie puts confidence in strong family values honesty and trust but does not preach lecture or on the other side of the barrel become lost in an utter mess of silly dog poop and passing gas jokes like See Spot Run. The movie takes itself seriously and is well written. We understand the character's motives.   Spy Kids gets one thing painfully right and that is therelationship of the brother and sister. Their relationship is all too familiar in American households where name calling and meanspirited behavior inhabit offspring of both sexes. The petty little conflicts they feel strained and forced giving this movie otherwise somewhat mature an immature sensation. This familiar stereotype is profoundly irritating.Spy Kids is often exciting funny and almost always entertaining. It is not the kind of movie that parents should just drop their kids off to however but should stay for themselves to witness some of the most effective family movie moments in quite a while. In a time when family movies are completely disposable Spy Kids proves itself to stand out from all the others and provide us with a genuine spy movie experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPY KIDS  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchIf James Bond married another secret agent had kids privately continued his life as a spy became captured and left his rescuing to his offspring we would have the formula for Robert Rodriguez's new action adventure Spy Kids. Rodriguez normally directs harsher more brutal movies like Desperado and The Faculty but accustoms a slick style of adventure and humor in this film that exceeds past the level of any of his recent work. Spy Kids really does belong in some kind of James Bond picture.As the film's writer director and co producer Rodriguez does a lot more with the material here than we expect.

All of the acting was high quality and the special effects first class.I shall enjoy it again in the future on video but it deserves to be seen on the big screen first.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a somewhat unusual film it's a children's film but it doesn't talk down to its audience. And as an added bonus it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too littleknown short Bedhead Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives themand us a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kidsspy equipment hidden in children's things but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films the kids are the heroes which puts too much pressure on them as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual highas most of the actors are quite talented no performances really let you down even the intentionallyoverplayed ones. The characters many of them fairly clichd and thin are all credible. As with manymost Rodriguez films pretty much all of those that he's written himself... there are subplots and such many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good I laughed out loud several points rather unusual for children's films and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs either. The special effects are quite impressive and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting and like the humor it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguezsuch as myself which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place will enjoy this if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 710".

Amazing fantasy world some true menace and a great message about being true to yourself and your family.Spy Kids as a family movie for the postMatrix age. It's witty but never falls into that ohsohip fauxironic self awareness that plagues so many movies today. It hands you a fantasy world and encourages you to believe in it.It has a great deal of action and slapstick but thankfully was completely missing the meanspirited undertones of the slapstick in Home Alone.Like all great children's literature or entertainment Spy Kids doesn't talk down to kids. It assumes they're intelligent and can pay attention. Having said that there are sections of the film that are hyperkinetic but they flow naturally.It has something of a similar vibe to the Pixar films Toy Story 12 Bugs Life without as many injokes. There are some wonderful adultonly laughs mostly stemming from the trials and tribulations of being a parent.It's PG for a reason. It's not for the youngest moviegoer. A mature 5 or a sixyearold is about as young as I'd recommend. There are some scary moments ala Willy Wonka or The Wizard of Oz. But that's good scary in my book as opposed to needlessly scaring folks to death.The message of family is delightful. The Cortez family is a real family. They have disagreements but they love each other. Thankfully Rodriguez avoids the sitcom smartmouth syndrome and gives us kids we can believe.And I love the fact that Rodriguez never downplays the Latino heritage of the family. Hey I'm so Anglo I'm practically translucent but it was such a refreshing change to not have typical whitebread heroes out to save the world.Not since Bob Porky's Clark pulled A Christmas Story out of his hat has a director come up with such a pleasant surprise in a genre you'd never imagine. Summary? A cup of Bond a splash of Willy Wonka and a dash of The Matrix. Sit back and watch the fun!".

Alexa Vega i thought was the best one in the cast! She is a great teenage actress and should go really far in the Hollywood movie making business. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. There was Also Antonio Banderas and it was an okay movie not the best but i expected better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spy Kids is one heck of a movie. Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best The Matrix and worst Baby Geniuses movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so PG and director and writer Robert Rodriguez From Dusk Till Dawn manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.He manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. Spy Kid's is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.The basic set up for Spy Kids is this. Gregorio Antonio Banderas and Ingrid Carla Gugino were both spies working for different agencies when a hit put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife and soon father and mother.But the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen Alexa Vega is skipping school while Juni Daryl Sabara is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.They see how their past lives have affected their children but before they can correct their wrong their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies but only end up being captured themselves.The culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star Fegan Floop Alan Cumming. Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV. But his other human henchmen Minion played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub has other plans. Back home the feuding siblings must learn to work together in order to save their parents and the world as they are tossed into the spy game as well.It seems as if the best kids movies always have a familylike theme to them and Spy Kids is no exception. Much of this movie is exciting but then there are those other parts which are to cuteness what Charlie's Angels was to sexy clad women. Some may accuse Rodriguez of turning corny on us all of a sudden but luckily he is also working with some very funny material here as well as with newcomer Daryl Sabara.His partner Alexa Vega also comes off very strong in her role as his sister. Together they are a very good crime fighting team and I look forward to seeing them in upcoming sequels. Alan Cumming is also very good turning in an absent minded Willy Wonka style performance that also fits in very well with Rodriguez's style for this movie which seems to be based largely around an amusement park surrounding a James Bond movie.His film may be corny for older kids but this is for the young ones and chances are you will never find a movie as decent and fun for them as this one is for a long time. Out of four stars Spy Kids definitely scores a three.".

I myself worked on a defense AI program that included the notion of a third brain' that is an observer living in a world different than 1 that of the world's creator and 2 of the characters.The third is the brain of the observer. This is also a strong element in film criticism where the camera is the third eye the eye of the artificial narrator. The most intelligent film about the third eye spying on the action is Snake Eyes' where we last saw Gugino. You may want to check my comments on that film to see what I mean.Even more this is the third time Cumming has played the evil thug Gates the others being Titus' and Get Carter.' The blooper of course is that Gates wouldn't know AI if it bit him despite buying up some of the big names from the past. So having him trapped in the virtual room is apt.The point is that there was some intelligence in this script not all artificial.".

Saw the stills thought they looked awful just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents all in a fighting stance implies incredible irresponsibility.  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is and eventually I got suckered in thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.Well kiddies might have a good time though in the theater I attended restless kids had to be told repeatedly to hush and one child articulated in the aftermath I was hoping for more action.  But this is one where the adults will definitely need to shut their brains off.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to check this out I'd strongly suggest not going.  It's not awful like CURLY SUE or something  I laughed aloud once and got a couple of chuckles elsewhere  but it is... well it's poor.  The adventure isn't manic enough the inventions by and large not that incredible a packet when microwaved becomes a McDonald's meal.  Yipee!. SPOILERS AHEAD Yeah the thumb thumbs are kinda cool but the villain is far too toothless.  Kids' movies CAN survive real villainry and in a way need it Wicked Witch of the West anyone?  And then when the villain goes soft and is revealed as NOT the villain Villain 2 is even less frightening.SPOILERS OVER.  I guess one of the main problems is that the sense of threat is never tangible. The film has obviously been designed not to frighten children giving no sense of real evil or malice onscreen almost all critical physical contact happens either off camera or with simple karate flips.  In cushioning every blow in this manner SPY KIDS leaves no sense of tension danger or conflict.  That's probably why the kids got so shifty during the screening and parents got testy the kids saw that this emperor had no clothes  or more to the point a candy colored but rather dull onepiece.  510".

	schema:reviewBody "Spy Kids is a film written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. I remember sitting in the hall some 12 years ago watching the 3rd part of this franchise. That happened to be my first 3D film. So since I had no clue as to what I was watching that time I didn't like the film that much. So I fortunately came across the first part which was being aired on TV a few days ago. And I can safely say that I didn't like it.Plot Carmen and Juni decide to take matters on their own hands when their parents who happen to be ex spies get kidnapped.Story and direction This film had quite a good story in its place. I can atleast give it credit for that. And its starts quite well. I was kind of engrossed in it. I felt like the flashback scene was to be the only over the top thing in this entire film. But then it happens to go on. I can understand when a film is being made for kids and we have to add some illogical sequences. BUt this film has a lot of them. And the VFX. Oh My God. How much green screen and so fake. Films before Spy kids had much better VFX. I know that the budget was very less. I always think when you can't do great VFX just put that thing away. And the fight scenes are so wirey. Almost every fight scene looked fake. This film kind of irritated me. Also we have a more over the top villain who stays in some CGIed castle. I would say that Danny Elfman was mostly the saving grace for this film because the score was quite enagaging.Performances Antonio Banderas was good. But he has done better than this. Carla Gugino was OK. The kids were great in their roles as most of the concentration was them and they did justice to what was given to them. Alan Cumming and Tony Shalhoub were so over the top that they became irritating over a point of time. Same goes to Teri Hatcher. Danny Trejo was a good addition to the film.I can't actually mention any scene that would be my favorite.Verdict This film is for Kids only. If you are mature enough you can quite avoid this venture. I am going with a 5.510".

Rodriguez makes two types of films shamelessly violent over the top bloody genre fun and family orientated sci fifantasy for kids. He fares better in the former as this is really the only good one in the secondary category. The sequels are trash and I don't know what he was thinking with Sharkboy and Lava Girl but with this one his filmmaking skill and passion for the craft work its charm and provide a wonderful experience. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play youngsters Carmen and Juni Cortez who are surprised to learn that their unassuming parents Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are in fact lethal undercover spies and need their help after being kidnapped by eccentric megalomaniac Floop Alan Cumming hamming it up terrifically.

The four have amazing chemistry as a familial unit especially when it comes time to kick major butt. The practical based effects have a wondrous vitality from the Thumb Thumb henchman to the eye boggling Terry Gilliamesque realm that Floop resides in. There's also work from Tony Shaloub Mike Judge Richard Linklater and a sly cameo from George Clooney. No shortage of imagination creativity and fun.".

It is about little people doing big things. The special effects are totally creative with a story that is straight forward but a lot of fun. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are captured spies by an entertainer who mutates spies as props for his show. Gugino tells of the two spies who were suppose to eliminate each other but ultimately fell in love instead. Their children catch on quickly when villains that resemble thumbs search for a device called the Third Brain. Alan Cumming plays a villain who desires to take over the world using robotic children and the third brain is needed. Director Robert Rodriguez outdoes himself here with inventive visuals and creative gimmicks. This is a far stretch from the gory horror films he is known for such as From Dusk Till Dawn and The Faculty. Banderas and Gugino are a wonderful pairing with Alan Cumming on target as the entertainer. Tony Shalhoub plays the scheming villain. Richard Cheech Marin is an amusing edition as an uncle who is in on the big parental secret. The third act is mainly numerous action sequences that present cartoon style violence and predictable results. Otherwise this is a challenging family friendly visual delight. Score 9  10".

	schema:reviewBody "Childhood nostalgia that is simply the 2 words why I saw this movie again. I watched the first three movies quite a bit as a kid and I can even tell you why. Around the time I was into James Bond so when I saw this movie I saw it as the same except with kids I was 7!. So watching this movie again did bring back some childhood memories but that's about all it did.The movie is about the 2 world's best spies who are married. They retire once their children are born. 9 years later the 2 kids  Carmen and Juni are keeping secrets from their parents  Carmen skips school and all of Juni's friends are as real as the CGI in this movie. Their parents find a mission to track missing agents and through that we find out a kids show host named Floop Alan Cumming has the technology to change people's appearances into crazyashell looking characters for his show as well as build robot kids  the robot kids being for some guy's army. After they get captured it is up to Carmen and Juni to save their parents.Well to this movie's credit it has a lot of imagination to it. Which is a pretty good thing for the most part. I say for the most part because the CGI of some of them looks really dated. Not to say I still didn't appreciate the thought and effort but... yeah some of it just looks a little bit creepy to show younger children at least.The only other thing I can really say about it is Alan Cumming's performance as Floop. He just nails whimsical headintheclouds crazy inventor Children's TV Show Host perfectly. If I were to talk about the acting some more Alexa Vega does an okay job but Daryl Sabara is AWFUL! I mean I know I shouldn't be too harsh on him because he's just a kid but here I don't think he's even trying.If there was one thing I hated and I mean LOATHED it would have to be the humour. It was terrible I mean it might make some kids laugh but most of it is the bottom of the barrel toilet humour that dominates awful kids films.Here's another thing we have too many morals. Or at least the screenwriter has no idea how to balance them out. On one hand we have importance of family and that message is delivered okay but when Floop tells Juni that all it was about was purity of heart and mind it almost comes out of nowhere. There maybe other morals that they tried to get across but I really just couldn't see them.So does Spy Kids hold up in my eyes? No and why should it? All it has to offer in terms of quality really is one supporting performance and the imagination behind it. With that said this could entertain your 710 year old for an hour and a half and it is relatively harmless. If you're babysitting a kid sometime  check it out or if you want to see how childhood nostalgia holds up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns plus it was using the stupid idea of smellovision. And this family film does not disappoint.Marissa Wilson Jessica Alba is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain Tik Tok and starts a family with her husband Wilbur Joel McHale and stepchildren Rebecca Rowan Blanchard and Cecil Mason Cook. A year later a new villain has emerged the Time Keeper who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director Danger D'Amo Jeremy Piven to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device.There are many problems with Spy Kids All the Time in the World. It's a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before the dad is a workaholic there is animosity between stepmum and stepdaughter as the stepmum tries to get closer to the children the revelation of a lie and so many others. The humour is crude mostly poo fart and vomit gags basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns time puns dog puns and smell puns  we're not stupid! The action is rudimentary it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can't guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven't seen enough movies. Spy Kids All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story.A movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations Spy Kids All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart they ask questions see plot holes and come up with ideas involving scifi concepts. The best family and children's movies are clever wellplotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working.Most of the acting is subpar. The child leads are bland and not natural actors it's your typical weakchild acting and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi SmitMcPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun but I'm sure that's because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same having fun and just being over the top.As movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez who's done great movies like Sin City From Dusk to Dawn and the Mexico Trilogy. Let's hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2.And I am sure you are asking the big question  what was the ScratchandSniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick. But you already knew that.".

I was wrong as awful as that film was Spy Kids 4 takes the cake as Rodriguez's worst film.The film for starters looks cheap. The camera work at best is odd and the effects lack clarity. The gadgets looked cool from the outset but once the nappy bombs for instance are introduced they lose their appeal very quickly.I didn't think much of the soundtrack either. I found it rather generic here rather than jaunty and memorable. And Rodriguez's direction is his most unfocused and inept directing job in my opinion of his career.The script is awful relying far too much on tired slapstick and heavyhanded messaging while the story is rushed and much too thin for the film's running time and the action is dull and not helped by the haphazard editing.Actingwise this film is disappointing. It was nice to be Daryl Sabarra and Alexa Vega here but other than the basic concept of the movie them and Rodriguez there seemed to be no connection to its predecessors. The new kids do what they can but they aren't as confident or as appealing.Jeremy Piven does give his all into a very underwritten and uninteresting villain part and his two other roles as well but at points it feels like he's overdoing it. Danny Trejo is wasted Antonio Banderas was cut which is yet another reason why this doesn't feel like a Spy Kids movie Jessica Alba does nothing with her role other than look pretty while even Ricky Gervais is flat.The cast are not helped by how their characters are written. The characters here are so cardboard it is difficult to engage with them on any level.Overall despite the trailer I was all for seeing this film. But it was awfulas part of a franchise and on its own terms and a big disappointment. 110 Bethany Cox".

For that viewers are given a numbered card called AromaScope so that they can scratchandsmell when the number appears on the screen. This is a childish gimmick aimed at kids. For adults it is more of a nuisance because the scents are faint and the exercise distracts us from the action on the screen. Although there are many fart and poop scenes the AromaScope only provides scents of chewing gum and other edible stuff thank goodness for that. History has demonstrated that all smellovision gimmicks mostly stink.Marissa Cortez Wilson Jessica Alba is such a dedicated spy that even when she is nine months pregnant she manages to take down notorious villain Tick Tock Jeremy Piven before going into labor and retiring from her spy duties. Her aim is to devote all her time to her newborn and her stepkids Rebecca Rowan Blanchard and Cecil Mason Cook and hubby Wilbur Joey McHale.Soon however she may not have that much time. One year later Tick Tock and accomplice The Timekeeper also Piven are back at their attempt to rob the world of 'time'  and Rebecca Cecil and their 'guard dog' Argonaut voice of Ricky Gervais must save the world what else?. Also they team up with Marissa's niece and nephew Carmen and Juni Cortez Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their former Spy Kids roles to make this mission a family reunion of sorts.Writerdirector Robert Rodriguez seems to be milking the same old cinemascript cow urging parents to spend more time with their kids. This 'message' has been used by almost all family movies throughout the decade. The timetheft and timetravel conceits can be puzzling to children even if they allow Rodriguez to make use of all sorts of timerelated gags. Of course Rodriguez cannot resist the poop and fart gags as well as throwing food all over the place. These I understand are the laughoutloud staple for American kids below five.Among the cast Blanchard and Cook are suitably cute and effective as the new title characters. Bringing back former Spy Kids Vega and Sabara is a good idea adding a nostalgic touch for parents in the audience. Ditto that for Danny Trejo's short cameo as Uncle Machete. However the irony of Daddy Wilbur being a 'Spycatcher' on TV is lost on the kids and scores no points with the adults.As for Jessica Alba as Marissa the younger sister to Antonio Bandera's character she provides the main boxoffice lure nothing more.

The boys actually were fairly entertained but I must say they are not exactly seasoned veterans of the movie watching experience.We saw it in 2D but also had the '4th D' experience. This amounted to a card they gave you that you scratch and sniff at certain points during the movie. It is a horrible gimmick that does not even work. I scratched as hard as I could and could only smell a faint flowery smell. That is only one minor flaw of the movie.The other flaws are as follow. The acting is horrendous. How they continue to let Jessica Alba act and even STAR in a movie is a decision that some Hollywood exec will eventually pay for with their job. Her lack of acting abilities were only surpassed by the rest of the cast. But it was not entirely their fault as the film's basic plot and script was about as thin as Kate Moss on a hunger strike.So what do you combine with horrible acting a thin plot and countless moronic lines written by the worst screen writers they could dig up? Mindless violence that is not suitable for small children. This movie is supposed to be about spy kids I presumed based on the title. Most of the scenes and actions were played out by adults and the plethora of punching and kicking scenes was immature and detrimental to young easily influenced minds.This movie is disturbing for young children and is completely inappropriate for children of all ages. It also is so horribly acted and the screenplay so illconceived that adults are left wondering how in the world Hollywood can continue to put out such dribble and expect us to shell out our hard earned dollars on such mindless 'entertainment.'To sum it all up avoid this movie at all costs. Even if your children have seen the other versions and beg you to see it be strong and suggest alternatives. Show Hollywood that you will not be swayed by their slick advertising and inept filmmaking.".

Yeah it was cool to see another Spy Kids movie on the way and as the cast was locked into place seeing Alexa Vega and Darryl Sabarra coming back was a total blast. Then it started to get a bit worrying with news of the gimmick of smellovision being used to try and sell this one.The end result? A big mess. On the plus side the effects and the 3D in this are better than they have been in previous outings. There is some fun to be had seeing Juny and Carmen come back as grown up Spy Kids and there are some nice little links to the original trilogy. The new Spy Kids are kinda fun but not as cool or engaging as the original two and Jessica Alba is pretty game to put up with some of the crap she's put through here. And some giggles can be had from Ricky Gervais' spy dog and Jeremy Piven's multiple appearances.That said the smellovision thing is just plain distracting granted it's not overdone and is largely confined to the starting 20 minutes with the large numbers flashing on screen and beeping to make sure you actually do scratch and sniff. The comedy is far too heavy handed and relies more on poop and fart jokes than in previous outings and is aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator  talk about dumbing down! And the message is hammered home with all the finesse and subtlety of sledgehammer to the crotch. There are numerous times where the whole spend time with your kidsparents is said direct to camera and after about the third or fourth time it gets preachy.It's a shame that Robert Rodriguez felt the need to restart the series with such a lame and heavy handed mess given just how much fun the first three had to offer. And on a personal note I was gutted to see that Uncle Machete was relegated to a blink and you miss him cameo after being built up so well. Aah well I'm guessing there are plans for another couple movies so there's a chance that it can redeem itself but I think that after this it's gonna have to work hard!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm aware that many people like to encounter films as a small unchallenging adventure. That isn't possible with me but I have something similar sometimes a simple film is a relaxed encounter with the filmmaker a sort of illustrated visit in his home.I like Rodriguez. I like his joy in image and his independent enthusiasm. I do not ever expect him to produce something that changes my life like fellow Austinite Malick can. But sometimes you just want to hang out. One thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly in his own studio with greenscreen networked to special effects subcontractors.

That isn't possible with me but I have something similar sometimes a simple film is a relaxed encounter with the filmmaker a sort of illustrated visit in his home.I like Rodriguez. I like his joy in image and his independent enthusiasm. I do not ever expect him to produce something that changes my life like fellow Austinite Malick can. But sometimes you just want to hang out. One thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly in his own studio with greenscreen networked to special effects subcontractors.

Sure I could do without quite as many fart gags but I never liked those when I was a kid either. Featuring Jessica Alba as Marissa Cortez Wilson and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara returning once again as a grown up Carmen and Juni Cortez  the original Spy Kids  this movie has some great action sequences and special effects and it all adds up to a great experience for kids of all ages  even kids who are all grown up.I loved all three previous Spy Kids films and even primed myself by watching them again this past week. I took my 15 year old daughter to see this one for her birthday today and she absolutely loved it as did I. She hasn't seen all three of the other ones so she didn't recognise any of the cool gadgets at the OSS' Spy Kids Division but that didn't keep her from having a really good time. I hadn't watched a movie in 3D in probably 30 years  back when you had to wear those goofy green and red cardboard glasses and if you didn't wear the glasses you couldn't make any sense of the picture  so watching this in the relatively new RealD 3D format was a real treat.Score One point off for the modernized version of the failed SmelloVision. My daughter and I both decided to abandon the Aroma Scope cards after the first three scents really didn't smell like much of anything. But a bonus point at the same time because unlike SmelloVision which blasted the smells right in your face now you have the option of not using the scratchandsniff cards if you don't want to. So one point down and one point up. But one point off for having just too many jokes and gags based on bodily functions. The movie would have been just fine without them. I give it an 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why this movie is getting panned so badly. No it's not Oscarquality but most movies aren't. When I go to the movies my goal is usually just to have a good time and Spy Kids All the Time in the World fit the bill for me with the added bonus of a message that so often goes ignored. For the record the movie is billed as 4D but I saw it in 2D and without the Aromascope card. For anyone who hasn't heard much about this movie here's a brief synopsis. OSS I'm sorry I've forgotten what it stands for agent Marissa Cortez Wilson makes a deal with OSS chief Danger D'Amo she can retire to raise a family after one last mission capturing the villainous Tick Tock who has stolen vital OSS information. A year later she's raising her baby daughter and trying to bond with her twin stepkids Rebecca and Cecil but Rebecca still resents her for trying to take the place of the twins' late mom. Meanwhile Marissa's husband Wilbur is launching a new reality show that follows him as he tries to catch spies. Unbeknownst to Wilbur his wife is a spy and has been called out of retirement to stop Tick Tock and his boss the Timekeeper from stopping time. As Marissa is dragged back into service her niece Carmen recruits Rebecca and Cecil in an effort to revive the OSS's nowdefunct Spy Kids Division.The performances range from solid to fantastic. Newcomers Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook play off each other well as the squabbling twin siblings. I hope they'll continue to do well in the future. As the kids are recruited they learn that their dog Argonaut is actually an OSSissue robot dog being used to supervise them. Ricky Gervais provides Argonaut's wisecracking voice and you can tell he's having fun doing it. Joel McHale's specialty is playing the man who doesn't have all the answers but is positive he does. Wilbur Wilson is one such overly cocky character and McHale throws himself into the role with his typical wacky aplomb. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return as original Spy Kids Carmen and Juni Cortez. Their roles are relatively small now but Vega and Sabara retain the chemistry that makes them so believable as siblings. Jessica Alba proves she's more than just a pretty face showing pathos and surprising comic timing as Marissa tries to save the world and patch up her relationship with Rebecca.Jeremy Piven gets his own paragraph because he probably has the hardest job in the movie playing the triple roles of the Timekeeper Tick Tock and Danger D'Amo. While the Timekeeper is something of a stereotypical supervillain Piven's other roles come with unique challenges. He completely transforms his face and voice as the grotesque henchman Tick Tock in fact I wouldn't have known it was him if I hadn't seen him on Leno and Kimmel but his third role is the toughest. The Timekeeper turns out to be none other than Danger who is desperately trying to reconnect with his late father after a timetravel experiment in his childhood separated them. His sorrow and regret seemed to run deeper than the D'Amos and their timetravel experiment to Piven and his own late father a suspicion that was later confirmed in an online interview. Watching him long for what can never be was heartwrenching and made me wish I could step into the movie and try to comfort himboth Danger and Piven. Playing what is billed as a triple role but comes closer to 24 roles once henchmen duplicates time travel and the elder D'Amo are factored in is fraught with physical and emotional challenges all of which Piven handles superbly. He gives his multiple roles his all and as a result he may have delivered one of the best underrated performances of the year.I would like to conclude by mentioning that Spy Kids All the Time in the World in 4D is already getting Razzie buzzand that said Razzie buzz is largely undeserved. Go to this movie expecting nothing but a good time with a good messageyou might be surprised at what you find. I was and I can't wait for the Bluray so I can relive my amazing discoveries in the comfort of my own home.".

I think even tiny toddles will cry when they see this piece of garbage!!! Please I beg you. Let the Spy Kids grow up to be real men and stop with the series!Now I know why this film was chugged on DVD as fast as it could to rake up even more money from gullible customers... well one things for sure.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved Robert Rodriguez for making Grindhouse films and very violent films and then making films that appeal to adults and children. Now if you go to this film thinking you're going to see the best film of the year then don't go to see this film. If you go to this film knowing you're going to see a fun film then go and see it. This isn't as good as the other three films but Robert Rodriguez has still made a good enough film. It's one that does appeal a lot to children but it's still got the jokes in there for the adults. The whole AromaScope thing is good but some of the things all smelt the same and you have to scratch quite a bit to get the actual smell. The 3D in this was good the scenes when there are action were good. Ricky Gervais as the dog is brilliant and he gets most of the laughs in the film just from some of the lines he says. There's a lot of poop and fart jokes in there but I guess they are to make the kids laugh. Not the best Spy Kids film yet not as good as the first three but still one that I did enjoy! And there's a hint of Spy Kids 5 but we will just have to wait and see what happens.".

The first two films are definitely better but this is way better than the horrid third film. I guess I liked this film because it brought back so many memories from my childhood. That was true when Carmen and Juni appeared on screen. I know the acting was cheesy and there were plenty of potty humor but I couldn't bring myself to hate this film.Robert Rodriguez's film is about an evil guy who is bent on making time go faster so a retired spy and her kids are recruited to turn time back to normal.As I mentioned earlier the acting is kind of cheesy. Jessica Alba is pretty good and is quite nice on the eyes. The kids are decent even though they say some weird stuff. Ricky Gervais makes an awesome dog with his voice.Overall this is a decent film but I can see why many people despised it. Despite my thumbs up I think it's time for this franchise to hit the bucket as I can see some wear and tear. This film wasn't even asked for in the first place but it's a nice distraction for the kids. It doesn't have the great visuals as the earlier films but it wont matter to the kids. I rate this film 710.".

Okay I know this is just a movie but..... what kind of organization lets A 9 MONTH PREGNANT WOMAN GO ON A MISSION? She's doing all these crazy stunts and doesn't even have a miscarriage. For a family film this is just offensive.What other sins does this movie have. Well we have the typical girl doesn't get along with her step mother clich wooden acting from Jessica Alba Joel playing the same a he always does bad CGI the villain sounding like a chipmunk and making bad time jokes gross out humour we have a scene where a boy throws 4 bags of vomit on an enemy ship and we see it splatter in it's disgusting yellow glory complete with the boy saying Never underestimate the power of puke. and the baby farts in EVERY single scene she's in and we have Ricky Gervais doing the voice of a robot dog.Also how stupid is Alba's character in this film? She takes her baby along for her mission even though the bad guys are most likely to kill them if they're spotted. How did this woman get to be an agent anyway if she is so thick? The villain shows his past on a video. This takes place in the 30's. How was this possible. How did they get an HD camera? How did he do close ups and editing? Who was filming all of this? This shows you how lazy Rodriguez is.I doubt that there would be a Spy Kids 5.".

The spy kids movies are a refreshing change and I'm glad to see it continuing. The first three were ground breaking and very special. I was so glad to see that this one lives up to that. Although not as good as the first two which were superb I rate it about the same as the third one. It may be hard for some to embrace the new cast which happens every time a new James Bond is cast. I think everyone is just as likable as the originals. Reviews that cut down the acting plot or whatever don't understand what Rodriguez has done. This movie as with the other three is for children and people who love children. If you don't consider yourself in one of those categories then you won't get it.".

I feel living in the 'now' is more important than ever before. 4 Special effects while nothing to win any awards were both functional and frequently interesting. 5 Having the original spy kids back as adults was a REAL treat and  for me the real highlight of the film. I kept thinking  why didn't they have Carmen as the mother and Juno as her brother that had to help fight the bad guys? They would have been SO much better!6 It was truly a FAMILY film! Not that many films I feel comfortable taking my child to so that in itself was great.The okay to bad1 The aroma card was really well strange. It COULD have added something. But the 's flashed on the screen so fast and it was so hard to see the  and scratch it off that by the time I was finished on one  it was already time to do another! I couldn't smell ANY difference between the smells though my daughter definitely could! But it really didn't add anything.2 The dog. 90 of the jokes from this creature were just unfunny. I think one  maybe  two jokes made me smirk.. That as about it.3 The kids were okay but definitely didn't have the appeal of the original spy kids.4 The highvoice time keeper REALLY got to me it was so annoying!5 Jessica Alba was just soso. Would have preferred to see the original Carmen in this role.6 The 3D was 'eh.' There were a LOT of times it COULD have been used to great 'in your face' effect but never was. While it did add 'some' depth to the film I felt the movie would have been just as fine in 2D.6 The husband and Jeremy Pliven were also  okay. Nothing special.The ugly1 Okay I REALLY loved the message of the film. But did it have to be HAMMERED into our heads EVERY scene? I lost track of how many times I heard spend more time with you kids you can't get back time make every minute count etc. Subtlety this wasn't. I kept thinking that somehow this was an apology from the director to his kids for not being with them for some extended time. Have no insight into this but it seemed that he felt he had to prove this point as hard as possible.2 The barf and poop jokes needed to go. Really.3 The time travel motif was WAY too confusing for kids  and even me! Unless you feel comfortable explaining the movie Primer to your child be prepared for some MAJOR confusion. Time travel is difficult enough they didn't have to make it even more complicated!All in all we enjoyed this film and there were some really fun scenes.I actually liked this a little better than 2 never saw 3.Normally I would say 'good film but wait for the DVD but I do think seeing it on the big screen helps  even in 2D.710".

Time travel is difficult enough they didn't have to make it even more complicated!All in all we enjoyed this film and there were some really fun scenes.I actually liked this a little better than 2 never saw 3.Normally I would say 'good film but wait for the DVD but I do think seeing it on the big screen helps  even in 2D.710";

	schema:headline " A very good early horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism the highly atmospheric style of filmmaking developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari. 1920 and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie Des Grauens 1922 were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn't have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener director of 1920's Der Golem Wie Er in die Welt Kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally another horror film Der Student Von Prag.Der Student Von Prag The Student of Prague is the story of Balduin Paul Wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague but who always find himself with financial troubles. One day Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit Grete Berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin Graf Von Schwarzenberg Lothar Krner who also wants to marry her. Knowing that he can't offer her much Balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli John Gottowt enters the scene. Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. Balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror.Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story William Wilson and the classic legend of Faust the story of Der Student Von Prag was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form Der Student Von Prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the scriptwriters of his time Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although Der Student Von Prag begins to move away from that style. While a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin.While Der Student Von Prag was Paul Wegener's directorial debut and Stellan Rye's second film as a filmmaker it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. Giving great use to Guido Seeber's cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his Golem series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limited resources Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection played by Wegener too. Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.As Balduin Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit and Lothar Krner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron WaldisSchwarzenberg showing the dignity that Lrner's character should have had.Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made 13 years after this film is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why Der Student Von Prag hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete. However Der Student Von Prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history.As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that Der Student Von Prag has in the history of German cinema probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career and with that German expressionism Der Student Von Prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 710".

Despite having very limited resources Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection played by Wegener too. Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.As Balduin Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit and Lothar Krner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron WaldisSchwarzenberg showing the dignity that Lrner's character should have had.Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made 13 years after this film is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why Der Student Von Prag hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete. However Der Student Von Prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history.As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that Der Student Von Prag has in the history of German cinema probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career and with that German expressionism Der Student Von Prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 710";

I think it's possible they also missed some of the intertitles one of the other users mentions something Balduin says after his reflection is taken that wasn't in the copy I viewed.A renowned fencer asks a man named Scapinelli to procure him a winning lottery ticket or a woman with a large dowry. The opening credits indicate Scapinelli is a sorcerer he isn't used much in this film and we don't know really anything about him when we first meet him or what relationship Balduin has with him. In the remake Balduin doesn't ask for those things just wishes for a rich woman not expecting the wish to come true and Scapinelli promises to deliver.A rich woman who is riding horses with her fianc also her first cousin falls off her horse into a body of water and Balduin saves her. In the remake it's clear that Scapinelli guides her horse to Balduin and then causes the horse to act wildly until Balduin scoops her off it. Here it's unclear that Scapinelli had anything to do with it.There are many scenes here that are reproduced in the sequel. Possibly even some of the same camera shots are copied.The ending is not as powerful as the ending of the sequel. Still this was interesting to watch and at the price of Alpha's DVDs a bargain.

It's a piece of a movement of many movements that tried to lend cultural respectability to cinema or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. Fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe it centers on a doppelgnger theme.Unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for his day but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt printed in Early Cinema Space Frame Narrative however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme characters being split by leftright nearfar and frontaldiagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for 1913 but there were more advanced pictures in this respect around the same time including the better parts of Atlantis August Blom 1913 Twilight of a Woman's Soul Yevgeni Bauer 1913 and the short films of D.W. Griffith.An expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a superior remake. Furthermore the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka characterother than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around seemingly with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me but I assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed?Nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener who seems to have been the primary mind behind it in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and codirect The Golem in 1920helping to further inaugurate a dark supernatural thread in German silent cinema.Note The first version I viewed was about an hour long surely not quite complete and was in poor condition with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD which at 41 minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted though.".

This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently tearing his life apart.

Also they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it.

This is the real meat of the story but unfortunately seems more like a subplot to the romance that too often takes centre stage between Balduin and a rich countess named Margit. What results is a sporadically engrossing horror movie mixed with a very slowmoving and tepid romance which goes nowhere. By the time we get to the film's inevitable conclusion we realize it could have been told in half the time and with greater results had it not devoted much of its time to going nowhere with a love story that neither develops nor endears. Sure Paul Wegener's loose adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson is an important one in terms of independent expressionist cinema but is it worth watching now? Not really. You're better going straight to Caligari rather than stopping by to read the history of each bus stop on the way.

It also ends with the gravestone.This one starts with a scene in the courtyard of the college. A lot of extras were used in this scene.Another thing this one has over the later version is it's better at explaining what's going on. In one scene Paul Wegener's double goes to kill the girl's Wegener likes' fiance and you have a nice title card explaining that. The later version does not.It's also interesting to see Wegener in his preGolem days. I wouldn't call him handsome but he doesn't look anywhere near as fierce.Still another thing this version has over the latter one is the appearance of Scapanelli. Poor doomed John Gottowot looks much more like an evil presence than the one in the latter version.Wegener's death scene is nowhere near as spectacular as Veidt's in the latter version. In fact in watching this I thought he had stabbed himself but I wasn't sure until Wegener fell to the ground.Gottowot is in the final scene and he pulls it off really really well. I'll let you see what I'm talking about.Overall I liked it quite a bit better than the Veidt version.".

It is based on a work by Edgar Allen Poe and like so many other films includes many references on Goethe's Faust when a young man makes a deal with somebody he should have stayed far far away. And of course the deal is about a woman.The movie runs for slightly over 80 minutes at least in the version I saw but I see that there are several way shorter versions out there too. Your choice which one to watch. I personally would recommend one of the shorter as I felt this film did not only drag on several occasions despite under 90 minutes runtime but it also clearly lacked intertitles and would have needed many many more of these to be a rewarding watch but also to actually let the audience understand what is going on.

While Anjaam is not a remake the theme of revenge is handled similarly in the second half... systematic extermination of villains and there are many of them but with one very remarkable difference the shocking level of violence.Anjaam is unforgettable for me if only for the fact that the female character played excellently by Madhuri Dixit usually docile beautiful present only for the entertainment of men in her other movies evolves into an almost superhuman avatar of revenge. And when she finds that she has been robbed of her chance to face her greatest enemy as an equal she cries but does not weaken in her resolve.Shahrukh's character Vijay while less attractive than his obsessed would be lover role in Darr is far more realistic in this film. His resolve to destroy what he cannot have rings true to life. How many times do we see this kind of choice being made in real life? His violent attack on Shivani makes him a true villain. The ending is a bittersweet tragedy. I recommend it.".

The story develops at quite a fast pace with one story twist preceding another killing every possible trace of romance much to the complete shock of an unprepared awestruck audience. This is one of the several formuladefying films a young newcomer named Shahrukh Khan appeared in earlier on in his career risking future career prospects as a leading actor in a film industry which very often resorts to typecasting and marking slots of villains and comedians.But it wasn't the case this time around and it only contributed to the image of this young highly courageous and talented actor whose efforts in films like Baazigar Darr and this time Anjaam were applauded all over and only enhanced his stature as a credible staractor. And one can see why. Khan is tremendous in this role. His Vijay is the nice romantic fool on the surface but underneath lies the soul of a true monster. And the trick is that this time it's not a caricature it's a real psycho  an eccentric capricious brat whose passion and ego drive him to pull out all the stops to have things done his way. The weird mannerisms the body language the delivery and the overall creation of this character are done brilliantly by Khan. No matter how real or unreal it could be it is immensely entertaining and impressive.The cynosure the love interest the victim the avenger and ultimately the leading lady of the film is Madhuri Dixit a beautiful principled young woman whose honesty is but the thing that drives the obsessive antagonist nuts. Roles of avenging angels had by then already become almost a standard in Hindi films with Rekha setting the bar with her unforgettable daredevil act in Khoon Bhari Maang. The character of Shivani is different in story and execution and it is not as heroic. That said Dixit is excellent in a performance that easily ranks amongst the best of her career. The transformation from a charming young lass to a woman hardened by what she had to endure is utterly convincing. One wishes she had accepted more roles like this one in better films.Which brings me to the next point and it is the film itself. Sadly Anjaam doesn't completely live up to the quality set by the acting. While the film is greatly entertaining the execution is often faulty. The prison portions though gripping at times are for the most part embarrassingly exaggerated. There is a familiar portrayal of the corrupt law and juridical system against which no man could ever resist if no money was found at their disposal. Anjaam is directed by Rahul Rawail a famous director. It is his most eclectic work and is an unusual Hindi film for its time. For the story it tried to tell it did very well. A strong story development a stronger second half which is a good thing and an ending which is totally overblown and unbelievable. But it's a good watch in spite of the flaws and the two central performance make up for many of them anyway.".

First he was the psychoticbutlovable stalker in Darr and then the vengefulbutlovable wifekiller in Baazigar and then the anythingbutlovable murderer in Anjaam.This time around his character has no redeeming qualities at all other than being kind of cute in the first 20 minutes or so of the film before it devolves into a sick marathon of seeing how many sadistic beatings the heroine can endure before she turns and exacts her equally sadistic revenge.I must say that it was somewhat satisfying to see Madhuri Dixit in yet another strong heroic role which she excells at but it took her two excruciating gratuitously violent hours to finally stand up for herself. And I'll admit with a little guilt that after all the torture that this film had put her and me through I was looking forward to seeing exactly how Shivani Dixit would get even with  Vikram Khan so I was disappointed that she didn't take better advantage of her opportunities at the end when Viki was helpless in a wheelchair after the car accident that had taken her child's life. If it had been me in her place I could have thought of dozens of creative ways to do him in. If fact by the time this film was over I was ready to exact a little revenge of my own...on the director.Anjaam is another example of Bollywood run amok with excessive violence and gore.

I didn't like it per se storywise just the fact that there are all these twists. I was kinda hoping for redemption and stuff... though I knew that it would have been implausible after everything that had happened.I rewatched the film and it strangely grew on me. It's now among my favorites because of its complexity. It's really interesting from the psychological point of view. Did Vijay love Shivani or was it pure whim? I think the latter... Was Vijay really nuts and psychotic or just spoiled rotten? Shivani insists that he's just an idiot but Shahrukh definitely played him as not quite normal. How is it that he manages to evoke sympathy even for such a diabolical character? Was Shivani at least partly to be blamed for what happened to her? I'd never think so the blame the victim attitude but the lyrics in the Chane Ke Khet Mein song are a bit strange. And then those words she says to her sister at the beginning of the film Don't blame the fate. Sometimes a person can lose their life because of one wrong step. don't remember the correct phrasing I basically think it was the combination of unfortunate circumstances and her nononsense stand up for oneself character.The film is full of foreshadowing subtext and I liked its stance on the position of women.So... SRK is brilliant Madhuri is brilliant songs are great there aren't many unnecessary scenes I actually love Johnny Lever here ... singing Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhein from Baazigar. It's a really interesting and powerful movie.".

WRONG!Anjaam is what in Western Cinema would be called first class slasher movie. It has it all an insane psychopath and lot's of bloody deaths with some divine justice in the end. It deals with how much a woman shivaniplayed by madhuri can take by men the worst being Vijay played by Sharukh before she exacts her revenge. Of course overlaid with the obvious references to Maa Durga Madhuri takes on that revengingpart awesomely well she even bites off a piece of her bad brotherinlaw's arms with her bare teeth before choking him on his own money. As far as slasher movies go this one is top notch  at least for the second part of the movie. But Anjaam is able to achieve something that most slasher movies of the West can never achieve. It's the political message. Because however horrid and incredible the stuff that is done to Shivani seems it is not all that exceptional. Of course for the film some parts were overblown. But everyday in beautiful India young girls ARE being sold as prostitutes wives ARE being beaten just because there husbands can et cetera et cetera. Anjaam asks us two questions 1 Why should women take such punishment? The answer is provided by a monologue Madhuri delivers because they are the only ones strong enough to be able to take it. 2 What are the consequences Anjaam when women refuse to take it anymore? The answer is Anjaam! Bloody gore and divine justice done by stark raving mad women empowered by Maa Durga. So don't go watching this movie expecting romance. Expect gore and death. And in that genre Anjaam reigns supreme.".

Except for the somewhat inconsistent Shivani the cast is a bunch of onenote caricatures. Events are opportunistic plotwise for example fires springing up according to the needs of the story rather than as a consequence of previous events or an antagonist being inexplicably alone and helpless so that the protagonist can wreak revenge and I can't for the life of me understand what the transvestites have to do with the story.I guess all the above can be explained away as serving the needs of symbolism that the movie is not to be taken literally etc but that is a lazy way out. A little more realism and consistency is a matter of better writing. This laughable production is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Though I'm tempted to give it 2 stars I'm giving it 3 because it overturns one of the conventions in Indian movies.Anyone wanting an introduction to Indian movies will swear off the whole genre if he begins with this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Well it's quite known past that in 1990's Shahrukh Khan was very well known for portraying any role he is served. He started off his career on an average note and then became popular by doing some terrific performances in movies like Darr Baazigar Dil Toh Pagal Hai etc. But there were films which could have downed SRK in a very terrible way. There is this Anjaam which falls in the later category. Well yes movies are carried out by Actors and their performances. But sometimes they ain't that responsible for the flop of a movie. Directors are equally responsible for the same. Even though knowing very well that movie Darr which was a landmark in the film history of Bollywood was made so beautifully and released just a year before why did Rahul Rawail chose to make another movie on revenge with similar premises? If this movie has hot some popularity that's only because of SRK and Madhuri Dixit in it. Anjaam has very similar concept and nearest to that of Darr if not just a remake of it. The only difference is there's some more and terrible brutality and there's some more role of leading actress which was missing in Darr. But that doesn't mean it is sufficient to make a hit movie. Many other things fall flat and underused so badly. For an instance SRK is just pathetic to see. I think SRK alone would have carried the whole movie but director didn't give him free hands to do the charm and that made his skills overused. Having seen lots of varieties of movies Anjaam had worst possible execution of screenplay. There can be lots of comparisons made with Anjaam to Darr. Like Darr was a psychological thriller where it could be enjoyed notoriety by SRK. Here in Anjaam the notoriety looks like he's forced to do and he's so unnatural. I think Rahul Rawail just misused SRK and that should be known by him. Again the second half which literally takes a different take which looks like movie is going to offer some good topics. But it lets down so badly. Women Empowerment is shown pathetically. The old Bollywood style super power enveloping by actress by the grace of some Goddess and taking revenge is just lame to see. So creating two faced movie from both the sides offering Actor and Actress rise and show caliber doesn't work. I just wished SRK and Madhuri Dixit shouldn't have accepted this film and should have concentrated in Dil Toh Pagal Hai.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a Bollywood movie the story of Rahul Rawail's 'Anjaam' is quite new but the film itself ends up being a messy product. The key to the mess is Rawail's miserable execution and the screenplay. Had the story only focused on Vijay and Shivani this would have made some difference. Rawail relies too much on the Bollywood antics which is painfully evident in the dialogues. Much of the plotpoints are also very far stretched. I mean a minister going all the way to prison to get himself a mistress! Come on! The Johnny Lever track would make you wish you were deaf. The background score is sometimes intrusive but there are certain sequences where it's minimal use is very effective. This is one of the very few things that director has succeeded in. Madhuri Dixit is quite passable as Shivani even though she does ham it up by a notch in the emotional sequences she's good in a few key sequences. Himani Shivpuri Kalpana Iyer and Sudha Chandran do quite well. Tinnu Anand isn't so bad himself. It is Shahrukh Khan who owns 'Anjaam'. Playing the obsessively insane lunatic isn't anything new for him but he gives his character Vijay an all new dimension that is different from his characters in 'Darr' 'Don' and 'Baazigar'. 'Anjaam' had potential and under the hands of a capable director and writer this could have been quite something.".

	schema:reviewBody "No Inbred is not a documentary about the Royal Family it's the first film in ten years by British director Alex Chandon Cradle Of Fear. Inbred was the penultimate film to be premiered at this year's Frightfest in London and it's a film that seems to have divided those who have seen it as brutally as its victims bodies are divided on the screen. On the one hand there are those who are already dismissing Chandon's ruralset gorefest as distasteful garbage on the other there are those who were instantly won over by its dark humour and its unrelenting intensity. I'm proud to say that I fall into the latter category.Inbred follows a simple premise. A small group of young offenders arrive in the sleepy Yorkshire village of Mortlake for a community service weekend. The group includes a bespectacled arsonist a cute shy girl a weedy gang member and an archetypal lad. They're led by two youth workers the feisty Kate Jo Hartley and the endearingly dorky Jeff James Doherty. On their first night in the countryside the visitors make the mistake of popping into the local boozer the imaginatively named The Dirty Hole a pub which makes The Slaughtered Lamb in An American Werewolf In London look positively normal in comparison. It's there that they're introduced to Jim Seamus O'Neill the pub landlord a man who's nearly as comical as he is sinister. The following day while the group are stripping abandoned trains they find themselves in a confrontation with Jim's son which quickly and dangerously escalates. Soon the locals have turned against them and from then on the group's quest for selfimprovement turns into a quest for selfpreservation as they desperately fight for their survival.Inbred begins with a trusty old film within a film opening one that features cult British horror chick Emily Booth in a cameo. It's not a particularly clever scene but it's one that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film droll humour coupled with extreme brutality courtesy of the film's consistently impressive gore effects. At the beginning of the film as the group of outsiders arrive in Mortlake and we get to know them the film is mostly lighthearted in tone but with a palpable uneasiness simmering underneath. The first genuinely creepy moment is the haunting sequence that was featured in the film's trailer  a gang of kids prodding a bloody human scarecrow with sticks.As the visitors begin to interact with the locals the film ups its humour milking plenty of laughs from the gormless backward villagers one highlight being the discovery of a unique pornography collection. But roughly half an hour into the film when the first drop of blood is spilt the rug of comfort that the humour provides is pulled out from under our feet and we're quickly plunged into a bizarre nightmare that rarely lets up until the final credits.It's clear to see that Inbred is heavily influenced by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and although it's not quite the sledgehammer to the senses that Tobe Hooper's masterpiece is it does manage to successfully channel that film's hopeless sense of dread allowing us to fully experience the desperation of the characters as they struggle to find a way out of their harrowing predicament.The characters themselves are brought to life by an impressive array of performances many of which are by newcomers to the big screen. Nadine Rose Mulkerrin is excellent as Sam the only girl in the group her babyfaced innocence a perfect contrast to the evil they encounter. All of the young actors are impressive but if I had to single out one more it would probably be Terry Haywood who plays Zeb mainly because when it's his turn to meet his maker his hysterical begging is uncomfortably realistic. As for the adults the always dependable Jo Hartley turns in what is perhaps the film's strongest performance as the tough as hell mother of the group Kate. And reallife Yorkshireman Seamus O' Neill who plays Jim the ringleader of the killers creates a villain who manages to amuse and terrify simultaneously.It's the tone of many of the performances that is undeniably one of the film's strongest points. Usually when a film is as outrageously violent as Inbred the performances of the actors playing the victims and their characters are jokey and tongue in cheek making us care less when they're gruesomely dispatched with. In this film however the victims are all played completely straight as straight as the performances in films like Eden Lake which makes the experience of watching the film much more disturbing.Most of the film's flaws come from the bad decisions that some of the characters make a common complaint levelled at even the best of Horror films. Why not use that as a weapon? Why not floor it while you've got the chance? These questions popped into my mind a few times while watching the film but not nearly enough to ruin my enjoyment of what was otherwise a gripping and powerful little shocker.Inbred is guilty of all the criticisms that have been thrown its way. It's meanspirited it's nasty it's offensive but I must've missed the meeting where it was decided that these were bad qualities for a Horror film to possess. I enjoy subtle slowburners as much as the next Horror fan but I also like to be brainraped occasionally and Inbred did that like a mad dog on heat. Pork scratchings will never taste the same.".

They're led by two youth workers the feisty Kate Jo Hartley and the endearingly dorky Jeff James Doherty. On their first night in the countryside the visitors make the mistake of popping into the local boozer the imaginatively named The Dirty Hole a pub which makes The Slaughtered Lamb in An American Werewolf In London look positively normal in comparison. It's there that they're introduced to Jim Seamus O'Neill the pub landlord a man who's nearly as comical as he is sinister. The following day while the group are stripping abandoned trains they find themselves in a confrontation with Jim's son which quickly and dangerously escalates. Soon the locals have turned against them and from then on the group's quest for selfimprovement turns into a quest for selfpreservation as they desperately fight for their survival.Inbred begins with a trusty old film within a film opening one that features cult British horror chick Emily Booth in a cameo. It's not a particularly clever scene but it's one that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film droll humour coupled with extreme brutality courtesy of the film's consistently impressive gore effects. At the beginning of the film as the group of outsiders arrive in Mortlake and we get to know them the film is mostly lighthearted in tone but with a palpable uneasiness simmering underneath. The first genuinely creepy moment is the haunting sequence that was featured in the film's trailer  a gang of kids prodding a bloody human scarecrow with sticks.As the visitors begin to interact with the locals the film ups its humour milking plenty of laughs from the gormless backward villagers one highlight being the discovery of a unique pornography collection. But roughly half an hour into the film when the first drop of blood is spilt the rug of comfort that the humour provides is pulled out from under our feet and we're quickly plunged into a bizarre nightmare that rarely lets up until the final credits.It's clear to see that Inbred is heavily influenced by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and although it's not quite the sledgehammer to the senses that Tobe Hooper's masterpiece is it does manage to successfully channel that film's hopeless sense of dread allowing us to fully experience the desperation of the characters as they struggle to find a way out of their harrowing predicament.The characters themselves are brought to life by an impressive array of performances many of which are by newcomers to the big screen. Nadine Rose Mulkerrin is excellent as Sam the only girl in the group her babyfaced innocence a perfect contrast to the evil they encounter. All of the young actors are impressive but if I had to single out one more it would probably be Terry Haywood who plays Zeb mainly because when it's his turn to meet his maker his hysterical begging is uncomfortably realistic. As for the adults the always dependable Jo Hartley turns in what is perhaps the film's strongest performance as the tough as hell mother of the group Kate. And reallife Yorkshireman Seamus O' Neill who plays Jim the ringleader of the killers creates a villain who manages to amuse and terrify simultaneously.It's the tone of many of the performances that is undeniably one of the film's strongest points. Usually when a film is as outrageously violent as Inbred the performances of the actors playing the victims and their characters are jokey and tongue in cheek making us care less when they're gruesomely dispatched with. In this film however the victims are all played completely straight as straight as the performances in films like Eden Lake which makes the experience of watching the film much more disturbing.Most of the film's flaws come from the bad decisions that some of the characters make a common complaint levelled at even the best of Horror films. Why not use that as a weapon? Why not floor it while you've got the chance? These questions popped into my mind a few times while watching the film but not nearly enough to ruin my enjoyment of what was otherwise a gripping and powerful little shocker.Inbred is guilty of all the criticisms that have been thrown its way. It's meanspirited it's nasty it's offensive but I must've missed the meeting where it was decided that these were bad qualities for a Horror film to possess. I enjoy subtle slowburners as much as the next Horror fan but I also like to be brainraped occasionally and Inbred did that like a mad dog on heat. Pork scratchings will never taste the same.";

Inbred goes all out using a combination of practical effects enhanced by CGI these guys have outdone pretty much anything I've seen outside of the most top budget gore films such as the Romero Zombie movies. It gave me a feeling I've not had in years where the special effects are fresh and startling and can actually be showcased. At times the rituals of the yokels get really twisted and weird and because the effects are gut wrenchingly disturbing I actually did start to feel a few twinges of dread at a couple of points at the thought of what I might be about to see especially when they suddenly brought phallic vegetables and a horse into the equation. Hard to believe too that despite all this I found myself laughing it has oh so black humour and bizarre over the top bumpkin caricatures. It's bonkers shocking nasty and hilarious.

It is shot through with a sense of humour so jet black and disturbingly bizarre that it comes close to transcending belief. The gushing blood splattering gore and exploding viscera is extremely well rendered with occasional bargain basement CGI that is minimally intrusive. Sometimes it's like a series of brief and punchy acid flashbacks to Tod Browning's infamous 1932 precensor horror antique FREAKS. This is not a bad thing.Not so good stuff Horror movies used to be morality plays. For the most part evil people and phenomena wreaked havoc and were then defeated by the forces of good. Sure innocent people died in the process but in the end the beast was vanquished or the armies of Satan defeated or whatever. In the best horror movies the sources of evil or bad were humanised and believable  Hitchcock's PSYCHO being a prime example. Norman Bates evokes conflicting emotions of sympathy and revulsion in the audience. Sometimes in horror movies the bad guys won but not very often.Things gradually changed with movies like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH. There were still surviving victims in some of those films but this gradually became less and less common. The agents of evil also changed so monstrous inhuman and inhumane that they no longer generated understanding or sympathy from the audience rather they became cardboard machines with minimal function  to butcher and terrorise. No more no less. At first this was different new. Then films where no one survived the carnage became the norm. And now what was once different is the same and by default crashingly predictable and all rather boring.In the seventies INBRED would be something new. In the here and now it's another alsoran among thousands. The victim characters are unsympathetic nonentities and no one cares if they live or die. Just as well because it's clear from the outset and the tone of the film that none of them are going to make it. When characters do very little that equates comprehensible logical and contextual responses throughout to avoid their fate that makes it a bit obvious where they're headed.The redneck freaks are just as onedimensional. Ugly evil vile inhuman yet largely characterless they invoke revulsion but no other connection. Their leader Jim is clearly the glue which holds them together. If you had a shotgun trained on him and one of his minions and you were given the option which one would you shoot? No prizes for guessing which in this type of film where normal human logic is an alien concept.Yes I know behaviour in horror movies is often arbitrarily illogical to advance the plot. The character who wanders off alone the people who go into the old dark house when they just know there's something evil in there. But there has to be at least some tenuous link with reasonable behavioural norms in order for an audience to suspend disbelief. INBRED plays like a checklist wherein all the irrational and stupid options open to the running ducks are the ones that get a tick. The most ludicrous one being the character who is pinned to the floor with steel croquet hoops over his wrists. The clearance between the hoops and his wrists is so vast he could have freed himself at any time. But he just continues to lie there whilst he is tortured to death. This level of glaring stupidity can almost have you shouting at the screen 'Just move your bloody hands ya moron!' So here's the deal when figuring out whether or not to watch INBRED. It's a horror film with no real scares but plenty of blood and guts. All the characters you should be rooting for you won't care about and you'll figure they're all going to buy it anyway from the outset. And you'll be right about that. The villains of the piece will prevail and you'll have figured that also. Some will get wasted but not enough to make any difference to the presupposed and heavily signposted outcome. The motives of the inbred freaks and their genesishistory is never explored. They do what they do for fun and food because they are simply retarded stupid and unpleasant and lack any moral insight.I was faintly bored by it for the most part but impressed by the black humour and some of the gore effects and what was achieved overall on a shoestring budget. If it wasn't for those elements it would have been lucky to scrape a score of 2.".

Its not really funny at all nor scary either in the east. While its not bad per se its not really great either just average and a bit below that to boot. There's Just a bunch of unlikable characters running around doing stupid things and getting their just rewards by your run of the mill inbred rednecks.. We have seen it all 1000 times before and better. For some reason when an unoriginal movie is made in EnglandIreland and especially foreign languages people tend to up vote them and I just don't know why. You would think by some of the reviews here that this movie was something special but I promise you its not. MILD SPOILERS HEREExamples of the ridiculousness when they're driving the truck away they just stop for the redneck with the shotgun instead of ducking and running him down or the really annoying guy with the blonde wig opens his mouth for the gas tank filled with mudfeceswhatever. The gore was okay acting below average sets good for a indie film. Film is way too long at almost 1 hour and 40 minutes1st kill not til the 46 minute mark yawn. Not much of a story to speak of. Overall I would say a 410 film. If you like Wrong TurnLake Deadetc you may like this but it offers nothing new at all to the genre.".

It's according to Alex Chandon 999  practical effects with a final digital touch. We're treated to a couple of ultragory scenes of extreme carnage lots of violence against heads stabbings bodyslicing!

You really can just suspend your disbelief and take it as the story it was meant to be though.It has a simple premise almost a trope people go to remote location with good intentions but find a horrific circumstance they must battle through. The distinguishing feature is that it takes those expectations and twists them ever so slightly. Even if you are looking for them they are either too subtle or too glaringly offensive that you just don't see it coming.It's well written well acted and humorous where it means to be. That's amazing enough considering the subject matter.It even shocks! That has nothing to do with the gore of which there is a plenty. The costume and makeup is adequate to good. You can't expect modern Romero effects with this budget but the post production isn't jarring masked as it is in the surprise.It's grim up't north and no amount of flat caps and ferrets can change that... but this film made it jovial in a very pleasant way. A very pleasant surprise.Take this review in context look at the films we have ranked this against".

That's amazing enough considering the subject matter.It even shocks! That has nothing to do with the gore of which there is a plenty. The costume and makeup is adequate to good. You can't expect modern Romero effects with this budget but the post production isn't jarring masked as it is in the surprise.It's grim up't north and no amount of flat caps and ferrets can change that... but this film made it jovial in a very pleasant way. A very pleasant surprise.Take this review in context look at the films we have ranked this against";

That takes 15 minutes into this flick before it all goes wrong. But even then it takes a while before the real horror comes in. But if you have the patient to wait long enough you will be rewarded by gore galore. If you see the opening with Emily Booth then you know what you will get. But once back in time it takes indeed a while before a small accident becomes an atrocity. It doesn't has a Hollywood ending. What do works are the effects used. For a flick like that they really looked great okay CGI but you have to do it that way here for such kind of gorefest. A small wink to Texas Chainsaw when Podge is swinging with his chainsaw. Not bad at all don't think to see a flick with a great story like Kill List 2011 but a pure delight for gorehounds. Gore 45 Nudity 05 Effects 45 Story 35 Comedy 05".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be put off by the lame artwork on the poster RISE BLOOD HUNTER is a striking unsettling moody thriller with really fine acting and cinematography from Oscar winner John Toll that has somehow been repackaged as an action movie ! It's not. I read on Shock Til You Drop that this was originally a non linear vampire noir film told mostly in flashbacks. And guess what? It shows!!! The movie has been rearranged chronologically and it becomes monotonous and not nearly as haunting as you can tell it was supposed to be. Where's the director's cut? Why the studios insist on dumbing horror down? Why is Nick Lachey in this movie? Why is it anytime someone tries to do something new the studios try to turn it into the same crap we've all seen a million times? You'd think Sam Raimi would have a little more faith in his fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite its unwieldy offputting title Rise Blood Hunter aka simply Rise isn't as terribly cheesy and disgusting as I imagined it would be. A reporter Lucy Liu wakes up in a morgue's body drawer and discovers she's been changed into a bloodseeking humanchomping immortal or something and rather than gleefully embrace her new self she decides to track down the evil bastards who put her in that condition making her a sort of avenging angel for all those who have been similarly wronged.Sadie Blake Liu is a sexy classy young lady who's just written a frontpage story about teen goth clubs. One of her coworkers the nerdy computer stereotype tracks down a phone number that one of the teens handed to Sadie  turns out it's not a phone number but the first in a series of clues that leads to a website devoted to some weird bloodsucking cult. Sadie of course thinks the story's over and goes on a quickie vacation to Mexico with her sister but when she returns you guessed it her coworker's dead. Sadie follows clues like a good little Nancy Drew and winds up getting kidnapped several times and killed several times all to figure out who or what's behind everything.The story jumps around a lot flouting the conventions of time as we know them things simply don't happen in the exact order we'd expect them to which clouds Sadie's motives and intentions quite a bit. Is she good? Is she even human? After all once she's been attacked by the vampire people she's not exactly the picture of health and she's gotta eat to survive. Is her ultimate goal of revenge enough to offset the unpleasant facts? It helps that there's a typically hissable bad guy Bishop James D'Arcy. He's eternal of course and he kills and mutilates and rapes for the sheer joy of it. There are no moral or ethical quandaries with this guy. Plus he has an effete brandyswilling British accent making all the more unctuous and slimy. Well he's slimy also because he's often covered in someone's blood. Now granted this isn't a pleasant sedate movie to watch. It's full of gore and guts although not so much as say a movie like Saw or Hostel. It's still not for the weak of stomach. You might remember how in Kill Bill The Bride traveled all over to wipe out those who'd wronged her  but the film didn't show us this in the order in which each avenging occurred did it? So you'd see Uma Thurman wander over to Viveca Fox's house not knowing if she'd already visited Lucy Liu. Well you would know of course if you picked up on the subtle hints and that's exactly how it is here. At one point Sadie runs into alcoholic worldweary copwithaconscienceandacause Clyde Rawlins a fantastic Michael Chiklis and mutters something about having seen him before. And if you watch the movie closely you see exactly where. It's as if there are no coincidences in the movie and I think that works in its favor.Still it IS just a revenge flick albeit one with vampires and a kickass crossbow. Liu is very very good  she's not the screaming handsintheair type of heroine but she's also not the ballsout gutstomping Lara Croft type either. Remember Lucy Liu is petite she doesn't automatically have this intimidating screen presence so she uses what she has and makes the most of it. In her case I'd have to say it's her eyes flashing terror or courage in.... well in the blink of an eye.So despite some predictability the movie does work thanks to Liu and the novelty of the disjointed sequencing. There are quite a few chills and the plot doesn't stray too far from its main revenge thread thus simplifying matters.".

Most of the time it succeeds. Lucy Liu is very effective as the reporter who has been turned into a member of a gang of vampires by James Darcy and Carla Gugino. Her journey to becoming an assassin bent on revenge is powerful stuff including an unforgettable scene where she has to feed for the first time off an old man in a shelter. That moment perfectly captures all that is good and new about this story a way to see the vampires that hasn't been shown before. The whole audience covered their eyes on that one. It was great! Another great moment with humor has Lucy picking up an innocent hitch hiker who just might be her next meal. Hilarious and tense. The camerawork and supporting cast including a cameo by Marilyn Manson great and a really weird one by Nick Lachey are topnotch and the whole thing is set up for an interesting sequel.

The film concerns a reporter played by Lucy Liu who runs a foul of a group of vampires who kill her for her troubles. Regrettably the vampires botch the job and Liu comes back with a driving thirst for vengeance.Three parts noir and one part supernatural thriller this is the sort of grind house film that belonged in the recent Grind House double feature. Moving with a speed and an economy of motion this is a film thats rare to day anywhere especially Hollywood. The film bleeds off the screen and you get a sense that this could be happening somewhere real. The story is as tight as a drum with nary a extraneous line or motion this is a movie that tells its simple story and it tells it well. There are things which it could tell us or show us but it chooses not to since that would get away of the story the alchemist for example. There is blood and violence but its always perfectly done for the right effect. The supporting cast is mostly note perfect including Mako Robert Forrester and Michael Chiklas.While the film has its flaws Liu is a bit stiff at the start the film actually turns out to be a perfectly made Bmovie of the sort that hasn't been seen on screens in decades. Taken for what it is the film will probably stand the test of time and repeated viewings to become a minor classic of its type.".

Instead she joins the ranks of the undead and sets out to get revenge on those responsible for her current state.Director Sebastian Gutierrez presents a refreshingly different take on the whole vampire schtick with this low budget shocker that is both bloody and innovative these vampires may lack fangs but still pack plenty of bite. Great cinematography an engaging story and a decent cast all go to make Rise Blood Hunter worth seeking out although the gimmicky use of a nonlinear storyline is a little unnecessary so many films seem to use this idea these days.A strong sexy performance from Lucy Liu means that the film is never boring although at times it does come across as a little too earnest for its own good. At times Gutierrez strives so hard for an effectively moody atmosphere to suit his tale that the resulting gravitas detracts from one's enjoyment. Fortunately Lucy Liu sees fit to shed her clothes at several points in the movie so everything balances out nicely in the end.If you love vampire films of all types adore Gothic fantasy or like me just want to see Ms. Liu in the buff then Rise Blood Hunter is recommended viewing.".

The main reason I went to see the film was that I'm a huge Michael Chiklis fan and if you enjoy his role in 'The Shield' you'll love him here. Lucy Liu carries out her role well...I wouldn't normally picture her in this kind of movie but she actually was convincing even when lines were a bit cheesy this is a vampire movie!. Gutierrez did a very good job with music selection to help build suspense there's some scenes in pretty industrial settings that had a lot of the audience hiding behind their fingers.The movie is a bit bloody and gory though it certainly could have been more intense it is not for the faint of heart. Editing and cinematography were great  John Toll who was cinematographer for Vanilla Sky The Thin Red Line and Braveheart  obviously knows what he's doing and he really contributes to the mood of the film.All in all if you're looking for a good scare with some funny lines this will certainly do the trick.".

But if you also happen to appreciate the slightly skewed Sebastian Gutierrez perspective  from such films as Women in Trouble or Snakes on a Plane  Rise becomes a mustsee.Yes the story is largely predictable. This is a formula film. But Gutierrez brings his own syncopated style to the formula. All the beats are there but they're just a little off the usual rhythm. The characters are just a bit different than you expect just a bit more human. And the story unwinds in just a slightly different way than you'd expect  even though it does reach a familiar destination.Along the way there are some really nice performances. Lucy Liu whom I've NEVER previously liked is amazingly subdued and sympathetic. Carla Gugino is excellent as usual and almost unrecognizable as a cynical vampire. And Michael Chiklis is particularly likable as the toughguy cop. You may have seen him before as the Thing one of the few bright elements in the two mediocre Fantastic Four movies.Rise is a film that's scary gory energetic yet also somehow intellectual on some existential level. Not everyone will get that but Gutierrez fans will. This is very much a 'vampire noir'  a film that elevates a familiar dark formula with its own uniquely mythic style.".

It's not only good it's one of the better of the genre over the last 10 years or so.The vampires are never referred to as vampires it's simply called a condition. Typical mythology like mirrors immortality drinking human blood arrow through the heart and daylight problems still exist. But these creatures are not super human their only true gift is immortality.The characters are well designed around the actors who play them. Lucy Liu plays a reporter looking into goth cults and finding more than she bargained for. Her performance shows some nice range especially during the early part of the story during her discovering the truth about herself. Michael Chiklis plays a tough vengeful hard drinking copa role he's perfected. Carla Gugino has a small role as the femme fatale surprise surprise but gives us a taste of the human being behind the monster. And long time character actor Mako in his last role portrays a disturbing and charming familiarlike character who's part butler part mentor. Even Robert Forster shows up for a cameo I really wanted more of him in this film. The rest of the cast works well no real turkeys here.The plot is really the weakest link a typical revenge thriller. But the outofsequence editing the director's unrated version is spoton. And the production values are quite strong. Writerdirector Sebastian Gutierrez the guy who wrote Snakes on a Plane gives us clichridden hokey dialog and we forgive him for it because it's often tongueincheek funny. The nuditysex is downplayed much less of it here than in the Underworld films. I prefer these less romanticized versions of vampires they're creatures who take what they wantlove never factors into it. All in all a good graphic novel type moviewith average substance but great style.What sucks is that theatrical release was apparently poorly cut and it performed badly at the boxoffice. So the nice setup for a sequel is probably wasted.So final verdict7 out of 10. Better than Underworld 2 and Blade 3. Underworld and Blade 1 and 2 still trump it however. A good rental for genreLucy Liu fans.".

The use of nonlinear storytelling is handled masterfully by writer and director Sebastian Gutierrez and along with the beautifully lush cinematography of John Toll these devices go a long way in giving the film an edge that most other horror films can only dream of. But then RISE is so much more than a mere horror film as it is just as heavily rooted in gritty film noir and hard boiled revenge thrillers like KISS ME DEADLY and POINT BLANK and Gutierrez effortlessly mixes these different genres into one helluva potent cocktail. He is also greatly helped in making this sell by Lucy Liu as her acting in this film is completely off the chart. This is without a doubt the finest and most daring performance she has ever given and the raw emotion she dishes out in certain scenes is nothing short of astounding. So... in the cinematic tradition of vampire films like THE HUNGER NEAR DARK and THE ADDICTION Sebastian Gutierrez's RISE is most definitely a worthy addition to the list.".

But the only part that got messed up....I've said this before and I'll say it again the producing. I swear if those goddamn producers kept their hands off this movie you could have had a great thrilling film noir but they just had to make it a Bmovie horrorfest.Lucy Liu is great as always. Her intense acting emotional scenes and laughoutloud one liners are enough reason to watch the movie.Michael Chiklis is amazing at the action per usual. He's surprisingly heartfelt at the scenes where it's vital and in every single one of the shots showing him you can see how heartbroken and full of rage he is. That's good acting.James D'arcy He's funny and a perfect villain for the movie. You are actually scared of him and you really want Liu to kick his ass. In the acting sense he really delivers and the movie would not be the same without him to say the least.Carla Gugino She really steals the movie I must say. My only wish was that I could see more of her. Because she is essential to the plot and her wonderful acting just makes a great movie a whole lot better.This film had such potential to begin with. And it still has it now. You should watch it. It isn't what it's hyped up to be. It wasn't supposed to be a supersexual hyperviolent Bmovie flick. It was actually supposed to be a sexy funny heartbreaking mature film. And most of the scenes are still that.Like any movie go in with low expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised.Basically if you look closely you can see the soul of what used to be a fantastic heartbreaking mature movie that was degraded to the point of cheap scares unnecessary nudity and lots of stupid gore. But it still has its heart. And it is most definitely worth checking out.There was this one girl in a scene in the homeless shelter. She was actually pretty good. I think that kid's got something. Haha. Seriously. CAST HER NOW!The studio messed up the release the title the poster and the hype. But they ceased to destroy the movie. Even there is a tint of obvious attempts to make the movie into something its not by the producers it still rings true to what it was supposed to be.

I will say however that from the outset the sequence of events are disjointed and make for confusing viewing. The film tries to be too clever throughout and ultimately ends up being hard to follow. For a vampire film it doesn't really give much background to the whole vampire genre as most do and adds to the confusion as to who is who and what is what. Apart from Lucy Liu's character there is no back story or build up to the antagonists everything just happens randomly which makes it an effort to keep track of things.As for the acting I find it a shame that Lucy Liu continues to make films that don't really challenge her. She spends most of this film looking either in distress or moody oh and naked. Having seen her in Kill Bill and her earlier turns in Ally McBeal Rise  Ecks vs Sever really don't do her justice as an actress. The vampire contingent here are pretty poor too with James D'Arcy playing a poor mans version of every other bad vampire we've seen before notably Stephen Dorff in Blade. Michael Chiklis is at best mediocre looking like he did this when short of a few bob in his spare time from filming Silver Surfer.Overall another addition to the growing number of mediocre vampirethemed films. I would avoid this if I were you but if Lucy Liu  a few others prancing about naked and lots of blood tickles your fancy then give it a go.".

The scene where he has to help her pull up her pants because her hands are handcuffed together is very sexy but that's all there is between them. Another scene where Liu suddenly appears in mysterious very vampirelike style at her sleeping mothers bedside could have been heartwrenching and made you feel for the doomed Sadie Blake Liu but it's so fleeting you may well miss it. There's too much time spent with Sadie acting like a secondrate detective and not enough in developing the fact of Sadie's inevitable doom and the cop's loss of his daughter. Having said that it's still fun and Liu is great to look at althought I suspect many of the nude scenes used a body double and is able to handle the action scene with credibility.

	schema:reviewBody "Rise has an attentiongrabbing opening sequence in which a nononsense Lucy Liu strides purposefully in a bar and practically steals a high class escort Point Pleasant's Cameron Richardson from under the nose of her businessman john a cameoing Robert Forster. Liu takes the slightly nervous talkative hooker back to a huge mansion and before the working girl knows what's happening she's hanging upside down in a cage naked crying and pleading with Liu about to feed her to an elderly vampire.After that slambang introduction we're in flashback mode as reporter Sadie Blake Liu delves into LA's bloodsports underground only to get kidnapped raped and killed by a secret coven of genuine vampires who mistakenly believe that she's close to uncovering their existence. In Rise's mythology vampires cast no reflection in a mirror and don't grow fangs but they can walk about in sunlight  though it hurts their eyes. Turning somebody into a vampire is also a delicate procedure that's difficult to master so the coven are as surprised as anyone when Sadie awakes in a cold metal mortuary drawer as a member of the undead and starts tracking them down one by one armed with a powerful miniature crossbow supplied by a vampire turncoat.Rise which is titled Rise Blood Hunter on the DVD box but not onscreen in the film itself is more concerned with character and drama than action setpieces and special effects and so while it's not as exciting as Underworld and Blade it's more satisfying than those movies. There are good performances all round especially Liu and some sequences  for example a newly vampirised Blake standing on a motorway bridge gazing at the traffic passing underneath and contemplating suicide  are quite beautiful.While the undead heroes of TV shows such as Angel and Moonlight obtain the blood they need to survive from butchers and slaughter houses there's no such easy and conveniently moral getout clause in Rise. When Sadie needs to feed she reluctantly but determinedly takes the nearest warm body justifying it by telling herself that there are always innocent casualties in war. The film also doesn't avoid depicting biting through someone's flesh and gulping down their gushing blood as being a difficult and extremely messy business. And refreshingly although the leader of the coven has amassed a fortune during his extended lifetime owns a large flashy house in the Hollywood hills and makes fancy speeches about how sex and murder are the only true pleasures left and that he's merely refusing to deny himself either of them he's ultimately portrayed not as a supervillain or Dark Overlord but merely as an expensively dressed well spoken serial killer.".

And refreshingly although the leader of the coven has amassed a fortune during his extended lifetime owns a large flashy house in the Hollywood hills and makes fancy speeches about how sex and murder are the only true pleasures left and that he's merely refusing to deny himself either of them he's ultimately portrayed not as a supervillain or Dark Overlord but merely as an expensively dressed well spoken serial killer.";

	schema:headline " Very slick sharply done modern Vampire tale. Nicely stylized and very well directed... Rewatchability High Bluray Very Good A9 V9";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bluray that I have is the shorter 97 minute version UK I haven't seen the longer Uncut version and I'm sure that it has a lot more nastiness in it but I found this version to be very sharp well put together and tightly paced.I've always liked Lucy Liu and I KNOW that not everyone likes her or thinks that she is that hot. I've enjoyed her in the recent 'Elementary' teleseries and she does a nice job here. The thing that makes her character likable is the she is fully believable in the role. She literally plays a normal person who has been thrust into a VERY NONnormal situation. Chiklis is awesome that guy is a great actor and does an excellent job with a pretty simple role. He injects a LOT of feeling and coolness into the character more so than you would expect from that type of role.I thought that the modern Vampire angle was done really well. I frigg'n LOVED the main bad guy he was SO damn smooth! He was clearly completely Evil but the way his character was written and the charismatic way he portrayed it REALLY made the role live. What I also really liked and appreciated about the film was that the characters were very believable and had a style of their own they weren't just stupid shallow caricatures. They were indeed larger than life Comic Book style characters but they had a cool vibe to them that worked really well. The story moved along nicely too and definitely carried the audience along with it.The views about this movie are pretty polarized. I don't know if it is primarily because of Lucy Liu or just the story and the way it was done itself I'm not sure. But it looks like about half the people love it and half hate it. I'm most definitely one of the ones who loves it. Not getting into any Spoilers or anything but I liked the way it ended. The overall mood and atmosphere of the movie were nicely balanced between a very slick modern approach but at the same time you still get a real Classic epic Comic Book feel to the film.Since people are so divided about the movie it's kind of hard to know exactly how to recommend it to others. The things that were appealing to me were primarily the director's style the way the characters were dimensional and textured and of course... Lucy Liu   Seriously though it was really the tone and mood of the film that I liked. It had a real Comic Book feel to it which gave it sort of a largerthanlife energy which I personally found very entertaining.I don't like a LOT of the more recent Vampire type films that have come out in recent years. The reason being is probably because I really love the more Classic Traditional approach to the Vampire Story. BUT... when they at least show SOME respect for the Vampire history and lore even in a modern setting I personally enjoy it a lot more. In this case they depicted how Vampires cannot be seen in mirrors so I kind of liked that little nod to the Vampire Tradition.I guess I would say that if you like a good Vampire story and you like a stylized approach where the characters really come to life in their roles and you don't mind the simplicity of the story then you might have a good chance of liking this movie. Keep in mind though... that if you are more of a fan of the 'TWILIGHT' approach to modern Vampire tales or if you are really steeped in the more Classic heavily textured romantic style like 'INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE' you might come away from this film somewhat disappointed. Another thing too that I personally liked about this movie was that it approached the story from a bit more of a Modern Gothic angle. So to me the film came across as a nice balance or blend of a Classic Gothic style but with a more slick modern tone AND without the dumbed down approach of the 'TWILIGHT' films.I hope that this helps to give an overall view of what the movie is like so that you can determine whether you want to take the time to watch it...".

I saw nothing wrong with her hooking up with Josh in that one though I know some found it a reach.Something that struck he about sixty minutes in was how much of homage to John Carpenter this film was becoming. The idea of somewhat ordinary people dealing with extraordinary and supernatural situations seemed so JC that I had to smile just a bit.If you want a little bit of drama a little bit of crime and a little bit pretty good acting that sometimes has to slog through some HUGE plot holes then give this movie a chance.

	schema:headline " A Vampire with Principles Out For Vengeance";
	schema:reviewBody "Judas Kiss writer  director Sebastian Gutierrez provided Lucy Lui with one of her more unusual roles as a vampire with principles out for vengeance in Rise Blood Hunter. Vampire purists may take issue with some of the bloodsucking details but this isn't a pedestrian fangster yarn. Gutierrez's film is gritty and realistic compared to other supernatural vampire movies. Primarily the chief setback here is length. The 'Unrated Undead' version wears out its welcome at an indulgent 2 hours and two minutes. Since I haven't ogled the theatrical cut which clocks in at a trimmer 98 minutes I cannot vouch for the shorter saga. Pacing is the problem. Gutierrez could have retained everything for the longer cut but pared down some of the action that drags things out. Another shortcoming is the lack of exposition on various characters such as the Alchemist or as he calls him 'her godfather' and Poe. Meanwhile some of Gutierrez's dialogue is catchy and quotable. Fear is where we go to learn says one vampire. The cast is good but some actors like Mako are wasted in lackluster roles. Carla Gugino doesn't have more than a couple of scenes but she still manages to make an impression. Comen VFX handled the special makeup effects with finesse. Special MakeUp Effects Technician Christopher Nelson makes an interesting comment in a featurette that vampire blood differs from human blood. Indeed this makes sense but it is something you don't really think about in these movies.Inquisitive L.A. Weekly tabloid reporter Sadie Blake Lucy Lui of Charlie's Angels writes a story about vampires and then finds herself at their lack of mercy. Bishop James D'Arcy of Hitchcock and Eve Carla Gugino of The One rape and drain our heroine of blood but Sadie clings stubbornly to life. Eve can sense the stubborn desire of our heroine to live. Nevertheless the authorities discover her body in a dumpster. Sadie awakens in the city morgue after her grieving mom has identified her but later manages to escape to track down the devilish dastards that turned her into a vampire. At one point a Hispanic pair find her and nurse Sadie back to health. Arturo Julio Oscar Mechoso of Planet Terror creates a coollooking little crossbow that our heroine can fire with one hand. Near the end of the action we hear Arturo referred to as the alchemist but Gutierrez doesn't dwell on details in this department. Eventually Sadie runs into alcoholic cop Clyde Rawlins Michael Chiklis of The Fantastic Four who is searching for his daughter Tricia. Actually Rawlins saw her after Bishop and Eve left her body in a dumpster. Anyway they team up after Sadie convinces him that she is not human. Rawlins shoots her twice in the back and then extracts the slugs and marvels at her recovery. Once they strike a dealRawlins promises to kill Sadie after she eliminates Bishopthey head off for a rendezvous at a remote stable in the middle of nowhere to confront the evil Bishop. Rawlins gets the surprise of his life when he confronts her own undead daughter.Rise Blood Hunter qualifies as an aboveaverage vampire flick with Lui registering a strong performance as a sympathetic vampire. Interestingly Gutierrez has fractured the story chronology so certain things appear in reverse to both heighten the suspense as well as accelerate the action. Essentially what he achieves is a marginally quicker pace because he doesn't supply the exposition in some parts which would definitely had drawn out the action. Meaning you get some straightforward storytelling and then Gutierrez backtracks to fill in the gaps. For example after Sadie leaves the morgue in her birthday suit she borrows scrubs so she can venture out into the open. As she saunters down the sidewalk she shoplifts a set of sunglasses. Most of the action takes place predictably after dark as our hero searches for the vampires. For the record these vampires don't flash fangs. They rely on cool looking pendants with sharp edges. They aren't shapeshifters. They are strong but they aren't super strong like Christopher Lee in the Hammer Dracula franchise. They can neither mesmerize their victims nor compel them perform deeds merely by controlling their minds like Dracula commanded the maid in the Todd Browning original. The ending suggests that our heroine doesn't stay in the city morgue any longer than she did at the beginning of this creepy opus. Vampires are not depicted as romantic but rather doomed and driven. Further these vampires appear strictly predatory. The victims in some instances are marked by either the subversive things that they do or are hopeless. The first victim that our reluctant vampire heroine quenches her blood lust for is an elderly man in a homeless shelter. Her second victim is a potsmoking hitchhiker. Tragically our heroine had no desire to become a bloodsucker. She was victim. Once she completes her mission she accepts that she must die because she is an abomination. Rise Blood Hunter could have been better but it is still worth watching once.".

Insofar it is not surprising that she tries to kill herself before she has a thought about revenge for the first time. I loved the scene when she visits her mother but is unable to explain everything so she just watches her. Even though the second half of the movie is a kind of revenge story we are familiar with from the cinema of the 1970 and 80s it's a good genre entry  neither trying to make an art movie like The Addiction nor the trendy Gothic pop thing but creating its own world which reminds me rather of dark city movies such as Clint Eastwood's Tightrope than any recent horror movie. It's not the blood it's the characters. And speaking of that  honestly since I remember Lucy Liu as one of Charlie's Angels I didn't expect she could pull this off. Thumbs up!".

When the Nazi war machine overtakes Warsaw they and their acting troupe use every actor's trick in the book to escape and make their way to England.All this of course while Anna becomes smitten with an American pilot Matheson who helps them both to freedom.  In the meantime there are threats from a devious doctor Ferrer a lecherous Nazi colonel Durning and a command for the troupe to perform for the Nazi Army with Hitler in the audience.There are so many classic moments here that to list them would be a disservice to the movie.  Let me just say that I enjoyed this whole film from opening to closing and even the closing had some doozies. The Nazis are seen as complete buffoons and the exchanges between Durning and his head officer Lloyd are classic.  In fact I can see why Durning was nominated for an Oscar for his role here not just anyone could have pulled it off as well as he.Everyone here has a good scene or two including Mel's regulars Graham Wyner Riley and the dialogue even manages to get the proper sentiment and tension out of the proper scenes.  A great effort by all involved. Purists of the Jack Benny original may disagree but this To Be or Not to Be is the to Be for me!Ten stars.  Mazeltov!".

I didn't know the original had been rated the 49th best comedy of all time by the AFI or that Brooks neither wrote nor directed it.What I knew was that from the moment it started to the moment the curtains came down I was laughing nonstop in awe of an incredible plot. The film managed to escalate with each passing scene. Just when you thought nothing more could be done to it they managed to push it further and further. Brook's performance was dead on as was the entire casts. It's the sort of movie that gives Christopher Loyd only seven or eight lines and you love him for it and need to ask for anything more.It continually makes fun itself building on jokes you thought were over half a movie ago. I'd place this movie above Spaceballs and below Men in Tights but would say that it is without a doubt the best plot of any movie I've seen in some time comedy or otherwise.This is a movie that you should waste no time seeking out and renting buying seeing in whatever way you can.Still not sold? I'll retell one of the jokes. Don't read further if you want the first five minutes to be as fresh as they were for me  if you're debating whether to see it or not I hope this is able to sway you.They're in a theater putting on a show. We hear the Polish songs  not quite sure what they're singing about. The curtain comes down on the two actors smiling and bowing together as the audience claps. The moment the audience can no longer see them the actors start bickering in Polish. We're not sure what they're discussing but it's clearly a heated debate. The curtain then comes up they immediately are smiling bowing curtain comes down once again and it's back to the Polish bickering. They continue bickering stopping for an announcement over the loudspeakers in this vaudeville theater. Attention for the Sanity and Clarity of the Audience the rest of this movie will be EnglishThen the movie switches into English and the plot begins.".

There aren't many belly laughs to be had from the lowkey screenplay cowritten by Thomas Meehan and Ronnie Graham and the Nazi caricatures are fun without being especially funny Charles Durning was Oscarnominated for his role as bumbling Gestapo officer 'Concentration Camp' Erhardt but the film offers an upbeat mixture of thrills and frivolity and a superb cast of experienced players take turns stealing the limelight from leading player Brooks Anne Bancroft has a ball as Brooks' duplicitous wife easing her marriage blues by encouraging a halfinnocent liaison with handsome airman Tim Matheson who's been assigned by British Intelligence to foil a dastardly plot initiated by double agent Jose Ferrer. As in the original the movie portrays the Nazi threat in a comic manner whilst constantly reminding viewers of the deadly reality which underpins the narrative and while the scenario is fastpaced funny and exciting in equal measure it's also surprisingly respectful of history. Johnson's unfussy direction keeps things moving along nicely and production values are efficient throughout.".

There aren't many belly laughs to be had from the lowkey screenplay cowritten by Thomas Meehan and Ronnie Graham and the Nazi caricatures are fun without being especially funny Charles Durning was Oscarnominated for his role as bumbling Gestapo officer 'Concentration Camp' Erhardt but the film offers an upbeat mixture of thrills and frivolity and a superb cast of experienced players take turns stealing the limelight from leading player Brooks Anne Bancroft has a ball as Brooks' duplicitous wife easing her marriage blues by encouraging a halfinnocent liaison with handsome airman Tim Matheson who's been assigned by British Intelligence to foil a dastardly plot initiated by double agent Jose Ferrer. As in the original the movie portrays the Nazi threat in a comic manner whilst constantly reminding viewers of the deadly reality which underpins the narrative and while the scenario is fastpaced funny and exciting in equal measure it's also surprisingly respectful of history. Johnson's unfussy direction keeps things moving along nicely and production values are efficient throughout.";

It followed the most basic rule of comedy in that the plot was simple yet interesting  meaning that you didn't have to spend time going over the plot in your head something that can kill a comedy yet you still maintain interest. Mel Brooks is on stunning form combining personal depth with superb comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "Rather than a satire of a film classic like Frankenstein or a genre of films like the western was done in Blazing Saddles Mel Brooks chose for the one and only time to do a remake of an already very funny film with the classic To Be Or Not To Be. 40 years later the Brooks remake has lost none of the laughs from the original in fact Brooks could now talk about things unmentionable when Hollywood was under the Code.The 1942 original film that starred Jack Benny Carole Lombard and Robert Stack in the roles that Mel Brooks Anne Bancroft and Tim Matheson play here was a sophisticated comedy that was not well received when first out many thought the Nazis were no subject to joke about during wartime. Over time it gained acceptance as yet another of the masterpieces that Ernest Lubitsch did over his career. It may have been Jack Benny's best big screen performance. It was also Carole Lombard's farewell performance.Benny's comedy was droll Brooks's humor hits you with a sledgehammer. Still the different approach works out in this remake. Anne Bancroft is more than a good substitute for Carole Lombard in fact she's as funny in this as Lombard ever was on the screen.Many years ago one of my supervisors knew Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft and he told us at work that her image as a great dramatic actress whose two career roles are in The Graduate and The Miracle Worker was a total fabrication. Mel Brooks he said was as zany a man in private as he was in film. But he also said that Bancroft was even zanier than he was and had few times to display that in public. In that sense the two were a perfectly matched couple. My supervisor said he lived in the same building as they did in Greenwich Village and got to know both of them.Mel Brooks got to show the effect of the Holocaust to come on gays in one of the first films to acknowledge that publicly. One of the touching performances in the supporting cast is by James Haake as Sascha the dresser for Bancroft who gets a one way ticket to a concentration camp but the trip gets put on hold permanently by his friends in the theater. Charles Durning also does well as Gestapo head in Warsaw who gets constantly bamboozled almost like World War II era film Nazis by Brooks's ingenuity and his theater troupe who give the best performances of their lives. And we can't forget Jose Ferrer adding yet another ethnic group to his repertoire as the Polish traitor Siletsky.If you're not a fan of Mel Brooks you will become one after you see any of his films. And this review is dedicated to the late Robert Peregoff one of my supervisors at work who provided me the insights I got into the BrooksBancroft screen and life partnership.".

And if the same sector doesn't have much of a grasp of affairs in Poland in 1940 so much the more informative.Mel Brooks leads a theatrical troupe in Warsaw in 1940 after it was occupied by the Nazis. The plot is too complex to describe in detail but involves a great deal of impersonation switching uniforms lambasting the Nazi hierarchy and poking fun at egotistic actors.The plot and dialog borrow heavily from 1940 but some of the jokes have been brought up to date. I'll mention just two.The troupe is desperately seeking safety from bombs and when they enter the shelter one actor makes the sign of the cross. The next in line presumably Jewish goes through some contortions over his thorax with his fingers. Now I may be mistaken but I think this is an allusion to an old joke. An airplane in jeopardy finally makes a safe landing. A minister gets off and makes the sign of the cross as does the priest who follows him. The Rabbi makes a sign too and when asked about it by a reporter replies What sign of the cross? I was just checking  spectacles testicles wallet and watch. The troupe's dresser is openly gay and he explains to Anne Bancroft that he hates having to wear a pink triangle. It CLASHES with EVERYTHING. The acting was suitably hammy in Ernst Lubitsch's movie. Here the performances outHerod Herod. If you want subtlety see the original. Charles Durning is a fine actor but may be miscast here. Anne Bancroft is beguiling a splendid and underrated actress with a skull and a frame sufficiently gracile to die for. I speak to you as your anthropologist. My services come with a fee  ten cents.You should probably watch this. It's still funny after all these years.".

I remembered him saying once that he loved singing and dancing Polish with his wife and now I can see why. They begin the show singing and dancing in Polish. I was surprised by how much they spoke Polish in the beginning. Unlike most Polish depictions they are not considered to be taken as jokes in this film. They are in Warsaw with their theater troupe. In actuality Warsaw was destroyed 90 by the war's end so it was probably very unlikely that they could outsmart the Germans but it's not a true story. The Jews wear the yellow Star of Davids and the homosexuals wear the pink triangle. Now the film could have ignored that part of the war but they did not. They wisely incorporated it into the storyline. They remind us of the concentration camps and the certain death that they would have faced. While the stars of the film and the fictional theater troupe Anne and Frederick Bronski played by Bancroft and Brooks are forced out of their own home to live with their homosexual cast member played memorably by David Haacke in this small one room apartment. The rest of the cast is superb with Charles Durning Tim Matheson as the young military man in love with Anna Estelle Reiner George Gaines George Wyner etc. Anne Bancroft is positively beautiful and glowing in her performance. She is truly a star and we know Mel loved her to death and she loved him in life as well. I don't get into the plot because I don't want to spoil it. It's worth watching again and again.

My grandfather also a big Mel Brooks fan had seen the film on its release back in 1984 and thought it was a kind of pale copy of the Jack Benny version which he loves too. But I personally thought that the film was a brilliant motion picture and contained more laffs and better music than the original. This quickly became one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies even though he didn't direct or write it! The supporting cast is great in a different way than the original. Instead of trying to merely copy the original performances they create their own equallyfunny ones especially Charles Durning and Christopher Lloyd. Jose Ferrer was great. That underrated Jewish character comic George Wyner was also as funny as ever. Even Ronny Graham had a role as SondheimSondheim send in the Klowns! James Haake as Sasha gave a brilliant performance. I wish he'd won an Oscar. Tim Matheson was good in his kind of bland role as the Polish Flier. But of course the stars are Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. Their highlights together include a Polish version of Sweet Georgia Brown. Brooks sings A Little Peace Ladies and on the soundtrack album only The Hitler Rap.".

By chance they discover that visiting Professor Siletski is a Nazi agent with a crucial report on the resistance and resolve to use all their acting skills to stop him getting those names to the High Command.This remake of the 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy classic is very faithful to its predecessor but is a hugely entertaining picture in its own right. What I like about it most is its terrific cast  Brooks and Bancroft seem almost made for these roles and both are sensational as are the whole Bronski troupe. Matheson and Ferrer are suitably suave and slimy but the real stars for me are Durning and Lloyd as Colonel Erhardt and his adjutant Schultz  you can basically never go wrong with a short fat man and a tall thin man as a comedy duo but these two are hilariously mismatched. The scene where Bronski disguised as Siletski delivers his report to Erhardt and the two Nazis scream at each other is a masterpiece of comic bungling. This film's chief addition is Sasha the gay dresser character who would never have gotten past the Hays Code but exemplifies the many moments where Brooks cleverly sprinkles the comedy with sharp reminders of the horrors it's lampooning. It also has much more of a musical element courtesy of a terrific score by John Morris and some funny numbers who else but Brooks would open with Sweet Georgia Brown in Polish ?. There aren't many straight remakes I'm especially fond of but this is a definite exception it's funny beautifully made retells a great story and is a terrific showcase for the comic talents of its ensemble. Produced by Brooks and deftly scripted by Thomas Meehan and Ronny Graham the latter of whom plays Sondheim the very loud stage manager.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm pushing my way through a collection of Mel Brooks films. Along the way I've revisited some classics been introduced to others and stumbled across the occasional odd title I've never even heard of before. One of those is TO BE OR NOT TO BE. From the title I assumed it would be Brooks lampooning the works of William Shakespeare in the same fashion he's tackled Hitchcock big budget scifi adventures and westerns. I came to discover this wasn't a Mel Brooks movie in the traditional sense. For starters he didn't write or direct it. It was directed by a man named Alan Johnson whose film credits are primarily choreography and the only other film he directed was SOLARBABIES a movie I'm only familiar with thanks to an episode of the How Did This Get Made podcast. TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a remake of a film of the same name from 1942 it tells the story of the world famous in Poland at least theater duo Frederick and Anna Bronski played by Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft. Their marriage is a rocky one with Anna skirting the idea of a possible affair with the smitten Lieutenant Sobinski Tim Matheson but there's hardly time for any of that to come to pass as Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich have begun their invasion of Poland. Fate intervenes and the Bronskis will find their acting skills put to the ultimate test as they accidentally become involved in the Polish underground resistance.TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a strange little anomaly in my experience with Brooks' films because this one plays out as a normal narrative. His spoof films are different in that the jokes always come first and the plot only really exists on which to hang the gags. Make no mistake though this is still very much a Brooks' film. The comedic styling of the film is very much in line with what you would expect from the man. Seeing as how director Johnson made a living as a choreographer I wouldn't be surprised to find that Brooks was a helping hand behind the scenes in crafting the film. The film is also interesting in that it gives Brooks a chance to dive into a more serious subject than we're accustomed to seeing from him World War II. Or more specifically the Third Reich and the subjugation of the Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis. TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a comedy but it's got its serious moments even if it manages to try and inject a little fun in them to keep the movie from becoming too heavy. One prime example is a scene in the film when the Nazis arrive at the Bronskis' theater to arrest their homosexual friend Sascha James Haake. It's a frightening moment because we as an audience understand what his arrest would mean for him that's made a little easier to swallow because it plays comedically during a music number on stage where Sascha tries to hide amongst the showgirls in the routine.Brooks and Johnson manage to balance the humor and weight of the situation pretty well. It never really lets it get too heavy. They don't need to hit us upside the head with the real world horrors because we know all that this is the tale of some nobodies in the grand scheme of the war and how they pulled the wool over the eyes of the foolish bumbling Nazis. For a film with Holocaust themes looming TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a lot of fun. The jokes are pretty consistent and the movie is loaded with a fantastic supporting cast including Christopher Lloyd in a small role as a beleaguered Nazi captain Charles During as the Nazi S.S. colonel in charge and the Bronski theater troupe including the talents of George Gaynes George Wyner and Jack Riley. All of this is topped off with the natural chemistry between stars Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft real life husband and wife in the starring roles. For being one of Brooks' lesserknown films I mean I assumeI know I hadn't heard of it before TO BE OR NOT TO BE is one of his more solid. Let me put it this way I was watching this and my nineyearold daughter who could only enjoy it at facevalue with the jokes because she doesn't know anything about the war context at this point couldn't take her eyes off the screen. This and SPACEBALLS are the two Mel Brooks movies we can enjoy together she couldn't be bothered with MEN IN TIGHTS or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and she's too young for BLAZING SADDLES or HISTORY OF THE WORLD.So if you haven't seen TO BE OR NOT TO BE I invite you to check it out. It's a hidden gem in his filmography that doesn't get much attention and you generally can't go wrong with Brooks in the starring role. It may not rank up there with his greatest hits but it's a respectable fun movie.".

The remake adds sentimentality and the unfortunate inevitability of a gay stereotype all in all however Brooks' earlier lampoon of Nazism in the form of the Springtime For Hitler setpiece in THE PRODUCERS 1968 was much more effective. There are nonetheless a couple of good songs here  while the original's gem of a final gag involving Hitler has been replaced by an equally priceless one.As I said the leads are no match for Jack Benny and Carole Lombard from the 1942 version and are overage to boot  though it was certainly nice to watch reallife couple Brooks who unsurprisingly gets to double as both Professor Siletsky and Hitler and Anne Bancroft playing alongside each other for once. Still Jose' Ferrer fills the old Stanley Ridges role more than adequatelybut then Charles Durning makes for a poor substitute to Sig Rumann in the allimportant role of Colonel Concentration Camp Erhardt amazingly Durning's rather forced performance here was nominated for an Oscar!.".

I don't care who made an earlier picture even if it's Ernst Lubitsch and Jack Benny in 1942 this is an original and is definitely collectible if the DVD ever comes out. We have been watching Euro art movies that paralyse you to the fingertips with boredom and this picture lights up your life and gives you a kick in the pants like few others do.

I don't care who made an earlier picture even if it's Ernst Lubitsch and Jack Benny in 1942 this is an original and is definitely collectible if the DVD ever comes out. We have been watching Euro art movies that paralyse you to the fingertips with boredom and this picture lights up your life and gives you a kick in the pants like few others do. To hell with Euro art movies about bondage and lesbianism let Mel Brooks reign supreme!";

	schema:reviewBody "Nice shots of the bayou under the opening credits. Unspoiled rivers pristine swamps oaks draped with Spanish moss. It all looks rather promising. I guess you can still find such subtle but majestic littorals maybe along route 90 around Houma but from most highways in southern Louisiana all you see is oily swamp water with derricks planted in it. Beer cans and garbage and quien sabe? corpses floating in the murk.The movie's kind of like that too. The location shooting is just fine. Everyone sweats up a storm in the heat and humidity and it's no wonder that they head for the gin rickeys with all that ice. New Orleans is exposed in all its funkiness. The French Quarter is more or less avoided but we get to see the lesser neighborhoods now drowned and empty of human life in the wake of Katrina. There are the shotgun houses of the poor the stripper bars playing bluesy music. The streetcars travel not through the Garden District but through ordinary residential streets. Beautiful in its own rotting way almost phosphorescent with corruption. Outside the city there are bait shops that rent boats and sell tackle. One of these is run by Alec Baldwin ex cop recovering alcoholic.The story isn't very much when you come right down to it. Hard to follow at times not really captivating but not absolutely mainstream generic either. Baldwin has a marvelously normal family including a stolen adopted girl but is accidentally involved in some shenanigans I couldn't quite follow something about smuggling which draws the attention of the mob. Baldwin doesn't seem to actually DO anything that threatens their presence but they surround his house one lightningfilled night and do his loving and courageous wife Kelly Lynch. The rest of the plot is a revenge story with Baldwin tracking down the killers one by one. There are some good action scenes a chase across the rooftops a battle on a streetcar. All the action is done in slow motion so you get a chance to savor it  the crashing crashing cars the catapulting bodies the muzzle flashes brilliantly lighting up the interiors of dark houses. PS Mister Director can we have a moratorium on slowmotion deaths? It's more than a clich it's positively decadent by now. Let's get together and blame Sam Pekinpah okay? I thought the conclusion was pretty well done. After his wife is blasted to shreds by shotguns an attractive young blond  and old friend  moves into his house in the woods and provides him with some emotional comfort. They once were quite close. Now  see  Baldwin's wife is gone and he's got this little Latina girl that he's adopted but there's a big hole in the nuclear family. In other words the guy needs a wife. A conventional script calls for him to overcome his grief and fall in love with the reassuring and loving blond babe. But no. When he makes clear that he holds his wife's memory sacred the blond leaves him a note and takes off realizing he's not ready to get on with his life as they say. The last scene has Baldwin in his house gazing affectionately at his sleeping little girl then falling on his back beside her. Sensing his presence she twists over and puts her arm around his chest and he places his hand over hers and stares at the ceiling. It is not a cheap shot. It's a brief but genuinely tender scene encompassing both love and the loss of it.".

Roberts shows that he does have a great deal of talent to offer when it comes to a juicy part like this.The film isn't brimming with action thankfully but it has a number of lengthy and exciting action sequences. It seems to me that Baldwin is becoming something of the thinking mans action hero. Whilst Willis is off doing the brainless actioners Baldwin manages to get the intelligent movie. This is a fine example as is The Edge.Baldwin makes this movie stunningly enjoyable and the supporting actors help a little but Baldwin manages to carry the whole thing single handedly.".

	onyx:emotionText "Not exactly faithful to the book but the film certainly delivers as an enjoyable thriller.Alec Baldwin is superb as Robicheaux Lynch Masterson and Hatcher are rather pretty and give the film what is needs but are mainly forgotten about as the film progresses. Roberts shows that he does have a great deal of talent to offer when it comes to a juicy part like this.The film isn't brimming with action thankfully but it has a number of lengthy and exciting action sequences. It seems to me that Baldwin is becoming something of the thinking mans action hero. Whilst Willis is off doing the brainless actioners Baldwin manages to get the intelligent movie. This is a fine example as is The Edge.Baldwin makes this movie stunningly enjoyable and the supporting actors help a little but Baldwin manages to carry the whole thing single handedly.";

	schema:reviewBody "Excop and exdrunk Dave Robicheaux has got his life back and makes a living selling bait outside New Orleans with his wife Annie.  When they witness a plane crash into the river Dave saves a little girl and they decide to keep her since she has been orphaned.  However when they then get a visit from the DEA and some local heavies it is apparent that the plane was doing more than just carrying a few illegals and soon Dave finds his new life rapidly crumbling around him.Opening with a stylish and atmospheric semi tocamera confession this film immediately caught my interest and managed to hold throughout despite not actually being that good.  The film is set in the Deep South and is full or rather annoying mannerisms and clichs from that area that put me off a bit. Despite this I still quite enjoyed it the plot meanders out of control a bit and involves too many characters to really keep a tight emotional grip on the audience but it still have enough grit and tension to it to keep you watching.  Some elements are better than others though  when the film focuses on Dave and his tough investigation it is great but when it tries to expand eg with Robin it just comes across as baggy.The film hasn't got massive action scenes but it does have some good chases and moments of thrills  most notably a roof top chase across New Orleans. These are fine but the film does too much talking in slow southern drawls for my liking  also making the film feel a lot longer than it probably was! The talking is fine but it does more than enough to set the tone and action  and then it keeps talking!  Combine this with the characters and you have a film that can't help but feel baggy and slightly disjointed.The one thread that holds it all together though is Baldwin.  He gives a great performance across the whole film dealing well with the various emotions that it throws at him.  Roberts is OK certainly better than some other rubbish I've seen him in.  Lynch is given little to do but look good in a bikini Masterson is not cast well and doesn't fit into the trashy stripper role Hatcher gets naked and looks good but her character is not dealt with that well by the script.  The support cast includes Hall and Guilfoyle but this is Baldwin's film and for it's other faults he carries it with him.  The direction is also good using some very good shots to up the tension and the pace of the film at key moments  if only the editor had been a bit more persistent though.Overall this is a tough noirish thriller that works well for the majority despite feeling bogged down by dialogue and characters at times.  If you can put up with the heavy Southern drawls and the icedtea clichs then it is worth a look.".

Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera our little filmgoing party of detectivefilm fans and Alec Baldwin groupies a.k.a. my mom my stepfather and me found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin who also served as coproducer brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans excoprecovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy toughguygal dialogue they're hampered by two things 1. The film's sloooow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone not just Baldwin. Of all the actors Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most so much that it began to remind me of the sweatingbullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 2. A plot that as rendered in the film whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor I can't be sure never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad because these elements could've made for an exciting movie drug dealing illegal alien smuggling rival crime bosses one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself essentially playing a Southernfried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl named Alafair by the Robichouxs after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time I liked the name Alafair so much I nearly changed my mind about naming my thenunborn daughter Siobhan! and a bevy of beautiful beguiling women including earth mother Kelly Lynch vampy Teri Hatcher in a fullfrontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time and Mary Stuart Masterson looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a changeofpace role for her a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses andor embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy dashing Alec Baldwin but he came up sweaty rumpled tired depressed and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up it would've been the sexiest picture of '96! To be fair there are a number of strong characterization and action scenes but there's just too darn much talky molassespaced lag time between them  and yet oddly some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou Baldwin  Co. could've dredged a tighter more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well read James Lee Burke's books instead.".

It's complicated FilmNoir plot has a recovering former alcoholic New Orleans policeman Dave Rebocheaux Alec Baldwin and his wife Annie Kelly Lynch adopting a little girl Alafair Samantha Laqpacan. Alafair survived a plane crash that was the result of a bomb hidden on it by the Bubba Rocque Eric Roberts mob who got wind that a DEA informant was on the plane smuggling illegal aliens into the US. The excop Dave gets involved with the Bubba Rocque mobs operations as well as with Bubba's hot and sexy wife Claudette Teri Hatcher even though Dave had no reason to since he was no longer in the New Orleans Police department. By him foolishly doing that Dave put his wife adopted daughter and himself in a whole lot of danger which in the end cost his wife's Annie's life. It also turns out that both Dave  Bubba are good friends going back to when they were both in high school.Dave to leave his quiet and peaceful little business selling fishbait in the Southern Louisiana Bayou country for the pressures and dangers of the big city wasn't that bright of an idea in the first place. The pressures of the city can easily drive him to drink which Dave has done his best to avoid.The local mob tries to knock off Dave but ends up killing his wife Annie which makes Dave even madder and more determined to get revenge. Dave tracks down and kills two of his wife's killers Toot  Romero Carl A. McGee  Milligan Hawthorne. The third killer is found electrocuted in his bathtub when someone from the Rocque mob I guess threw in a turned on radio to keep him from talking. Dave and the audience finds out in the end of the movie who's really behind together with the Mafia all this carnage. The ending leaves you cold and jaded because the movie was so long and confusing with so many blind alleys that you just lost interest in it by the time the big surprise was thrown on you. In fact the movie reviled the culprit long before it ended making the whole ending anticlimactic. Alec Baldwin as Dave Rebocheaux does his best to put some believability in his role as well as in the movie but he falls flat on his face since he had no reason at all to be so involved in what was happening on the screen. Dave was no longer a part of the police department and it was theirs and the DEA's job to solve the crimes in the film not his.Dave's actions put people that he loved and were close to him in jeopardy for no reason at all. The movie Heavens Prisoners would have been more effective if it stuck to one story like keeping the Mafia and Rocque mob from getting their hands on little Alafair who was the only survivor of the plane crash. Alafair may have known something about who was behind blasting the plane out of the sky as well as it smuggling drugs and illegal aliens into the US. That danger would have Dave and Annie protecting her and keeping the gangsters from killing or kidnapping her to keep her quite. Instead the film went off in some half dozen different directions and by doing that getting everybody in the audience lost following it.The one good thing that Alec Baldwin did in the film besides taking care of the bad guys and doing or having done in the person who was responsible for all the chaos including his wife's brutal murder was that he did his best not to take a drink in the movie even though there were one or two exceptions.".

Instead the film went off in some half dozen different directions and by doing that getting everybody in the audience lost following it.The one good thing that Alec Baldwin did in the film besides taking care of the bad guys and doing or having done in the person who was responsible for all the chaos including his wife's brutal murder was that he did his best not to take a drink in the movie even though there were one or two exceptions.";

We watch as our hero Alec Baldwin practically dehydrates in front of our eyes due to the high humidity in some scenes and immediately look as cool as a cucumber wearing the same shirt that has dried automatically.The action is all right but everything is predictable.

Being from New Orleans and also married to a Cajun from South Louisiana as well as an avid fan of Burke's I watched this movie with utmost scrutiny3 times. I was at first dubious about Alec Baldwin playing the part of a Southerner much less my beloved Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux aka streak.  After 2 viewings I concluded he had done a fine jobindeed.  The movie did well in doing the impossible which is to capture on film the lush tapestry that is South Louisiana  the bayous and New Orleans as captured in language by the unequaled master of description James Lee Burke. To have made an action movie out of it would have been to bastardized it and ruined it.  I feel for viewers who find a movie unsuitable because the body count hasn't mounted to 10 in the first 15 minutes or there isn't a burning car or an explosion every other frame.  Heaven's Prisoners was the first or one of the first in the Robicheaux series by Burke and provides expose' for future tales. Again the film captured the feel of Burke's seductive Louisiana Wetlands along with his character's  troubled alcoholic mind as he constantly is forced to come to terms with life's underbelly and ultimately himself.As an aside and correction to the member providing the plot outline Dave resides in New Iberia Louisiana a real town close to Lafayette not on the outskirts of New Orleans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dave Robicheaux played by Alec Baldwin is an ex cop who decides after one too many shootings on the force to open up a fishing tackle and bait shop on the Bayou with his wife Annie played by Kelly Lynch. While they are out on their boat they witness a single engine plane spiralling down from the sky barely missing their boat before it crashes in to the water. Robicheaux dives in to the water down to the planes cockpit where he sees a small child trying to survive in an air pocket amongst a few dead people. With his air supply quickly diminishing in his scuba gear he rescues the child from a near death experience and with his wife Annie in agreement they agree to raise the young girl as their own even though she does not speak a word of English.A Detective Minos Dautrieve played by Vondie CurtisHall drops by the bait shop inquiring in to how many passengers Robicheaux witnessed on the sunken plane when it initially submerged in the water and he tells Robicheaux to forget about the big guy with the whale tattoo who floated to the waters surface. This gets Robichaux's curiosity up and he starts making inquiries that a few local criminals want him to stop inquiring about. One of these criminals is a guy named Bubba Rocque played very well by Eric Roberts who answers to some bosses higher up the criminal food chain. Bubba's wife Claudette played by Teri Hatcher is a bit of a tramp who likes to sip cocktails most of the day and chase men.Eventually threats don't stop Robicheaux's inquiries and since he won't let up with his investigation the mobsters decide to lay a beating on him to firmly tell him to stop his inquiries. Further threats are made and fulfilled as Robicheaux continues with his investigation with the quasi assistance of mobster Bubba's wife.The movie does run a bit long at around 132 minutes but I did not find the movies length composed with any filler time. There were twists and turns throughout the bayou scenes were quite expansive and the acting was above par. Mary Stuart Masterson plays a stripper named Robin Gaddis who has a unique relationship with Alec Baldwin's character Dave Robicheaux which strengthens throughout the film. This is a good film for couples to watch together as it contains romance heroism action and suspense. Well worth the watch and 132 minutes well spent!".

	schema:reviewBody "Tommy Lee Jones has either read Burke's books or he is really that good. Unlike Alec Baldwin's Robicheaux in Heaven's Prisoners Jones has the complex nature of Robicheaux's personality down. Jones can deliver on the character's contrasting moods  the sensitivity of his care for others versus the fire of his smoldering anger. Good flick. No stupid CGI tricks no political correctness just a good old fashioned crime mystery with a very riveting main character. There are some unresolved elements regarding the Goodman and Beatty parts but the dogged pursuit of the criminal element by Jones is worth the price of admission. I've read all of Burke's books and this is as close as anyone is going to get to myriad aspects of Dave Robicheaux's tortured soul. Burke fans disappointed by Heaven's Prisoners should see this one.".

She really nails this part.The story is about a Cajun cop who is haunted by his own demons and by the demons he faces in his work as an Iberia Parish Deputy. The characters he meets in trying to solve the murders are so true to life that you wonder if the people playing the parts were really actors. John Goodman is great as usual as is Ned Beatty.While a good old fashion murder mystery awaits you what is more important as it is in the novels by James Lee Burke is the story of Robicheaux. He is a man who has a strong moral code yet is violent alcoholic and continually puts his family in danger. The complexity of his character is difficult to portray but TLJ does it better than anyone else could.It is a fine beautiful movie. Now if only another movie could be made that also includes Clete Purcell one of the best sidekicks ever written in a mystery novel series.".

So the twin questions are ... who is responsible for the murders of the prostitutes and is there a link between these murders and the longago killing of the Black man?Set in modern day South Louisiana near New Orleans In The Electric Mist absolutely drips with authentic Cajun atmosphere. The place names the rustic look of old frame houses the backwater bayous with lush vegetation those wonderful Louisiana accents the outdoor barbecue at a plantation house ... You feel like you're really there in that place. It's the best element of the film by far.The film's casting and acting are quite good. And the music is terrific. At the end credits the song played is the haunting La Terre Tremblante with its mysticalBlues sound and French lyrics. The song is straight out of Cajun country and it is mesmerizing.Unfortunately the film's plot is muddled. Editing is terrible. And the film's ending is very unsatisfying. My understanding is that the film went through some serious postproduction issues the most significant being the deletion of a number of scenes. These deletions may account for plot problems associated with choppy flow and lack of clarity.Even so In The Electric Mist is still worth watching not so much for the story or plot as for the evocative Cajun atmosphere and that terrific music.".

The script was so adept that they handled the issues of race relations in what I considered a realistic manner without any preaching. The settings whether swamps at night Southern mansions broken down shacks or merely country scenery all seemed highly realistic. The editing was excellent. Thus the timing of most scenes was just right so there wasn't the problem of boredom.The only reason I gave the movie an 8 rather than a 10 is that it suffered from too much mumbled dialogue so you have to be willing to live with about 25 of dialogue shooting past you unless perhaps you are from Loozyana and perhaps missing some of the relationships between people early on. However while this meant that you might miss out on some of the subtleties the story is not that fast moving and complex that it warrants bypassing the movie given all its virtues.".

The crime action itself serves more to buffet the lead character on his internal journey than to create an actionheavy thrillride.In the Electric Mist is rich in atmosphere and that is perhaps its strongest point. All aspects of the filmmaking process come together to drive home the feeling of the Lousiana bayou from the detailed sets to the slow pace to the contrast between the simmering intensity of the true Louisiana folks with the outlandish extroversion of the outsiders and the locals who have been won over by Hollywood culture. It is a movie best experienced with your full attention.There is a strong sense of suspense in the film but it is delivered through tragedy and the search for resolution not high action. While Tommy Lee Jones delivers the sort of performance one might expect and there are certainly plenty of thriller mainstay elements this is not an action piece an in intrigue or a intricate mystery. If you cannot get invested in the tension of a complicated shadesofgrey lead character and his search for answers to questions that may not e fully expressed the suspense will likely escape you and you will be left with a slow movie with an unsurprising plot. And if you cannot get absorbed into the play of contrasts and dialectics within the fabric of the rural Louisiana cultural fabric you probably find the message trite the ending too neat and some of the performances e.g. John Goodman as Baby Feet Balboni as overthetop and distracting. But if you can allow yourself to experience the film through Jones' Robicheaux you will find yourself sharing his internal conflict delighting in bright spots of energy like Alana Locke's Alafair and clinging to a misty hope for resolution.".

The writing is good and I don't get why people think the story is confusing. But there is one major flaw for me that rankles. Why cast musicians Levon Helm Buddy Guy in roles that really need strong acting? Helm was a great drummer for The Band but I've never seen him act with much conviction. And the character of the dead Confederate general requires strength. Hal Holbrook would have been perfect. Then there's Buddy Guy a great Chicago blues man but he's no actor. He seemed almost to be reading most of his lines from off camera in one scene. You cannot put strong actors in the same scenes with weak ones. But good actors together can make a scenewitness the last confrontation between Tommy Lee's Robicheaux and Ned Beatty's Lemoyne.So solid direction much strong acting faithful to the book great sets and setting all brought lower by some bad casting.

John Goodman is another who always delivers a solid performance and they both give us a great show. The writing of the script is solid and the setting of the film is provoking. The entire film works well with support from veteran character actors like Ned Beatty craggy faced James Gammon and exdrummer Levon Helm as well as younger performers like Mary Steenburgen Justina MachadoKelly Macdonald and the up and coming Peter Sargaard.One might argue that this kind of a role is almost type casting for Tommy Lee Jones but I would argue otherwise. An actor works with what he has and TLJ has always been able to use his face to great advantage from a stonecold glare to a sheepish grin.

	onyx:emotionText "I can count on my fingers with half my hand cut away the number of times I've ever been disappointed by Tommy Lee Jones's performance in a film. This film here is no exception. John Goodman is another who always delivers a solid performance and they both give us a great show. The writing of the script is solid and the setting of the film is provoking. The entire film works well with support from veteran character actors like Ned Beatty craggy faced James Gammon and exdrummer Levon Helm as well as younger performers like Mary Steenburgen Justina MachadoKelly Macdonald and the up and coming Peter Sargaard.One might argue that this kind of a role is almost type casting for Tommy Lee Jones but I would argue otherwise. An actor works with what he has and TLJ has always been able to use his face to great advantage from a stonecold glare to a sheepish grin.

All were pleasantries in a world of crap films that abound. BUT and here is the kicker... what just happened in the last 2 hours? At every turn the story is dished out like patchy comic book with no flow to the plot. Though i loved the tempo of the shots there was no meat on these bones... and other than tommy lee and the daughter no other characters except the cop with the mosquitobat joke left anything for us to hold on to or want to see more of. Plot wise i felt tossed from one awkward portrayal of some event or person to the next each scene consistently lacking something important. Just as some French flicks can end leaving you hanging like an abrupt slice of life does this film felt like that the whole way through but not at the end! In some ways it flowed like Jules and Jim and i can't put my finger on why i draw this distant similarity. But in the Electric Mist the question what's the point? was a recurring theme for me in the details and dialogs. Even though i felt kidnapped and tossed in the back of a van for a lot the film being lost just really didn't matter because we are spoon fed the stepbystep details of the choppy simple plot which left me feeling like all the details and the plot superfluously and inanely added up to very little by the end. You see you ultimately get to the end and i got there with a lingering huh?. Again don't watch this for the plot or the attempt at mystery there is neither. Don't expect the thriller or action it tries to be or even to be engaged by any deep social commentary it fell short on all these too. Watch it to get out of the rut and repetition of Hollywood and into some beautiful bayou through some French eyes with the ever enjoyable Tommy Lee as captivating guide who pulls off some good small town tough sheriff moments.".

Well he won the National Board of Review USA and the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Screen Guild Actors Award but no Oscar even though he was nominated.This is a story that will keep you mesmerized if you watch it uncensored and uncut. If your only option is cable other than TCM or Sundance skip it and find a video but it'd worth seeking out.If you find it uncut it will bring you into the bayou culture for a couple of hours and really make you care about what happens to these characters.Most of the cable channels slash it too much too even follow it.

	schema:reviewBody "First there's a mess of bone and gristle wrapped in a chain and uncovered in a Louisiana bayou by Katrina. It's what's left of a black man who was shot down 40 years ago. Maybe he'd been messin' around with a white woman. There's Cherry LeBlanc a beautiful young girl on the game sellin' her jellyroll. She'd been cut and eviscerated. There's the dead girl they found stuffed in a barrel a few weeks ago who now has blue crabs crawling all over her. The coroner will only be able to get her out of that barrel in pieces. And there's Dave Robicheaux a cop in New Iberia an alcoholic who hasn't yet fallen off the wagon a Viet Nam vet a tough man saddled with a conscience and a sense of morality who sometimes does righteous and violent things. In the ancient world Dave tells us people placed heavy stones on the graves of their dead so their souls would not wander and afflict the living. I always thought this was just the practice of superstitious and primitive people. But I was about to learn that the dead can hover on the edge of our vision with the density and luminosity of mist...and their claim on the earth can be as legitimate and tenacious as our own. Don't let anyone tell you that In the Electric Mist isn't a very good movie especially if you're fond of James Lee Burke's series of books featuring Robicheaux and the Cajun country of southern Louisiana. Dave Tommy Lee Jones is going to find himself searching for a serial killer who needs to cut prostitutes and he's tormented by what was uncovered in that bayou. When Dave was a little boy he saw the shooting but not who did it. Forty years later he's going to find out who did it and why. Bertrand Tavernier the director is going to take us on a journey into bayou Louisiana centered around New Iberia parish where the conditions of life haven't changed much for a lot of people. Along the way we're going to meet all kinds of characters and this is one of the movie's strengths. Dave may have a good marriage to a strong woman Mary Steenburgen but there's also that childhood friend who now is the sociopath Julie Baby Feet' Balboni played with great vicious style by John Goodman. Feets is back in New Iberia because he's backing a movie being filmed nearby. There are aging good ol' boys and blacks who respect Dave but know when to be cautious. There's his daughter Alafair and even a couple of movie stars Elrod Sykes Peter Sarsgard and Kelly Drummond Kelly Macdonald. There are bayous thick with mosquitoes and trees heavy with moss. The dialogue is pungent and sounds natural. There's even Confederate General John Bell Hood who Dave finds himself talking to now and then. For most of the time In the Electric Mist is a moody sometimes vivid occasionally violent story that has more to do with characters and relationships than murders. This is Tommy Lee Jones' movie. He's in almost every scene. He provides the occasional narrative. His introspective discussions with Hood give us insights to his conflicts which some of us may or not feel adds to the story. With all the good things about the movie though there are three significant weaknesses. First Jones is too old for the part. He can play tired seenitall types better than most but he's noticeably older than almost everyone else in the movie. Second I'm one of those who could easily do without in the movie as well as in the book the Confederate specters providing an excuse for Dave's angst and Hood as an excuse for insights into Dave's soul. For me this is a just a literary device that comes off as unneeded and awkward. Third the movie attempts to bring the conclusion together too quickly. The knots get tied but we have no time to satisfactorily understand a couple of the story threads or to savor the conclusion of a movie whose style and characters gave so much pleasure. Well we can't always get everything we want. What we do get is darn good. The background to the movie however might scare us off. Evidently Tavernier and Jones did not see eye to eye as the movie was being filmed. The American producer took Tavernier's cut chopped off 15 minutes and released the movie direct to DVD in the United States. The movie was released to theaters worldwide elsewhere with Tavernier's 117 minute cut. I've heard one or two critics say that the U.S. DVD release is hard to follow. No it isn't. There is only one part of the story where some useful motivation was evidently hacked up. I'd certainly like to see Tavernier's version. Just stay alert and you'll have few problems. Bernard Tavernier is one of the best directors around. To get a glimpse of his style and variety try Coup du Torchon 1981 a supremely mordant and cynical black comedy D'Artagnan's Daughter 1994 a flashy costume adventure and Life and Nothing But 1989 a sad and thoughtful film. Tavernier often used Philippe Noiret in his films it was a great partnership. We'll let Dave have the last word after he's solved the crimes and confronted one of perpetrators. Have you no mercy sir? asks the aging man. No sir Dave says. No sir I don't.".

To get a glimpse of his style and variety try Coup du Torchon 1981 a supremely mordant and cynical black comedy D'Artagnan's Daughter 1994 a flashy costume adventure and Life and Nothing But 1989 a sad and thoughtful film. Tavernier often used Philippe Noiret in his films it was a great partnership. We'll let Dave have the last word after he's solved the crimes and confronted one of perpetrators. Have you no mercy sir? asks the aging man. No sir Dave says. No sir I don't.";

The director is Bertrand Tavernier and I was familiar with some of his previous work in French cinema. I actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies. The cast Tommy Lee Jones John Goodman Peter Sarsgard Mary Steenburgen... I was looking forward to see all this talent on screen. I wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and I hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but I was told that it was an investigation movie set in the Deep South we've seen a lot of those in the past maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others...2 hours later the end titles appear THANK GOD IT WAS OVER!!!!  The plot is beyond comprehension. If you've read the book you have a significant advantage. There were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs. We didn't understand a thing!  The accents. My God! Tommy Lee Jones' accent is decent but I still have nightmares from Mary Steenburgen's CajunFrench singing...  Poor casting in my opinion. I can't believe old man Tommy Lee Jones can beat the crap out of a linebackerbuilt goon... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman.  Who were these people?!? We barely understand who all these characters are and what they do. There's a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Blrg!  The comedic attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably its action and suspense scenes. They were horrible. No thrills. Bad acting Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?...  And then there's the scifi stuff. No spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird.I usually don't write any comments on IMDb but I thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion.

	schema:headline " A pleasantly surprising neonoir";
	schema:reviewBody "IN THE ELECTRIC MIST is a nearperfect neonoir anchored by a solid yet restrained performance by Tommy Lee Jones. Ever since I heard about this I wanted to see it and boy was I surprised. It exceeded my expectations greatly. The story put simply is about a New Orleans detective Dave Robicheaux Jones who is investigating the murder of a prostitute and also looking into the 40yearold murder of a black man who was recently found in a swamp. Along the way he ends up getting into situations that drag him further into Louisana's deep dark secrets and past uncovers some things that other people would rather forget and has some surreal encounters with a Confederate general. That last bit really caught me offguard and also calls into the question the mental state of Robicheaux who also serves as the film's narrator. I really liked the way that the filmmakers play around with the concept of reality in this movie because it adds some depth to a fairly standard story and it also works in the thematic context of the story itself. There were also some great supporting performances given by John Goodman as a crime boss who is also investing in a movie being shot there Peter Sarsgaard as actor in that movie as well as Mary Steenburgen Robicheaux's wife Kelly MacDonald Buddy Guy and Levon Helm. Each of these actors has moments in the film where they can show off their acting ability and not a moment is wasted with them. Also of note is the stunning soundtrack which is full of great blues tunes and native Cajun folk songs which really bring out and accentuate the Louisiana culture on display. The score also helps to establish and maintain the palpable dramatic tension as well as give some shades of melancholy which are also personified in Jones' weathered detective character. If there was one fault I could find with the movie it's a third act twist which is a bit predictable and clich but fortunately it's resolved rather quickly. Overall the real draw is the strong central performance by Tommy Lee Jones who does a great job of portraying a seasoned hardboiled detective with some flaws but a good sense of right and wrong. I also especially liked the idea of transplanting the hardboiled detective story into postKatrina New Orleans. Highly recommended viewing.".

This is in my opinion the case with 'In the Electric Mist' which is totally unknown to most of the cinema fans because it seems to not having been released in cinema theaters in the US. This is a very hard to understand decision as this is a much better than the average detective movies better than many other similar films released around that date it's well acted beautifully filmed directed by a wellknown French director Bertrand Tavernier and with supreme star Tommy Lee Jones as lead actor. What do I know about the art of film distribution though? Probably not too much.The story is set in the swamps of Louisiana and features detective David Robicheaux which some may remember as having been played by Alec Baldwin in Heaven's Prisoner more than a decade before this film was made the character is inspired by the same series of novels. The atmosphere of the Cajun country with its fogs and smells legends and collection of unique characters makes for a good background for mysteries and hidden secrets and Tavernier makes a good use of it in a way that predicts Beasts of the Southern Wild. Nobody is surprised when generals and soldiers from the Civil War fought more than a century before show up from behind the fogs and the phantoms of the older conflicts of race and class mix with the personal daemons the heroes have to face.Watching Tommy Lee Jones playing the justicedriven detective although his means are not always really orthodox is always a pleasure and to a large extent the film relies on him. He is helped by an excellent supporting cast with John Goodman featuring as one of the lead bad guys and Mary Steenburgen as the classy wife of Robicheaux. While the script does not really close perfectly every corner of the story there is cursive story telling in the style of the big detective American novels of the 40s and the heroes have the same naive faith that the good cause of justice is worth risking everything to have it prevail. Bertrand Tavernier has filmed with European lens a very American story in a very American landscape and despite the relative lowkey ending maybe the weak part of the movie it's a good film to look for and watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember that movie In The Valley of Elah? It was the movie that Tommy Lee Jones starred in before this one. Yeah this is exactly the same movie. I've been a huge fan of Jones ever since he first came to my attention in Under Siege but come on man time to branch out a little bit you know? On the other hand In The Valley of Elah which is just as disappointing as In the Electric Mist but doesn't have nearly as bizarre a title was released the same year that Jones appeared in No Country For Old Men so I guess the man deserves some credit. But I'm still getting over The Missing and The Hunted. Yawn!This time Jones plays Dave Robicheaux an alcoholic who is a regular at the bars where he orders drinks that he never drinks. He's a detective in the deep south and one day he spots an Italian sports car speeding through the sleepy streets of their town. When he pulls it over he finds it's being driven by Elrod Sykes Peter Saarsgard a local boy who has become a movie star but is now drag racing through his town drunk out of his mind. Dave sidesteps the expected bribes and goes to run him in like he should but changes his mind when Sykes tells him he knows where a dead body is.Before you go thinking about Stand By Me the most famous I know where there's a dead body movie ever made this one goes in a completely different direction. The body is the result of a decadesold hate crime where a bunch of racists had chained a black man and then shot him while he ran through the swamps for his life. Dave a 17yearold boy at the time actually witnessed the crime from across the swamp but never figured out who the killers were. Now the location of the body has been revealed and it has become his life's mission to bring the killers to justice. Complicating the movie more than necessary is a simultaneous investigation that Dave is running about the murder of a blonde prostitute and worst of all some truly bizarre runins with the Civil War generals out in the woods. There is suggestion that it is just a local group of dedicated fanatics in the middle of a Civil War reenactment but at times it seems more like an LSD flashback than anything else. Ultimately the movie is nothing but a tedious wait to see some racist dirtbags get what they deserve for a vicious hate crime that happened decades earlier. There is a brief approach of the difficult subject of forgiving someone for a past crime when they have made genuine change although the change portrayed in the movie is not genuine so the idea is dropped pretty quick. There is always a feeling that the movie is about to take off but it just never does and when the end credits start to roll there's a distinct feeling that you may have just wasted a bunch of time. I should mention that the movie is based on a book called In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead which I haven't read and I understand that some fans of the book are pretty impressed with the film adaptation so there may be something more to be said about the movie than I give it credit for here. But as an unprepared moviegoer there definitely seems to be something missing here. None of the performances are disappointing and the location where the movie was shot is undeniably beautiful but it just seemed to me that nothing materialized along the way".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of you have probably never heard of Tavernier which is a shame as he has at least two masterpieces under his belt. The American DVD release is not only cut by 15 minutes it is also drastically different in structure and tone. Think Leone's American cut of Once Upon a time In America. You didn't like that did you? Well to be honest neither of the films are perfect but the American DVD is UNWATCHABLE. At least the director's cut is the way Tavernier preferred and actually a middling thriller that is worthy of giving a spin. Gone is the made for TV pacing and ludicrous ending and while it's not his best work it will probably entertain you enough.The acting is serviceable in both versions but the lack of a back story and thus motivation makes some of the character actions seem out of place and silly. I happen to like Heaven's Prisoners a lot more than anyone has any right to and I think Tommy Lee Jones is a very good replacement for Baldwin. Gone is the optimistic charm of old Dave hello new Dave that is bitter by what life has shown him. But a lot of that is lost in the American DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally another Streak movie! I have been waiting for another since Heaven Prisoners and wasn't disappointed after watching it. While Baldwin played a good role TLJ enhanced the character with a little more of his rugged personality as displayed in the books. The story was well done for a 2 hr movie but unfortunately jumped very abruptly in some scenes leaving people who are unfamiliar with the story trying to figure out just what had happened. The acting by everyone was done well. A little more of the General and Elrod would have filled in some blank spaces. A slight history of how Dave and Bootsie met and finally married also would have added to the movie. I like the addition of Dave explaining to the viewers a little history of the past and his opinions just like JLB does in his books. Definitely recommended to all and if you have to watch it a second time to appreciate the story. Hoping for another movie this time with Clete. I would think that the next one would have to follow some kind of timeline as things move forward in the History of Robicheaux.".

There are some brutal kills e.g. people exploding with meat all over and some fun fights e.g. strip club.

Debutante director Scott Mann did a terrific job considering the budget. The action is non stop. There are shootouts gun play bloodbaths in unlikely venues severed limbs exploding bodies caused by boobytrapped tracking devices plenty of explosions car chases kicking punching heads exploding off like melons severed limbs wild stunts a bustruck chase nudity and gore. Its really a ucking shame that this film didn't got the recognition it deserves. The star cast is decent the hot n attractive Kelly Hu her sex scene from Farmhouse man Ving Rhames Robert Carlyle Liam Cunningham Scott Adkins n Sebastian Foucon the guy from Casino royal.

The surprise aha is that through a plot twist a drunken priest played by Robert Carlyle becomes an unwilling participant. Ving Rhames Kelly Hu and that dueshbag from LOST round out the character actors. A movie like this for me needs two things  badass characters  and I mean MAKE THEM BADASS! Have a guy who uses snakes as weapons and has an eyepatch and uses a boomerang! Have a girl who has poisons and throwing stars and who killed her whole family when she was 3 years old  I want some bloody history goddammit. Have assassins who get their arms pulled off and still keep killing. What we get here is a stupid video game sequence for each of the top 5 assassins THE TEXAN THE FRENCHMAN THE Asian CHICK etc kicking and punching a bit before freezing for the camera. This is not the way to go. Show them in their environment. SHOW us don't just tell us how badass they are. The movie has a stupid subplot where Ving Rhames's wife has been killed and hes there for revenge blah blah blah these movies tend to get all cocked up when they try to make an emotional plot work and this one is no exception. I feel like having this tournament plus a bystander who's a priest who then becomes one of the players is more than enough plot for an action movie the rest can be just watching the carnage unfold and if the characters are interesting and the action scenes are creative that's all it really needs. This movie tries to straddle both and ends up having mediocre characters having mediocre fight scenes the two fight scenes with the FRENCHMAN were the exceptions mostly because I'm a sucker for that parkour jumping around stuff.One last thing  movies like this need to understand the idea of contrasting elements. Contrast these deadly killers against a very normal town! Show them getting coffee at starbucks fighting in a walmart contrast crazy with normal. Instead the towns people seem to barely exist the cops are nowhere you never get that moment where a kid looks at a bleeding murderer from behind a box of paper towels and the killer goes hey there buddy before blowing away a crazy monkey fighter who leaps over the tootsie roll display. This place is the town equivalent of an empty warehouse.People are comparing it to death race but I actually liked that better because it embraced it's stupidity and didn't try to have that emotional subplot. The Tournament is really a movie best enjoyed after at least four beers and even then you might find yourself nodding off near the end.".

Actually I expected it to be a pleasant DTV title with a couple of cool actors.What I got instead was a thrilling actioner that surpasses most of the theatrical releases of the same genre. The action is hyperkinetic and violent and Scott Mann has undisputed Hollywood potential.The plot about the assassin tournament is clean and simple a lot like Taken and when it comes to comparison between these two films only advantage for Taken is Liam Neeson. The Tournament provides solid acting but it doen't have such a potent star. Actually if we consider its budget The Tournament is really outstanding in terms of casting because it combines available theatricalfeature actors like Kelly Hu Liam Cunningham Robert Carlyle and Ving Rhames with top DTV names like Scott Adkins. Scott Adkins' potential was obvious ever since he first appeared in Isaac Florentine films and in the Tournament he is accompanied by Sebastien Foucan the parkourist we remember from Casino Royale.Fight scenes are marvelously staged with great fight choreography but also outstanding gunplay and vehicle stunts. When it comes to the sheer amount of action The Tournament gives you the most for bang for the buck. It is very hard to invent some new kinds of action setpieces and choreographies but in a couple of scenes Rhe Tournament does that.Also you must bear in mind that action is very violent and gory. The sheer amount of gore is comparable to Neill Blomkamp's District 9. Bloodletting is stylish and lavish and Scott Mann really has the guts quite literally to pull it off.I am surprised that this film failed to get theatrical release. I mean it's quite obvious that American distributors wouldn't release because none of the stars are a draw in the US but I guess it should've worked quite well internationally.Writer Gary Young was lucky to move on into theatrical business with Matthew Vaughn production Harry Brown. I hope Scott Mann will accomplish the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is one glorious thing about making movies going in to the second decade of the millennium it's that someone can have a successful movie and a pretty good movie that does not have to have a theater run to gain an audience or make money. There has been plethora of direct to DVD or direct to OnDemand releases that are just as good or better or better in a different way than a lot of wide release movies. Usually the biggest difference between the two are marketability. The main consideration for marketability is the star power of the cast or the filmmakers.Ving Rhames one of the stars in the ensemble cast of The Tournament is probably the most marketable name associated with the movie. Most people still remember him as Marcellus Wallace from Pulp Fiction so that right there gives a clue as to the marketability of the Tournament. That's OK. The Tournament should live on in DVD rentals and sales for years to come.The Tournament is ridiculous in its attempt at scripting and plot. The concept and continuity is as undeveloped as a Jason Statham franchise. But the action. Oh my the action is dialed to the extreme.The plot is that every seven years the best assassins from all over the word are gathered together in a small town to go at each other in a free ranging field of play until there is one man or woman left standing. This year the action takes place in Middlesborough a small town in the UK. The advantage of this small town is that it has more closed circuit cameras than any place else in the world. Therefore a team of hackers led by a dude that looks like my friend Spike of the famous podcast The Paul  Spike Show can somehow gain control of all of these cameras and bring live feeds of the action to a room full of billionaires from all over the world that are placing bets on the contestants. The group is hosted by Powers Liam Cunningham who channels the most campy essence of Richard Dawson from The Running Man .Included assassins are Joshua Harlow Rhames the defending champ who is only back to settle a score Lai Lai Zhen Kelly Hu a killer with a conscience Miles Slater Ian Somerhalder a crazy killer from Texas and the alcoholic Father Joseph Macavoy Robert Carlyle who through a devious tactic by another assassin gets pulled into the game against his will.What develops is a farcical stretch of anyone's credulity but the action is so fun and violence so overthetop that a fan of the action genre cannot help but to enjoy the show. The gore level of the violence is nearly on par with Stallone's Rambo and the physical stunts many actually done by this fun cast are the high flying craziness of District 13style.The finale comes as a bit of a surprise in that it revisits a style similar to action movies of the 80s and 90s. The satisfaction level of the ending is very high.The Tournament is a blast for action fans. The movie is simple with only a hint of a plot that's only purpose is to set up action sequence on top of action sequence. If one starts to deconstruct the plot too much it is revealed for the silly and contrived object of convenience that it is. So don't. Pop the flick in grab a pizza and a craft beer and enjoy the show.".

	onyx:emotionText "If there is one glorious thing about making movies going in to the second decade of the millennium it's that someone can have a successful movie and a pretty good movie that does not have to have a theater run to gain an audience or make money. There has been plethora of direct to DVD or direct to OnDemand releases that are just as good or better or better in a different way than a lot of wide release movies. Usually the biggest difference between the two are marketability. The main consideration for marketability is the star power of the cast or the filmmakers.Ving Rhames one of the stars in the ensemble cast of The Tournament is probably the most marketable name associated with the movie. Most people still remember him as Marcellus Wallace from Pulp Fiction so that right there gives a clue as to the marketability of the Tournament. That's OK. The Tournament should live on in DVD rentals and sales for years to come.The Tournament is ridiculous in its attempt at scripting and plot. The concept and continuity is as undeveloped as a Jason Statham franchise. But the action. Oh my the action is dialed to the extreme.The plot is that every seven years the best assassins from all over the word are gathered together in a small town to go at each other in a free ranging field of play until there is one man or woman left standing.

Perhaps not for those with a weak stomach but certainly for those who wants 90 minutes of pure action and entertainment without effort.I thought it was soso the theme became too repetitive the movie too simpleminded. The risk with a movie with constant action is that when the pace never changes also a high pace can become boring. In my mind it does this time it is the change of pace that thrills and this have none of it.Also many of the characters and actors are handled wrong. Vhing Rhames' character Joshua Harlow could have been the heroic veteran the avenger but the glory he could have vanishes as he is acting out as enemy instead. Robert Carlyle is a very competent actor that is given an annoyingly weak character albeit intended but totally misplaced in an action movie. This is a movie that should emphasize heroics skill and glory not crying and weeping and being pretty useless. Yes that is probably the most realistic turn of events but this movie should have nothing to do with realism.That the plot is utterly predictable and full of small and big goofs and plot holes mostly concerning the camera surveillance and tracking system doesn't help either.

Much of the production crew is also Bulgarian which I imagine helps create jobs in the small Balkan country. Besides this trivia I gave the flick 3 because it joins the adamant insistence of people in the moviemaking business that action films will please the audience only if they are gory unnecessarily gory and add more gore on top of that.Language. The Famous and Fabulous F word is well exploited to beef up the dialog. Nothing new. Also I wonder when are they going to start using the name of Buddha as a curse word in those Hollywood and quasiHollywood productions!? No surprises in this respect too.If the script was not so blandly predictable and setting us up for the gore experience I could have given the film a 5 star rating. The chases are well filmed the acting is reasonably good and there is a level of surprise in the ending. Surprise that is if you did not pay attention during the movie. The blowing up of humans and the rest of the violence actually take away from enjoying the fast pace of the film if flying body parts are not in your taste for action entertainment. Not surprisingly character development is also imperfect shall we say? The Lai Lai Zhen character represents the ever present noble chick turned bad because bad people made her do it. She is one of the top assassins and believe it or not ends up having a heart of gold  inappropriate take compared with the rest of the intentions of the moviemakers and the tone of the movie. Joshua Harlow Ving Rhames the 1 world assassin also has a soft tender heart. When he is not murdering blowing up and hacking people he is a family man. The attempt at drama within and after the massive massacre was absolutely corny. They should have stuck with the senseless killings. Stay with what you're good at.".

The attempt at drama within and after the massive massacre was absolutely corny. They should have stuck with the senseless killings. Stay with what you're good at.";

It's like watching a stream of Facebook threads links and comments fly past for 90 minutes. Intercut with whoops and heavy basslines. It doesn't feel like a music video. It is a music video. And about as satisfying.It's made in the image of John Hughes films updated for the Ritalin generation but it moves too fast. I found myself wanting to say 'How about that scene where ...

	schema:reviewBody "I walked into this film thinking this film is going to be a ripoff and be a stupid predictable party movie. Though some things were obviously predictable but isn't all comedies predictable.Though critics have rated this film horribly I think they are wrong you have to look at this film for what it is supposed to represent. Mostly 1525 year olds appreciate the film. But some people have to understand not every film is made for everyone and not every film has to be Oscar material.As for the movie itself I loved it it was a different way of showing partying in a movie. The film has some type of feel to it like when you finish it you feel you were at the party. Some people may complain about the sex drugs nudity etc in the film but one thing that made this film unique is the power of them 'going there' like going way over the top making the craziest things happen in it.If you basically do not have a sense of humor I do not recommend this film but if you have some fun in you and understand what it is like to be a teenager in this generation you will like it. Also I know some people say the film is not realistic in ways but it is one of the best movies to show how teenagers party there are teens that have partied like this but without the over the top ending it is very realistic.The found footage idea for this film is what made it better a new concept and it is finally being used for a comedy an excellent job. Though I hope this film becomes a hit because I feel it is highly underrated it is no different from the 80's90's party movies the only difference is 'Project X' shows everything that happens at parties.You can say the fans of the film are immature but the film is worth seeing. Also it is nothing like 'The Hangover' nor 'Superbad'. Though the film is funnier and more over the top than the hangover. This film is just another classic that was supposed to happen but won't it has too many mad reviews.I give this movie a 910 a perfect comedy and a good way to show what happens at parties. Interesting to see what happens through out the movie it is very intense so you will be blown away at a lot of scenes. May contain lots of nudity and outrageous behavior but at least the film had the balls to make it right. Please see the film first before you hate a lot of you are missing out.".

Some people may complain about the sex drugs nudity etc in the film but one thing that made this film unique is the power of them 'going there' like going way over the top making the craziest things happen in it.If you basically do not have a sense of humor I do not recommend this film but if you have some fun in you and understand what it is like to be a teenager in this generation you will like it. Also I know some people say the film is not realistic in ways but it is one of the best movies to show how teenagers party there are teens that have partied like this but without the over the top ending it is very realistic.The found footage idea for this film is what made it better a new concept and it is finally being used for a comedy an excellent job. Though I hope this film becomes a hit because I feel it is highly underrated it is no different from the 80's90's party movies the only difference is 'Project X' shows everything that happens at parties.You can say the fans of the film are immature but the film is worth seeing. Also it is nothing like 'The Hangover' nor 'Superbad'. Though the film is funnier and more over the top than the hangover. This film is just another classic that was supposed to happen but won't it has too many mad reviews.I give this movie a 910 a perfect comedy and a good way to show what happens at parties. Interesting to see what happens through out the movie it is very intense so you will be blown away at a lot of scenes. May contain lots of nudity and outrageous behavior but at least the film had the balls to make it right. Please see the film first before you hate a lot of you are missing out.";

	schema:reviewBody "like many have said before me if you are going into this movie expecting some potential Oscar material you will be sadly disappointed. The best way to approach this movie is to not expect anything at all but a bit of over the top entertainment provided by an out of control high school party. If you are too old to remember the days when you were in high school and attended a party that seemed to get a little bit crazy I would not watch this movie. I think you need to have had some kind of crazy party experience in the past in order to take that event in your mind and multiply it by 100 times. But you won't HAVE to create that scenario in your head because that is exactly what project X does for you. There really is not much of a story. But that being said there are some theatrical elements that will set up for scenes later in the movie. So in that respect there is a sort of a story line and a decent attempt at unfolding events. The characters aren't THAT bad. There is some character establishment although they may not be entirely likable. While they do establish the characters there is not much development. Right from the beginning of the movie you get a good sense of the characters and that is what you can expect the whole movie. I didn't think the secondary characters are too horrible either. The 12 year old security guards an angry midget and the angry drug dealer all create for some great mind numbing entertainment. Basically if you are over the age of 35 MAX depending how young hearted you are. Or if you can't recall a crazy high school or college party experience to relate to I would not recommend this movie. People are going to talk trash on this movie because they were expecting something more upon going to see this. DON'T! Some people ask a lot out of movies. They need plot twists and turns surprises and thrills. This movie does contain some of that but in a dumbed down mind numbing fashion. So don't expect anything other than some wild overthetop epic party experience of the century and you should be OK.".

There is a good balance of dialogue montages of general party mayhem and Thomas completely stressing out and the films great for watching with a few of the lads.The three of us who watched it were laughing consistently throughout the film and many of the characters were very relatable.

The movie is based on the real life story about a boy named Corey Delaney who threw a huge party that involved the whole street. The movie has worried several people due to the fact that teenagers are represented in a very negative way. Reports of imitations of the Project X party have also been in the news. I think everyone is overreacting personally but that's just me. This movie is so much fun and as much as it makes me want to go to a party I would never act so ridiculously as portrayed in Project X. The movie can be compared to American Pie Super bad etc with it's really American humour and classic story line. It features filthy comedy naked teens scenes of drug use and alcohol consumption and is a nonstop thrill ride. It will leave you gritting your teeth and covering your eyes due to it's absurd stunts and the cringeworthy events in it. It has a great soundtrack that makes you wanna get up and dance too! However the reason why I haven't rated it a ten is because towards the end it becomes a bit TOO dramatic and silly. But overall it's fun sexy funny pulse racing  definitely memorable. Just like in Super bad you emphasize with each character and each one is completely different to the other. If you like Super badAmerican Pie you'll love this ".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not original. It is not thought provoking. It's not well written. Hell it doesn't even have a plot. However Project X takes everything young people loved about movies like Superbad The Hangover Animal House Van Wilder and the like and it blends it all together brilliantly to the point where you actually feel as though you're at the party. The character formula is basically Superbad 2.0. Costa is like Jonah Hill's character but even louder more foul and crazier. Thomas is the sensible one much like Michael Cera. JB is Fat Mclovin. That's about as deep as it gets for characters. There is very little character development. Costa becomes a little more sensitive to Thomas' problems at the end and Thomas acknowledges his 'female best friend' as a lover in the end but that's about as far as character development goes. Oh and JB gets some booty. That is it. The real fun comes from the actual party and the true host Costa. The guy is hilarious and makes all of the negative aspects of American culture something to laugh at. He's loud rude crude and obnoxious. The movie is shot in such a way as to make you feel as though you are really at the party. I read some reviews from people that stated they did not feel they were at the party. I personally got sucked right into it. The soundtrack was brilliant and created a real party atmosphere. And boy if you like breasts you are in luck because this movie has plenty.The antagonist is an alcoholic neighbour named Rob and the movie does a good job making him look like a dbag. Even though he is right when he confronts them about shutting down the party and the kids really should have kept the noise down you still hate him for some reason. I suppose this movie represents that innate teenage rebellion and Rob represents authority. As such you're forced to choose a side. If you're under the age of about 21 you will probably choose teenage rebellion. I a 19 year old surely did. What I love most about this movie though is how unrealistic it is. I doubt a party this big could ever last as long as this one does. Police would be there so fast it wouldn't be able to get past 300 people. I've never been a raver but I've been to and thrown house parties and this movie takes my small shindigs with 2030 people and multiplies it by a thousand. The kids never face appropriate justice. If you're hoping to take your kids to see this to show them the negative consequences behind disobeying authority and disturbing the peace don't take them to see this. There is no moral other than never throw a crazy party at your house. Even that is kind of muddled because while the house is wrecked you leave the theatre with a sense of it was worth it. Thomas' father doesn't even beat him which would have been more realistic Just me?. All in all project X is a very memorable experience. I would like to watch it again soon but I have a feeling it will lose some of its glamour upon a second viewing. I had a lot of fun watching this in the theatre and recommend it to anyone who enjoys teenage rebellion good tunes scantily clad females and laughing at ridiculousness. If you enjoyed Superbad you will probably like this as long as you don't put too much emphasis on a plot. Side note before i forget This movie took something from Animal House that i noticed right away at the end of the film the fates of the main characters are revealed on screen via text narration much like in Animal House. The birthday boy Thomas is said to have been voted most likely to succeed by his peers. This reminded me so much of Animal House how Bluto grows up to become a US senator. Just thought I'd throw that out there.".

It soon spirals out of hand but what Project X does right is that it makes sure to really push it ridiculously far without betraying its setup. None of this would work if we didn't have some lovable protagonists to root for. We have our hero Tom the friendly and most normal guy. JB is the slightly rotund geek that tries to act sophisticated and finally we have Costa. A big douchey dick. This could go horribly wrong but his pranks are often harmless and Cooper plays it in a way where you can see how desperate he is for attention. It makes him very sympathetic even when you can't believe how outrageous he is being. The film builds up the party slowly which is perfect. It starts off with a few drinks. The dog is then attached to helium balloons and once the ecstasy comes into play all bets are off. The film is also littered with those bizarre curiosities that often make great comedy which thankfully it doesn't overuse. Two of my favourites were the 11 year old security guards. I would have liked to have seen more of the party halfway through as it turns into a huge montage of hilarious moments. Overall this is a riotous teen fantasy where people act like cocks but you somehow hope they succeed in one way or another.

	schema:headline " Douchebag The Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "We have all heard the horror stories of parties being posted on the Internet with events spiralling out of control. This story idea serves as the basis for Todd Phillips' The Hangover latest movie Project X which he produced. He intended it to combine teen comediesparty movies like Old School with foundfootage films such as Paranormal Activity.Thomas Kub Thomas Mann is a highschool student from Pasadena who is about to celebrate his 17th birthday. His friend Costa Oliver Cooper plans to host the most epic party possible at Thomas' house when his parents are away in effort to change their loser status. Costa spreads the word throughout the school and on the Internet but the party is bigger than anyone could imagine. As Thomas tries to control the situation there is also romance in the air he must choose between his longtime friend Kirby Kirby Bliss Blanton and the most popular girl in school Alexis Alexis Knapp.Because of the success of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity the foundfootage genre has become popular with this already being the third movie in that style in 2012 alone after The Devil Inside and Chronicle. It's a cheap alternative so now studios are trying to extend it into other genres and an Rrated teen comedy seems as good as any.But Project X is blighted by montages using music multiple cameras and cuts. The explanation for the filmmaking style is that it's meant to be a birthday video for Thomas but it begs the questions of why film something so selfincriminating and also how did the characters get all this footage? Dax Dax Flame serves to be no more than the cameraman not having a personality whatsoever and he has a very voyeuristic filming style.The movie pushes its premise to its extreme. It features 12yearold security guards with Tasers people jumping the room with skateboards a crotchpunching midget and an angry drug dealer with a flamethrower. Considering the idea of using found footage is usually meant to bring a sense of realism that was thrown out the window early.As a comedy Project X is not funny enough. The dialogue lacks wit and most scenes rely on more crude and physical humour such as dogs humping things because that is always funny. It does have its moments but the best bits tended to be in the trailer.As for the characters Costa is big dick and one of the most annoying characters imaginable. Think Jay from The Inbetweeners without the redeeming features. He brags all the time uses his friends and looks only for sex. He throws the party for his own selfish reasons. Of course the character was likely written this way to some extent so Cooper performed decently but deliberately making him annoying worked a bit too well. Costa was the type of person I'd personally want to punchand then again when he gets back up.The acting throughout is pretty good from the young cast. Thomas is a decent kid pressured into having this party who tries to keep order when chaos descends around him. It is sad then when he changes in a negative way. Jonathan Daniel Brown is basically a young Jonah Hill and Blanton reminded me of Dianna Agron from Glee a nice person and easily desirable. So why would Thomas' eye wonder to Alexis? There is a mean spirit behind this movie. Why should we support these people turning a suburban home into a rave and ruining the lives of the people around them ? None of the characters face real punishment. Instead they celebrates their excess at the expense of others.The Rrated highschool comedy always has an audience and I am sure Project X will develop a fan base but it will surely attract as many dissenters as it will fans.Rating 4.510".

	onyx:emotionText "We have all heard the horror stories of parties being posted on the Internet with events spiralling out of control. This story idea serves as the basis for Todd Phillips' The Hangover latest movie Project X which he produced. He intended it to combine teen comediesparty movies like Old School with foundfootage films such as Paranormal Activity.Thomas Kub Thomas Mann is a highschool student from Pasadena who is about to celebrate his 17th birthday. His friend Costa Oliver Cooper plans to host the most epic party possible at Thomas' house when his parents are away in effort to change their loser status. Costa spreads the word throughout the school and on the Internet but the party is bigger than anyone could imagine. As Thomas tries to control the situation there is also romance in the air he must choose between his longtime friend Kirby Kirby Bliss Blanton and the most popular girl in school Alexis Alexis Knapp.Because of the success of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity the foundfootage genre has become popular with this already being the third movie in that style in 2012 alone after The Devil Inside and Chronicle. It's a cheap alternative so now studios are trying to extend it into other genres and an Rrated teen comedy seems as good as any.But Project X is blighted by montages using music multiple cameras and cuts. The explanation for the filmmaking style is that it's meant to be a birthday video for Thomas but it begs the questions of why film something so selfincriminating and also how did the characters get all this footage? Dax Dax Flame serves to be no more than the cameraman not having a personality whatsoever and he has a very voyeuristic filming style.The movie pushes its premise to its extreme. It features 12yearold security guards with Tasers people jumping the room with skateboards a crotchpunching midget and an angry drug dealer with a flamethrower. Considering the idea of using found footage is usually meant to bring a sense of realism that was thrown out the window early.As a comedy Project X is not funny enough. The dialogue lacks wit and most scenes rely on more crude and physical humour such as dogs humping things because that is always funny. It does have its moments but the best bits tended to be in the trailer.As for the characters Costa is big dick and one of the most annoying characters imaginable.

This movie will really appeal those who can relate to the plot somewhat. As an 18 year old that has thrown parties when my parents were away the film struck a chord with me. I could feel the main character Thomas's anxiety when he realized he had no control over his house and that's why I feel many teenagers and even those in their early 20's would really relate to this film.Project X might not be worth 10 dollars to see it in the movie theater but if you go with a good group of friends the 10 dollar ticket will seem more than worth it.

His parents are going away for the weekend admonishing him not to touch Dad's car make sure Dad's office is locked etc. etc. etc. All the time Thomas' hilarious friend Costa performed extremely well by Oliver Cooper is pushing pushing pushing for Thomas to host an insane party to boost their credibility his other hilarious friend the obligatory fat one is hanging around and the entire proceedings are being filmed on an enormous hidef video camera by a fourth kid who noone notices. And of course hundreds of people turn up leading to the house being trashed burnt car in the swimming pool riot police trees in the street on fire press helicopters etc. Perhaps this is funny if you are a teenager. Personally I found the Costa character effectively Jonah Hill's character in Superbad only immensely more offensive and the driving force in the events which destroy his friend's house the most repellent character I have ever seen on screen outside monsters like Uday Hussein. It isn't so much that things get out of hand although they do it is more that Costa is pushing pushing pushing all the time with a total lack of respect for other people's hardearned belongings or for their desperately needed peace and quiet.At the end after everything has gone horribly and predictably wrong even Thomas' Dad while watching his car being hauled from the pool and explaining that the cost of the damage will consume Thomas' college fund shows that he is impressed by the turnout to the party and back at school Thomas' star is in the ascendant.The message underlying this film is that it really doesn't matter what damage you cause or how badly you screw up your own and others' lives as long as you come out of it cool and as a parent who has had occasion to be dismayed at the lack of respect shown to my home by guests of my teenage offspring I think it is a disgraceful message to purvey.I thought that this was a deeply unpleasant film with a truly horrible central character portrayed as someone to be admired selling a perverse life lesson under the guise of comedy which it wasn't. And the hand held subjective camera footage is getting terribly old now.It is interesting to note from IMDb's user votes that this film has scored highly with the youngsters who would be the target for such parties and badly with the older generations whose homes and lives and years of work would be what ends up trashed without remorse. I also read many comments along the lines of Wow! I wish I could go to a party like that right now! And I despair somewhat.This film has absolutely nothing in it apart from some singularly unerotic breasts to justify watching it. I hope those responsible for putting it on the screen never work in films again.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a preface to this review before anyone's kneejerk reaction is to dismiss my opinions as those of a prude I'm not at all opposed to hardR comedies. In fact I love many of them. But something about this one rubbed me the wrong way  indeed to even refer to it as a movie seems wrong there were scenes chronicling the party that basically devolved into minimusicvideos focusing on naked girls. And not even in tantalizing ways  rather these scenes felt creepy especially since a lot of the girls featured are supposed to be high schoolers  for example the director relies upon paparazzistyle upskirt shots. And because the movie is shot a la Blair WitchCloverfield etc. with its found footage style it only makes these shots seem all the dirtier and more voyeuristic.Moving on past that stuff... other flaws The fact that the main characters were so clichd and stereotypical of the genre didn't help either  the Jonah Hilltype character from NYC was sporadically amusing but overall just seemed to be trying too hard the mandatory overzealous good friend who's obsessed with girls and thinks he has game but doesn't. So nothing original or distinct enough to make him different than any other sex comedy character. He made me laugh a couple times but that's faint praise.While the first half of the movie is sort of dumb fun the second just gets derailed by increasingly silly unrealistic borderline disturbing stuff  e.g. a huge sequence with a dude wielding a flamethrower at the end was not just stupid but kind of terrifying like it belonged in a completely different film.I also didn't like the 'moral' of the story or whatever you want to call its attempts to reconcile its events. Unfortunately I can't discuss it without spoiling the film but suffice to say the feelgood moral closure of Project X felt like an attempt at Risky Business without any of the actual morality behind it. Not to mention the main character wasn't half as likable or realistic as the Tom Cruise character despite ostensibly looking more like an actual high schooler than Cruise did  alas that's why good writing is key. The only word I can use to describe the film is...sleazy but not in a good way.Think back on what made films like Superbad so much better than much of their genre it was the characters. They said and did a lot of crude dumb stuff but they were rendered as realistic and likable kids and we could relate to them. When they were put in compromising situations  like an out of control party  it was funny because as corny as this sounds we cared. They weren't throwaway caricatures of teenagers or onedimensional meanspirited idiots.In Project X whose various elements and characters are basically ripped off of superior teen films you don't particularly care about any of these kids  nor can you relate to them. Is the film enjoyable? People in the theater laughed  I imagine it'll appeal to its primary demographic which is the teencollege crowd  but I think years from now those viewers will look back on movies like The Hangover and Superbad and realize why those were better.P.S. Don't be fooled by misleading marketing  while this film was indeed produced by Todd Phillips he did not direct it. The studio is capitalizing on his involvement  and can you blame them for it when the Hangover films have made like a billion dollars worldwide?  but apart from a producer credit he didn't have anything to do with this flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's put aside the fact that the foundfootage genre is rapidly becoming a poor excuse for real filmmaking and a sad gimmick. Let's erase the fact that NONE of this would ever happen. EVER. And let's ignore the obscene extension of a clichd 5minute YouTube video stretched for 88overlong minutes that literally felt like twice that long.The single worst aspect of Project X was how incredibly irresponsible it was. Sure enough younglings will flock to see this adore it and glamorize it to the point of attempting to recreate the horrible actions of the horrible individuals in this film. Since this movie or the creators have no soul or accountability to children I can miserably see the next found footage documentary would be on how to make a bomb to bring to High School when no guns are accessible.Speaking of indignity shame on you Harkins Theatres! My 440 Sunday afternoon halfpacked showing was overrun guardian'less groups of preteens and obviouslyunder17 crowds. Sadly they seemed to really love LOVE this movie cheering and laughing at all the most inappropriate times i.e. when these senseless inconsiderate thoughtless brainless and evil characters destroyed property hurt the innocent and worst of all felt zero remorse about their actionscrimes. Eh who am I fooling? Harkins employs the same mindset teens to run the front of the movie house so of course they'll let young punks into this Project X.Speaking of my unfortunate moviegoing experience these two adolescent girls behind me laughed and laughed throughout but oddly not in the finale. That's when I cracked up. Yes I did laugh once. You see the main nerd Thomas whom I heard was Sooo cute by the preteens behind merepeatedly wants to be accepted by his high school peers or at least the devil on his shoulder Oliver tells him that's what he wants. In the climax he's being highfived and cheered on by his new buddies when he walks down the school hall. I laughed in utter disbelief because of how incredibly sad I was that all of these losers actually lived through the party and how if this were true I will end up having to pay for their inevitable many trips to prison later in life.I digress. The movie's opening is a setup to a birthday party for a 17yearold Thomas whose parents strictly warn him not to have a big party when they're out of town for the weekend. Well flipflopping Thomas is controlled by the most evil of all the children his buddy Oliver a boy whose selfesteem should be questioned each time he makes homophobic comments Oh did you know if you don't drink alcohol you're considered a faggot? racist remarks and insults against their third musketeer the heavierset JB.During that small yet drawnout opening of Hey Party at Thomas! we have yet another unbelievable series of explanations in yet another incoherent foundfootage movie to why one rarely seen psychopath carries a camera onequarter his body size. Apparently no one notices this camera in the classroom in the boy's restroom or even worse in the boy's locker room. That last one had me really puzzled to why no one seemed to mind being filmed while they changed or came back from the showers. If you didn't see this massive camera on one guy's shoulders while the other males are changing you're either flipping blind an exhibitionist or as usual the filmmakers can't always explain the flawed foundfootage dilemma during 80 of the film.I digress again. All but the final 3 minutes takes place at the most incomprehensible and out of reach party of any generation. You will see the obligatory midget stuffed into an oven that literally could kill him. You'll see animal abuse that makes the tying of the dog in National Lampoon's Vacation seem tame. You'll see High School Girls whose ages range between 2530 that could model the bathing suits off Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue's females. You'll see freshmen banned from the festivities while two 9yearold Damien's work as security guards. You'll see policemen that get outwitted by a punk whose only legal expertise is from Judge Judy. You'll see two hot fight impractically over a guy who makes Jay Baruchel look gorgeous. You'll see five hundred perfectly placed and always waterproofed camera angles from the delinquents as if they're hands were always free to film with their phone cameras instead of holding onto the alcoholic beverages they shouldn't be having anyways for another few years. You'll see how both the movie's audience and the characters think it's funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. Literally my theatre's group of asses thought it would be funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. SIGH. If this is Earth's future bring it Mayans! And you'll see how easy it is when splicing the foundfootage together to obtain police and news videos.What you won't see is any realism or any resemblance to the real world even MTV's The Real World is more genuine. You won't see more than one neighbor call the police  instead they're busy calling the nerd's Dad and overexaggerating on the party's extend. You won't see any adult with a doubledigit IQ but not in the funfunny John Hughes way. You won't see a plot. You won't find an original idea or thought. You won't see a single female that would even come close to what a High School girl really looks like. You won't find anything intentionally funny. And you certainly won't find a single character with an ounce of morality.And while this movie makes Jersey Shore ethical Twilight's Bella a good rolemodel and Charlie Sheen appear sane the only thing honest in this movie was the fake apology given by Warner Bros in the opening. Don't see this movie. Don't pay them into a PX2.".

The movie's opening is a setup to a birthday party for a 17yearold Thomas whose parents strictly warn him not to have a big party when they're out of town for the weekend. Well flipflopping Thomas is controlled by the most evil of all the children his buddy Oliver a boy whose selfesteem should be questioned each time he makes homophobic comments Oh did you know if you don't drink alcohol you're considered a faggot? racist remarks and insults against their third musketeer the heavierset JB.During that small yet drawnout opening of Hey Party at Thomas! we have yet another unbelievable series of explanations in yet another incoherent foundfootage movie to why one rarely seen psychopath carries a camera onequarter his body size. Apparently no one notices this camera in the classroom in the boy's restroom or even worse in the boy's locker room. That last one had me really puzzled to why no one seemed to mind being filmed while they changed or came back from the showers. If you didn't see this massive camera on one guy's shoulders while the other males are changing you're either flipping blind an exhibitionist or as usual the filmmakers can't always explain the flawed foundfootage dilemma during 80 of the film.I digress again. All but the final 3 minutes takes place at the most incomprehensible and out of reach party of any generation. You will see the obligatory midget stuffed into an oven that literally could kill him. You'll see animal abuse that makes the tying of the dog in National Lampoon's Vacation seem tame. You'll see High School Girls whose ages range between 2530 that could model the bathing suits off Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue's females. You'll see freshmen banned from the festivities while two 9yearold Damien's work as security guards. You'll see policemen that get outwitted by a punk whose only legal expertise is from Judge Judy. You'll see two hot fight impractically over a guy who makes Jay Baruchel look gorgeous. You'll see five hundred perfectly placed and always waterproofed camera angles from the delinquents as if they're hands were always free to film with their phone cameras instead of holding onto the alcoholic beverages they shouldn't be having anyways for another few years. You'll see how both the movie's audience and the characters think it's funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. Literally my theatre's group of asses thought it would be funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. SIGH. If this is Earth's future bring it Mayans! And you'll see how easy it is when splicing the foundfootage together to obtain police and news videos.What you won't see is any realism or any resemblance to the real world even MTV's The Real World is more genuine. You won't see more than one neighbor call the police  instead they're busy calling the nerd's Dad and overexaggerating on the party's extend. You won't see any adult with a doubledigit IQ but not in the funfunny John Hughes way. You won't see a plot. You won't find an original idea or thought. You won't see a single female that would even come close to what a High School girl really looks like. You won't find anything intentionally funny. And you certainly won't find a single character with an ounce of morality.And while this movie makes Jersey Shore ethical Twilight's Bella a good rolemodel and Charlie Sheen appear sane the only thing honest in this movie was the fake apology given by Warner Bros in the opening. Don't see this movie. Don't pay them into a PX2.";

	schema:reviewBody "Project X was exactly what you thought it was going to be. The movie spends a very brief 20 minutes establishing the plot line and introducing the characters. The rest of the time is spent delving into a teenage male fantasycomplete with drugs booze and hot babes. As a teenager myself I found this movie interesting because it felt like I was there at the party. For 88 minutes I and probably all other teenagers got to see our fantasy play out on the big screen this was the stuff we could only dream about. Hard core Movie lovers will hate this film and I don't blame them. It's true Project X won't win any awards and it'll probably be forgotten in a couple months once bigger productions like John Carter and the Hunger Games come out. But what Project X lacks in the theatrical masterpiece department it makes up for with a message. That message is the plight of teenagers around the the world which is the desire to be accepted. Basically this movie says that if you aren't popular then do what society has deemed cool and throw a huge party. Even though I'm a teen I don't agree with this message shocking I know. Sure it would be cool to ATTEND an epic party like that  but would you really want to throw one?? At the end of the movie the main character Thomas Kub says I burned down my neighborhood bankrupted my parents trashed my college career and I'll be in debt for the rest of my life.. Wow really?? I may be 18 but there's no way I would destroy my future for ONE night of epicness. What most teenagers don't realize is that this pubescent angst period is a drop in the bucket of our lives. It seems to me that trashing 80 of your life just so that 10 can be spend bathing in the false admiration of people who after high school you'll probably never meet again isn't worth it. Project X lets teenagers fantasize about what could not necessarily should be like. There's a reason why it's a called Hollywood because like most movies this is a fantasy created to draw audiences not to be taken seriously.Project X was an epic 88 minute dream but like all dreams when the lights come on it's time to wake up and get back to reality.".

Dax Flame Dax Director Nima NourizadehDown through all the years of movie making there have been certain films that leave a unique taste. Some leave a taste of satisfaction whereas others leave the opposite. Yet even the worst films can be saved by something. Maybe the music is great or a character is interesting. It may be unintentionally funny. Then there are films like ''Project X''. That rare cinematic beast the movie with no redeeming features. I've seen a diverse amount of films and I can safely say that ''Project X'' is the worst one I've ever encountered. I'm not exaggerating. To elaborate...The ''plot'' is simple enough. It's Thomas' 18th birthday and his parents are leaving for the weekend. However his ''friend'' Costa wants to use the occasion to hold ''the most epic party ever'' all at Thomas' house. With the help of a nobody called J.B. Costa hopes the party will make himself and Thomas ''cool''. Soon enough Thomas' house is flooded with hundreds of highschool idiots and everything predictably goes to hell. Filming this terror is Dax a quiet kid who becomes creepy for no real reason. Can our loser heroes resolve the carnage before Thomas' parents arrive home? Not if Costa has anything to say about it...The ''shakycamera'' style of filming is headacheinducing as always. Each ''plot point'' is separated by a montage of unerotic shots of girls lifting their shirts and idiots gurning at the camera. All of this is scored to hiphop drivel and booming bass that assaults your senses. But where ''Project X'' truly fails is in its characters and ''comedy''.Simply put Costa is the most horrible character I've ever seen in a film. He makes Eric Cartman look pleasant. This tanktopwearing scumbag dominates the film and is obviously meant to be the ''funny'' character. The one everyone quotes. Yet his onslaught of racist and homophobic bile makes you want to punch him even harder. Other characters treat him like a king of cool and he treats them like dirt. For example he brands the nondrinking Dax a ''faggot'' casually blows fag smoke at a baby and manipulates his ''best friend'' in order to get laid. Result He ruins everyone's lives destroys Thomas' home and gets away with it without a shred of remorse! Not only that his actions are glamorised at the film's end. Ferris Bueller he ain't.The other characters don't fare any better. Thomas could be sympathetic if he didn't blindly follow Costa. J.B. is the obligatory ''fat kid'' and only exists to be the butt of Costa's depraved jokes. Dax is only there to film the insanity and hide in the bushes covertly filming peoples' private business. The only sympathetic character is an angry neighbour who comes to complain about the noise. For his troubles he is shot with a taser threatened by two junior psychos and nearly has his home torched by a drugpeddling maniac. We're told this innocent man has a baby! So this apparently makes his suffering ''hilarious'' and makes Costa look like ''da bomb''. What a partykiller. To make a long story short the film's bizarre message is that as long as you look cool it's okay to destroy peoples' lives and houses. Even Thomas' dad is impressed by the chaos his son has helped to create as well as some newscasters and Jimmy Kimmel! So disgraceful characters mindnumbing music and crass stereotyping of teenagers help make a truly monumental piece of cinematic vileness. I lost hope when a dog was tied to balloons and sent into the air while an idiot went ''OMG it's a flying dog.'' Cue facepalm.Please spare yourself from this film. You won't regret not watching it. I already did that so you won't have to.".

This is therefore a failure for all age groups. At least I thought I would laugh even if the plot is lacking but I was mistaken. This is a cinematic waste and it makes me cringe to think of the money that goes into actors writers camera crews props and the set for this movie which is a hemorrhoid on the butt of society.

Just like I don't believe the majority of people who gave this a positive review who claim to be teens and in college are real. Movie marketing teams hire social medial guys they pay 8 to 15 and hour to write reviews everywhere saying how awesome this was and relatable fun blah blah.Don't be a dummy. Do you want to go to a party or watch a video about party?? Are they going to start making full length films about riding a bicycle? Walking a dog? Transformer movies are dumb but at least they are actual movies and you get the benefit of cool special effects and hot super models this you get none of that. All this movie is really for is for people who DON'T get invited to parties. And seriously how many people can't get an invite to a party? The film marketers are just trying to trick teens into thinking it's cool..when what is cool about watching a video about a party? That sounds like the most uncool thing I've ever heard of.".

	schema:headline " Wildly unlikable actors disturbing amounts of misogyny and a narcissisticsociopathic plot and characters make this the worst comedy of the year...";
	schema:reviewBody "In what universe is this comedy considered funny entertaining or good by any stretch of the imagination? I have just witnessed nearly 90 minutes of coldblooded hateful misogyny violence spitefulness narcissism and sociopathic characters in the movie Project X. This is a fundamentally unlikable film by any and every stretch of the imagination. I felt downright filthy watching it and only finished it out of sheer masochistic curiosity hoping it would get better at some point. But... oh god... It didn't. It only got worse and worse.This is one of those exploitation films that just misses the mark completely. It aims for it's target and then turns 90 degrees shooting in the completely wrong direction.From the opening minute you know this is a stinker when Costa Oliver Cooper one of the main characters in introduced. He is a loathsome character. From the second he's introduced it's clear he's some sort of evil hybrid of Jar Jar Binks and the raunchiest frat boy you could find. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard and his complete and utter hatred of women from his first few seconds of dialog and sociopath tendencies towards anyone else turn off the viewer instantly. Oliver Cooper if god forbid there's a sequel at least tone down your obvious hatred and spitefulness please!Costa to be hereafter referred to as Evil Punk and his friendcameraman Dax Dax Flame are working on a video for their friend Thomas' Thomas Mann birthday. Thomas is actually kinda sorta likable at first. We also meet JB Jonathan Daniel Brown another friend an overweight nerd. Evil Punk continues to spew his misogyny CONSTANTLY and they plan to have a party at Thomas' house to gain popularity and to get laid. Thomas and JB quickly lose what little likability they have and it is hinted that there might be feelings between Thomas and Kirby Kirby Bliss Blanton a friend of his who sadly like the others is likable at first but quickly degenerates into a caricature.The trio invites a ton of people to the party and go to get booze. During which Evil Punk further proves his vile nature by shoplifting harassing shoppers over the PA system at the store and even putting alcohol into a baby's hand and making it cry. HOW IS THIS FUNNY? That's mentally deranged behavior! These characters should be committed to an asylum. They also get drugs and the party starts. From there on in the film is a whirlwind of evil deplorable scene after evil deplorable scene.The rest of the film features consistent continuations of the misogyny from Evil Punk and the others consequenceless depictions of underaged drinking and use of heavy drugs cases where people from outside of the party are assaulted including an upsetting and disturbing scene in which a father is physically attacked for asking the party to quiet down so his infant can sleep excessive property damage and severe and aggressive instances of violence. And the influence of this film on impressionable teens has already caused at least one death and well over 100000 in property damage from copycat parties in the months after it's released so congrats filmmakers! You're responsible for death and destruction!This is one of the single most deplorable unlikable and I don't say this lightly evil films I've seen in quite some time. It has absolutely no sense of selfcontrol and simply tries to shock the audience again and again despite having no respect for basic human decency or life. It's disgusting and vile. I'm a fan of extreme cinema including films like Human Centipede 2 Ichi the Killer A Serbian Film Cannibal Holocaust etc. And from a basic level of human decency the sheer hatred and disrespect this movie has makes those others look like Disney film.In addition from a technical standpoint this film is a mess. It's meant to resemble a found footage feature yet the footage is either way too professional looking or just too awful looking from shot to shot making it feel manufactured the editing is a mess and the music is dreadful.Shame on Thomas Mann Oliver Cooper and the other actors involved. Shame on director Nima Nourizadeh. Shame on producer Todd Phillips. Shame on writers Michael Bacall and Matt Drake. And shame on anyone who supported this film.This is one of the most deeply disturbing upsettingly misogynistic poorly made shockingly unfunny and unlikable and downright narcissistic films I've ever seen. It's easily the worst comedy of the year and possibly the worst comedy of this decade.I've been trying not to use the word hate so much recently but there's no other choice I hate this film and all involved. It's a 1 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Project X reaches a whole new level of juvenile debauchery and because of its repetition of incoherent party scenes it spans for what seems to be a lot longer than eightyeight minutes. It isn't offensive if you've seen other R rated comedies but it isn't as original funny clever or as witty as it bills itself.The plot is wholly absent. High school Senior Thomas Mann plans to throw the ultimate party at his house to commemorate his birthday and to try and become popular with the help of his friends Costa Cooper and J.B. Brown. Because Thomas's parents are vacationing for the weekend they decided to hold the jam at his house and after hours of promotion at school and throughout the town it finally happens. It turns out to be the craziest thing ever. Hundreds and hundreds of teenagers show up and spend the night drinking stripping gyrating dancing swearing fighting and well being teenagers.Project X plays less like a film and more like a music video. Scenes involve inconsistent shots of all different age groups of men and women dancing and stripping combined with the neverending hiphop song with booming bass.If that's what you want cease to read on much further. At this point you can decide if it's for you or not. I love comedies especially the ones that don't succumb to neutering content just to make an extra buck from the teens. I however don't like comedies with faceless characters or ones that follow the easy path of all style no substance. The difficult thing with party movies is that not only are they incredibly hard to write but they are incredibly hard to write well. Rarely do we get descriptions of people in these films and in Project X any form of credible definable characterization is completely absent.It isn't long before the film turns from juvenile to just plain nihilistic and meanspirited. Nihilistic in the sense that nothing matters as long as we have fun and meanspirited in the sense the film doesn't seem to like anybody. Every group of people imaginable in this film is depicted in their lowest possible form. There's also a lovely scene that qualifies as one of my rules on how to make a poor comedy or movie in general it's the animal in distress. Thanks movie for showing no passion or feelings to even the virtually helpless.Not only is an animal treated poorly but both genders are depicted at their lowest. The film shows men as horny brainless delinquents and women as useless caricatures that are no better than the size of their breasts and buttocks and only deserve to be shown in a Girls Gone Wildesque light. Few films bring light and wit to these dehumanizing traits and Project X brings misogyny to an all time low.By the final act the film goes from vaguely comedic and dizzying to brutal unforgivable and harshly consequential. Oddly enough it involves the best scenes in the film even if they are a little farfetched. So many films show the great side of parties but never the consequences. While it is taken to the extreme and may be a bit impractical after hundreds of jumpcuts of gyrating teenagers and exhausting bass these shots are fresh welcoming and sometimes a bit frightening.Project X is partying to the extreme but not nearly as fun as one would like to believe. The found footage aspect is fine although not necessary but I'd still take it over 3D any day. The film's main flaw is in its indistinct script that characterizes everyone by stereotypes and makes the protagonists into unlikable snobs who believe popularity is the only way to go through life. Even the use of verbal timing an almost vital trait in any good comedy is very rare. The end we're left with is extremely off. It basically says even if you endangered the life of yourself and hundreds of other people hey you're popular man! Starring Thomas Mann Oliver Cooper Jonathan Daniel Brown Nichole Bloom and Alexis Knapp. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh.".

	schema:reviewBody "Really this is a great flick.  Especially if you go for British comedy. Rita Rudner's writing is just fantastic.  I caught this in the theatres by chance and loved itand bought it as soon as it became available on video.Since this is just commentary I'm not going to get into the plot anyI'll just toss in my 2 cents.In the Maltin Review he mentions that many consider this a British Big Chill.  In a way I can see that but where the Big Chill focuses on how much the characters have changed since college Peter's Friend's does a good job of showing how the characters really HAVEN'T changed since then. They have matured but the root of who they aretheir faults strengths and weaknessesare still the same.The wit flows the humor can be obvious as well as understated the interplay between the actors is simply sublime and the overall feel is fun and warm.  I've seen many of these actors together in other films and they're all first rate.  Just because Emma Thompson is the only one to win an Oscar doesn't mean the others are slackers!!The one thing I've had to accept though is that in 7 years it has become datedespecially the reason why Peter decides to bring his old college buddies together.  That last scene packed a much bigger punch in 1992 than it could in 1999.  Not that the issues are any less significant now just that as a culture we're more accustomed to the subject.  And I won't spoil itif you want to know what the subject is rent the movie! grinAlso the soundtrack is fabulous!  And I'd say it's worth the price of a rental for those who came of age in the 80's just to watch the opening montage  The highlights of the 80's set to Everybody Wants to Rule the World.  Fantastically done.Rent it and enjoy!!".

They have matured but the root of who they aretheir faults strengths and weaknessesare still the same.The wit flows the humor can be obvious as well as understated the interplay between the actors is simply sublime and the overall feel is fun and warm.  I've seen many of these actors together in other films and they're all first rate.  Just because Emma Thompson is the only one to win an Oscar doesn't mean the others are slackers!!The one thing I've had to accept though is that in 7 years it has become datedespecially the reason why Peter decides to bring his old college buddies together.  That last scene packed a much bigger punch in 1992 than it could in 1999.  Not that the issues are any less significant now just that as a culture we're more accustomed to the subject.  And I won't spoil itif you want to know what the subject is rent the movie! grinAlso the soundtrack is fabulous!  And I'd say it's worth the price of a rental for those who came of age in the 80's just to watch the opening montage  The highlights of the 80's set to Everybody Wants to Rule the World.  Fantastically done.Rent it and enjoy!!";

To fully appreciate why the characters behave the way they do for instance Mary saying goodbye to her baby son Ben while husband Roger stands by it is worth watching the film twice. Peter's character also unfolds in a logical way and his actions become crystal clear as the film progresses. Carol  seemingly a Blist celebrity who thinks she's a legend  turns out to be a multi layered character and is certainly one of the most memorable.The only drawback to this rather characterdriven film is that sometimes I watch it and think I have obviously missed a scene somewhere. Although I cannot identify with everything the characters have been through they are all reasonably fleshed out. As the audience gets further into the film the layers of show and pretence are peeled back like onion skins. The two extra characters are eliminated with reasonable explanations. I can see what makes all of the characters tick  except for Brian. Roger and Mary are a good couple stressed and yet strengthened by the way they finally deal with their personal tragedy  in fact I feel like the holiday is quite cathartic for them. Carol and Andrew although a bit showbiz for my liking are obviously moulded and shaped by their Hollywood surroundings  they are clearly used to fulfilling a role on and off camera and somehow I don't feel that the audience for this film sees the ultimate end of their relationship. Sarah another thespian type evidently with a colourful past seems to do some serious thinking about her approach to relationships. Maggie  oh I do like Maggie!  the rather bookish spinster undergoes a total change before balancing her old self with the new self she has tapped into. Peter excellently played by Stephen Fry makes a courteous host friend and confidante to all reluctant to burden his friends with a problem far more stunning than anything his friends have been faced with perhaps Roger and Mary's is on a par?.But I have tried and tried and watched this film over and over and I still feel as though I have somehow missed a key scene that would help me understand Brian. Where is it I ask? I still don't get the Greta Garbo joke  I can only surmise that it is a story he finds humour in where nobody else ever could because the punchline never made it to the final cut. A line from him after upsetting Mary states It's not like me to put my foot in it  how ironic when he spends the rest of his time in the film spoiling the moment particularly after the revue group's lovely song by the piano and upsetting others. So where the others have a bit of backstory  we know who went out with or slept with who at university  and can be empathised with Brian appears onedimensional. His character as it stands is the only real flaw in the film his only real purpose is to be cast off by Sarah when Andrew helps her see how wrongly she approaches her relationships.A notable mention also goes to the soundtrack. I only wanted to see this film initially because it featured Tears For Fears' 1985 single Everybody Wants To Rule The World but this is in no way the only musical highlight. The opening sequence was one I enjoyed very much.".

As they're invited to a country manor by one of them to celebrate New Year's and enjoy each other's company for old times' sake they're unfazed by the impression they may leave but perhaps too eager to make it a fun time together. It's the people they bring along that start to complicate everything but also truly reunite them.The cast is fantastic mind the wonderful Phyllida Law Thompson's mother in the role of Vera and the atmosphere brilliantly subdued. The upbeat late 80's music brings back memories and it's a sorely needed uplifting element amidst the dreary British winter. Branagh's direction leaves some direction to be desired but it's exactly that slightly amateurish feel to it that makes the film tick.When I watched Peter's friends for the first time more than ten years ago it struck me as a slowpaced movie quirky but fun. A decade later it seems spirited joyful and warm with lots of smirks some laughs and plenty of I know this awful embarrassing feeling moments. It's also become a great testimony to the late 80s early 90s era now trapped in time but well remembered for its excess in clothing opulence in music powerful political movements and perhaps youthful naivety. It's a movie I could watch each year anew.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a waste of time and talent!  We are supposed to feel deeply involved with a clutch of actors who are too selfish and petty to feel anything for each other.  In no time the two outsiders at the snobby little weekend gathering of Peter and his old university friends are driven out and the remaining coterie can get on with admiring themselves and being alternately belligerent and maudlin with each other.  I thought it was ironic that Branagh's American archbitch actress wife played by Rita Rudner is the only character in the whole film who actually puts herself out to do something for someone else when she comforts a distraught Emma Thompson after the latter's rejection by Peter and gives her a makeover and new hairdo to make her feel better.  It's a silly gesture but it's the only generous action by anyone even while Rudner's character throughout is portrayed as a distasteful brash American clod not like those wry witty humorous Brits. No one in this movie seems able to keep their mouth shut about anything and we're even treated to a ludicrous moment when the bereaved mother of a SIDS victim sits down at the dinner table and happily announces to the assembly that she and her husband have been shagging. A weekend with these tasteless vulgarians would drive anyone mad with disgust. Apart from the ugly characterisations the plot is so obvious and telegraphs its intentions so far in advance there is nothing for an intelligent viewer to look forward to.  Early in the movie Peter has a sudden attack of weakness while helping his friend to carry in firewood what can be the matter with him?  Nothing as original as maybe lung cancer from smoking too much  no naturally it has to be AIDS the poverty of imagination on the part of the writers advertising the climax of the movie a good hour before our arrival there.  This is a stupid waste of a good cast and a worse waste of the viewer's time.".

One character is sleeping with a married man.  He cries and runs back home later.  She cries and gets upbraided by her friends. And the poor martyr Peter has gasp AIDS.  Everybody cries when he tells them Peter asks them to help him celebrate life and then they all act like some cure will heal him.Too much cutting down a person behind their back then having them overhear then having the critic cry  apologize. A VERY disappointing effort from a group of actors who can do and have done a LOT better in such films as Much Ado About Nothing Sense and Sensibility and others.Peter's Friends is not really worth your time.".

I think they should have chosen someone outside the group of very real friends to perhaps keep it from some sentimentality. Branagh also seems to not enjoy close ups that much as some really great performances are missed. For example the scene were everything is coming to a head Branagh decides to pan around a Christmas tree and you are unable to see the faces of the actors. This bad direction does take away some of the impact of the scene.Despite the somewhat bad direction the performances are superb. While the whole cast is excellent I do think the best performance came from Hugh Laurie who was wonderful as a father who is trying to cope with the death of one his twins. The heart felt scene were he basically semiexplodes to his friends is so touching. He expresses his hurt about how people always say it's hard for a mother to lose a child and not the father is so touching and moving that despite the somewhat lack of close up his performance is still a knock out as is his scene with Imelda Staunton who plays his wife. Their scene were they work through their heartache is very powerful. I think Brangha was right to have played that in one shot. But alas both Laurie and Staunon are somewhat under used and their is very little of them actually talking to their friends.This film despite the miss judge of direction is a rather enjoyable and delightful film that I do recommend and while does have some heartache it is a very amusing film.".

Footlights revues since 1960 have included the casts of Beyond The Fringe Jonathan Miller Dudley Moore Peter Cook and Alan Bennett Monty Python all of them The Goodies Graeme Garden Bill Oddie and Tim BrookeTaylor Alas Smith And Jones and Douglas Adams HitchHiker's Guide To The Galaxy.In 1981 the Footlights mounted an Edinburgh Fringe Festival show called The Cellar Tapes whose cast included...Stephen Fry Hugh Laurie Emma Thompson and Tony Slattery! The Cellar Tapes show won the Fringe's Perrier Award and pretty much guaranteed everyone jobs for life in British TV and film. The scene of them at school doing an amateur theatrical show for the university dons is a reference to this supposedly. Of the film despite an interesting concept some good moments and a talented cast I found this film disjointed emotionally cold only rarely witty and even faintly unbelievable at times the scene where Thompson breaks down and cries is so reserved and smug it's like she can never really let go which she never does in anything she's in anyway!It's rather as if they want to thinly satirize themselves but only thinly as if they take themselves too seriously to open themselves to selfmockery. For a better take on this concept I recommend the 1998 film Final Cut starring Jude Law which has the current mob of Britpack actors playing themselves in an improvised film often times for laughs.It's amazing how far Branagh's star has fallen since 1992 when he was The Olivier People Actually Liked. I guess some people really do peak early he did the movie of Henry V and wrote his autobiography when he was 26! Since then?....Anyone?...Bueller?".

	schema:headline " A Very British Chill";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter's Friends can be seen as a British version of The Big Chill. Like the American film it deals with a group of old university friends meeting up several years after graduating. In 1982 Peter Andrew Roger Mary Sarah and Maggie were all members of Cambridge University student comedy troupe. In 1992 Peter the son of an aristocratic family invites his friends to celebrate New Year at the stately home he has recently inherited from his father. Joining the party are Sarah's boyfriend Brian and Andrew's American film star wife Carol. Roger and Mary are now married to one another Peter and Maggie are still single although Maggie it turns out nurses an unrequited passion for Peter.As the weekend progresses we learn more about the members of the group and the secrets which some of them are hiding. It becomes clear that Roger and Mary have recently suffered some great misfortune but the nature of this is only gradually revealed. The first great shock comes when the audience discover that Brian is in fact married with a son and is cheating on his wife with Sarah. Thereafter the revelations come thick and fast the final one involving Peter himself coming right at the end.The comedy troupe was obviously based on the famous Footlights to which cast members Hugh Laurie Stephen Fry Emma Thompson and Tony Slattery all belonged although the rather naff sketch we see them performing might indicate why none of the fictitious characters unlike their real life counterparts have gone on to become professional comedians. Scriptwriter Martin Bergman was also a former Footlight he wrote the script together with his wife Rita Rudner who also plays Carol. Perhaps I should declare an interest. I myself was a Cambridge contemporary of some of the cast and knew Stephen Fry personally.A film like this one could easily have ended up as little more than a countryhouse soap opera for intellectuals. That it does not is due partly to Bergman and Rudner's literate script and partly to the skill of the cast members. In 1992 several of these were known mainly as comedians or at least as comic actors but although there are moments of humour this is more a character study than a comedy. There are no stars this is very much an example of ensemble acting. Special mention should go to Stephen Fry as the kindly but haunted Peter Kenneth Branagh who also directed and produced as the recovering alcoholic Andrew struggling to cope with the demands of his Hollywood writing career and with marriage to the tempestuous Carol Branagh's then wife Emma Thompson as the frumpy Maggie Tony Slattery as the arrogant bumptious Brian and Alphonsia Emmanuel an actress I have not heard much of recently as Sarah. There is a nice contrast between Hugh Laurie's Roger and Imelda Staunton's Mary both recovering from their shared tragedy but in very different ways.Peter's Friends is in many ways a very British film just as The Big Chill was very American. Although it involves strong emotions several of the characters deal with them with a typical British reserve and stiff upper lip this is particularly true of Peter himself Roger and Maggie and to some extent of Andrew although he loses his stiff upper lip when under the influence of alcohol. It does not have the overtly political content of The Big Chill although it does deal with a broadly similar theme the way in which youthful idealism can be corroded by the harsh experiences of adult life. One of the best psychological dramas of the nineties. 810".

After not seeing it for so many years it's surprising as just to how somber the film is at times.As well as the film subliminally congratulating the stars for their input into the British Arts it deals with infidelity morbidity loss age and self realisation and it deals with them marvellously.The cast as you'd expect are wondrous and the chemistry in the film is perfect. My only qualm with the film is that whilst it deals with life changing issues delicately with three of the characters the other characters problems seem simply trivial compared to those. So while the loss of a child is treated as you'd expect it to be treated suicide is joked about early on and cast aside.But all in all it's a fun love in for all concerned but it's definitely an acquired taste.I can't wait for the directors cut that has Alan Rickman turn up late with a silly story and a slight problem.".

	schema:reviewBody "I stumbled across this film while reading about the comedy show A Bit of Fry and Laurie since it also features the dynamic comedic duo of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. The pair's eclectic brand of wit is however somewhat subdued in this bittersweet drama from director Kenneth Branagh which concerns six college friends who reunite a decade later to catch up on old times and pick up the shattered fragments of their middleaged lives. Sounds terribly depressing doesn't it? It is at times but the overriding emotion is one of nostalgia and reassurance the knowledge that old friends however estranged are always there to lend a hand in one's darker hours. First and foremost 'Peter's Friends 1992' boasts an excellent intimate cast including Emma Thompson Imelda Staunton and Branagh himself. Stephen Fry seems a bit flustered in the title role seemingly uncomfortable playing such a sincere polite character though there are snippets of his usual trademark flamboyance Laurie however predictably excels in a tough dramatic role.Branagh shoots the film in gracefullymoving long takes some single shots encompassing five minutes of action or dialogue. While this approach can often seem overly ostentatious here the use of longtakes is laudably understated. The opening scene is an elaborate flurry of song and movement that runs over four minutes and follows the main characters through a musical performance and into their changerooms while scarcely acknowledging that the scene is a single take. The motives behind the technique differ from those of Hitchcock in 'Rope 1948' in which the mobile camera voyeuristically shuffled across the room alongside the film's characters. In Allen's 'Everyone Says I Love You 1996' the camera is basically sat in one place a silent but nevertheless present participant in each conversation. In Branagh's film the camera feels less like a participant than an omnipresent observer surveying each scene coolly and detachedly. This omnipresence is heightened by an oftenmoving camera recalling Altman's everpanning lens in 'Gosford Park 2001' which more overtly references the Upstairs Downstairslike relationship between masters and servants.".

	schema:reviewBody "I looked up this movie on IMDb fully expecting to find a lot of comments that reflected my opinion that this is a great little film. I was quite surprised at how many people don't feel the same way I do.Some of the movies detractors seem to suggest the movie is a bit slow and that it misses opportunities for packing in lots of jokes. I can't agree I think the pace is just right and that the movie's direction is more deftly handled than you might think. Some of the set ups in this film are developed meticulously over time allowing plenty of humorous moments along the way to the payoff. And when they payoff they payoff beautifully. For example I love the scene in which a German mercenary enters a really dangerous looking Mexican bar. The room is full of thugs and cutthroats who laugh at the German's prim appearance and so he kills a few of them. He then instructs the rest of the patrons to be more respectful of strangers and to expect some friends of his to drop in later. The mercenary leaves and soon the Three Amigos arrive wearing camp looking Mexican costumes. It's not long before they start to sing an extremely girly song to the patrons of the bar called My Little Buttercup. The song is accompanied by the most effeminate dance routine committed to film. The mystified bandits all assume the Three Amigos are the German mercenary's friends and go along with the song and dance routine which after a while becomes so cute it makes you feel physically sick.And here is the pay off the Amigos leave as the real mercenaries arrive one of the bandits notices the pearl handled revolvers one of the strangers is wearing and yells Look at the sissy guns. Carnage ensues the German sharp shooters finish off the rest of the patrons in a bloody gun fight the confused looks on the bandit's faces throughout this whole routine is hilarious.This film isn't desperate to pack gags into every available space and because of this it feels more controlled and less tryhard to me most of the jokes are of a high enough quality they don't need a lot of superfluous back up gags. I also enjoy the overall up beat tone of the film even the bad guys are actually really nice to each other  the sweater Scene is touching . I think it's the warmth between the characters that really makes this film for me I think if the gags kept coming at a breakneck speed we wouldn't have a chance to warm to the characters the Mexican atmosphere and music the way that we do. I give this a ten out of ten even though it's not a perfect film it makes me feel as good as a perfect film would.".

Riddled with laughs upon laugh upon laughs this wildly enjoyable romp through the open desert could only have been accomplished by three of our favorite comedians.Those are Steve Martin Chevy Chase and Martin Short. To say that anyone in today's cinema can come close to the genius of these three powerhouses would be a lie. While I do believe that Ryan Reynolds is a very close to becoming the next Chase nobody else can match their style humor and elegance. Comedy was not just a job for these three it was an art.Three Amigos places us in a small town that is searching for some heroes that will help them get rid of some local hoodlums. Mistaking the opportunity as work our three protagonists rush into the town prepared for the show of a lifetime. Little do they know they are soon going to be fighting life and death. Thankfully seriousness is in low amounts in this film and comic hijinks ensure. Our three stumble through bars the desert and the final hideaway before their creative finale.I remember watching this film with my family when I was really young. I remember laughing at everything these three bumbling idiots did and how impressed I was by the grace they did it with. As I grew older this film remained with me. These three actors represent some of the funniest moments in cinematic history and here they are gathered together to make a film. I loved this movie. I loved the absurdity the randomness and the sheer fun of these types of films. I miss this type of physical pseudointellectual humor. I miss laughing as much as I did when I first watched this film and when I watch it over and over again. The simplistic nature of this film allows it to be enjoyed at any time during your life. Martin Short and Chase are at the top of their game and never let go. It is sad to see these actors getting less and less work today. Overall this film impressed me. It is funny enjoyable and so silly that you don't need to wade through the bathroom humor to get to the good stuff. It is all right there. I suggest this film to anyone that is looking to laugh and be entertained!Grade  out of ".

The funniest characters in the film are the villains led by El Guapo played by Alfonso Arau. He is almost indescribable. All he has to do is open his mouth and show his bad teeth and then give his huge smile and I crack up every time.The three leads  played by Steve Martin Matin Short and Chevy Chase  are all excellent and in the primes of their careers. The film also is directed by John Landis who has a knack for directing extremely entertaining movies. Just look at his resume on the IMDb. This film was written by Martin Lorne Michales of Saturday Night Live and songwriter Randy Newman. Kudos to all of them for a job well done.In addition to the great comedy decent language and color characters both good guys and bad guys was the beautiful cinematography.

More the combination of having super star comedian's Steve Martin Chevy Chase and Martin Short share the silver screen in one film. This was the first and last film with this particular cast of talented comedians.The Three Amigos is about three early film heroes with funny names who lose their favor with the film studio they work for. Afterwards these three doofuses in real life mistakenly except a show appearance in Mexico. Of course the Amigos have no idea their soon to be infamous costar is actually a real villain and the show is a real life struggle with a group of bandits. It's a real showdown.By the end of the film the Amigos become the film stars they were but in real life. There are trials and difficulties they must face along the way providing for some interesting and varying situations. There is simple comedy throughout the film from beginning to ending. This movie will not challenge you to think but it will appeal to your funny bone. Really intellectual comedy would not have fit into this film giving the sort of thick headed nature of the main characters.Timing of these comedy masters is excellent which makes the movie appealing and entertaining and that is why the film is successful. Above all that is what is so great about this film. It's three stars giving their best plus a great supporting cast of wellknown and not so wellknown actors and actresses.Technically this film is put together pretty well. You'll appreciate varying camera angles nice sets and colorful outdoor scenery. Production values are at least average and there's some nice attention to detail. You will notice for example many of the bandidos have bad teeth. Something classic western movies are often knocked for but this movie takes into account.Over all for most watching this film should be an enjoyable for those with average sense of humor. Trying to take this film too seriously would definitely be a mistake. Those viewers prone to do so should probably pick a different movie off the rack.810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Three Amigos is one of those movies that can be hugely entertaining and amusing but only if you keep in mind that it is not a serious film. Chevy Chase Martin Short and Steve Martin some of the funniest men ever to work in comedy all team up here as The Three Amigos a group of out of work actors in early Hollywood cinema. The unfortunate thing is that this is not a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts since I would expect more from actors with the caliber of Martin Chase and Short even working individually but even the fact that they are all not used to their full potential is not enough to bring down the rest of the comedy here.The story involves the three out of work silent film actors who suddenly find themselves unemployed and broke when they receive a telegram from a small village in Mexico desperately asking their assistance. I liked how clever the ploy was where the woman who sent the message was so poor that she could not afford enough words to make her desires clear so the Amigos read the message and think that they are about to be paid a fortune just to make an appearance in this village. Naturally they jump at the chance since they have nothing better to do.Most of the rest of the film deals with their adventures in this village which they are supposed to be protecting from an evil villain but do not realize that this is real life until one of them gets shot. You would think that they would have caught on sooner but on the other hand they DID happen to stumble into the only tiny village in Mexico where no one speaks Spanish so it's not hard to understand why they thought the whole thing was a set up. If I went to Mexico and was walking around a dusty village with nothing but endless desert on every side and every single person was speaking only English I would also wonder what movie set I had just wandered onto. There is some interesting biblical content which is made interesting really only because of the great satire. As the Amigos are walking through the valley in the shadow of death they come upon not the talking bush or the burning bush but the SINGING bush and can't seem to get it to stop singing long enough to answer their question. Will you please stop singing and tell us if you are the singing bush!' There's a hilarious sequence right after this about the invisible horseman and just before was one of my favorite moments in the entire film when Chase attempts to get off his horse but only succeeds in getting onto the horse next to him facing backwards and seems to be unsure about what just happened. A lot of this movie is made up of funny skits which are strung along a thin and less than convincing clothesline of a plot but even though the plot itself is not very believable the movie is still very entertaining. There are a lot of scenes that seem to go too far or just don't really seem to fit with the rest of the film such as the campfire scene where all the animals join in to the campfire singing but for the most part the comedy is very good and there are a lot of memorable scenes the canteen scene in the desert for example is one to remember!. Not a film that was meant to win any Oscars but there is definitely some great comic entertainment to be had with  The Three Amigos.".

El Guapo is about as evil a villain as they come yet one can't help but find hilarity in his wide range of emotions whether it be his utter delight in receiving a sweater for his birthday in the middle of a desert in Mexico or his disappointment at his failure in courting a woman he captured from her own village literally grabbing her and hoisting her on his horse and whose village he had repeatedly pillaged and harassed. The scenarios director John Landis creates in relation to the Amigos thinking their bout with El Guapo's gang is part of a show they were hired to perform the cultural misunderstandings the negative effects of stereotyping put on display... it has far more comedic material than can be found in say 10 strong comedies of today.There are numerous scenes and lines that on the surface may not seem entirely funny at first but upon repeated viewing are appreciated for the hilarious situations they really are. Three Amigos is a comedy that will never be confused with a drama or romantic film yet the jokes are so subtle and welldelivered that those who do not normally find slapstick funny will appreciate that Three Amigos gives one the opportunity to laugh without being told to do so.".

The fight outfits have all sorts of embroidery on them  not like the townspeople's outfits at all.  You know that what the movie has just claimed has happened has not happened that way at all.

It's underrated a bit but not by much.Steve Martin Martin Short and Chevy Chase star as film stars in the depressionera their show is about three Amigos that fight bad guys down in Mexico. Eventually due to low ratings of some sort their show is canceled and they are all thrown out of Hollywood. But then at the lowpoint of their life and career they get an offer from a Mexican woman. She has seen their show and thinking the show and the three men are genuine wants them to come to Mexico to help rid her town of bad guys that come through every day to steal food money etc...Martin and co. think the woman is interested in making a television show so they eagerly follow her down to Mexico to shoot the film. When they find upon arrival that it is NOT a film but rather all very real. Now the guntoting fakes will have to learn how to really aim a gun if they wish to succeed.Three Amigos! has some pretty weak gags and the film becomes tiresome after a while especially some scenes around the town in Mexico. But the scenes like the one where Martin and co. sing My Little Buttercup in the local bar in town is unmissable.Steve Martin and Martin Short do well. Chase hinders their comedic timing a bit but not by much. Overall they are a pretty good comic trio. I've always been a fan of Martin and Short and...well...I liked Chase in Vacation so I think they really make this movie. It would be no better than the dirt on my boots if not for the comedians in this film. Because of themespecially if you're fans of the comediansthis film is worth viewing. It's not particularly great in fact it's pretty average material but Martin and co. make it worth seeing at least once. Definitely worth catching on TV but don't go out of your way to see it.35 stars John Ulmer".

The locations shooting as well as the stuff filmed on the soundstage are colorful perfectly lit and framed and are basically eye candy. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is perfect in every way. Randy Newman's songs are fabulous and his singing as the 'singing bush' is hilarious. The absolute best part of the movie is the Blue Shadows sequence featuring Chevy Chase Steve Martin and Martin Short singing a western ballad written by Randy Newman while surrounded by a campfire singing horses with mouth movements handanimated that are better than much of today's CGI lots of animatronics critters listening in and probably the most beautiful sunset ever filmed indoors on a soundstage I might add. I could never tire of that song or the segment. Otherwise there are much better movies with Chase Short and Martin although not together. Either you love this film or you don't. I fall in the 'love' category but it's still not a great movie. The predictable plot and sometimes repetitive slapstick can be grating on the nerves at times. Still the good parts far outweigh the notsogood and it actually gets better with multiple viewings. Maybe it's just taking me longer to finally get it.".

When all hope seems lost one of the girls from the village Carmen sees a showing of The Three Amigos about three warriors who protect the peace and at the end of the particular show she watches refuse to take the reward money because the justice is their reward.  Believing that this is her village's one chance at freedom from El Guapo Carmen sends for the Three Amigos promising a huge reward if they come assuming that they will turn it down like they did in the show.Of course as we all in the real world know The Three Amigos is merely a TV show that on the very day that Carmen's telegraph reaches them is canceled and the actors fired.  Lucky Star Martin Dusty Bottoms Chase and Ned Nederlander Short read the telegraph and mistake it as a request for them to act out the show and in desperate need of money take up the offer and head down to Mexico.  Things get crazy as villagers praise the warriors while Lucky Ned and Dusty simply believe that these people are just big fans.  However when they discover that it's real!! the guys must make a decision to go back to Hollywood or become the Three Amigos... for real.Most people on this message board have said that they're not big fans of the movie but I personally love it and wish that I could find it on DVD.  If you're not a fan of slapstick or just don't like Steve Martin Chevy Chase or Martin Short then yeah I wouldn't recommend this movie.

Having been forced into exile after the Glorious Revolution deposed his mother Isabella II Mercedes Vecino from the throne in 1868  Alfonso studied in France . There he meets Maria De Las Mercedes Paquito Rico and he has a crush on her . His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870  and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup carried out by General Martnez Campos who proclaimed in Sagunto  Alfonso XII as King of Spain . Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo Jose Marco Davo took power as Premier  the new King  proclaimed on 29 December 1874  arrived at Madrid  passing through Barcelona and Valencia and was acclaimed everywhere 1875 . Initially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister  what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the politicaladministrative positions of power in reality ushered in a permanent civilian regime that lasted until the 1931 Second Republic . Cnovas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration . In 1876 Alfonso signs the Constitution of 1876  and carries out a vigorous campaign against the Carlists  in which the young king took part  resulted in the defeat of Don Carlos and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle . He also terminated the Cuba War  as the victory over the New Yorkbacked Cuban revolutionaries and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able King and Alfonso is nicknamed the pacifier . In 1885  Alfonso died  just short of his 28th birthday at the Royal Palace of El Pardo .

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Haywire is not really appealing. It's about someone tough who got betrayed then wants revenge. It's been used in so many action films. But Haywire has a different purpose to exist. It's about giving Gina Carano her own show with Steven Soderbergh's direction. It's pretty fascinating. Both merits cover the cookiecutterness of the plot. It's not your standard action film with senseless explosions and mediocre dumbness. It's a film with art style and action scenes that are ridiculous and realistic. It's short but it's still worth the ride.The film isn't really trying to be original big or loud. Haywire is one of Soderbergh's experiments. The story may not be original but he tells it in a pretty clever way. The first half of the film takes place on a car and shows a lot of flashbacks. The scenes are pretty slick. The action is silent but it's pretty awesome. Gina Carano made every fights dangerously exciting. The other stars does their thing but they don't appear that much. It's one of Soderbergh's trademarks. He casts some big stars but they end up being minor characters. Well this is Carano's show. It's all about her.The only thing that disappoints me here is it's too short and there are only few fight scenes. But there are still some action scenes that are pretty exciting like the car chase in New York and the SWAT chase in Dublin were well shot and have a good amount of suspense. The rest of the filmmaking Well written. The score is fancy. The cinematography and editing are simply art.Haywire is as simple as it gets. It may not be a fast action blockbuster but it is more interesting than that. It's not quite recommendable to everyone unless you like art films Soderbergh's directing style or Gina Carano. No female action star can fight like Gina Carano. It's fun to see her beat up all of these men. Since we are now stuck with action films with mediocre filmmaking at least we get to see another classy action film like this. But the true core of this film is Gina Carano.".

I believe this film has flaws but as a whole is a very unique and special experience. When I watched this film it was not like any film that I had seen before from the camera angles sound choices etc. I felt some of the sound choices were strange but it went with the whole flow of the movie. This movie is NOT a standard action movie but more like watching art. There were few fight scenes but the fight scenes that are in the movie have a raw feeling to them and are extremely well choreographed. They are believable because the main character's hand to hand fights are all one on one with the exception of one fight in which she is fighting two people. But it is believable because she gets a surprise attack on the two people. The other fights she is fighting people her size except for one fight in which she was getting her ass handed to her until someone else joined in and helped her.I think people were either expecting an ACTION action movie or a Oscar worthy drama but this movie is neither. It has a very surreal feeling and it can be slow but it has a very real feeling to it as well and is more like an experience then a movie. The fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission and seeing the birth of a legitimate female action star. Was her acting stellar? No but it was pretty good especially for someone who has never acted before. She can only improve from here.".

If you are expecting Fast and Furious or some other schlock like that this is not the movie for you. There are intense action scenes and slower parts where the story really unfolds.

But it's the athletic and talented female lead notsoknown Gina Carano who carries the movie forward. She's like the female Bourne. I wonder why she hasn't done more movies.The action sequences between Carano and the male actors are uniquely brilliant the male and the female punch hit and kick each other with the same amount of raw brutal force which is not usually seen in movies. In that regard the movie is quite feminist in my opinion. And the fact that no sound effect or background score is used during the fight scenes make the sequences feel more real and effective.The editing is tight the camerawork is beautiful the background score is minimal and the story doesn't try too hard to be complex which makes the movie an exhilarating ride.".

All the strikes and grips because of this looked fake. Overall bad and unconvincing action  chases were about mindless running there were nothing special about them despite all the tries. I wish my English allowed me to explain it better but i will do my best if you as a director want something fight or running scene to look real it would be wise to do some research otherwise you will get really poor result. For example in the Barcelona chase Jina's bottom was wobbling  nobody runs like this in the real life if he was in army because you know everything you do in the army is running. It's just looks unprofessional and fake. Script is on same level of quality  huge conspiracy with big plot holes. Just bad movie.".

IMDb published an interview of Antonio Banderas on Haywire but I wonder why. His screen time is less than 5 minutes in total and not the most interesting 5 minutes either. Reasons are not explained characters are not detailed it is not a respectable film overall. Some people called Mallory the female Bourn. That is another mystery because when I saw the world through Bourn's eyes I never had any problem understanding what he was feeling or going through. In this film I had no attachment with any of the characters. If the bad guys just killed Gina Carano in the middle of the film I would not really feel any different because I had no idea why a bunch of people were just randomly hurting shooting at or killing each other. I read a review a while back where someone criticized those who came to watch this film expecting a real action film or some award winning performances. He wrote he liked this film honestly because of the surreal feel. I can kind of appreciate his remark. Surrealism and retardedness are two extremes that can sometimes cross over from one side to the other. For mentally healthy people who expect to see female Bourn with stylish performances from McGregor Banderas Fassbender etc. I do not recommend this film at all. The film is well shot well edited the soundtrack is not too horrible so I give it a 5. If I had to rate only the substance I would rate it 1 like many others have done.".

The painful dialogue and nonexistent plot line almost made me leave in the middle of the movie. However I stayed waiting for the plot to take forum and for the action to pick up... it never did. Not a single character is developed throughout the movie and for the most part it is just a series of bland discussions that are pointless until the end of the movie. This isn't a Fight Club or Usual Suspects twist ending either it is just simply a recap of what had happened. While the plot is bad it is hardly the worst part of the movie. Some of the action scenes are just incredibly boring. While I wasn't expecting a well developed plot going into this movie I did expect good action sequences. Whether it was the car chase where she is driving backwards at about 5 miles per hour or the stupid sprint on the beach it was astoundingly boring. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the number of movies Soderbergh already made and most of them really good he proved to be an eclectic director traveling thru all kind of genres effortless delivering alternative approaches without getting so much away of the mainstream. He makes American movies but for a different American audience and sometimes Hollywood movies but for those who want something a little different from the obvious. And that way Soderbergh proved to be one of the top directors of his time but that is also his main problem because people usually overrate his movies a lot.He made a huge campaign about Haywire stating that his decision to make this action movie is for the fact that great action movies wasn't being produced anymore. And great action movies for him is those Chuck Norrisish ones with a real bad ass action star able to make an entire scene without stunts or so many edition tricks. So he met MMA fighter Gina Carano and so he decided to make a movie specially for her. He also stated that he wanted to make a kick ass movie with a female leading different from the others while most of action movies use their sexuality more than their fighting skills. He succeeds. Gina Carano's expertise really dismiss stunts and the results are intense and realistic scenes.Being an MMA fighter Gina Carano delivers a fair performance but of course that she is better fighting than acting.The movie gives what it promises and Soderbergh tries to keep the actions scenes focused entirely on the fighting performances and chasing sequences never using soundtracks or gun shots more than the necessary to not overshadow all the technical attention he so wanted to experience. And it works but not entirely. For ordinary audience the movie may not be what they seek and that may be frustrating.The plot is extremely predictable and common an agent that has been betrayed and now has to clean up all the mess to get back a normal life she so desperately want. And we know Soderbergh a lot and we know that he makes huge twists and turns over a simple plot just to give the false impression that his movies aren't brainless.Anyway... I admire his efforts to bring back old technical visions into his movies but Haywire doesn't get off so much of the line as he so hardly stated. Still being a great action movie and like Hanna 2011 it is not an action movie for ordinary audience and ordinary action lovers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Soderbergh has a reputation for directing films that are great weird or anywhere in between. You can however always depend on the right pieces to be in place as he has a devoted following of Alist actors who agree to star in everything he does. With Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Ewan McGregor Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender in supporting roles Haywire certainly has a large part of the equation covered in order to work but it falls decidedly in the anywhere in between category.MMA fighter Gina Carano is the foundation around which Haywire attaches its many Oscar caliber ornaments. A freshfaced action star padded with so many superb talents Carano automatically rises to the top of this vanilla actionthriller concoction. Despite some really wooden line delivery in a number of scenes she's got action star chops and her character contracted black ops agent and exmarine Mallory Kane isn't treated differently for being female.Haywire isn't quite bythenumbers as far as modern postBourne special agent action thrillers go nothing by Soderbergh ever is but it places all its novelty in Carano's hands. She's an entertaining watch but she's not going to take generic material and make it awesome  no one's that talented.Lem Dobbs' screenplay isn't really a problem as plenty of films in the genre have been made out of worse but neither he nor Soderbergh make an argument for why you should watch Haywire instead of another movie or even another viewing of any Bourne film other than to see all the stars that have been collected to play minor characters.Haywire follows a classic betrayed agent looking for revenge premise. Mallory is an asset working for a private ops contractor named Kenneth McGregor who is thinking about getting out. The film opens after he's betrayed her and left her for dead in Dublin and she's set to meet with him in upstate New York except he sends her coworker Aaron Tatum who attacks her in order to bring her in. She breaks his arm and escapes in the car of a random person at the diner Michael Angarano and tells him the whole story of her betrayal as she flees.Soderbergh downright refuses to follow some of the most fundamental conventions of the action genre in this film which keeps Haywire fresh but ultimately renders it somewhat stagnant. The trade off for avoiding something stylistically generic is depriving the audience of some of the usual tactics of action films to engage and maintain interest. With a short run time Haywire never gets too boring but it does at times feel flat.The technique Soderbergh uses that stands out the most involves flipping the traditional use of scoring in an action film. Whereas most movies use silence to build suspense and then use music to underscore the intensity of an action sequence Soderbergh does the opposite he enlists David Holmes of the Ocean's films to create syntheticsounding '70s action music leading up to action confrontations and then cuts the sound completely to make the fighting feel more raw and natural. It has an interesting effect that manages to work in the fight scenes but it sets an awkward tone for the buildup given how dated the music sounds.The handtohand or I should say foottothroat combat scenes we get are rather exciting with this raw presentation and it suits Carano well given her talents before she decided to try acting. She is definitely beautiful but she's not ladylike and as you watch her you aren't distracted by her sex. The point is that it would be wrong to categorize her as a femme fatale or anything we've previously seen in this genre. She's an action star and she earns it here.Solid is one and perhaps the most applicable of the many unremarkable yet reputable adjectives one could use to describe Haywire. Its detractors will likely come from disappointment over potential rather than poor filmmaking and considering the names on the poster it's not an unwarranted complaint. One could also argue that without the level of pedigree the material wouldn't warrant any attention but the bargain bin. Best then to attribute to Haywire's lack of being special to some miscalculation on all fronts. Fortunately it's quite tolerable nonetheless.Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody " www.ramascreen.com Director Steven Soderbergh doing an action flick starring a real MMA fighter what is there not to like about HAYWIRE?! Plus it's written by Lem Dobbs who gave us Soderbergh's old great film The Limey. You want another reason to like HAYWIRE? How 'bout this the supporting actors are Alist names who are on top of their game. O and did I mention that Gina Carano kicks serious ass because unlike skinny Saldana or Jolie Carano can literally kick your ass. Action film doesn't get more grounded and more solid than HAYWIRE..Steven Soderbergh is one of those filmmakers who I can easily trust by that I mean whenever I hear there's a film made by Soderbergh you can count me in because I know I'll be treated with good stories handled by a master who always aims to dig deeper and find those extra layers. I wasn't too crazy about Contagion but that was mostly because the film bit off more than it could chew. I personally don't find Dobb's HAYWIRE script to be too complex I actually find the whole thing a bit thin but it's not too simple that it might insult your intelligence. You could see the pawns in this chess game who's pulling the strings which one has more power over the others beware the quiet ones but the story fits nicely in between one action sequence after another. They mean to design HAYWIRE as a throwback to old James Bond films but I think HAYWIRE has enough kicks to be taken as an original espionage thriller.What I appreciate about HAYWIRE is that it's not an overthetop excessive CGladen action film. Other films brag about being grounded in reality I think HAYWIRE can shut their mouths because for the most part of the film what you see is what you get. And no offense to Statham's beating up 50 guys at a time which is excitingly farfetched but what Carano's character Mallory Kane offers is a more creative set of fighting styles and the result is a very realistic choreography each fight doesn't drag often times it's just one two move and done. Little to no acrobatic wire work and lavish special effects. The action in this film is physically possible. I think it's brilliant that Soderbergh chooses to not have any music accompany the fight sequences there's music for the car chases and the dramatic scenes and when shots are fired but as soon as the fights start all you see and hear are the fights. Brilliant!I'm saving the best part for this last paragraph Gina Carano. What a revelation! Finally a convincing believable female action star who can also look elegant and beautiful. At first I was a bit concerned knowing that I'd be watching a film where a bunch of guys famous guys I might add were punching and kicking a woman. But after researching more on Carano I became more concerned for the guys instead. Actingwise I think Carano does a fine job she looks like a fast and disciplined learner she holds her ground when facing such giants as Banderas and Douglas who've been in the business for years. Carano is sexy and lethal. My favorite scene would have to be the brutal handtohand combat between Carano's character Mallory Kane and Michael Fassbender's character Paul in the hotel room. It's intense chaotic and thrilling. The first fight scene with Tatum is just as badass because you never know how far they'd hurt each other. But I'm sure that being a fighter Carano finds all that to be her comfort zone. I hope we'll see her in more action films because she has what it takes her future is bright in cinema. www.ramascreen ".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to begin it was just awful. Reviews with a negative base are never taken seriously or noted as helpful but I am here to tell you DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! There has been so much praise and hype about this movie its mind boggling. I enjoy an action movie heck I even enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's movie Contraband. Gina Carano simply cannot act. Not even a little bit. I heard they reedited her voice for the movie and for the life of me I can't imagine it was worse then it is now. The scenes were painfully long and incredibly slow. The fighting was predictable and terrible. Now let's talk about the movie.The movie starts with Gina a special op for hire meeting a colleague for some unspecified covert meet and some nondescript diner. After some Thoroughly confusing double talk a fight ensues. This quick action and actually decent fight scene gets ones hopes up that we may be in store for a good movie quickly deteriorates to the dumbest escape scenes ever. This entails hijacking a random car with a guy who she proceeds to tell her out of Sequence life story to. The storytelling is fractured and set in a 70's kind of vibe and feel very similar to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but not remotely as successful.I could bore you with details about how there's a double cross and she wants to get even with everybody but why? The movie is packed with stars and directed by Soderbergh and can't manage to be watchable. With low expectations I was still brutally disappointed. Do yourself a favor if you must see itwait till redbox. Even then it will suck but you'll only be out 1.50 for Bluray.".

	schema:reviewBody "I kept waiting for this movie to suck ... but it never really did.Generally I check reviews and ratings before I rent movies but this one caught my eye at the video shop. I did however check IMDb before I watched it and figured I had made a mistake and was in for some tedious viewing.But instead I found it very good indeed. Yes there are plot holes. Yes the acting isn't stellar and the basic scenario has been done many times before but come on people you need to take it on its own terms and in terms of the basic agent out in the cold actionthriller with the usual shady dealingsbetrayals in high places it acquits itself very well.I'm generally pretty critical  Hanna for instance a similar tale but with a young girl rather than a woman was preposterous from start to finish.There will probably never be a truly realistic action film. Most fights in the real world end quickly with one person writhing on the ground in pain which is not very entertaining. So all action films  including the Gold Standard Bourne series  have to have supposedly highly trained killers slugging away with blow after blow that would fell an ox and somehow our hero escapes broken bones massive swelling or even serious bruising. Even gunshot wounds only cause minor discomfort and seem always to come right overnight.So we have to suspend disbelief and this movie doesn't overly strain that capacity in my view. The fights were gritty and involving the photography was excellent. The supporting characters were wellcast and believable. The lead actress gave a very credible portrayal of the sort of person she was supposed to be.All in all I was very satisfied and enjoyed a good evening's entertainment.".

We know from the very beginning who set her up and keep asking why is she even after Kenneth to begin with. Why does an agent go to mission with real name and everybody knows about her family history who her dad is where he lives what he does and still make a nice scene with him when they want her dead. It doesn't even look like an action movie action scenes make you feel ashamed for their quality. The storyline is hilariously stupid. I am absolutely disappointed by my time being wasted can't even understand how McGregor Douglas Banderas  Tatum agreed to play in a movie like this. You watch it and then you would be like What the hell?!".

	schema:headline " Good action movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Haywire is about a female special ops agent who has been set up while on a mission and her effort to get herself out of any more trouble for she's still being chased. The film covers the story usually back and forth with many agents involved. Gina Carano and her fighting skills have been chosen for the leading role alongside an interesting supporting cast such as Antonio Banderas Michael Douglas Ewan McGregor Channing Tatum Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender. Nevertheless the film is moving around Carano's character. Douglas and McGregor seemed to play a decorative part and Banderas is charming his way through while Tatum and Fassbender get their ass kicked pretty well! Don't expect jaw dropping performances because mostly it's all about the action.The outcome looked like a RichieTarantino attempt. Lots of action and mystery with a little bit of sarcasm and a weird selection of music. Not bad David Holmes in charge but at a few points it just seemed that it didn't match the scenes.A nice action film. No need for high or low expectations. Steven Soderbergh is just trying stuff. Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " A smart action flick that doesn't opt to be literally Haywire.";
	schema:reviewBody "It has more brutal action scenes than Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. It has a female lead hotter than the one of Battle LA in fact Michelle Rodriguez is probably the best actress who Gina Carano can be reasonably compared to who provides a better leading performance than Zoe Saldana in Colombiana. And it is boasting a better cast than Cowboys and Aliens  Haywire is arguably the best piece of filmmaking in the action genre in recent memory.This could obviously be expected by Steven Soderbergh still one of America's most consistent directors. His film has a brain and utilises it and this experimentation of the action genre is a unique one especially in the superbly engineered action scenes. He has avoided to use background music as an intensifier and it works giving the action scenes a very high level of brutality as every fist impacting the human body is heard. And he has avoided the shaky cam technique as an intensifier simply because there's no need. It's brutal enough without the standard exhilarating background music.The stellar cast of this action picture have rewarded his direction with brilliant performances Gina Carano in particular as aforementioned. They empower the story of a gutsy fearless asskicking woman determined to avenge herself even with a loss of trust for anyone willing to take her side after the doublecrossing and the small amount of genuine help.The plot itself is told in a disjointed way which is honestly a criticism to be made of the film because I believe that it will leave several people scratching their heads for some time during their viewing experience. But if you can get your head around it and should really be able to once you complete the pieces of the puzzle you will have experienced an intelligent action thriller from an intelligent director. A great start to the new year.Watch it if you like new takes on genres willing to view something with a brain especially if you just saw something stupid like New Years Eve recently are a fan of Steven Soderbergh and his smart direction looking to begin your 2012 cinema experience with something good. Don't watch it if you expect something on the same scale of blockbuster action as MI4Sherlock Holmes 2.".
