Although a lot of the plot elements are old standbys of the genre there are some nice twists and the lowkey humor usually works fairly well too.The film begins with a playwright a theatrical producer and the producer's assistant getting stranded in the country and seeking refuge in a large gloomy old house.  The playwright happens to know the occupants and it turns out that the house had been the scene of a stillunsolved murder some years previously.  At dinner the producer and his assistant listen uncomfortably as everyone else discusses the old murder.  Suddenly the lights go out and then  then comes a pretty nice twist which most viewers should find surprising and satisfying.  It sets the stage for the rest of the action and is quickly followed by some other twists.The story that follows is routine in parts but it is entertaining and has just enough unpredictability to keep the viewer's attention until the end. There is a lot of light humor most of which is handled pretty well by the cast.If you like oldfashioned mystery stories that do not take themselves too seriously you will probably find The Ghost Walks worth watching.".

Mr. Arthur is great in his role of Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the Broadway producer Herman Wood played by another great character actor Richard Carle.They play off of each other superbly.Although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.The mystery angle of the film is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.For a low budget poverty row picture this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.Director Frank Strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.This film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films old dark house mysteries they actually managed to work in the lines It was a dark and stormy nightand it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.This movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the Internet Archive at archive.org.".

	schema:headline " A nice surprise!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the murder mystery as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade in which the first movies of the genre were produced. Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after Warner Bros. picked his threeact play The Wax Works to create the 1933 horror film Mystery of the Wax Museum. Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to keep making films and The Ghost Walks was one of his best.In The Ghost Walks John Miljan plays Prescott Ames a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood Richard Carle with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer Johnny Arthur to his country house for a reading of his play but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. The three men ask for refugee in an old Mansion which happens to be property of one of Ames' old acquaintances. Inside the house Wood and Homer witnesses the strange relationship between Ames and the house owners however this is all a plan conceived to impress Wood everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately the murder committed is done for real and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake after discovering Ames' original plan the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.As expected Charles Belden's screenplay for The Ghost Walks features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy. However what's interesting here is how Belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clichs of murder mystery plays. The dialogs are excellent full of wit and lighthearted charm and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end it follows the murder mystery routine anyways it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters. Interestingly there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.By 1934 director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the Poverty row side of the film industry but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies and The Ghost Walks was one of them. While obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time Strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story. The pacing is a little too slow at times but Strayer knew that the power of his film was on Belden's script and makes the most of it letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results. Certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal but Strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film.As written above the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine and fortunately most of the cast play with this to their advantage. Veteran character actor Richard Carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer Herman Wood adding a lot of charm to his character specially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant. John Miljan is just effective as Presocott Ames nothing amazing but nothing really bad and the same could be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw the obligatory love interest whom is just fine. However Donald Kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious Terry Shaw and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time.As usual with Frank R. Strayer films the low budget hurts the film badly as while Strayer makes the best he can the film still feels kind of plain at times. However the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments. It also must be said that while effective in their roles Miljan and Collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to Arthur and Carle and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple. Finally as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts although credit must go to Belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end.One could say that Charles Belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the B movie studios nicknamed as the Poverty Row The Ghost Walks is easily among the best alongisde Strayer's previous film The Vmapire Bat despite its shortcomings. And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play. A very recommended film if you like the genre. 710".

But at the same time it's also one of the very first and best spoofs on the genre  and the scary moments are really masterfully mixed with the comic ones!

But the balance between mystery and comedy is being held really perfectly throughout the whole movie so it should provide unforgettable entertainment for ALL classic movie fans with a sense of humor  a much underestimated little B movie gem that should certainly get more attention by film historians so that a wider audience will be able to get to know and enjoy it!".

Beatrice Eve Southern is convinced her late husband was murdered and goes into trances when she communicates with him. There is a showdown at dinner with accusations flying thick and fast  the lights go out and Beatrice disappears. It is all too much for Wood and Erskine who go to their room intending to leave. But things are not as they appear  Ames has masterminded the whole evening  it is the first act from his new play and everyone at the house is an actor rounded up by Gloria June Collyer Ames' fiance. Woods and Erskine cotton on when they find the play The Ghost Walks in their room but meanwhile someone is taking things seriously because Beatrice is found murdered.A knock at the door is heard and a keeper from the local sanitarium is enquiring about an escaped patient. At the sanitarium we call him Case 202  I guess you'd call him a homicidal maniac!!!! Of course while everyone is now in a panic Woods and co still think it is part of the play and are constantly making jokes!! Ames then tells how he came by the house  it was once owned by a mad doctor who had 9 patients that mysteriously disappeared. It then got the reputation as a haunted house. When a portrait winks at Erskine he finally gets the message that this is not a game  meanwhile half the guests have mysteriously disappeared.....While the play within a play was ho hum to Broadway audiences it was still a novel idea to film patrons of the mid thirties. This is a quite enjoyable film that is very easy to watch and even though Johnny Arthur is one of the leads he is quite funny and the laughs don't get in the way. It is just so nice to see John Miljan as a likable hero with no nasty secrets to hide and June Collyer is just as beautiful as ever as the love interest. Johnny Arthur specialised in whiny effeminate types  typical was his role as Homer Erskine.".

However there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew and despised. However while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. However partway through the ruse the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. What no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plotmaking for some wonderful twists and turns. So when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. While I have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourselfand it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing.Considering that this is a Bmovie in the public domain I certainly did NOT have very high hopes for this little film. However I was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flickwith a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichd plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. Plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even betterwith lots of sparkling wit and a nice lighthearted pace. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's occasionally amusing  a story about seven people in a haunted house on a stormy night. One by one four of them disappear evidently one of them murdered.There's a lot of shouting and carrying on. One of the characters  the secretary of a Broadway producer  is gay and I'm glad because he gets most of the funny lines and bits of business. I suppose some people today would argue that the character's flamboyance is politically incorrect but I'm sure that if this were shown in the Castro Theater it would get belly laughs and applause.The plot is hardly worth going on about. I always enjoy the notion of a handful of people stuck in a country mansion during a fierce electrical storm but the writers have to DO something with the proposition. After all it's not funny in itself. Neil Simon did an exceptional job with it in Murder By Death using some of the same hoary tactics. Two living eyes stare out of a painting. All of the acting is overdone. The lines are loud and the gestures theatrical but the viewer will have to go easy on such weaknesses. It's 1934 and many of the actors of the period came from the stage. They had to shout to reach the balcony. On top of that the huge noisy cameras had to be enclosed in soundproof blimps as they were called and the microphones hidden in vases buttonholes garter belts and whatnot.It's worth a look perhaps but not two looks.".

I suppose some people today would argue that the character's flamboyance is politically incorrect but I'm sure that if this were shown in the Castro Theater it would get belly laughs and applause.The plot is hardly worth going on about. I always enjoy the notion of a handful of people stuck in a country mansion during a fierce electrical storm but the writers have to DO something with the proposition. After all it's not funny in itself. Neil Simon did an exceptional job with it in Murder By Death using some of the same hoary tactics. Two living eyes stare out of a painting. All of the acting is overdone. The lines are loud and the gestures theatrical but the viewer will have to go easy on such weaknesses. It's 1934 and many of the actors of the period came from the stage. They had to shout to reach the balcony. On top of that the huge noisy cameras had to be enclosed in soundproof blimps as they were called and the microphones hidden in vases buttonholes garter belts and whatnot.It's worth a look perhaps but not two looks.";

So he tricks him into a strange house where actors are assembled to perform the thing as if it were a real spooky murder. The pretend victim ends up dead in reality and from then on the players leave the play and enter reality. The producer discovers the ruse at this point so he shifts from believing it real to believing the real thing is a play.Overlain on all this is another drama. A madman has escaped from the local loony bin. It turns out that he also is a consummate actor and he has his own fantasy to enact. It also draws from spooky movies but in his case it is the mad scientist genre rather than the spooky detective story. These two fictions compete for dominance in the spooky house.The actual production is plain with values typical of the period which means that you will likely find it boring. But the idea is remarkable.One folded joke the producer is coughing. His assistant says are you okay? Producer Sure why? Assistant Because you were coughing horribly. Producer You think you can do better?Charles Belden the writer was a sort of genius at these sorts of folded things.

However a fallen tree on the road prevents that as their car becomes stranded the three decide to head to the nearest house for help  shelter. They arrive at a large mansion where Dr. Kent Henry Kolker lives he is treating a patient named Beatrice Eve Southern who has psychological problems after the murder of her husband three years ago in that very mansion. With other assorted guests Ames Woods  Erskine decide to stay the night but strange things begin to happen  when Beatrice is found dead it seems that there is a killer amongst them...Directed by Frank R. Strayer this obscure hard to find old dark haunted house type horror mystery from the 30's is alright but nothing overly special. The script by Charles Belden shoots it's load far too early for my liking the main plot twist is revealed about 20 minutes in  isn't a bad twist at all but afterwards the films becomes a rather bog standard mystery with an extremely predictable  routine ending which I was surprised the makers went for purely because it is so obvious  because they tried to inject some mystery  suspense in the film which the ending is totally at odds with. Maybe back in the mid 30's audiences hadn't seen too many films like this but then again you would have to be pretty dumb not to figure this one out even back in the 30's. The character's are alright but the comedy relief Woods  his secretary Erskine become extremely annoying the running gag about being stuck in a play is frankly irritating. On the bright side it only lasts for 63 minutes so at least it's short  sweet it's watchable I suppose  will pass an hour harmlessly enough but it's not something that I think is anything special or would want to watch again anytime soon.Director Strayer does OK but of course you need to take into account the fact it was made back in the early 30's just think about that for a moment because that's over 75 years ago. It was released on December 1st 1934  that's literally a lifetime ago. The scenes set outside at night during a thunderstorm are quite atmospheric but the interior scenes are dull  bland. Unfortunately I think The Ghost Walks is a public domain film  therefore the print is not going to get cleaned up anytime soon the print quality is atrocious with a huge whacking great white line running down the right hand side of the picture for the first 15 minutes  plenty of scratches pops crackles  damage for the rest of it. Even if a big Hollywood company decided to release it would they bother to remaster it? Would they really spend time effort  money cleaning the prints up? I seriously doubt it'll ever happen  therefore The Ghost Walks will probably alway look terrible. Being shot in the 30's this is squeaky clean without any death's violence or profanity so it's family friendly stuff all the way.Technically the film is fine considering it was made over 75 years ago the black and white photography is alright although as I've mentioned the quality of the prints make it sometimes hard to sit through. The acting is OK but there are a few wooden performances here actually now I think about it there's lots of wooden performances.The Ghost Walks is an OK time waster it passes an hour but I doubt the twists will surprise anyone these days  I doubt it'll live that long in anyone's memory either. If you can actually find a copy  can live with the bad picture quality then it's just about worth a watch.".

Lauren Jeffreys is the main suspect as she had a public fight with Draper and was seen entering her building shortly before her death.  Lauren is a friend of Della's so Perry takes the case despite also being a witness for the prosecution.  Meanwhile Ken hooks up with a minorMafia hood to hunt down the real killer.If you've seen one of these things then you've seen them all. The legal realism of these shows are always very doubtful but the drama is still enjoyable. Here for Mason is a witness but is still allowed to prosecute  also they do an unusual and unfair line up in the courtroom itself! Mason does his usual ripping into the witness stuff which is good and this time it isn't as straightforward as it usually is with a view twists making the climax different from usual slightly. Ken's investigation is better than usual here and is enjoyable thanks to the presence of mobster Loomis as his partner  makes a change from Alexander Paul or some other dippy girl.Burr is as good as ever in a role that he could do in his sleep with no real difficulty.  Hale is as underused as always but seems happy to be there. Moses does his usual stuff and gets help from Clohessy best known for Ozwho is quite enjoyable despite being a bit of a caricature hey! Gone on get outta here' etc.  Muldaur is solid and is an unusually famous defendant having been in Star Trek.  DiCenzo is fun in a small role as a dressmaking mobster!Overall this doesn't really stand out from the majority of the Mason movies but if you like them then you'll like this.  It isn't the best of the series but it's as good as the rest.  Worth watching if you liked any of the other ones.".

Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much.The same perpetrator also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with his trusty investigative lawyer William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters. Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner. One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy track down the perpetrator I cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case. Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have.But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney introducing himself to Raymond Burr saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him. Foolish Boy.In fact my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Baio was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. Burr catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on cross examination. Absolutely priceless.Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.".

But Malansky is double crossed by Nardone and he abducts the suspect planning to exact revenge in his own way and the young attorney must find him and persuade the mafia lord that it is best for the suspect to appear in court and let the law take its course.";

I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events although truthfully I can't always tell exactly where he stands but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals. Most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect. I'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie. In fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another. That's not to say that there aren't characters real people but except for Jim the protagonist  a kind of '60's drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly. A few make a very powerful impression especially a gurulike taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself. When he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving Jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD is the quote The danger is clear which is taken from President Bush's speech that paved the way to our incursion into Iraq. In retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered.".

In retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered.";

I'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war. These days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there patriotism. Anyway back to this review USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether it's through politics protesting or arts or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate knowledgeable willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique astute etc. I looked through the whole site that's linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles essays etc.that are there.

I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches. It really was like taking a trip through the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really blew my mind was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. I found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. I've heard him speak before of course but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like I understood his message in a way I'd never thought about.What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? In fact there's no credits at all in the film. You have to access them by selecting them in the features. Somehow that made me think a lot. All in all I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.".

I kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks. Personally I thought the audio was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the RV with Jim the main character or in his head. Everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway this is a very amazing DVD which made me cry.".

Finally you're lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What do you wake up to? What do you do next?

This whole approach once you get used to it provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images. The sight of an innocent Ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude Sycorax in order to perform her earthy and abhorr'd commands is one of the darkest I've ever scene in a Shakespeare film. However by the end of the film I'd grown tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much to take. Still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play.".

The play's intent is still intact in the film if a little obscured by the language and is conveyed mostly through the acting and the cinematography though adapted in style to a more contemporary audience. Hence the film's inventive finale features a vocal rendition of Stormy Weather a modern metaphor for a message that spans the ages.Even with the updated visuals this film is going to be a bit much for most viewers.

Some films are designed to trigger this but once in a while some rather simple film unintentionally leads me into uncharted territory. This IS a simple unassuming film but it prompted more rumination than say Branagh's The Tempest' cleverly masquerading as Dracula.'I have had only one experience with Jarman with his Wittgenstein' which actually offended me with its lack of nuance. Jarman is that kind of artist who has a single impulse one thing to say and adapts any material to support it. Like others of this type  Stone Spike Campion  that impulse is richer than a mere political view and their expressive talent is similarly rich. But no matter how technically sweet their expression the fact remains that it is applied to a view of the world that bleaches rather than distills simplifies rather than clarifies and dulls into stereotype instead of sharpening into archetype.Shakespeare works with ideas those ideas have agency engage in being themselves and weave their own tapestry in a spiritlike world somewhat independent of human action. He expresses that tapestry in words where the manifold ambiguities and multiple threads reinforce each other idea and meaning. Those words necessitate characters and situations and such but characters are mere parts in a celestial machine. The Tempest' is to my mind the most perfect and selfreferential of his constructions the one most concerned with its own nature creation and structure. It is bottomless worthy of exploration for years.Now along comes a stage tradition that believes the entire world of drama revolves around characters the way they are written and played. Unfortunately when actors hijack Shakespeare they turn the equation on its head. Suddenly the tapestry of finely spun ideas has to be reduced to a few strong obvious threads in order to explain' and support the plot. So Romeo' becomes a love story Hamlet' about indecision and Tempest' about revenge. It is a travesty as blunt as TeeVee wrestling. Socalled schools conspire with the selfishness of the theater market to perpetuate this.Now here's my dilemma. I liked this production I really did. Miranda is supposed to be 14 sexually pure and the white space' on the conceptual palette. Greenaway's Prospero's Books'  the best film Tempest by far  understood this. Around this center of discovery which includes us the audience swirls all sorts of confabulated issues cosmic and trivial. At least in the play.Jarman gives us a different type of center a buxom sexy punk rocker who has the best understanding in the cast of vocal sculpting and presence. And at the same time Jarman so simplifies the play and characters by omission by making things clear' by using unsophisticated language by giving each character a role' that he turns the whole construction on is head. Everything else is white space EXCEPT her. She is the magician. This is truly an unsettling notion. All the swishy dancing at the end is mere background noise to this dangerous notion.The photography and staging is a treat unto itself. Of all his plays this one is the most difficult to stage because Shakespeare himself was struggling with the new technologies of the art. He created all sorts of hooks for effects and much of the action depends on those effects. Jarman's notion is inspired using the abbey as he does. It is perfect in its own way. Miranda's costume  the only one that matters  together with Ferdinand's nudity is pretty effective.So where I was expecting Shakespeare's engrossing insights on the superficialities of the world I instead find myself captivated by that very world. It may take some time to recover.See this and imagine the perfect film Tempest. At the moment I would include this dual dangerous notion of passiveaggressive sexuality in the girl as part of the ambiguity something Shakespeare couldn't do but would if he were here today. It would be between Jarman's lines and those of Larry Clark. It would be animated in the manner of Sprited Away' itself a version of the Tempest but all players would be nude. It would have grand political clockworks like Ran and simple imaginative love like Holly Golighty's. It would have the literary layering and emphasis on imagethenlanguage of Greenaway. It would have all the special effects machinery of the most popular current version of The Tempest' The Matrix' without the guns and glasses and by this I mean not the effects of the movie but of the world within. And it would be a serial.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

At its core is a comingofage story for Miranda an adolescent girl who is old enough to leave her father. She is confronted by various male archetypes before settling on the only boy her own age. The Bard of Avon's message is so normal that like should marry like that youth calls to youth and that Show Business is the process of taking these ordinary and important stories and making us pay for them by wrapping them in mystery ... well so normal that people miss the point. The play's real magic is the story of Rapunzel and Snow White and all the other fairy tales which Bruno Bettelheim has shredded to show their symbolic content. That and the language.

	schema:reviewBody "For me the Tempest and its characters by which I mean the admirable ones are like old friends. Ever since I first began to experience the play through acting classes I played Ferdinand I found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that Shakespeare created. I can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play Ferdinand after all and so I took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent Miranda.One of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them  there is always something you can discover about their character. A film production of the Tempest of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend dear to one's heart each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work. With Prospero's Books the ritual and the elegance of the play was emphasized the exuberant celebration of art within the art. Here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on floors more Aleister Crowley than Naples nobleman. It also made me reconsider  why was it that Prospero was cast out of Naples? His magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed Prospero to exile but rather the fact of his difference from his peers. So in the real world he suffered. Was cast out powerless to change the wrong to the right. All of the villains in this play whether they realize it or not act in accordance to creating a more painfilled hell of a world  it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains into his island the realm where he has absolute dominion.Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater the realm where Shakespeare dictates the events the words the outcomes. Shakespeare is of course Prospero  but what this film adaptation does that really honors the text is to make Prospero so sympathetic such a figure of reason despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational astrological texts alchemical symbols magical diagrams etc.. Is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder or to be a heretic and work towards the righting of wrongs? Prospero IS a heretic for the reason he abandons his magic is not because the books will lose their value in Naples but because they are not necessary anymore  the world itself  has become the magic of the books.In Hamlet Hamlet presents a play to his peers. The play accuses his fellows of conspiring against others for their own advancement. The reaction of the audience varies while Ophelia is puzzled Claudius reacts with stunned shock. This happens within the play and then Shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare watch for their reactions? In the tempest Prospero lives the play he is constructing and we live it with him. How do we react? Do you react with simple delight at the happy ending? Are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production which is entirely fitting given the source material? Do you feel sad at the fact that this little life the play is rounded with a sleep as transient as it is eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for mankind's life on Earth but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of petty power struggles. We have Claudiuses.Like a good friend this film is not without its flaws. I disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue. The dance of the mariners is rather tangential. But at the heart this is truly The Tempest and one of its many faces.".

	schema:headline " A confused but intriguing version of the Shakespeare play";
	schema:reviewBody "This film version of Shakespeare's play opens on an island where Prospero and his daughter Miranda have been exiled for many years along with their servant Caliban and a spirit called Ariel. Prospero is rightfully the Duke of Milan and a powerful sorcerer and while he sleeps a storm at sea wrecks a ship near the island. Aboard are the men he blames for his exile including the King of Naples and his son Ferdinand. Ferdinand is separated from the others and captured by Prospero and accused of being a spy Miranda vouches for him and gradually falls in love with him. Meanwhile others survivors plot against their king and Caliban plans to kill Prospero who he claims stole the island from him.This is the only version of 'The Tempest' that I've seen so I can't say how good an adaption it is I can however say that it won't be for everybody. It is a bit confusing at first then as things are explained things start to make sense and finally as it ends one is left wondering how much of what we've seen was meant to be real and how much was meant to be the creation of a deranged mind! The film sometimes feels more like a TV play than a film although I don't imagine a TV play made in the '70s would feature as much nudity. The cast do a solid job I particularly liked Toyah Wilcox's portrayal of a punkish Miranda and Jack Birkett's disturbing performance as Caliban. Overall I'd say viewers some will love it some will hate it give it a go and decide for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one can say they don't know Shakespeare's most mysterious play The Tempest. But no one can say they understand it because it is not done to be understood but only interpreted and that's exactly what Derek Jarman does with it. And his interpretation is that a labyrinth if not a maze in which we are supposed to get lost. We sure have an island and two people father and daughter Prospero and Miranda marooned on it. We then have a tempest that brings to the island the brother Antonio of this father who unseated him as Duke of Milan with the help of Alonso the father of Ferdinand all marooned on the island by the tempest. In fact Alonso was the plotter who managed to get Prospero off the throne of Milan and got him and his daughter marooned. That is called a coup d'tat or a putsch. The object of the tempest is thus simple to bring Ferdinand and Miranda together to get them married Prospero's vengeance in a way on Alonso.But it is not a play about a vengeance and Derek Jarman puts a lot of other elements forward to amplify other levels of meaning. Everyone is waiting for Caliban the perverted and twisted slave who is an inept son of a witch. He is obnoxious as expected. Everyone is waiting for Ariel the spirit that is used by Prospero to make the tempest happen and he is what we expect a magical master of ceremonies. He brings Ferdinand and Miranda together. He more or less loses all the others on the island for Prospero to have enough time for his plan. And then he brings them to the castle in due time to be obliged to endorse the wedding.But that still is not the meaning Derek Jarman wants us to see. He uses his camera again as a painter's brush and he is able to bring up all kinds of fantastic events and artificial situations including a grand ball for the celebration of the wedding. But we know Derek Jarman does not believe in miracles. He is making a film and telling us a story and he wants us to know that the plot and the vengeance and even the marriage are nothing really interesting. What is interesting is that life is always the same and it all ends with a feast with some dances and with a song. And there he pushes his imagination to extreme anachronistic and iconoclastic antics. The ball is in fact an all male ballet of modern sailors in their nice uniforms obviously mimicking love in male couples for the wedding of a man and a woman. And Derek Jarman crowns this obvious gay scene with the black singer Elisabeth Welch singing Stormy Weather surrounded by all these sailors and their love multiple pasdedeux. And this time it is no longer a hint it is a direct message of love from Derek Jarman to whoever to any man he is missing right nowDon't know why there's no sun up in the sky Stormy weather Since my man and I ain't together Keeps rainin' all the timeAnd here Derek Jarman turned the Tempest around and it became a song or a prayer about impossible love about separation about longing for love that cannot come because of the stormy weather and Derek Jarman makes it a gay manifesto and he probably was absolutely conscious of what he was doing. He was hijacking Shakespeare's play from a simple straight meaning to a more complicated gay signification. But he did that too with Shakespeare's sonnets in another film The Angelic Conversation. Shakespeare is easy at that game because his love sonnets his love poetry are always so perfect that you could project yourself into the sonnet and be in love with the young man whose beauty Shakespeare is singing. Even the famous sonnet of the pilgrims in Romeo and Juliet can be interpreted in any orientation possible since it is a dialogue between one I and another I kissing with their hands and praying with their lips.But we cannot stay on that colorful and slightly sad note. Derek Jarman leaves the play with a last vision of the same palace the same hall where the wedding feast has just come to an end. But this palace is back to the state of total unkempt abandon that goes along with the emptiness it now has since everyone has left on the ship on the following morning. And Ariel is there totally forlorn since he is no longer needed in the civilized world of Naples or Milan. But Derek Jarman adds one more touch. Prospero is till there too unable to go because Ariel is his lover he is in love with Ariel and he cannot go away from him even in the stormy weather we know. That's the very sad moment of this interpretation of the play love is for everyone else when you are gay because then gay love can only be found on a desert island on which you are marooned once and for all and your gay love will be for a spirit a phantom. Your love will be nothing but an illusion for an illusionary character that only exists in your mind.That's the sad way of looking at this film. You can always look at it with modern eyes and say that after all that was the past and now gay lovers can kiss on public benches and in parks and commons. Dogs will not bark any more at least we can hope so.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

Knowing his own style I did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the text.What I have found is sometimes striking sometimes evocative but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music I find that in films such as this the building blocks of powerful filmmaking are crafted even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of which is odd since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once. A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.Interestingly enough I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.I do not say that this is a bad film but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake.".

It's something about a man named Prospero who's exiled to an island with his daughter Miranda a REAL annoying slave and an angel I think named Ariel. His brother and the king did it to him I'm not sure why so Ariel fixes it that the king's son Ferdinand is shipwrecked on the island becomes a slave of Prospero and falls in love with Miranda.This is NOT a faithful retelling of the play. There's plenty of frontal male nudityactor David Meyer playing Ferdinand is introduced completely nude for a lengthy timeand there are strange costumes noises and settings all mixed with Shakespeare's dialogue! And the wedding has sailors doing a homoerotic dance AND posing afterwards. Then there's a woman all dressed up and lipsyncing badly to Stormy Weather...I honestly can't say I liked it but the acting is good and it's definitely the strangest Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Jarman did another one like this years laterEdward IIwhich was better than this. Still this is a one of a kind and not without merit.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been a number of excellent films about murder and mayhem occurring in small towns. They Only Kill Their Masters Sherlock Holmes  The Scarlet Claw Winter Kills and Five Card Stud come to mind and this 1973 ABC movieoftheweek has got to be one of the very best ever made.An increase in the death rate among the older residents of a small New England community is initially labeled as being due to natural causes. But something about it doesn't feel right to Daniel Barnes the local chief of police. Barnes excellently played by Alan Alda refuses to believe the official findings and begins an investigation to prove there's something rotten going on in his little town. The excellent supporting cast includes Will Geer as a nicotine addicted coroner Louise Lasser of Mary Hartman Mary Hartman fame as the police station's wisecracking receptionist and Ruth Gordon cast to type as a dotty old lady who may be in danger of becoming the next senior to sign off. Directed by John Badham of WarGames fame the film maintains a superb balance between both the story's darker aspects and the folksy charm of the familial setting and characters. The method of murder alluded to in the movie's title is refreshingly unique and the film's tense climax features some surprising character revelation. There's even an actionpacked car chase that appropriate to the film's setting takes place in a corn field. Lane Slate's script is as funny as it is intriguing and he clearly has a great feel for small town characters. The undeclared courtship between Alda and his receptionist Lasser is particularly fun to watch as they joke and natter away about bird watching and other mundane things because neither is willing to risk declaring to the other their true feelings. It's as endearing as it is amusing and the chemistry between these two actors is remarkable. David Shire's score effectively captures the feel of the rural setting while injecting the right note of menace to reflect the darker and at times melancholy aspects of the story.ABC Movies Of The Week were quickly shot and a mere 90 minutes in length but for some reason the 2 hour TVmovies we get today seldom approach the quality of a little classic like this and that truly is shocking.".

There's even an actionpacked car chase that appropriate to the film's setting takes place in a corn field. Lane Slate's script is as funny as it is intriguing and he clearly has a great feel for small town characters. The undeclared courtship between Alda and his receptionist Lasser is particularly fun to watch as they joke and natter away about bird watching and other mundane things because neither is willing to risk declaring to the other their true feelings. It's as endearing as it is amusing and the chemistry between these two actors is remarkable. David Shire's score effectively captures the feel of the rural setting while injecting the right note of menace to reflect the darker and at times melancholy aspects of the story.ABC Movies Of The Week were quickly shot and a mere 90 minutes in length but for some reason the 2 hour TVmovies we get today seldom approach the quality of a little classic like this and that truly is shocking.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature likable TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars including lighttouch love interests. The others are They Only Kill Their Masters James Garner 1972 and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game both Andy Griffith 1977.Alda's is set near Vermont Mount Angel next to Horse Creek the others in California Garner's at seaside Eden Landing and Griffith's in the mountains Jasper Lake. All try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. On that level they are somewhat entertaining that they were often rerun itself suggests they have some appeal. But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and offputting forced attempts often juvenile or crude at color or humor.Alda's and Garner's are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone. They have the best supporting casts though Alda's is put to better use the Griffith casts pale in comparison. Alda's has the best director.Shocking has some surprise and drama. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others from smug bigcity transplants to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as figments of a Hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine the worst offender is the Griffith movies' pipsqueak mumbling moron Whit who we are told tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the dock for the police boat stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them and filled out 11 on the withdrawal slip of Spiro T.

My name is Lloyd.But Alda is too lowkey and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a smalltime police chief certainly not a redhot lawman in demand by a rival town. Slate has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition. Rather than detect or investigate Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue Why didn't I think of that he says!. An embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot contrivance leads to another gift clue.Worse Barnes is more interested in deriding the militarystyle helmets of the county police sent to help him Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military than leading them or his own men effectively. He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again he is ineffective and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected by accident. The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believability.There are plot holes. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to later ones  a couple together a shopkeeper in his store during business hours a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and unbelievably his dog!Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. This and talk about the female doctor smack of a crude meanspirited pattern Garner's film has been described as sleazy including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her.

It's not that this is a bad film but it's not all that good either and certainly isn't one of the better made for TV movies from the seventies that I've seen. The plot is interesting enough and focuses on a small town where a bunch of old people are dying. There are certain similarities between the deaths and it leads Sheriff Dan Barnes Alan Alda to investigate. The plot plods along at a relaxing pace and there's not a great deal of suspense or interest which is a bit of a surprise since director John Badham would go on to make the very suspenseful thriller 'Nick of Time'...though that was twenty two years later. The small town setting provides a good place for the film to take place but this isn't taken advantage of to any notable extent and the film simply boils down to a simple ending.

	schema:reviewBody "Isn't it Shocking? is a lowkeyed and inconspicuous TVmovie that greatly benefices from a terrific ensemble cast an unusual but nevertheless intriguing premise and a script full of witty jokes and fun dialogues and this in sheer contrast to the sober subject matter. This was one of the many legendary ABC Movies of the Week that were especially produced for cableTV during the early seventies and I have yet to encounter one of those that isn't worth tracking down. I was born in the wrong decade and the wrong continent in order to enjoy this series on actual television but thanks to the modern wonders such as You Tube these old TVmovies still find their way to new fans. The story takes place in a small American town called Mount Angel where in a short period of time three senior citizens  including the deputy Sheriff  die from seemingly ordinary heart failures that nevertheless raise the suspicion of Sheriff Dan. At the beginning of the film we witness how a strange and also elderly man comes to town and kills his first victim with a portable device that induces the heart failure. So the viewer knows the killer's identity immediately but it's up to Sheriff Dan and his gossipy assistant Blanche to figure out why these gentle old folks are knocked off. They discover that all victims graduated together in the class of '28 so perhaps something sinister happened back then. It always amazes me how those modest ABC movies managed to rely on such acclaimed and respected actors and actresses! Isn't it Shocking? stars class players like Alan Alda MASH The Mephisto Waltz and Edmond O'Brien The Wild Bunch Fantastic Voyage but also a splendid supportive cast including Louise Lasser Will Greer and Ruth Gordon as a character that may perhaps have inspired the Crazy Cat Lady from The Simpsons. This was also one of the first directorial efforts of John Badham who would later make a handful of action favorites like Blue Thunder Stakeout and Nick of Time. There's one remarkably spectacular sequence involving a battle with cars ! but what I really liked most were the smooth jokes and sly interactions between the lead characters. Fun movie!".

This was one of the many legendary ABC Movies of the Week that were especially produced for cableTV during the early seventies and I have yet to encounter one of those that isn't worth tracking down. I was born in the wrong decade and the wrong continent in order to enjoy this series on actual television but thanks to the modern wonders such as You Tube these old TVmovies still find their way to new fans. The story takes place in a small American town called Mount Angel where in a short period of time three senior citizens  including the deputy Sheriff  die from seemingly ordinary heart failures that nevertheless raise the suspicion of Sheriff Dan. At the beginning of the film we witness how a strange and also elderly man comes to town and kills his first victim with a portable device that induces the heart failure. So the viewer knows the killer's identity immediately but it's up to Sheriff Dan and his gossipy assistant Blanche to figure out why these gentle old folks are knocked off. They discover that all victims graduated together in the class of '28 so perhaps something sinister happened back then. It always amazes me how those modest ABC movies managed to rely on such acclaimed and respected actors and actresses! Isn't it Shocking? stars class players like Alan Alda MASH The Mephisto Waltz and Edmond O'Brien The Wild Bunch Fantastic Voyage but also a splendid supportive cast including Louise Lasser Will Greer and Ruth Gordon as a character that may perhaps have inspired the Crazy Cat Lady from The Simpsons. This was also one of the first directorial efforts of John Badham who would later make a handful of action favorites like Blue Thunder Stakeout and Nick of Time. There's one remarkably spectacular sequence involving a battle with cars ! but what I really liked most were the smooth jokes and sly interactions between the lead characters. Fun movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "I missed THE GILMORE GIRLS first season because I'm generally not interested in series television and I'm a man in his early 50s and this is a series about a mother and a daughter and I'm frankly not interested in WB shows which focus on a more youthful audience. However a year of reading rave reviews of the series got me interested in tuning in during season II. It was instant love.I think this is the best series on TV a thoughtful funny beautifully written and well observed show about the relationship between a loving mother and daughter. At the same time if features the quirks and tics of a fictional town with the kind of appeal that is unrealistic but makes us nostalgic for a sweet and picaresque hamlet that has taken the two formerly outsider main characters and claimed them as one of their own.Lorelei Gilmore the stunningly beautiful and hugely talented Lauren Graham is a young single mother in her early 30s who is raising her daughter Rory a sweetly restrained Alexis Bledel on her own. Lorelai got pregnant when she was sixteen dashing the ambitions of her wealthy snobbish parents Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann for a fine college and a brilliant marriage.Lorelei has moved away from her parents home in Hartford CT taking her daughter with her to Stars Hollow where she eventually becomes a manager of a bed and breakfast inn. Lorelai is determined to raise her daughter in a loving if bohemian atmosphere. Most of all she wants her daughter to be her friend and encourages this amazingly close bond. The town composed of eccentrics and other comic types has accepted them watching over both women with love and affection.When it becomes clear that Lorelei will need financial help in order to put her daughter into Chilton a local private school in order to prepare her for Harvard Lorelai swallows her pride and hat in hand goes begging to her parents. They agree but on one condition. The girls are to have dinner with them at their stuff home every Friday night. Lorelei agrees.This forms the basic story outline of the show. We see Rory blossom into a lovely and smart teenager. Lorelei though responsible and a fine mother is still a young and vibrantly sexual woman so there are the complications of her love life including an unfinished attraction with Luke Danes the town's cranky but hunky coffee shop owner well played by Scott Patterson.Lorelei's best friend is Sookie a cook at the inn. Rory's best bud is Lane a gawky Korean girl who lives under the absurdly strict iron rule of her judge mental mother who thinks Lorelei is a loose woman who should be keeping a more watchful eye on her daughter. Rory has fallen in love iwth Dean a young man she goes to school with before she switches to Chilton. That love suffers a number of tests most disastrously in the third season with the arrival of Luke's nephew Jess who asserts his own romantic mystery.Well I'm going on and on. The entire cast is firstrate. It's fun watching series veterans Sally Struthers and others as the townspeople. I love the pompous character of Michel the asst.manager. He's a riot. The tension between Lorelei and her mother often explodes in angry confrontations that are very real indeed Kelly Bishop an original CHORUS LINE cast member is outstanding.But make no mistake about it. Lauren Graham is the glue that holds this show together. Sexy funny she handles the smart dialog with all those cultural references like a virtuoso. She deserves to be a movie star. P.S. I bought the first year on DVD and have been having a great wallow. This show is that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gilmore Girls is probably the best show of its kind on TV today.  If Jane Austen were alive today she'd be writing this show.  It's a great show first and foremost because it treats the viewer as an intelligent person and requires one to pay attention.  The rewards for doing so are the dozens of subtle jokes and pop references contained in the torrents of conversation that issue from the characters' mouths  Gilmore Girls must have the highest wordsspokenperminute ratio in the history of TV.The writing and acting are both superb.  The familiar setting of the small quirky town allows for the use of many inventive plot devices like 24hour dance marathons picnic basket bachelorette auctions and vagrants who apply to become the official town troubadour.  You can even throw in a smartmouthed kid from New York to see how he fares maybe a tribute to Northern Exposure???  The progression of the story is well thoughtout and well paced.Each actor really gets a chance to inhabit his or her role because each character even the most peripheral is defined by a very distinct personality and not just an occupation e.g. hotel desk clerk.  Thus we vividly remember sweet and shallow Shelly mean Mrs. Kim and shy guy Brad from Chilton even though they don't appear very often.  The principal actors are tremendous especially Lauren Graham Alexis Bledel Liza Weil and Scott Patterson.  Ever notice the way Luke will sort of tense uppuff up his chest whenever he walks up to Lorelai's table?  That's good acting.On top of all this there are three characteristics of Gilmore Girls that make it an exceptional show instead of just high quality.  In the first place it has good drama without being either melodramatic or manipulative. Think about the way the writers handled the Jess vs. Dean issue and compare that to Friends where we have IsRachelPregnantOrNot one episode IsRossTheFatherOrNot the next DidJoeyProposeOrNot the next ad infinitum.  On Gilmore Girls the drama unfolds not according to plot formulas but the interactions of the characters.Secondly the show is femalecentered without being selfconsciously so or politically charged.  The main characters are female human beings not symbols.  To whatever extent they are feminist or empowered the show presents them as such without commenting on it and that is refreshing.Finally Gilmore Girls takes a unique thoughtful and complicated view of the relationship between the generations.  It's billed as a motherdaughter show but is actually a grandmothermotherdaughter show. On most TV shows the roles of Grandma and Mom are restricted or stereotyped but here we have three women of a line Emily Lorelai and Rory who are made of the same material but have led VERY different lives and are trying to get along and be a family.  Occasionally one woman will step outside her role and be a Mom or Kid to one of the others.  And this is also refreshing to see on TV.If you enjoy quality entertainment regardless of genre Gilmore Girls is for you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.".

'Gilmore Girls' has to be the only quality show on WB and one of the few on television in general. It's about the relationship between a mother and daughter in a small town in Connecticut. Lorelai Gilmore had Rory when she was 16 and ran away from her uptight old money parents to start her own life independently as a maid at an inn and then working her way up to general manager. Their relationship is more like a sister relationship than a parentchild relationship. The townspeople only add charm to the show.'Gilmore Girls' is an intelligent show with quick witty dialogue that often refers to literature music movies and pop culture. The characters talk extremely fast which can be quite unrealistic sometimes when in a span of five seconds two people can create comebacks for each other that contain references to Shakespeare and Madonna. But c'mon it's just a show and the point of the fastpaced dialogue and references is for the entertainment of audiences. We watch the show hear the dialogue and laugh hard because we know what they're talking about. It's what makes 'The Simpsons' enjoyable and the same can be applied to 'Gilmore Girls'. We know that such a quirky place as Stars Hollow most likely doesn't exist but we watch it for the admiration for a dedicated single mother hardworking daughter and their minds that are abundant with intelligent and witty remarks about everything from Billy Bob Thornton to Bob Dylan.Give it a try. It's just one smart joke after another. Definitely not a typical WB show.".

The characters are not stereotypical and stand out thanks to the great job of both writers and actors I especially enjoy Melissa McCarthy and Liza Weil's portrayal of their characters the show is chock full of wit that is if your brain is quick enough to register the references made through the fast speech and the plot from what I have seen is more than sufficient to keep you wanting to see more.My favorite thing about the show is that unlike other dramas it isn't too over the top. The plot progresses smoothly and slowly just slow enough and while the show changes as time passes it doesn't change so completely as other shows in the same genre would. It is a perfect example of that while life changes it is a subtle change not an overt one.I would recommend anyone in search of intelligent witty television to watch this show. I give it a 9 out of 10 and I hope that it stays on the air for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gilmore Girls is one of those shows that people love because they're so adorable...and they simply don't know it. And not teen pop bunk adorable but as in they're easy to love. I was surprised by the quality of the series considering it's on the WB. It's intelligent creative and sophisticated in an everyday way. And even though this show has enough sarcasm to give you heartburn it's fueled by sarcasm in double digit gallons the characters are fleshed out and live an alternate lifestyle that may be foreign but is completely believable. These aren't people who live stereotyped mid class American TV lives they live like the people next door but like the strange people next door. They're those specially chosen eccentrics small town hicks artists and snobs who are so full of quirks and idiosyncrasies they tend to make our lives colorful.And this show is about characters and how they relate to each other. The crux of the show is the relationship between the close in age coffee addict mother Loralai played by the fantastic Lauren Graham and daughter Rory beautifully played by Alexis Bledel who have an unusually close knit and witty relationship. The two are an eccentric pair  they live for each other and pay no heed to those who sneer upon them and indulge in their wacky Bohemianness. They eat at Luke's Diner for breakfast and order economy size platters of Chinese food from Al's House of Pancakes. Rory likes chaperones Loralai intrinsically trusts her daughter.When Rory is accepted to a posh prep school which she doesn't care for but deals with because quite simply she has a higher IQ than most of the town and wants to get to Harvard paid for by her incorrigible and borderline personality grandmother  another recurring character her mother has to take a job she doesn't want at a first class hotel and thus a whole passel of problems and dilemmas occur. Long term plot lines gracefully combine with town occurrences scandals gossip etc and create a show with as much flavor and pizzazz as Stars Hollow can take.And where the sarcasm and one liners bizarre scenarios and crazy happenings flow freely there's always an underlying riptide that surfaces quickly here and there and the tensions that arise can become especially pungent because we're allowed to be close to the characters. For example in one episode Rory accidentally falls asleep next to her boyfriend late one night while they were both reading a book together and next morning they are found by Miss Patty the fabulously fabulous Liz Torres who is also from American Family nothing had happened Rory is completely innocent but Loralai is worried when she's alerted that she hadn't come home and receives the call that they had been found together. Rory's grandmother jumps to conclusions and starts harshly saying that Rory has ruined her life just the way Loralai had but her mother adamantly sticks up for her. Yet when Rory comes in they have an explosive fight with Rory crushed that her mother didn't trust or believe her.And yet situations with even a slight potential for sugaryness are resolved with lightning fast dialogue a la Philadelphia Story'. The fact that they're close is already there anything else feels wrong. This is the genius of the show's writing and acting. All said whether during revealing moments of emotion or poignancy or the standard rib cracking fire crackling wit and sarcasm this show gets under your skin and refuses to let go. It's more than a gem and I hope that it lasts.".

	schema:headline " I hate this show with a seething passion...and cannot stop watching it. Please help me....";
	schema:reviewBody "Looking for something new to watch I perused the ratings of various television shows and noticed that the Gilmore Girls had an astonishingly high 8.6 rating and was intrigued. I came to the show with absolutely no preconceptions The title indicated it might be a chick show though was not discouraged as I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and appreciate shows featuring strong female characters. So I managed to find a copy of the first season and set about watching it. From there it was all downhill.The first few episodes were by and large exposition introducing the ensemble cast and the relationships among them. Center stage are the titular Gilmore Girls  mother Loreli and daughter Rory. They are depicted as best friends and more often than not Rory as the voice of reason contrasted to her overthetop popculturereferencing carefree daretobedifferent clich of a mother. At first blush the script seemed witty the banter playful. But after about three episodes the style became forced and horribly contrived. Loreli's inability to provide a straight answer or simple declarative sentence under virtually every circumstance quickly turns from endearing to irritating.Though the show's writer would have us embrace her as a freethinking independent woman that facade quickly breaks down and any sentient being watching sees her as little more than a selfish vain egotistical spoiled rich girl who demands to be the center of everyone's attention. She demeans those who do not share her freespirited world view dismissing them as droll conformists who cannot appreciate her offbeat demeanor. She despises her parents a wealthy insurance executive and his socialite wife ridiculing them mercilessly and mocking them for their shallow need of respectability. But her disapproval of them does not interfere with her turning to them for money when Rory is accepted to an exclusive private school. One need not be a PhD. in literature to spot the dripping irony of Loreli not only asking for the money from those she abhors BUT for the purpose of sending Rory to a school that institutionalizes all that Loreli stands against. To stack the deck on her side her parents are depicted as stodgy dullards who have never resolved themselves with Loreli for getting knocked up at 16 and running away from home and have her child alone. As an aside Loreli's mother Emily though very much flawed stands out as the only genuinely compelling and sympathetic character as she struggles with her obvious mixed emotions for her ungrateful and overbearing daughter. But Loreli now puts up with their intrusive behavior in exchange for some quick cash. Freespirited indeed.What is most appalling about show and there is a lot of competition is its depiction of men as either spineless unreliable effeminate wimpy or imbecilic or all of the above. I appreciate a TV series or movie that features strong female characters that defy the brainlessbimbomold that makes up the lion's share of the women we see on TV. Smart independent women are hot. It was one of the things that made Buffy such great television. However in order to elevate the female characters it does not require that you denigrate or marginalize all their male counterparts. The male character are clearly the creation of writers who demonstrate a profound lack of understanding of the male mind or worse a deepseated loathing of men in general. Not one male character is admirable and all are reduced to little more than sounding boards for the unbearably whiny Loreli. Loreli's attitude towards this collection of eunuchs is at best dismissive and at worst abusive. In one particularly egregious incident in a display of monumental bad judgment she begins an affair with Rory's teacher then after breaking up with him she entices him back with words of love and respect and promises of commitment. In no time she impetuously agrees to marry him  a decision based entirely on her fear of losing him and having nothing to do with love...again what a freethinker.

	onyx:emotionText "Looking for something new to watch I perused the ratings of various television shows and noticed that the Gilmore Girls had an astonishingly high 8.6 rating and was intrigued. I came to the show with absolutely no preconceptions The title indicated it might be a chick show though was not discouraged as I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and appreciate shows featuring strong female characters. So I managed to find a copy of the first season and set about watching it. From there it was all downhill.The first few episodes were by and large exposition introducing the ensemble cast and the relationships among them. Center stage are the titular Gilmore Girls  mother Loreli and daughter Rory. They are depicted as best friends and more often than not Rory as the voice of reason contrasted to her overthetop popculturereferencing carefree daretobedifferent clich of a mother. At first blush the script seemed witty the banter playful. But after about three episodes the style became forced and horribly contrived. Loreli's inability to provide a straight answer or simple declarative sentence under virtually every circumstance quickly turns from endearing to irritating.Though the show's writer would have us embrace her as a freethinking independent woman that facade quickly breaks down and any sentient being watching sees her as little more than a selfish vain egotistical spoiled rich girl who demands to be the center of everyone's attention. She demeans those who do not share her freespirited world view dismissing them as droll conformists who cannot appreciate her offbeat demeanor. She despises her parents a wealthy insurance executive and his socialite wife ridiculing them mercilessly and mocking them for their shallow need of respectability. But her disapproval of them does not interfere with her turning to them for money when Rory is accepted to an exclusive private school. One need not be a PhD. in literature to spot the dripping irony of Loreli not only asking for the money from those she abhors BUT for the purpose of sending Rory to a school that institutionalizes all that Loreli stands against. To stack the deck on her side her parents are depicted as stodgy dullards who have never resolved themselves with Loreli for getting knocked up at 16 and running away from home and have her child alone. As an aside Loreli's mother Emily though very much flawed stands out as the only genuinely compelling and sympathetic character as she struggles with her obvious mixed emotions for her ungrateful and overbearing daughter. But Loreli now puts up with their intrusive behavior in exchange for some quick cash. Freespirited indeed.What is most appalling about show and there is a lot of competition is its depiction of men as either spineless unreliable effeminate wimpy or imbecilic or all of the above. I appreciate a TV series or movie that features strong female characters that defy the brainlessbimbomold that makes up the lion's share of the women we see on TV. Smart independent women are hot. It was one of the things that made Buffy such great television. However in order to elevate the female characters it does not require that you denigrate or marginalize all their male counterparts. The male character are clearly the creation of writers who demonstrate a profound lack of understanding of the male mind or worse a deepseated loathing of men in general. Not one male character is admirable and all are reduced to little more than sounding boards for the unbearably whiny Loreli. Loreli's attitude towards this collection of eunuchs is at best dismissive and at worst abusive. In one particularly egregious incident in a display of monumental bad judgment she begins an affair with Rory's teacher then after breaking up with him she entices him back with words of love and respect and promises of commitment. In no time she impetuously agrees to marry him  a decision based entirely on her fear of losing him and having nothing to do with love...again what a freethinker. However the day of their wedding Loreli suddenly panics at the prospect of sharing her life with this gutless pantywaist the source of her panic is it turns out that up until the night before her wedding she never gave thought to the fact they would live under the same roof and now is repelled by the idea...bright girl... and being the freespirit for whom convention will not suffice she skipped town with Rory without so much as a word of explanation to her betrothed the wedding guests and those who worked diligently to arrange the reception...including among them her BEST FRIEND!

The best thing about the show has been the budding romance between Lorelai Gilmore played by Lauren Graham and Max Medina played by Scott Cohen. These two actors have magical chemistry. On top of that the Love War and Snow episode of 121400 used the theme of magical snowfall in Lorelai's life to underscore the romance.  Brilliant high quality writing. I want MORE!".

Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her nonrebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally I just didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. The writing is neither smart or intelligent it's syrupy and tedious.So why did I watch? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched. KneeJerk reactions are usually wrong so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didn't attract me. I never liked any of the Freaky Friday films  not to say this is like that but there are some similarities. Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her What is this show about? A very bright young lady usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it  they really don't know either.Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program that's like an art house movie. Many of us wont get it but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one just to be hip. Yes I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying  whine whine nasally WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The town is hokey the men are wimps the grand parents are boring and sadly I find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall.".

She obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others.In one show Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She dithers on about how boring the guy was. Her date somehow got a few words in edgewise. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking choke.

The following explains why.Writing I suspect the dialog is written as follows. 1 Devise a trite plot and produce a basic script to support it. 2 Revise the dialog by randomly interjecting references to pop culture. 3 Revise the dialog by using a thesaurus to randomly replace smaller words with bigger ones.Characters I firmly believe that before every episode each character draws his or her lines from a hat. If you were to ignore the actors and focus solely on the dialog you would realize that every character is virtually identical. They all have practically the same interactions and reactions to other characters and events.Acting and direction I posit that the following direction is given to the actors before recording each episode. A If you are female speak quickly. B If you are male speak less quickly unless you are excited.Realism Obviously some aspects of the characters are universally shared among all people. However I have trouble believing that the agglomeration of inanity and neuroses the characters represent could exist outside a mental institution in Fantasyland. In real life their personalities could only arise if a town of clones was raised by circus performers in an amphetamine production facility.In summary I find the program to be superficial and pretentious. I apologize if this offends.".

It captured two girls both very different yet very alike coming together in order to made life fun exciting and a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.It didn't need to have a large cast of young actors to win over fans. In fact the wide range of ages that are portrayed in this dramedy make fun viewing whether you are 13 43 or 73. All ages enjoyed the antics on Lorelai and her teenage daughter Rory as they grew up fell in love moved on with life and did it without any drugs OTT violence or fancy clothes.If only shows could be like this today. Full of warm colors and witty remarks that only Lorelai and Rory could deliver with fast dialogue. Then there's all the other lovely interesting characters of Stars Hollow and of course Lorelai's rich aristocratic parents who better her every move in trying to win Rory's affection over with each episode.With each season better than the last and the overall feeling of emotion and spark never leaving the screen Gilmore Girls was amazing throughout it's entire 7 season run.I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of LIfe Unexpected today or was a fan of Everwood My SoCalled Life and The OC.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Wind and the Lion' is simply put one of the greatest adventure films ever made a classic that helped break the 'James Bond' stereotype for Sean Connery solidified Brian Keith's reputation as one of America's finest character actors and gave actionoriented director John Milius his most 'audiencefriendly' success. It is a sweeping epic in the tradition of 'Lawrence of Arabia' without the earlier film's subtexts of megalomania and sexual ambiguity. Here the personalities are clearly defined they start off on opposing sides but through the nobility of their characters their unspoken codes of honor and a sense of oldfashioned chivalry in a modern world of betrayal and greed by the film's climax they become allies against a greater evil. Some critics attempted to link Theodore Roosevelt's world view in the film to the eventual U.S. debacle in Vietnam. That is unfair to both the film and to Milius who if anything admires and respects the 'big stick' idealism and machismo of our only true 'cowboy' President. This respect led the director to film the excellent 'The Rough Riders' twentyfour years later for TNT. Rest assured 'The Wind and the Lion' is NOT a boring political treatise!The setting is Morocco in 1904 where an American woman Candice Bergen in perhaps her best screen performance and her two children are kidnapped by 'the last of the Barbary Pirates' Sean Connery and his large band of followers who are seeking restitution for a long political imprisonment by his family. In Washington dynamic young President Teddy Roosevelt brilliantly portrayed by Brian Keith uses the incident to send in American marines both to rescue the family and influence the country's politics much to the chagrin of Secretary of State John Huston! Privately Roosevelt admires the Arab's courage and honor and wishes the two could face off in a duel to resolve matters.As her captivity continues Bergen learns that the real villain is not Connery who is truly the 'Chosen' leader of his people but those who imprisoned him. The Americans discover this too as they see alliances being forged between the usurpers and greedy European powers particularly Germany. Ultimately this leads to a riproaring battle between the two forces full of unforgettable images Connery on horseback at full gallop snatching up a rifle offered by Bergen's son is one of the great moments in film history! as the film reaches a VERY satisfying conclusion.There are many wonderful aspects to this film and Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score must be singled out it is one of the finest of his long career ranking with his soundtracks for 'Star Trek The Motion Picture' and 'Patton'.'The Wind and the Lion' is the kind of epic adventure they don't make anymore. Happily John Milius has proven that cliche wrong. This film is ABSOLUTELY essential in any Connery or action film collection. I HIGHLY recommend it!".

	schema:reviewRating 10;
	schema:headline " Another film where I almost can't seem to find enough nice things to say about it";
	schema:reviewBody "After reviewing others' comments I have to say that I agree with most of them even to some degree with some of the seemingly disparaging ones. In that regard however I would have to say to those disappointed with the film because of the considerable liberties it takes with the historical facts that they should bear in mind that this film is clearly intended as a pure adventure story with only enough depth to get the audience emotionally involved which may explain its undercurrent of political satire so suggestive of the immediate postVietnam era in which it was made and released and could never have been intended as a theatrical representation of historical fact. I'm inclined to doubt you can do both successfully in the same film at least not without losing a lot of the breezy lighthearted simplicity that makes the adventure movie what it is in the first place. I think adventure movies deliberately ignore deeper issues raised by the events they treat that could be expected to lead to emotional conflict in the minds of the audience.  Thus in the typical adventure movie there are welldefined good guys and bad guys and motivations and justifications are crystalclear. On the other hand real history is full of ambiguities and complexities which raise deeper issues and conflicting feelings in the audience's consciousness leading to an essentially heavier more deeply dramatic treatment. Thus if the producer had tried to make the plot of this film completely accurate he would have wound up with more of a drama than an adventure film and you would have had a completely different kind of movie all together. Consequently criticizing this film for not dealing with the deeper issues behind the Morocco crisis of 1904 is like criticizing Raiders of the Lost Ark for not treating the evils of Nazism more seriously than it did.  The Wind  the Lion is like Raiders not Schindler's List.Moreover even apart from the numerous variances from actual history found in the plot they even moved the date of the event several months to bring it closer to the presidential election I have to wonder how accurately it portrays Berber culture or even Theodore Roosevelt whose portrait hangs on the wall directly above my computer monitor while I write this and about and even by whom I have many books including a complete set of his papers as edited however entertaining and appealing they may appear in the film. Nevertheless because of their interesting and sympathetic treatment this remains one of my favorite movies.  So if these matters still trouble you when you watch the movie do what I find comes more or less automatically to me and try thinking of it as basically pure fiction and you should like it just fine.Having said that though one of the best things about this film is that irrespective of what the writers or director did with it to make a lighthearted adventure story other departments seemingly spared no pains in making it every bit as believable if not actually accurate as possible. First I would bet money that the extras in the scene where the Marines land and storm the palace were real Unites States Marines specifically recruited for the part  note the haircuts the prolonged doubletiming in heavy uniforms the fact that everybody stays in step the shouted closeorder drill commands and just their general bearing or attitude if you've ever spent time with Marines or seen one of their little public relations demonstrations at a Marine Corps base you'll know what I mean. Second Steve Kanally got into his part in a serious way portraying a practically flawless Marine Corps recruiting poster company commander  this is exactly the way the Marine Corps wants its people to come across when they are showing off for the public. Third in the scene in the U.S. consul's office Steve Kanally historically accurately relates that he has two 'reinforced' rifle companies with which to seize the palace and his statement is realized in deed when the Marines land on the wharf as well as when they finally reach the palace because you will see that not only are Marines present but also U.S. Navy sailors backing them up  i.e. two rifle companies reinforced with sailors from whatever ships that landed them.Such leads me to the detail that is my favorite because it is so subtle that it is hard to imagine much more than literally a handful of viewers among the thousands who would see this film ever being likely to appreciate it. In the book American Naval History  An Illustrated Chronology published some years after the film was made naval historian Jack Sweetman relates that in the actual event the Marines were landed from the cruiser USS BROOKLYN.  When you see the Marines landing in the film you will note a very antiquelooking steamship looming prominently in the background. This is obviously a matte painting inserted using special effects techniques because probably the only ship still existing in the world that looks anything like that is a stationary floating museum the cruiser USS OLYMPIA of SpanishAmerican War fame and it would not be available unless the producer was willing to shoot that scene in downtown Philadelphia. More to the point consideration of the depiction by anyone with a relevant photograph or two and basic sensitization to ship identification issues reveals that the ship pictured isn't the OLYMPIA. There are not many books easy to find these days that would help you identify the ship I know of only two but if you were to make the effort you would be rewarded with an unmistakable solution. The raised fo'c's'l' three very tall stacks turret locations and sweep of the stern unambiguously identify this vessel as just one ship and one ship only and by now I shouldn't have to tell you its name but of course it is the BROOKLYN. My hat's still off to the Art Department for taking that much trouble to get something so easy to disregard so right.Anyway this film which has just about everything this writer could want in an adventure movie not only Theodore Roosevelt and a lot of Marines at their most virile kickbutt best but expansive Americanism at its optimistic best we have men who can do anything  we have men who can FLY Sean Connery as a highly appealing charismatic leader who at one point very plausibly takes out about ten scumbucket thug types with aplomb John Wayne could envy a long cavalry sequence with seemingly hundreds of riders culminating in a good oldfashioned saber charge a kid angle which reminds you how to look at this thing if you ask me a certain amount of witty repartee healthy doses of chivalry throughout a romantic aspect that is not wholly gratuitous and not the least a very feminine and attractive heroine with enough Yankee grit and determination to satisfy Katharine Hepburn.

	onyx:emotionText "After reviewing others' comments I have to say that I agree with most of them even to some degree with some of the seemingly disparaging ones. In that regard however I would have to say to those disappointed with the film because of the considerable liberties it takes with the historical facts that they should bear in mind that this film is clearly intended as a pure adventure story with only enough depth to get the audience emotionally involved which may explain its undercurrent of political satire so suggestive of the immediate postVietnam era in which it was made and released and could never have been intended as a theatrical representation of historical fact. I'm inclined to doubt you can do both successfully in the same film at least not without losing a lot of the breezy lighthearted simplicity that makes the adventure movie what it is in the first place. I think adventure movies deliberately ignore deeper issues raised by the events they treat that could be expected to lead to emotional conflict in the minds of the audience.  Thus in the typical adventure movie there are welldefined good guys and bad guys and motivations and justifications are crystalclear. On the other hand real history is full of ambiguities and complexities which raise deeper issues and conflicting feelings in the audience's consciousness leading to an essentially heavier more deeply dramatic treatment. Thus if the producer had tried to make the plot of this film completely accurate he would have wound up with more of a drama than an adventure film and you would have had a completely different kind of movie all together. Consequently criticizing this film for not dealing with the deeper issues behind the Morocco crisis of 1904 is like criticizing Raiders of the Lost Ark for not treating the evils of Nazism more seriously than it did.  The Wind  the Lion is like Raiders not Schindler's List.Moreover even apart from the numerous variances from actual history found in the plot they even moved the date of the event several months to bring it closer to the presidential election I have to wonder how accurately it portrays Berber culture or even Theodore Roosevelt whose portrait hangs on the wall directly above my computer monitor while I write this and about and even by whom I have many books including a complete set of his papers as edited however entertaining and appealing they may appear in the film. Nevertheless because of their interesting and sympathetic treatment this remains one of my favorite movies.

In fact Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek national. Never mind that though his predicament was serviceable enough at the time.The damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here. Of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our European powers to get their foothold into Morocco. The intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom.The Wind and the Lion is hardly history. But it is an enjoyable film and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in the Roosevelt White House do ring true to all the stories told.

Want to know about how the teddy bear came into being ? Watch this film . Roosevelt was a great lover of nature  he was both a hunter and an ecologist and decided that if America wanted to be a major world power then the nation would have to carry a big stick while speaking in a soft voice Roosevelt more than any president in history made America the superpower it is today and it's a very topical film to watch in 2004 . America's resentment of Germany and France ! Arabs slaughtering infidels on the battlefield but taking a moral high ground about women and children being held as hostage ! American military leaders and diplomats not really caring if they start a bloody war ! The more things change the more they stay the same It is interesting to see that Milius has painted the Arabs with very human faces . Mulay might be a brigand but he's a most likable anti hero and a cinema audience has the rare opportunity of seeing what Sean Connery is capable of when he's given a good role . I wonder though how this film would have the Arabs if it'd have been made a few years later after the Iranian revolution ? I've got a feeling it would never have been made at all in todays current climate As it stands THE WIND AND THE LION is very poor history in most parts  fairly good history in some parts and stands as a sort of timepiece when Hollywood was far less xenophobic than it is today".

Raisouli Sean Connery o Wow!wondering 'What kind of gun does Roosevelt use?Teddy RooseveltBrian Keith o Wow!wondering What kind of gun does Raisouli use?' and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95.Raisouli armed with but a sword... A Prussian cavalry officer HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword... Honor.  That's something long dead from a world long gone but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...Milious at Milious's magnificent best and now out on DVD.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Wind and the Lion starts in Tangier in Morocco on October 15 1904 where an American woman named Eden Pedecaris Candice Bergen  her two young children Jennifer Polly Gottesman  William Simon Harrison are kidnapped by the gang of men lead by Moroccan rebel Mulay Hamid El Raisuli Sean Connery the Lord of the Rif Sultan to the Berbers  the last of the Barbary Pirates. Word of the kidnapping gets back to President Theodore Roosevelt Brain Keith who decides to use the situation as a show of strength  issues the ultimatum 'Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead'. As the struggle for power in the Middle East  Morocco wages between the Europeans the Americans  the Moroccan people Raisuli  Pedercaris become pawns they become symbols of war  what to fight for or against as the Middle East sees in the beginning of the 20th Century in turbulent fashion...Written  directed by John Milius this historical adventure is loosely based on real events but in essence is a fictional work whether you like The Wind and the Lion will probably depend on how much you enjoy period adventure films. Of course the fact that the film is partly about an American war against Middle Eastern extremist's who kidnap people  demand a ransom has parallels to what's happening right now in the real world doesn't it? The character's are well written  likable it's odd to see Sean Connery play an Arab Sultan but he has great charisma  screen presence although it's rather inevitable that Pedecaris will fall for his roguish behaviour sense of honour  conviction in his beliefs while it's also just as inevitable that Raisuli will fall for her strength independence  good looks in the obligatory romance subplot. The film has an uneven pace  tone it flips between Raisuli Roosevelt in America lots of political wrangling  some good old fashioned fighting without a totally clear direction. It's a good film but I just wish it didn't last quite as long  it didn't come to a grinding halt every five minutes for a speech of some sort whether it's Roosevelt in America talking about Grizzly Bears or Raisuli in Morocco spouting another cryptic proverb. I mean I just think it might have flowed a bit better had it not been so bogged down in politics  philosophising. The Wind and the Lion is good film but I did get bored by it by the end it is a little predictable  the story could have been a little bit more focused.Director Milius does a fine job here the film looks wonderful from start to finish with exemplary production design costumes  locations. A lot of time is spent during The Wind and the Lion setting the scene  really making the viewer feel they are watching something that did indeed take place at the start of the last century. The film can also be quite violent at times there's plenty of death shootings a severed tongue a couple of executions  some nicely choreographed action scenes. Some people seem to think the horse were abused during the making of The Wind of the Lion the film has never been released on any home video format here in the UK because the BBFC demanded cuts to several horse falls to which director Milius reacted angrily to  stopped the planned release since all who were involved with the making of it say no animals were hurt at all. To be honest I didn't see anything that concerned me at all.With a supposed budget of about 4000000 The Wind and the Lion looks great throughout with top class production values  meticulous attention to detail. Set in Morocco but filmed largely in Spain. The acting is good especially Sean Connery.The Wind and the Lion is a visual treat for anyone who likes their films set in the past it looks great throughout  there are some nice action scenes but the story doesn't hold up that well  it's far too long for my liking. Good but not great  I doubt I would want to see it again anytime soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Luscious Candace Bergen as a prim Victorian beauty kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh let me count the ways!!! Earthy primitive Sean Connery exactly the right man to tame a brittle classy beauty like Candace is . . . well underwhelming in the role. That's because instead of having dialog about the real issues you are a woman . . . I am a man! he has to babble nonsense about the will of Allah and the wind blows destiny across the desert sands. John Milius a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight or interest in conventional human relationships has a maddening way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might get kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape we are treated to endless and I do mean ENDLESS shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have . . . if it had ever actually gotten underway! The weird thing is Milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution. Candace's two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does. There's no humor no chemistry no sizzle in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. Unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfect.The only real moment in the story is when late at night Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says we must escape. The little girl turns over and without missing a beat replies but mother I was sleeping! That one line sums up what's really missing from the story. No danger suspense or sizzle in the basic story line of a cultivated lady in captivity. She and her children are both so snug and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate.Mind you if Candace herself had said the line it might have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity or her delight at being in the arms of Sean Connery and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction then the story would have had some tension. But Milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him . . . and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless . . . like the burning desert sands.".

In any case The Wind and the Lion comes up short though what film wouldn't?  I feel its chief shortcoming is its lack of specificity in dealing with the political motivations of the Raisuli's actions which cry out for more detailed explanation here. The movie spends far too much on the relationship between him and Mrs. Pericardis a subject certainly more conducive to drawing in the crowds. Until I find some actual historical research to confirm it I must remain skeptical of the growing affection of Mrs. Pericardis toward her captor portrayed here. Stockholm syndrome or no I simply find it difficult to believe an American woman at the turn of the century would develop a quasiRomantic attraction toward the man who kidnapped her and her two children.We have also the cynical view of U.S. foreign policy and the projection of American strength portrayed here which is perhaps not unexpected what with the memory of the U.S.'s recently ended Vietnam experience fresh in the national memory at the time of the picture's making. Doubtless the scenes of American troops marching in mideast capitals might elicit a different reaction in post911 America than when this movie was first shown.But the centerpiece of the movie and the feature that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Brian Keith's altogether stunning and captivating performance as Teddy Roosevelt one of the cinema's great performances in my view. He absolutely monopolizes the screen in his scenes which make the whole movie worth watching. The topnotch production values and gorgeous cinematography don't hurt either.In short a mixed bag but worth watching just for the scenery and Keith as Teddy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched The Wind And The Lion last night...decent adventure yarn but I was annoyed by the huge unexplained holes in the plot that didn't make any sense and while some actors did a great job there were others who were terrible! At times the dialogue was kinda cheesy as well. I thought Connery was ok in the role but it certainly wasn't his best performance...his ScottishArabic hybrid accent was laughable. The visuals were nice and the music score had some great parts. All in all an ok movie but I was disappointed that its full potential was not realized.SPOILER ALERTMaybe part of my problem is that I'm a history major and I have to say that they took rather large liberalities with the plot...the movie is definitely fiction based on real events rather than an accurate historical portrayal. There's nothing really wrong with that but when they put certain scenes in the movie that make no political sense in context of the time and setting then I get kind of annoyed but bah maybe I'm reading too much into it...it is just entertainment after all. I guess I'm referring to the tactless way the Americans invaded Morocco despite the presence of all the great European powers which is ridiculous or the scene near the end where an all out battle occurs between the American and German factions over the prisoner which is silly and never explained and just what did the Germans want with Connery's Raisouli? To me it just looks like they were added into the plot at the very end just as a cheap excuse to stage action scenes with the usual stereotypical Hollywood villains Germans.I also feel that there was too much inappropriate humour such as scenes where Connery's character helplessly sulks and complains when laughed at by the kidnapped children and by his own men over his lack of control over Candice Bergen...believe me a truly ruthless brutal leader would not act in such a manner. I think the film would have worked much better had the tone been much more serious rather than trying to work subtle elements of romantic comedy into the story. The smirks you see on Connery's face and his men really sap the necessary feeling of danger and suspense that the film should have...I never felt like any of the characters were particularly dangerous especially whenever Connery would spout off socalled deepmeaning proverbs that came across as completely cheesy and had my friend and I rolling our eyes and laughing when we weren't supposed to.At least Connery and Bergen never got it on because that would have been unrealistic and painful to watch...I was quite relieved that they left that cliche out but Bergen's sudden Stockholm Syndrome turn at the end and the Americans' unflinching willingness to go along with her plan was pretty dumb I have to say.That having been said it isn't a downright bad film it just could have been much better.".

I must assume that the film though focussed around the year 1904 must have been written allegorically because much like present world events Sean Connery plays a shiek speaking frequently of a jihad and Brian Keith plays Teddy Rosevelt as an embellishment of a power hungry politician. Candice Bergen's character sits in the middle as the occasional something of value that the two sort of toy over. It's really an interesting movie even if a bit full of itself. The weird thing is that when it's not playing out like an adventure or romance which really seemed contrived it seems rather humorous in an exaggerated manner so my guess is that buried underneath all of the thrills is a biting satire of ... well something.

Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon on board with her fellow golddigging mother the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them Matthau has no money either.

	schema:reviewBody "After the making of GRUMPY OLD MEN and GRUMPIER OLD MEN the box office success of those two films made it evident that another film property costarring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau was needed. They found one property THE GRASS HARP where they shared one scene together. But then this film was made which was fully their film together. Like most of their films Lemmon is the quiet partner who is dragged into the troublesome situation by the noisy partner Matthau. Here they are brotherinlaws Matthau's sister who is dead. Matthau convinces Lemmon that he needs to take a sea cruise to end his long period of mourning. Lemmon does not realize that Matthau got them free passage by signing them onto the cruise as social dancers partners for elderly lady passengers. Lemmon can dance but Matthau cannot and one scene has Lemmon trying to teach Matthau only to be caught by Donald O'Connor and Hal Linden dancing together O'Connor and Linden jumping to the wrong conclusion. If they can't pull their weight as social dancers they will have to pay the 1500.00 per person fare as travelers. Neither can afford that. Matthau really could not care much about this  he hopes that he will be lucky to find romance and marry a wealthy woman. Lemmon is encouraged to do the same but he is not as mercenary. As it turns out Lemmon does meet Gloria De Haven and Matthau meets Dyan Cannon and her mother Elaine Stritch. But the course to true love is never smooth in movies. Matthau has a rival for Cannon in Edward Mulhare. And Brent Spiner the cruise entertainment director is an evil martinet determined to impress the cruise line owner Rue McLanahan to put him in control of all the cruise ship's entertainment centers.It is a wellcast film which helps this is reminiscent of the two Grumpies films that preceded it. But those films had better balance to them. They had moments of pathos where one could see Lemmon and Matthau were not just funny men but human types. Here Lemmon is shown to have such a weakness  he has romanced De Haven in spite of his qualms but at a critical point remembers his deep love for his first wife. But Matthau's personality is so mercenary a cousin to his Whiplash Willie Gingrich in THE FORTUNE COOKIE that his turning into a legitimate lover of Cannon doesn't quite sit well. Nor does it sit well when we find other likable characters can be equally mercenary.However there are plenty of great moments in the film. Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious he calls his nonsteps the crawlbut that she enjoys. Spiner better known as Mr. Data the android in STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner whom Linden really dislikes. But the film is still very amusing and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film. That would be THE ODD COUPLE II.".

Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious he calls his nonsteps the crawlbut that she enjoys. Spiner better known as Mr. Data the android in STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner whom Linden really dislikes. But the film is still very amusing and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film. That would be THE ODD COUPLE II.";

It is very reminiscent of Lemmon and Matthau's other projects together THE ODD COUPLE II and Lemmon's solo with James Garner MY FELLOW AMERICANS.The film has divine originality as the plot has not been done before but the story has its share of cliches. The dance host director played by Brent Spiner who has the honor of taking on the bad guy villain role of this film is quite laughable but still acceptable. The film goes from depressing to funny as hell and makes you forget your life for a while.Quite a good comeback for the Grumpys. Well worth watching.

	schema:reviewBody "Out to Sea hereafter OTS is basically a melding of Grumpy Old Men or The Odd Couple take your pick with a typical Love Boat episode. Before you groan and decide this is something you might want to skip I wish to assure you that comic and acting and sadly now departed legends Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon effortlessly turn on the smooth wacky exasperated and cunning charm to make OTS a laughfilled satisfying if somewhat predictable romp.The frantic fun begins when Matthau's character Charlie Gordon a shifty gambler in hock with several bookies and loan sharks persuades his despondent widowed brotherinlaw Herb Sullivan Lemmon to take a cruise with him onboard the Holland America liner Westerdam presumably to cheer him up. When Herb protests that neither of them can afford a cruise Charlie assures him that he managed to wrangle free tickets. Herb grudgingly agrees.Of course there's a catch. Only after they board the ship does Charlie inform Herb that in exchange for the free room and board they must serve as dancing partners and escorts for unattached women passengers. Though Herb is understandably agitated with Charlie for this con he figures he and Charlie can make the best of it. After all cruises have all sorts of amenities and benefits and the Central AmericaMexico itinerary is enticing. Besides Herb is a good dancer. But of course there are other catches.One while Herb can trip the light fantastic Charlie can't. In fact Charlie has all the dancing grace of the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz. Two their boss is the despotic brownnosing and smugly irritating martinet Gil Godwin Brent Spiner in a role as diametrically opposite to his unemotional rational role as Data the android from Star Trek  The Next Generation as a role can be. Gil is the cruise director from hell with a soul of a drill instructor. He warns all the dance partners that dancing is as far as it goes with the women passengers. Any kind of relationship even the most casual is strictly forbidden. Naturally Gil keeps a haughty eye on Herb and Charlie  especially Charlie who spends much of the movie shirking his dancing duties and dodging and disobeying Gil's edicts.And so OTS launches into a comedy of deception mistaken identity and screwball antics. Besides avoiding Gil Charlie keeps busy by playing poker against the snobbish wealthy card expert Cullen Carswell and doggedly wooing the apparently glamorous welltodo Liz LaBreche a still stunning Dyan Cannon traveling with her ornery cantankerous mother Mavis Elaine Stritch who wants her to marry someone worthy of her social station and who instantly disapproves of Charlie. Meanwhile the more subdued Herb finds his own romantic interaction with Vivian Gloria DeHaven a fetching widow traveling with her grown daughter and soninlaw. They are mutually attracted to each other. Problem is Vivian through Charlie's interference believes Herb is a doctor. Herb is actually a retired Gimbel's sales clerk but is afraid to tell Vivian the truth because he doesn't want to disappoint her. Besides Herb still stubbornly yearns for his deceased wife of 46 years Susie.Again the plot is straight out of any Love Boat episode but Matthau and Lemmon are consummate confident pros who can squeeze laughs out of the most outlandish doings. Through both physical slapstick and quick and sharp dialogue Matthau and Lemmon seem to be having a ball in OTS and therefore let us have fun too. And yet good comedies always have a core of emotion and pathos. Both Matthau and Lemmon have it in OTS and so we hope that they can rise above the sticky deceptions and white lies they have built and find love and fulfillment. Do they? Well think about any Love Boat episode and how it turns out that Herb and Charlie aren't the only ones harboring secrets in the movie not least Gil and his shameless flattering of ship owner Ellen Carruthers Rue McClanahan in order to secure a promotion and rest assured that poetic justice comes into play.P.S. Although I have been on several cruises with several cruise lines including Holland America I have never been on the Westerdam. OTS showcases the ship well and I'm sure Holland America was grateful for the publicity. I would love to take a trip on the Westerdam someday.".

Of course Lemmon doesn't know that. What he does know that Matthau who is the brother of his late wife has come to him with one scheme after another for years. And Matthau owes some big money to the bookies and that's why he needs cash.So they go on the cruise and as for Matthau he gets involved with Dyan Cannon and her mother Elaine Stritch and its poker not the dance floor where he meets them. Matthau has to deal with a pompous Englishman in Edward Mulhare who really is a sitting target for Matthau's cons.As for Lemmon he gets involved with Gloria DeHaven who is accompanying her daughter and husband on a holiday. They don't think she gets out enough. Oddly enough that's how Matthau feels about Lemmon.As for the rest of the cast Star Trek's Data Brent Spiner has a great part as an obnoxious twit of a performer and dancer who lords it over the others of greater talent who also include Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor. Matthau bounces some great lines off him and Spiner's reactions are priceless. I'd also have to single out Elaine Stritch who comes into her own explaining the facts of life to Cannon.During the Nineties we were fortunate indeed to have Lemmon and Matthau in some great films specifically written for them. In Out To Sea you can see that a great supporting cast was assembled for them. Like some of the comedy teams these two comic actors did variations on their first film together The Fortune Cookie where Matthau is the con artist who is always dragging Lemmon into one of his schemes.Out To Sea isn't as good as The Fortune Cookie or the first The Odd Couple but it's still plenty funny.".

This film is not quite as funny as their Grumpy Old Men comedies which it strongly resembles but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of inlaws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance. What's worse Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members there's the cruise director Gil Godwyn played to the hilt by Star Trek The Next Generation veteran Brent Spiner who acts like an evil dictator. There's two fellow dance hosts played by Barney Miller star Hal Linden and veteran movie musical star Donald O'Connor. There's the ship's owner Mrs. Carruthers played by Golden Girl Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers there's Vivian a widow played by Gloria De Haven who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz played by one of my alltime favorite actresses Dyan Cannon who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis Liz's mother played by veteran stage actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others as well. All these actors are a pleasure to watch as Lemmon and Matthau play off of them. It's great to see Cannon here see's beautiful as ever Stritch is a hoot Spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight De Haven is wonderful Linden O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two and finally the two main stars Lemmon and Matthau are fine as usual. A nice little gem of a comedy. out of four".

The dialogue here is so leaden and devoid of humor one is amazed they had the gall to bill this as a comedy. Matthau at least invests his pitiful material with some of his old spark but Lemmon resplendent in his new Stepfordlike facial tuck seems to be sleepwalking through the experience.

The two Oscar winners and senior stars had given us some funny and entertaining films over the years. Besides their comedy each had a distinguished film career that included dramas action films and mysterythrillers. Matthau lived just three more years and died July 1 2000 at age 79. Lemmon would live just four more years and died June 27 2001 at age 76. In this 1997 film the boys are in their usual form. They have slowed down some but still appear to be chipper. They are a couple of retired codgers. Lemmon plays Herb Sullivan and Matthau is Charlie Gordon. They are brothersinlaw. Charlie's never been married and Herb who wed Charlie's sister has been a widower for a year or so.This film has some prominent actors in supporting roles and these add to the humor. Dyan Cannon Gloria DeHaven Elaine Stritch Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor all are good for laughs. Brent Spiner plays the stars' nemesis. He's Gil Godwyn cruise director.The plot is farfetched and that makes it even funnier. The cast seemed to be having a ball making this film. It isn't on the level of the earlier LemmonMatthau comedies but it's still an entertaining film that's sure to arouse many laughs. It's a good adult film to enjoy especially for middle aged and older folks. Few in younger audiences are apt to enjoy or appreciate oldfashioned humor especially among the older set.Here are a couple samples of humor in the dialog. Gil No you listen to me. I'm your worst nightmare. A song and dance man raised on a military base. Dismissed! Herb I'll bet his father was cruise director on the Bismarck.Herb to Charlie You're crazy.

The plot is thin and the film itself is overlong. BUT what makes it is the chemistry between the two leads. Their friendship both on and off screen shines through for all to see and these talented comedic actors wring every last joke out of the script.

Matthau and Lemmon have irresistible comic chemistry. Brent Spiner plays the entertainment organizer in a standard role yet a terrific foil. Dyan Cannon plays Matthau's love interest but the role is too straight forward. Brent Spiner plays the foiled master of ceremonies who views our duo as a major inconvenience.

Matthau hopes to hook up with a rich widow at which he fails...sort of...Dyan Cannon and Matthau just wants out but falls in love with Gloria deHaven. Along the way there are some funny hijinks but only the ending is disappointing...way too impractical.Along for the cruise as other dance hosts are Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor who frankly get too little screen time. Brent Spiner is good as the overbearing cruise director. Elaine Stritch is fun as Cannon's mother. Edward Mulhare who died shortly after making the film plays another cruise ship passenger.

Treat Williams lights up the screen as Berger the unconventional and freespirited hippie who does his best to get Claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by Savage as Claude who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is a charmer as Jeannie the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care.

Judge it on its own merit too often a movie is compared to its stage roots and is inevitably crucified. As it is the film plays out like one long fantasy trip whether that trip is substanceenhanced or not is your call starting with the Aquarius sequence and continuing on to the marvelous set pieces for Manchester England Ain't Got No I Got Life and best of all the Electric BluesHare Krishna fantasy which shows lovers John Savage and Beverly D'Angelo literally flying through their own wedding ceremony. BTW the woman singing Aquarius in the film's opening is not Melba Moore but Ren Woods a wonderful singeractress seen a lot on TV in the 70's and star of the Los Angeles production of The Wiz. The opening Twyla Tharp corpsdeballet shot right on the Central Park grounds with Woods' solo in a dizzying 360 camera pan is an awesome start to a rockinfested musical. Ms. Moore who performed in the original Broadway HAIR appears later in the film singing 3500 with Ronnie Dyson in the war protest scene shot in Washington DC. And there are moments like the Walking In Space basic training sequence or the simple closeup on Cheryl Barnes's torch solo Easy To Be Hard which are just plain astonishing.".

George Berger played by Treat Williams leads a small group of 1960's1970's era antiwar hippies living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man Claude Bukowski played by John Savage who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army. Still distressed over his having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the USA to visit Claude ...for a couple of hours in the words of George Berger to an M.P. stationed at the entry gate of the Army base Claude is temporarily stationed at in Nevada. The outcome is truly touching so I won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. The musical score is equally fantastic! Don Dacus of the rock group Chicago who plays the part of Woof  one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo who plays Sheila Franklin an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group is sensational in her role! A MUST SEE film!!".

Beverly D'Angelo is such a 'hot mama' in this filmI had forgotten just how hot! WOW!The supporting cast is absolutely greatwith the late great Nell Carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes as well as the kooky Charlotte Ray Mrs. Garrett on 'Facts Of Life'The story gets a little weak toward the end but the antiwar sentiment of the late 60's still holds up and is relevant today. It's beautifully filmed quite a bit on location and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen.I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15 and was moved by it then and it still moves me now at 40. Some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made soonerI don't think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60'searly 70's.The Vietnam War ended in 1975 and the whole thing hit a little too close to home I think for this story to be filmed before it was like in 1969 70 71Bravo to Director Milos Foreman!

He's a little young 9 for a lot of the themes in it but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch and he gets the idea that end is ironic. While I can't think of other films in this genre it does have a stand alone genius I love. It also does a unique justice to Central Park. Most musicals are lost on me one way or another. Tommy was over the top and heavy handed in direction Oliver seemed like crowd control on the silver screen The Wall was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble but listening to Failure of the Flesh from Hair sounds right for our times today as it did in the eighties as it must have in the sixties...truly Timeless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later I am now 17 and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect since it had been 13 years since I last saw it but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing the music was so fun and I now find myself singing along to every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger the leader of the hippie group who always gets what he wants one way or another except for at the very end of course. John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude the Oklahoma draftee who falls in love with Sheila Beverly D'Angelo. D'Angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud the other two members of the group and Cheryl Barnes who plays Hud's fiance has an amazing voice. The only problem I have with this movie however is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are barely ever shown together and when they are they fight remember the skinny dipping scene?. It seems as though their relationship is very weak and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love only based on the few meetings they had. I also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the PG rating this movie has. I personally would raise the rating up to a PG13 only because there is some drug use... but remember in 1979 PG13 didn't exist. I don't think the nudity is bad at all it is in no way sexual in fact there isn't really any sex at all in this movie and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries nudity isn't regarded as something bad and I don't see why it is here in the US. Anyways I give this movie a high rating and I'm glad it was made back then because in the insanely politically correct world of today they wouldn't even think of making it and even if they did it would be a very watered down version and I'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. In conclusion this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.".

I had heard people make fun of it and I had heard people praise it. So I had to watch I had to have an opinion.At the beginning of the film I enjoyed The Age of Aquarius number and was intrigued. However when the number Hair came on I didn't know how to react. I wanted to laugh at it and change the channel I didn't want my siblings to make fun of me. Yet the song though a little stupid was also catchy. I kept watching. After I was finished watching the entire film I had no idea what had just happened. I didn't know if I liked it or not I did know that I wanted to see it again.This is a strangely addicting film. I watched it three more times in the days following and my final verdict is I love it! I can't help it. It's just so fun! The fist time I watched it I was mocking it but by the third time viewing it I was in anticipation over when the number Hair would come on so I could sing along. I especially loved the song How Can People Be So Hard it's a different pace from the majority of the film. What can I say when it was over I was singing the songs in my head for weeks. I just have to buy it. I highly recommend this film to musical lovers especially if you love musicals like The Who's Tommy. And although I know I would never be a hippie this film makes me want to say Heck with work I'm going to grow out my hair so fleas can live in it! Watch it but beware I think it just might do the same for you!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The original stage show was a gem but there was no practical way of reproducing its essence on film so it appears the story was almost completely rewritten and the staging redone for the film version.What was filmed is lively and a fun depiction of the hippie movement as it never was.  Then again most musicals reach into fantasy just a bit to give the audience the escapism reason for wanting to see movies.  The movie of Hair is presented in a very mainstreamed format unlike the stage show and leaves out the major protests of the stage show against pollution I understand that DOW Chemicals was a major financial backer of the movie so that might explain the omission of all pollution references and songs  although they are on the soundtrack as well as most references to the politics of the era or the plight of black soldiers in combat.  Gone too are most of the conflicts between the younger and older generations. This film however works for what it is a musical fantasy that should not be taken seriously or as a depiction of real history.  The songs that made it to the film are just as full of energy as they were on the stage and the new story line for the most part is well done.  The ending sadly goes over the top and alters the whole focus of what had been the building conflict within the plot.  Overall it is an enjoyable musical involving a very sad time in this nation's history.  Unfortunately the profundity of the stage show is lost and most people will only ever know the frivolity of this film rather than the beauty and depth of the original musical.".

For those of you who don't realize it this film is almost nothing like the original play Claude was more or less the leader of the tribe not Berger. And Claude was bisexual. Most of the plot in the film was totally fabricated by Milos Forman the director. Among other things he left out some of the more interesting songs including one My Conviction that was sung by a transvestite long before most people were even aware that such people existed. The antiwar sentiment was much stronger in the original...etc etc etc.All this does not mean that the film version of HAIR isn't interesting  obviously many people like it. But I thought you should know that it is a pale substitute for the original. For those who liked the film it might be worthwhile buying the play and discovering just how different the two versions are.I would like to say one thing here that I found extraordinary. I live in Paris and when this film opened I went to one of the largest cinemas in Paris to see it. At that time the French were a very controlled people in general. Despite this something quite extraordinary for its time happened in the cinema the day I was there. At the point in the film where Hud's wife is angry for having been deserted by him she sings How Can People Be So Heartless?... and she did such a wonderful job of it that the entire theatre burst into spontaneous applause. In the middle of a movie theatre this was unheard of behaviour for the French So I guess Milos Forman did something right!".

But when I read through the reviews written by viewers who didn't like Hair I felt that my disenchantment with the film was a bit different from that expressed by other people. I saw the original stage production when I was very young and grew up listening to the lp from age 5 to 15. I loved Hair both the music and the story. And when the movie first came out I saw it. I didn't like it. Now 25 years later I have tried to watch it again thinking that with the passage of time Hair the Movie might have qualities I didn't notice then. No. That is not the case. If you like The Wiz then Hair the Movie might be up your alley. But if you are expecting it to let the spirit of the songs and story emerge forget it. Watch the original Jesus Christ Superstar or watch a movie made in the 60s or early 70s like a Cassavettes or Jodorowksy movie or anything. But I'll try to tell you why Hair the Movie is such a disappointment.Several reviewers have complained that the movie is dated. I agree  but it is dated not because it is about the 60s but because it is about the late70s. Watch Micheal Jackson's Thriller and you'll have pretty much seen the authentic 60s dance sequences. Tharp or no Tharp. Makeup coifs clothes jewelry all remind me of the cheesy late discoearly New Wave style.The producers went out of their way to flatten the significance of the songs. We can still hear the taboo words but gone is their force and gone are the dark insinuations the writers made about a society torn apart by racial hatred economic inequality and confusion over a war we were fighting for murky reasons. Hair the Play asked questions like what does it mean to die for your country? what does it mean to be free? what does it mean to be hated? what does it mean to love? Hair the Movie doesn't ask anything. It shows us some stock characters with easily identifiable clichd qualities and runs them through a predictable story. At least one reviewer complained that Hair is about a bunch of drug taking hippies etc. etc. Sadly that is exactly what this movie is about  cheerful vacuous stereotyped characters. Hair the Movie is not about humans struggling with hate death love struggling with their own values and those of their families friends and people who they may never know but who they are told to hate. In fifty years film critics may look back on Hair the Movie and be able to say something interesting about the fetish of the 60s the shallowness of the late70s or something. For now this movie sucks.".

Maybe taken as an separate thing the movie is OK but as an adoption of the play it's terrible.First the good. The songs are sung well and the production values are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys White Boys is cute. The ClaudeBerger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.But the basic spirit was very much distorted. It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fit the storyline to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.Claude Sheila and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly probably be busted in rank and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like not what the play described and is directly opposite to a love generation.I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be selfsufficient outside the capitalist system not beg from it.After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out Berger insists on being bailed instead with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents and then hitting on his own mommy.Be In has always been a very spiritual point but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip it ruins a beautiful song. I know they're contrasting Floating In Space with the Army. But again it totally ruins a beautiful song.While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping Berger steals their clothes laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible.Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing Starshine at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible stolen of course.I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979 and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show but this ain't it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Milos Forman celebrates the hippies people should be able to remember with this how beautifully right they often were. They are still usually put down as much as they were when they were operational.The best HAIR is beautiful Beverly D'Angelo's blowing in the wind as she sings Good Morning Starshine in the Pontiac convertible with her new friends as they zoom across the Nevada desert to find Claude John Savage.Berger Treat Williams has two fabulous arguments with the authorities both of which are very painful to watch because you can feel the militarysocial force over what is considered to be his irresponsibility and paltriness. The first time is at Sheila's wedding party when he resists eviction from the party and ends up mostly prevailing by dancing on the tablealthough he and all of his friends end up in jail for it. The second time at the army base he does not prevail and the other wellknown solution is arrived at. But both times you can feel the quiet violence of authorities against gypsies.Actually society tells you to be like the Flower Children then punishes you if you actually do it.Just because a lot of the original Flower Children became Yuppies doesn't mean they didn't do anything important when they were hippies.The 60's were NOT over because of what some otherwise fine writers have authoritatively said had already begun to occur before the Manson murders. Anything artistically beautiful leaves living traces that endure forever this film documents one of those movements that mattered.They called this writer media poison and she wasn't always that. She just called them children who she more or less said were just living this way and left it at that. They had been smart not to tell her everything in HaightAshbury when she drank gin and took ups to do the story.In the same group of essays she claims not be interested in paradises real or artificial. Well that explains a lot.She said she was too unstable to take acid when they offered it to her but this was only partially true It was fear of paradises.Otherwise it is impossible to miss how this extraordinary film made almost 15 years after HaightAshbury and the East Village would cease to exist as they had remaining primarily only as weak mutations reduced to unspeakable New Age ashrams where the pot was all gone and heavily enforced k.p. dutyvilely called karmayoga thingswas prevalent captures so much of the happiness that some of us remember so well still as we continue on as kinds of older hippies...Twyla Tharp's choreography and Ann Roth's colours are all that that strange moment was and is supposed to beI remember the way people who had used LSD drew stars you could always tell a psychedelic star a psychedelic moon a psychedelic sun. I went to a New York head shop where I was referred to an 84yearold morphine addict who lived in Paris who I was to look up as I bought two velvet hats.Some hippies lasted. I saw Adam Purple at the Union Square Market in 1996 riding a bicycle festooned with many balloons and told him how much I had loved his tulip garden in concentric circles grown in a vacant lot in what was then a wino neighborhood on Eldridge Street about 1977and then razed for highrise apartments. He said yeah if it's good it won't last...Well that's not exactly true of course but he wouldn't have been a pure hippie artist if he hadn't been able to put it that way and not try to see it another way.His wife was Eve Purple. I hope he hadn't really married her. They obviously wouldn't have needed to.Beautiful Beverly D'Angelo seems to love Berger and Claude and Hud Dorsey Wright and she is never corny about it. Nobody is corny.Corniness has little to do with love.Hud's fiancee is Cheryl Barnes and she sings Easy to Be Hard full of deep Gospel that resonates dark sounds in Central Park. It is this song that proves the comprehensive intelligence of the show Hud has just tried to shirk his responsibilities to Cheryl and their young boy. He wants to wish them away. In this song she talks about how easy it is to be hard especially people who care about strangers...who care about evil and social injustice.. those same people who will walk away from those close to them when they get in the way of their easy time of it. Gradually Jeannie and Sheila and Berger and Woof make Hud go back and gather Cheryl and the boy up. Even the hippies were being given a strict test for hypocrisy the beauty of this is that they pass the test so we can love the hippies. The 'carpool' going across the desert would never have been possible if Cheryl and the baby hadn't been part of the mornin' singin' song.Central Park has never been more of a movie star than it is in this one and New York is sure lookin' good in this memoir of collective rapture.That same essayist said New York was no mere city and that she would always have the feeling toward it as of the first person who touched you.She was often right of course. It's not my fault she wouldn't give the hippies a break. They had time to help bring on the resistance to the Vietnam War that forever changed the course of what America could then be no matter how hard it tries to forget it.Let the Sunshine In makes it impossible for the song in the Pontiac Bonneville convertible to be called Good Mornin' Sunshine and that is a true blessing it goes without saying.It's about those psychedelic stars even though they are under the sun in the morning in Nevada and this moment in the film is like a magic carpet ride all its own. This is where the hippies just get to be hippies like in THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA when Mrs. Faulk Ava Gardner says when Richard Burton finally lets loose That's Shannon bein' Shannon!Good mornin' Starshine...the earth says 'hello'...you twinkle up above..we twinkle below...Good mornin' Starshine...you lead us along...My love and me as we sing...our early mornin' singin' song...Glitty clup cluby...libbee lubbee loobee..oh la la la lo..Saba sibbie saba...Dooby aba naba.. lily lo lo..Dooby ooby wama...Nooby aba naba.. early mornin' singin' song...Singin' a song song to sing...Song song song siing sing sing singsong... Song song song siing sing sing singsong... Song song song siing sing sing singsong..This is not a cereal song but it would make cereal seem okay and even macrobiotic food more bearable if one remembers beautiful Beverly D'Angelo and beautiful Treat Williamsit wouldn't even hurt Anita Bryant and Pat Boone and other Baptists but they couldn't sing it either.A song about song. Very perfect singin' song I'd say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people have raved about the film version of the acclaimed Broadway musical here on IMDb. That being said I went in to watching this film with a very open mind. Having seen the play only a few nights before viewing the film I couldn't wait to see the same amazing songs and the same poignant storyline done on the big screen.However from the getgo I was rather disappointed. Not only was the story almost completely rewritten important pieces were omitted and songs assigned to specific characters in the play were completely reassigned to other characters with seemingly no rhyme or reason. I was especially disappointed in the representation of Hud. In the play he and all the other characters are harmless peace loving hippies but this movie makes him an arrogant and absent father of a child who then proceeds to scream at and be abusive towards the mother of the child two characters not even included in the play in the first place.Sadly the vocal chops of the stars in the film just didn't match the caliber of the current Broadway cast either.Someone else said it very well in one of their reviews this movie just did not capture the spirit and real message of the play for me. A lot of people scoff at the nude scene that is in the play but it actually holds very important symbolism and in actuality is a pivotal moment in the plot. Obviously at the time a full nude scene was out of the question for films but I think the issue could have still been dealt with in the movie in one way or another. I can also say that I can only imagine what a monumental task it had to be to turn a play that revolves around only one set and its cast of characters into a feature film but it has been achieved successfully in the past and I think it still could have been done with this play as well. Some might say you have to separate the play and just appreciate it as a film and that may be true. But for me personally the play is such a gem and such an important political and historical artifact that it was just impossible to separate the two.".

	schema:headline " A different Hairstyle than the stage version but still good.";
	schema:reviewBody "The stage play Hair is primarily remembered now for two things....its shocking frankness and its music.  In bringing the musical to the big screen belatedly the bulk of the stage version's loose plot was discarded and a more conventional storyline was created to link the songs together.  This seems to either please or alienate people depending on their relationship to the original show.  In any case the great majority of the songs are retained in this filmization which is more than can be said for many many stage to screen adaptations.  And what music!  In most cases the vocalizing even exceeds the quality of what could be found onstage though the authenticity of the performers is obviously forsaken somewhat as the original cast was LIVING this at the time they were in the show.  The film's plot concerns an Oklahoma farm boy Savage who's on his way to report for active military duty during Vietnam.  He is waylaid in Central Park by a clatch of hippies led by Williams.  He also spies the girl of his dreams D'Angelo a debutante who rides by on horseback in the midst of all the free love gyrations taking place in the park.  The rest of the movie concerns the connections of these characters as they experience culture clash sharing understanding and even love.  There is copious drug use and rebellion against the wealthy along with hallucinogenic dancing and skinny dipping.  Eventually one character makes a gesture for another which winds up costing more than could ever have been imagined.  This moment makes for a hugely poignant ending to what is mostly a lighthearted and ebullient film. True more than a little of the original subject matter has been tossed aside but the filmmakers must be credited for almost successfully weaving a story around the songs which are quite varied in their style and content.  The story fails with regard to creating a believable bond between Savage and D'Angelo that would endure the way it does in the story.  They hardly spend any time together in the bulk of the film and quarrel a lot during that! yet supposedly have this amazing love.  Aquarius gets the movie to a rousing eyeopening start and it's just the beginning of many striking effervescent musical moments in the show.  Oddly the one song that is badly arranged poorly sung and just basically mangled is the title number!  Most of the rest are excellent.  NOTHING is better than complete unknown Barnes' rendition of Easy to be Hard.  She knocks the song completely out of the ball park and sadly and inexplicably her career went nowhere.  Williams is at times deliriously sexy here.  He comes off as annoyingly arrogant and stubborn at first but eventually wins the audience over with his innate charm and vibrant talent.  As the movie nears it's close he soars into the hunk stratosphere when ironically he cuts his hair.  Savage doesn't come off at all like an Oklahoman but manages to display the contrast of his and Williams' characters.  He does an adequate job in all departments throughout.  D'Angelo two years after her jawdropping role in The Sentinel! is hardly debutante material and comes off as icy much of the time but she has her moments as well.  Chapin does a bang up job as her brother.  The remainder of the hippie gang are acquired tastes.  Wright does pretty well but went nowhere after this.  Golden just looks dazed and chews gum incessantly.  Dacus is quite weak and does little to enhance the film.  What's surprising is how a film that contains lengthy shots of bare breasts male rear ends and even split second male frontal nudity was considered benign enough to warrant a PG rating yet now nearly 25 years later America seems to still have a Puritanical viewpoint towards the human body when compared to other countries.  The tide has turned backward from the free love and selfexpression era except in trash like The Jerry Springer Show and Howard Stern.".

	schema:headline " Not just a musical but a strong poignant bittersweet movie";
	schema:reviewBody "When Hair was released in 1979 I told myself You really love each song of the musical and now it's adapted for the screen by one of your favorite filmmaker. So hurry up! The show starts in twenty minutes!' That afternoon I saw what I consider one of the best movies ever made. Everything is just perfect in it. The casting the choregraphy the screenplay the mise en scne. Although the film depicts a period very limited in time the end of the sixties and the Hippie movement its message is universal. Hair the film is about the meanness of the riches the absurdity of war the naivety and selfishness of the youth and the power of love. The main quality of this film is that it leads you where you don't expect to go. Each scene is an amazement. Even after seeing it over and over I'm still surprised by its originality. The funny number called White BoysBlack Boys' that is sung jointly by trios of girls and army officers is a pure jewel of sexual ambiguity. This uses beautifully the elliptical editing. A good example of this being the scene that shows Claude in his barrack's bed writing a letter to Sheila and then cut to Sheila running to show the letter to Berger and his gang. And what can I add that hasn't been told about the poignant final scene? It summarizes the genius of this bittersweet film that makes you laugh and cry that is both charming and revolting just like all the other Milos Forman's movies. Summing up it's a great film one of those we can discuss endlessly".

'The Hearts of Age' an eight minute short was codirected by Welles with William Vance whose only other film credit is a 1932 adaptation of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and also stars Welles' first wife Virginia Nicholson.This silent film essentially a string of images loosely tied together was almost certainly inspired by surrealistic classics such as Luis Buuel's 'Un chien andalou An Andalusian Dog 1929' and 'L' ge d'or The Golden Age 1930' and Jean Cocteau's 'Le Sang d'un pote The Blood of a Poet 1930.' Whether Welles and Vance where attempting to imitate this surrealism or merely to satirize it I was unable to deduce though the final effect is adequately frightening and disconcerting.For such a film comprised of splitsecond flashes of seemingly random objects it is difficult to judge performances. However I can safely assert that Welles' is the standout even if his performance is far from spectacular. Despite his face being obscured by his Death mask Welles unquestionably radiates at least a small portion of the charisma that would lead him to stardom later in life his confident  almost arrogant  swagger is unmistakable.If somebody other than Orson Welles had created this film would we be taking any notice of it? Probably not. However the very fact that that it is the debut directorial effort of one of the twentieth century's most respected entertainers makes it a fascinating historical curiosity and therefore mustsee viewing.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1938 a young actor and theater director named Orson Welles earned notoriety and recognition when his radio play version of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds was broadcasted shocking the nation and prompting many studios to notice Welles' talent. This success would take Welles to Hollywood where in 1941 he would direct what is now considered by many critics as the best movie ever made the influential classic Citizen Kane. At the age of 26 Welles had already made the movie of his lifetime and was about to begin a career that despite the many troubles he found mainly studio interference managed to produce excellent results. However Citizen Kane wasn't the first time this prodigy had made a movie as before Kane the young Welles made 2 short films that helped him to experiment with the medium. The first one was The Hearts of Age a film he did when he was only 19.The Hearts of Age is a surrealist film based on ideas about old age decrepitude and death. Virginia Nicholson plays an Old Woman sitting on a bell on the top of a house while a black servant Paul Edgerton rings the bell. She seems to enjoy the feeling of the bell moving with her on top as she watches people coming by and gets angered whenever her servant stops to rest a bit. Soon a sinister man Orson Welles appears acting exaggeratedly polite to her and becoming interested in her servant. Soon she discovers that the sinister man is Death as he begins to do his job with some of the people she has seen. The Lady doesn't seem to care much until he decides to go after her servant whose death would mean that the bell would stop moving. As she watches how his servant dies she discovers that she is also on Death's list.Cryptic and strange this 8 minutes short film was written by Welles in an apparent attempt to satirize the surrealist movies of Jean Cocteau or at least that's what he said about it many years later. It certainly follows the style and structure or lack of one of the works of surrealists like Buuel for example as the plot is developed in a dreamlike fashion often illogical and filled with metaphors about the main theme. In this case theme is mortality the nature of death and how people reacts to it. The movie also touches the subject of the hypocrisy of the attitudes towards black people that people of his time used to have. While this may sound like a honest attempt to satirize what Welles sees as the pretentiousness of surrealist artists it never truly achieves that purpose and in the end it feels more pretentious and overthetop as the movies is attempting to parody.While of course nowhere near the movies he would make later in his career The Hearts of Age does show two interesting traits that would later become trademarks of Welles' style. First a highly creative camerawork which even in this experimental stage already shows that Welles understands the limitless possibilities of cinema and its value to tell stories visually. The second of those traits is his stylish use of editing sadly something he wouldn't be able to show in many of his movies which in this films still shows a lot of influence from Soviet montage theory but that later would evolve into the perfect complement for his cinematography. Something that can also be seen in this short film is that even at the age of 19 Welles already knew what to get from his actors and had the skill to direct them properly into delivering what he wanted.Considering the style of the short this last thing may sound insignificant but one can't deny that while certainly the movie is nothing more than a mere amateurish experiment it shows that Welles truly had a prodigious talent despite the lack of a properly written script. The cast is good in their roles although as written above the main weakness in in the script. It's not that it's bad it actually handles symbolism in a remarkable way it's just that it seems to take itself too seriously for its own sake that it ends up making the film a but boring despite the short runtime. Welles himself considered the movie more an experiment on filmmaking than an actual film and watching the results it's hard to disagree with him as the technical aspects are far more interesting than the artistic merit of The Hearts of Age.Wheter he truly intended to make fun of surrealism or actually failed in an attempt of making surreal art it is truly an impossible thing to know for sure but what we do know is that this first movie marked the beginning of Welles' interest in filmmaking as an extension for his work at the theater. An interest that would transform into an obsession that would become the force behind some of the most significant films in the history of cinema. The Hearts of Age is not exactly something amazing but given its historical importance it is a required viewing for anyone remotely interested in the career of one of the most important men in filmmaking Orson Welles. Weak confusing and a tad pretentious The Hearts of Age is the proof that even giants started small. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like surrealistic films like Cocteau's or Salvador Dali's THE HEARTS OF AGE may appeal to you. It certainly throws symbols around but it is the work of two teenagers at a prep school not of a major French 20th Century poet and film maker and a major Spanish artist. When the latter two put in symbols and repeated them there was a rhythm and sense in their use  especially as their films were meant to shock or to attack the Church.Here two preppies William Vance and George O. Welles are trying to make a surreal movie. It has some nice touches. A hand reaches out of the crypt of a cemetery or seemingly so to grab a stone marker cross. But it's dollar book symbolism. In high school I was involved in making a film and it involved a rare tablet that unlocked hideous power secrets. I suggested in a scene supposedly shot at a religious altar that the tablet be placed in a skeletal hand. Disembodied or fossilized hands scare people and are useful in keeping an audience's attention. That was why I suggested it.From my above reduction of one of the two creators of this film calling Orson Welles by his first name I am sort of hinting at the problem at watching THE HEARTS OF AGE. If it's creators were a pair of nonentities we would not care to even consider the film. But it was codirected by Welles some three years before THE CRADLE WILL ROCK some four years before THE WAR OF THE WORLD broadcast and some seven years before CITIZEN KANE. Welles' creative ascendancy was about to blossom so we look at this early stunt as full of suggestions of greatness. That's stretching it.It shows potential. Mr. Vance Virginia Nicholson and Paul Edgarton do as well with their acting parts as the normal teenagers who are in a school production. It's when Welles shows up that we see more spice in the acting. This is not based on a blind Wellesian hero worship. He shows a subtlety in his playing the part of the mysterious male figure that is lacking in the other three performances. Ms Nicholson seems bad tempered and suspicious at times mostly at Mr. Welles but she fails to gain our interest or sympathy. Mr. Edgarton as a doomed bell ringerslave he's in black face gets some sympathy as he is forced to constantly labor and eventually he dies by hanging. But the lack of any rational or symbolic reason for this kills the effect of his demise! Welles obviously was given the best part because he can act. He first appears as a jaunty figure in top hat and tales. His thin body he could not have played this part forty years later seems to be springing down various ladders and walks as in a dance. With his pale bald features he may represent death dancing and later playing the piano. But is he? Or is he simply an old man who is happy to survive his wife Ms Nicholson? and buries her quickly when he finds her corpse? When Pauline Kael did her hatchet job on Welles' contribution to CITIZEN KANE she pointed out that his makeup in THE HEARTS OF AGE mirrored the elderly Kane. There is a resemblance but then keep in mind that in both films we are seeing the frame of Welles' face covered by a bald wig. So there would be a resemblance anyway. Moreover Kael was so determined to rob Welles' Kane performance of any originality that she also found he looked like Peter Lorre as Dr. Gogol in MAD LOVE a 1935 thriller where Lorre is an insane surgeon terrorizing a crippled pianist Colin Clive. When Welles was asked about this he said he never even heard of Lorre's movie before. He probably hadn't. My guess is that any resemblance between Welles' performance in THE HEARTS OF AGE and CITIZEN KANE are solely due to both characters he played having to age or be old. Certainly when he played the old Charles Foster Kane he moved slowly like the elderly slightly obese Kane would have moved  not like the jaunty death's head he played in THE HEARTS OF AGE.".

Disembodied or fossilized hands scare people and are useful in keeping an audience's attention. That was why I suggested it.From my above reduction of one of the two creators of this film calling Orson Welles by his first name I am sort of hinting at the problem at watching THE HEARTS OF AGE. If it's creators were a pair of nonentities we would not care to even consider the film. But it was codirected by Welles some three years before THE CRADLE WILL ROCK some four years before THE WAR OF THE WORLD broadcast and some seven years before CITIZEN KANE. Welles' creative ascendancy was about to blossom so we look at this early stunt as full of suggestions of greatness. That's stretching it.It shows potential. Mr. Vance Virginia Nicholson and Paul Edgarton do as well with their acting parts as the normal teenagers who are in a school production. It's when Welles shows up that we see more spice in the acting. This is not based on a blind Wellesian hero worship. He shows a subtlety in his playing the part of the mysterious male figure that is lacking in the other three performances. Ms Nicholson seems bad tempered and suspicious at times mostly at Mr. Welles but she fails to gain our interest or sympathy. Mr. Edgarton as a doomed bell ringerslave he's in black face gets some sympathy as he is forced to constantly labor and eventually he dies by hanging. But the lack of any rational or symbolic reason for this kills the effect of his demise! Welles obviously was given the best part because he can act. He first appears as a jaunty figure in top hat and tales. His thin body he could not have played this part forty years later seems to be springing down various ladders and walks as in a dance. With his pale bald features he may represent death dancing and later playing the piano. But is he? Or is he simply an old man who is happy to survive his wife Ms Nicholson? and buries her quickly when he finds her corpse? When Pauline Kael did her hatchet job on Welles' contribution to CITIZEN KANE she pointed out that his makeup in THE HEARTS OF AGE mirrored the elderly Kane. There is a resemblance but then keep in mind that in both films we are seeing the frame of Welles' face covered by a bald wig. So there would be a resemblance anyway. Moreover Kael was so determined to rob Welles' Kane performance of any originality that she also found he looked like Peter Lorre as Dr. Gogol in MAD LOVE a 1935 thriller where Lorre is an insane surgeon terrorizing a crippled pianist Colin Clive. When Welles was asked about this he said he never even heard of Lorre's movie before. He probably hadn't. My guess is that any resemblance between Welles' performance in THE HEARTS OF AGE and CITIZEN KANE are solely due to both characters he played having to age or be old. Certainly when he played the old Charles Foster Kane he moved slowly like the elderly slightly obese Kane would have moved  not like the jaunty death's head he played in THE HEARTS OF AGE.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ok I will say more this goes down in wrestling history as the first super match it was the current WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs the WWF intercontinental champion The Ultimate Warrior it was a unification match of sorts.  What made this match so special was the fact that there was no 'bad guy' both were huge fan favourites and one of the few times when no one knew who was going to win this made for a unique atmosphere with the crowd 5050 on who they wanted win I was a little warrior not a hulkamaniac.  Of course now we know that the Warrior beat Hogan much to my delight. Everyone thought that this would be the last time we saw Hogan hold the WWF Chamionship and that The Ultimate Warrior would go on to dominate wrestling. For one reason or another this never happened and a mere six months later Hogan was the champ again.  This match will also be remembered as one of the very few times Hulk Hogan jobbed lost to someone.  Anyway this main event will go down as one fo the great matches of all time maybe not for the quality but because of how important it was.  I would rank it right up there with other main event Wrestlemania matches like Bret Hart vs Shawn Micheals Steve Austin vs Shawn Micheals and the second Austin vs Rock match.  I would recommend buying this video to anyone for the plain reason of the main event.".

Hogan and the Warrior battled in an explosive match for over twenty minutes in a match that could have gone either way. Those two guys were sweating at the end of the match. And who can forget the crowd? Just like WrestleMania III where Andre the Giant fought Hogan the crowd cheered like they were crazy. The electricity in the building was amazing as Hogan and the Warrior tore into each other.If the main event isn't enough for you there were plenty of other great matches such as The Rockers VS The Orient Express Tito Santana VS The Barbarian Roddy Piper VS Bad News Brown and many other great matches. My favourite match on the undercard pitted tag team champions Demolition VS The Colossal Connection.A smashing event!".

With Wrestlemania VI however two incredibly popular wrestlers at the time in Hogan  the Ultimate Warrior put their respective belts on the line in a main event that split the crowd in half in terms of cheering support. Good guy vs good guy!Of course an event is not made by its main event alone and this is a great wrestling card that earns its 5star rating. I won't go into detail on every match here but here are some of the highlightsMr. Perfect continuing his great brand of wrestling against Brutus The Barber Beefcake. The Hart Foundation taking on The Bolsheviks with some hilarious prematch comedy featuring Steve Allen. An interesting semiheel turn from newlybranded Macho King Randy Savage by pairing up with Sensational Sherri instead of the traditional Elizabeth. Any Big Boss Man match this time vs. Akeem is usually pretty entertaining because he is such a great character.There are no terrible matches in this entire event. They are all entertaining in some facet or another. The commentary from Gorilla Monsoon  Jesse The Body Ventura helps set the perfect tone once again.Then Hulk vs. Warrior blows the lid off! This was one of the most anticipated battles of all time and it pretty much lives up to the billing. Neither big man is a particularly talented wrestler but the hype is just so big and each man plays his part perfectly.This is the best Wrestlemania in the series so far just ahead of the tournament from W4.".

	schema:headline " First WrestleMania out of the states... Hogan finally suffers a loss";
	schema:reviewBody "WrestleMania 6 took place April 1 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto Ontario Canada.Match 1 Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware  For what it was a very solid opening match. Koko was always fairly popular with the fans and at this point Martel was still getting over as a heel talent. In the end Martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.Match 2 The Colossal Connection Andre The Giant  Haku c with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan vs Demolition Ax  Smash for the WWF Tag Team Championship  At this point Andre's health was really awful so his performance was really nothing special. The crowd is 100 pro Demolition in this match. In the end Haku is pinned and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the match Andre lays out Haku and Heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania.Match 3 Earthquack vs Hercules  Very short match. Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. R.I.P. to both men in the match. John Tenta Earthquake passed not that long ago and same with Hercules. In the end Earthquake pins Hercules for the win.Match 4 Mr. Perfect vs Brutus The Barber Beefcake  The first really good match of the night. R.I.P. to Curt Henning Mr. Perfect. Really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. In the end Brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.Match 5 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown  Not a technical classic but a pretty decent brawl for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half blackhalf white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.Match 6 The Hart Foundation vs The Bolsheviks  Complete squash match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy win. Surprising that WWE used to have a tag team division.Match 7 The Barbarian vs Tito Santana  Bobby Heenan's Heenan Family fairs better in this match as The Barbarian takes the win against Tito Santana. Not memorable but good to go back and watch years later.Match 8 Randy Savage  Sensational Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes  Sapphire  Big intergender tag team match. Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. In the end Rhodes and Sapphire get the win over The Macho King and Sensational Queen Sherri.Match 9 The Rockers vs The Orient Express  Surprisingly another tag team match. Tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the Orient Express.Match 10 Dino Bravo vs Jim Duggan  Duggan gets a decent reaction despite his American Patriot gimmick. Bravo a member of Jimmy Hart's group comes to the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has support Duggan takes the win.Match 11 The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase c vs Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship  The first major main event of the night. Roberts was extremely over with the fans. Match was considerably good for what it was. DiBiase is able to pick up a count out win on Roberts. But Roberts ends up possessing DiBiase's money and giving it away.Match 12 The Big Boss Man vs Akeem with Slick  One Man Gang's sad attempt at being an African Dream named Akeem. A really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. Boss Man wins with a slam.Match 13 Jimmy Superfly Snuka vs Rick Rude  Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this match. Snuka never really got it good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing end. After a short 5 minutes Rude gets the win over Snuka.Match 14 WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior  Dubbed as The Ultimate Challenge we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. The match was actually very good given that people tend to think Hogan can't wrestle. A lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. In the end Warrior gets the win on Hogan and wins both titles. A stunned crowd looks on as Hulk Hogan suffers his first loss at WrestleMania.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988 but mostly it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan and that's the way it should be.But on this night that was about to change a new champion a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out. But the WWE was right about one thing Hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established.This historic Wrestlemania the first to be held outside America kicked off with Rick Martel defeating Koko B Ware. Koko never really had a lot of luck at Wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here.Next up the Colossal Connection Andre the Giant and Haku put their tag team titles on the line against Demolition Ax and Smash and lost. New tag team champions crowned.Next match saw Earthquake defeat Hercules. Hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at Wrestlemania. Plenty of luck for Brutus Beefcake as he ended Mr Perfect's undefeated streak. Well I guess someone had to end it.Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match next up the Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19 seconds. Not really a match unfortunately. The Barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short match.The American Dream Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated the Macho King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a messy mixed tag match. This was the only female wrestling really going on in the WWE at this point of time.Next up was a fun match as the Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated The Orient Express in a fast paced encounter. There were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a nothing match.Next Ted DiBiase put his most cherished possession the Million Dollar Championship on the line against Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and counted out allowing Ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show.Next up the Twin Towers collide as the Big Bossman defeats Akeem in short order this is followed by Rick Rude winning a short match with Jimmy Snuka.Finally we come to the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE Title on the line against Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is an entertaining back and forth match won by the Warrior after Hogan missed a leg drop. The crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle.And so the torch was passed but would the Ultimate Warrior prove to be the Champion the WWE hoped he would be?".

Its pretty stupid to whine about but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot and it didn't exist on this DVD. What is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?".

Hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior on the other hand was a masked man of few words  an outofthelimelight hero for a different audience.This rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant. I had a place for both of them. Because there was bloodshed too in this long heavy battle the stakes were high  at least to me as a kid.

Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. Their movies were like a sap to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog.Armored is so a guy movie. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Exploding money? If that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited then stay away.At 88 minutes Armored is all muscle without an ounce of fat. We meet six security guards who drive armored trucks three per truck. The six led by Matt Dillon scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks. Their mission one day is to deliver 42 million from the federal reserve I think. The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse stash the cash then stage a hijack. Sure the cops will suspect them but if they stick together they'll get through it.Trouble is one of the six played by Columbus Short is a holdout. At first. But he faces eviction. And he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother. He needs cash bad.Matt Dillon cajoles pleads persuades the holdout. No blood on anyone's hands. A clean getaway. All good no bad. You'll be rich forever. Blue skies smiling at you ...Right.Everything goes to hell of course. It's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up. And it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay. I happen to like industrial urban decay.Kudos to Matt Dillon who plays the top bad dog. He goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie. Love that guy.Also credit is due to the menacing throbbing blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by John Murphy. I am guessing he's heard a few Tangerine Dream records.Also it's surprising that this is a PG13 movie. I caught one  one!  fbomb in this entire movie about violent toughguy robbers. On some level I like that. Take the kids.The director is Nimrod Antal a Hungarian who made a fine noir set in the Budapest subway system called Kontroll. Screenwriter is an outofnowhere guy called James V. Simpson.A lot of the people in this movie are just starting out. I am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers.".

Firsttime screenwriter James V. Simpson's script for Armored gets this half right. He made extradoublesure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank brother I've been there. And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike Matt Dillon who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with Baines Lawrence Fishbourne and some weird French dude Jean Reno. These guys like to have fun and play pranks but they are also serious armored car guys too so that means they carry guns and are tough.After a short while as one theoretically watches Armored one might start to think as I did that maybe  just maybe  this is going to be some kind of awesome tongueincheek cornball heist movie with some onthenose characterizations that move the story along its natural course cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really really clever plan with lots of potential 'holy sht' moments. I mean the music alone is textbook heistmovie  gritty edgy beats working overtime as we're treated to closeups of characters who say things like As a matter of fact I do and Are you crazy??

There's no Ok here's what we're gonna do... scene no blueprints no explosives no black van or skimasks despite their 'testrun' as can be seen in a trailer. No these guys are going to steal 42 million dollars from their own trucks which are only being tracked by HOURLY contact over the radio despite being equipped with some fancy bigdeal 'GPS technology' and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it. Hell Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before which is completely ridiculous. But of course Ty's got his house to think about so as long as Mike promises that 'no one will get hurt' he's on board. Guess what though. Somebody gets hurt. Why? Because besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money they have no plan. That was it. That was how far they thought things out. So naturally things start to unravel. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared.This script frankly feels like it's like the product of some bad improv game Armored Car robbed by its own guards...GO! Despite some halfdecent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions the story just completely falls apart and pretty soon NOTHING makes sense or is even remotely plausible.When filmmakers don't have a cool hook for their heist their characters seem stupid and bungling. And when characters are stupid and bungling it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie leaving a laughable hollow husk.Skip it. 310".

A basic story where security guards for an armoured truck company decide to steal millions of dollars of money but a newbie panics and it's splits up the team leading to problems. The script is terrible and very clichd and even though the movie for the first half hour tries for character development as it tried to be a sort of drama but fails miserably as it isn't touching in the slightest it just leads to pointless talk about inconsequential things and as a result you just get bored. The film was far to slow in getting started and the action well there was little of as it became more and more far fetched and actors who couldn't act. I was quite disappointed with this film particularly with Lawrence Fishburne as he was outstanding as Morpheous in the Matrix as Ray Langston in CSI and great in a small cameo role in the recent predators. Though he did try better than the other actors the script didn't help. This is a movie which is bad in all departments and in the end I didn't care about the characters and what happened to them. This was an hour and a half but it felt like three hours. A bad movie all round and one to avoid.".

Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either. What you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money.

To pull this off they need Ty an Iraq war veteran who just joined the company. At first Ty refuses to be a part of the scheme but he desperately needs the money since he's in risk of loosing his house and his little brother might be taken away from him. Ty ends up agreeing with the all thing but not before Mike the leader of the guards promise that no one will get hurt... Armored is a fastmoving heist film with a good amount of action and some unpredictable twists. Obviously everyone can tell that things are not going to go smoothly but still there are a few surprises and the film doesn't become predictable at any point. Looking at the cast of Armored which is comprised by very well known actors like Jean Reno Laurence Fishburn and Matt Dillon one might expect a tremendous film given the quality of the actors but that's not case. I'm not saying it's a bad film it's not by any means but it's not a film with depth either. If you're expecting something like that you'll be disappointed. This is a popcorn movie there's not much to think about here just turn your brain off and enjoy it. The acting was average with the exception of Matt Dillon who really stood out as the leader of the bad guys. His character is a mean son of a bitch and Dillon played the role perfectly. The film fell a bit short in the third act though because the ending seemed a bit rushed. Bottom line is Armored is entertaining and therefor a good watch just make sure you know what kind film you're about to see.610".

This is a popcorn movie there's not much to think about here just turn your brain off and enjoy it. The acting was average with the exception of Matt Dillon who really stood out as the leader of the bad guys. His character is a mean son of a bitch and Dillon played the role perfectly. The film fell a bit short in the third act though because the ending seemed a bit rushed. Bottom line is Armored is entertaining and therefor a good watch just make sure you know what kind film you're about to see.610";

The movie is all about bloody action scenes with guns. Probably the biggest star in the movie is Laurence Fishburne and he has put on a lot of weight and gotten fat and none of the acting is all that good for any of the characters.

I actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and I nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't. Heist movies are notmeant to be feelgood flicks and this one tried to be just that. Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie I found myself saying no way. Without giving the whole story away it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out and whose house was going into foreclosure.

	schema:reviewBody "I like a few others have made an account simply because of the atrocity that is this movie. I was having a sleepless night and decided to check the movie channels to see if anything was on and low and behold 'Armored' popped up. Remembering some previews I saw awhile back I figured it would at least be entertaining.This ended up being one of the few movies that I just up and turned off about thirty minutes before the end. Normally people just leave if they don't like the type of movie after 530 minutes or just sit through to see how it ends. It has to be a special kind of bad when you've watched almost the entire movie and decide you don't even care how it ends.For those who haven't seen it I can sum up about 40 of the movie in a line. Guys let's spend 45 minutes trying to pop the hinges. That's literally the bulk of the movie they sit there hammering away at the hinges on the armored vehicle because the good guy had a last minute decision and locked himself in the truck. There's little action there's no plot there's no character development there's no good dialogue there's nothing to make you think there's just nothing.The rest of the movie can be summed up pretty quickly as well with no exaggerations made. War veteran comes home has no money has a set of values. Friend gets him a job. All of a sudden the night before some apparently huge 42 million dollar heist the good guy gets told hey we're gonna steal all the money from ourselves and no one gets hurt. He says no.Then OMG your brother is going into child care services because your parents died and you're too shitty of a guardian! I guess the characters thought process was like this I guess it's time to take them up on that 42 million dollar heist that I heard about last night and have no idea as to their plans to actually make it work! After that the heist happens. It becomes apparent that there was no plan they simply plan on dumping the money somewhere pretending they got robbed and picking it up later. Of course the premise is they have an hour after checking in by radio before they have to check in again. That plan is just absurd and any jackass can understand that armored vehicles carrying 42 million dollars don't just go unmonitored for over an hour with no sort of tracking on the vehicle.Well sadly that wasn't the worst part. We get back to what I was talking about earlier. The reason he's been good guy in quotations is because he wasn't the protagonist at all. This movie had no protagonist. He was the guy who joins something on a ridiculous premise and then instantly he decides he doesn't want to when it starts. He tries to get away in the armored truck gets trapped and then next 1 hour chunk of the movie is him sitting in the truck with them hammer on the hinges. The only real feeling this plot generates is one of hate towards the supposed protagonist. His actions are just so unrealistic and stupid you just want the bad guys to kill him after a few minutes.Well to be fair there is a little more than just hinge banging. Every now and then a terrible sub deviation of this glorious main story occurs like a cop showing up to check out the loud sounds and getting shot or one of the guys outside the truck having a change of heart and trying to help him and then promptly getting knifed to death. It was just absurd. And then finally it happened. The few scenes that made me give up entirely on the movie reared their ugly heads. Basically whenever none of them are paying attention he starts sneaking out of the car pretending to be batman or something and causing all sorts of problems. The first time he sneaks out and lights all their stashed money on fire and then returns. After that he somehow undoes the floor of the armored vehicle and starts crawling out from beneath it which none of them notice and then trying to radio for help somewhere.I don't know around that time I noticed there was twenty or so minutes left and just turned it off. It was probably one of the poorest constructed movies I'd ever seen. No actors or good acting could save it nothing could. Armored is just one of those movies that should of had its screenplay thrown in the garbage when put on the studios desk.".

Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it. And thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major onesBecause of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage all of his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon.There are many more needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.".

The lead character Tye and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed along comes godfather Matt Dillon Who does not look much older than Tye so not exactly sure how that happenedto the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it. And thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major onesBecause of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage all of his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon.There are many more needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This thriller from mediocre director Nimrod Antal starts off as though it might have some depth but soon degenerates into a by the numbers heist movie with the most obvious plot imaginable. A group of security guards agree to rob their own truck. When it goes wrong and an innocent is killed the main character then gets a sudden burst of righteousness and decides to take on his crew. Highly predictable clichs including the the protagonist's friend Matt Dillon who when confronted with the temptation of money suddenly becomes a sneering maniac the kidnapping of the protagonist's brother which you could see coming a mile off and the innocent cop Milo Ventimiglia who stumbles upon the gang and gets taken hostage. Unsurprisingly the hero kills the gang and is let off. This is the kind of movie DVD bargain bins were made for. I rate it 3 because it's not the worst thing I've ever seen but I would rate it minus 10 for originality. If you have read this and haven't seen this movie I have hopefully just saved you an hour and a half of your life!".

Its central 'goodguy' figure Ty Columbus Short is an Iraq war veteran who takes a job working as an armoredcar deliveryman who has the backup of other members on the crew who knew his father. They plan a heist so that Ty's house isn't foreclosed by the bank and that his younger brother isn't taken away from him for being a delinquent and a promise is made to him by his friends that no harm will come to anyone during the heist. This of course isn't true as a vagrant is in the warehouse where the armored car thieves attempt to stash the millions and then it turns into a tickingclock scenario where Ty has to find a way out before the other members fully turn on him in realtime the cars have to be back in an hour you see or the whole plan is a bust.Replace Germany with Iraq and you could have a similar scenario play out and one can even see certain actors filling in shoes played by actors of today maybe Farley Granger for Columbus Short certainly they're both bland enough and a heavy like Lionel Stander in Laurence Fishburne's role or Kirk Douglas in Matt Dillon's part. I kept thinking of this during Armored perhaps as a way to amuse myself while the story kept chugging away on its somewhatpredictable gears. Somewhat in that there are a couple of twists that one doesn't expect one involving a crewmember's suicide and that there is some heavy action a couple of times handled competently by director Nimrod Antal.It's never too poorly acted save for Short as I mentioned and its story moves along at a quick enough pace to cover over the fact that it's characters with only so much personality to get them through the picture i.e. Fishburne's a drunk and violent which suits him fine as he appears to have rolled right out of bed before some shots. But mentioning filmnoir in this context should I hope be meant as a compliment. Antal works in a style that is indebt to the far away past of crime thrillers as much as more modern fare that ask for action over character development. It's nice to see an action flick without CGI and the actors are game for the film aiming for simple meatandpotatoes Bmovie roots. It can work just as well seeing it in a theater or on video or late night on cable the latter sounds about right really and seeing it once it's not a disappointment. That it's also kind of forgettable is also a little sad.".

Now one of the men in the heist turns on the others because he doesn't like this murder business. He did not sign up for this and in fact was reluctant about being part of the robbery anyway.The rest of the movie is the battle between that guy  Ty Hackett Columbus Short  and the rest of his gang of security mengone bad. It reminded me of the brutal 1992 movie Trespass where a long intense battle scene was waged in a abandoned building. This turned out to be Trespass 2. The cast was good in here and had some big names like Matt Dillon Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno and one of my favorites from years' past Fred Ward yet only Dillon made much of an impact.This is a guy's movie no women and a lot of violence tough people and some bloodandguts. It ain't Tinker Bell. It definitely was entertaining and decentlyphotographed but had a B feel to it which shouldn't have happened. As I said it's worth a rental and that's it.".

Now one of the men in the heist turns on the others because he doesn't like this murder business. He did not sign up for this and in fact was reluctant about being part of the robbery anyway.The rest of the movie is the battle between that guy  Ty Hackett Columbus Short  and the rest of his gang of security mengone bad. It reminded me of the brutal 1992 movie Trespass where a long intense battle scene was waged in a abandoned building. This turned out to be Trespass 2. The cast was good in here and had some big names like Matt Dillon Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno and one of my favorites from years' past Fred Ward yet only Dillon made much of an impact.This is a guy's movie no women and a lot of violence tough people and some bloodandguts. It ain't Tinker Bell. It definitely was entertaining and decentlyphotographed but had a B feel to it which shouldn't have happened. As I said it's worth a rental and that's it.";

This one a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role just simply isn't very good. Altman made many notverygood films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting there.Shepard is Eddie a stuntman who has a lovehate relationship with May Kim Basinger. The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man Harry Dean Stanton who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the fourperson cast as a gentleman caller.The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice over.Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry.Grade C".

	schema:reviewBody "Fool for Love 1985 was directed by Robert Altman. It's based on a Sam Shepard play. Sam Shepard did the screenplay. Sam Shepard also stars as Eddie a rodeo rider who drives up to an endofnowhere motel and starts causing trouble within the first 60 seconds.I'm amazed that this movie is so bad. Shepard is a good actor and so are the other leads Kim Basinger as May and Harry Dean Stanton as Old Man. Randy Quaid has the unenviable supporting role as a normal guy who arrives at the motel to take May out on a date and ends up enmeshed in the bizarre triangle. It's hard to believe that a brilliant director working with such skilled actors could end up with a movie this bad. Nothing works except that Eddie is a menacing presence throughout. It's obvious from the first minutes of the movie that bad things are going to happen and they do throughout the film.It's also obvious that Altman needed to open up the play so that he could turn it into a movie and he did. He didn't do it all that well but he did it. It's clear that people didn't like the film. At the time I'm writing this review the IMDb rating is a horrific 5.9. I actually helped improve the rating when I gave the film a 6. That must be a first.The movie will work well enough on DVD which is how I saw it. It would probably work better on the large screen because you'd get even more of a sense of the total isolation of the motel location. However my advice is to pick another movie. Fool for Love just isn't worth the time spent watching it.".

Still I don't know what made me decide to give this movie a try when I saw the title in the beginning of the movie but in the end I was glad that I watched it because it certainly wasn't as bad as I feared it would be.Bruce Willis is Russ Duritz a wealthy L.A. image consultant who's about to turn forty. He's a cynical workaholic who has estranged from his father who has no memories of his childhood and who doesn't have a girlfriend a family or even a dog. One night he surprises an intruder who turns out to be an almost 8 years old kid. But there is something strange about him. The chubby kid is named Rusty and has a lot of similarities with Russ. Soon they find out that Russ and Rusty are actually the same person. Together they make a journey into Russ's past to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. How this is possible what it all has to mean and how it will affect both their futures will only be clear at the end of the movie.In a way this is a very typical and predictable Disney movie with it's rather innocent and naive look on life but I guess it can be enjoyable for adults as well. It is all very recognizable and it is a nice fairy tale about losing touch with your inner child. It certainly isn't the best movie ever but it is some decent and heartwarming family entertainment that offers some nice acting and a good story. I would say watch it with an open mind and you'll see it isn't as bad as you feared. I give it a 610.".

I was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part.  This is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it I now agree.  This film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be.  This is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think.  Usually we scorn at What if... movies.  For example Waterworld attempted to answer the question What if the world were to be covered with water and...?  But truthfully nobody cared.  This movie however effects everyone in the theatre.  True young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children.  This movie is definitely worth seeing.  Although it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff  Just relax and have fun.  And take something with you when you leave that cinema.  Take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now for sure this is one of the lightesthearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona I haven't loved everything he has ever been in but he brings it to the 'Bigtime' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. His acclaim he is Russell Duritz he knows what it takes to make it. It just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundationally set there is a problem an intruder at his home the alarm has been activated! Russell can't seem to figure out for the moment what is happening to him. It's different and yet it is somehow familiar. A small boy who looks exactly like.... him. As their lives run smack dab into each other there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him You have unfinished business to take care of now!Amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. She works with him puts up with his 'ego' and yet she is smitten with Russell. Very much so. With Rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute singing too late at night everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! Willis is fun egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable Disney modern times classic 'The Kid' and to add his little heavyduty side kick Spencer Breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational supporting character as he is the heavyweight champ teaching 'little' Rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. All in all this is a real winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as the secretary and aide to Russell. I originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later with equal enjoyment. This is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan Recommended highly ".

This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity offcolor humor profanity or gratuitous violence. I refer of course to The Sixth Sense. Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well although as others have pointed out it isn't a flick FOR kids. I was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained except that we know Russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old.  Also why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight why if as his older self says he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. Good use of the red plane as metaphor however.".

This is certainly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Disney tries to make the film in an interesting and lovely way so it can appeal to both the kids and the adults. But what lies behind the film by far beyond the comprehension of a normal kid. Here let's first look at how other comments put it The movie starts by completely neglecting even an attempt at explaining how 8yearold Rusty shows up on 40yearold Rusty's doorstep But this is not true. Actually the film made a hard work demonstrated how Russ Willis a successful image consultant and a rich jerk was haunted by the hallucination of a flying plane which was actually the same kind of a model given to him by his father as a present. Here Audey Wells present all the viewers a question as a shrimp in the later plot suggested it you're having hallucination for a reason and you need to figure out what that reason is.But at that time the film is not in a hurry to explain the reason. Later on Ross's hallucination got stronger and he even imagined a boy intruded into his house. Even more the hallucinated boy lead him to an old drome. From there Ross's dream or more accurately the psychiatric journey of exploring himself began. That exploration filled most of the film till the 8yearold Rusty disappeared on the same drome notice only at that time Russ's clothes changed back to the sleeping pajama. The main part of the film that's what I called the exploration centered on the questions that had puzzled Russ these days What's wrong with him? Why he always said somebody call the Ouaaaaaaaaambulance? Why he had a twitch? What happened from being little Rusty and becoming Russ? What will be supposed to do with the relation with Amy? And finally what he will be doing in the later time of his life? The film did an excellent job in explain all these questions. Evenmore it raised another question Is Russ really a loser? Here Jean Smart said something very inspiring I mean how many of us grow up to be astronauts or prima ballerina? We just all do the best we can. This film presented the normal theme of midyear crisis in a swift and clever way without lacking of provoking thought.The main character especially Bruce Willis and Jean Smart worked very well to helped achieve visual effect as well as the profound theme.Russ got the answer and know what to do next what about us?".

At this point I'm reminded of a cross between a poor Quantum Leap episode and a bad time traveling flick.Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period. They figure it out.  They meet Willis when he's older.  Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization that he needed to do this and so on.Basically it's a very tired unoriginal uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it.  The good news is that the Kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television.".

What we do have is a pleasant enough though unbelievable feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis in a change of pace plays a selfcentered stuffed shirt of an Image Consultant. He degrades not only his clients but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. Into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin Disney always finds these kids somewhere. This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant. Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the interaction between the Willis and Breslin characters. The Kid though not the greatest of Disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling.".

It's pure genius!!and escapes the Aztec Mummy and his own snake pit trapHe was probably very happy that built that secret escape and had his keys with him. And Bruno is one of the few VERY loyal sidekicks I've ever seen in any film.

Pretty slow moving and lacking in action.  Generally a rehash of the 1st two Aztec Mummy films with a little addition of the Robot creation.  Looks like a really poor interpretation of a Universal monster compilation.  The sequences pulled from the original AZTEC MUMMY look pretty good though. This one is kind of what a 12 yr old kid with a super 8 camera might try to do with a little help from mom and dad who know nothing about making a movie.  And they probably would think it was good too.  One redeeming quality lots of eerie night shots for mood.".

Besides HOW do you resist the title?For late comers a brief explanation of it's merit Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films dubbed them into English then made a mint with them at the drive in. The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with American boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded. Great great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. Now mix in Catholic influenced social conventions Mexican folk lore and we are not in Kansas anymore. Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into. Most were written by Reuban Guberman who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN not the literal translation. As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. There's even a fan web site for Murray that prints the best most over the top lines for each movie. First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing the purple prose the production values and are told it's SUPPOSED to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. It all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION BCI and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.ROBOTMUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two and it's downhill from there logic wise. You don't even get The Angel back or any mention of him in this final episode. Names places even family trees switch between films. After a while you start LOOKING for the continuity changes. By now the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. The mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana  Co S.A.'. I mention this because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. Nope.This was PLANNED. Wait until you see the controller it runs from. X box where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you??? The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end but actually came back in two more Mexican made movies..it had a FAN BASE.. All in all a funny quirky finish to a three movie series. Sit back and enjoy.".

Unfortunately most of the film consists of flashback scenes and some scientist's encounters with The Bat. The robot built out of sturdy cardboard and headlights isn't even introduced till the movie is practically over and their monumental confrontation the premise the movie is supposedly centered around lasts about 30 sec.I have a lot of questions for this movie.

The Bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. He stresses this by rolling his eyeslaughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.He has cobbled together an invincible robot.Looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick.This will make your eyes bleed.A company even takes credit for making this tin can!

	schema:reviewBody "RVAM's reputation preceded it. I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books The 50 Worst Movies Ever or The Golden Turkey Awards or something like that. Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. However Robot wasn't really all that bad. Oh this is definitely a Z film through and through. Some of the voice dubbing as is usually the case for K. Gordon Murray imports is awfully cheesy and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous Aztec Mummy movie narrated with a voiceover by the leading man. A dead giveaway anytime the question Then what happened? is asked more than twice in the dialog you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. In RVAM Then what happened? or What happened then? is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. Even without the structural problems the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older American audience. For instance as the hero explains and explains and explains the backstory. he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards. No background no explanation he just suddenly turned evil. Obviously this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. The clincher though is the Robot the supposed showcase of this movie. This Robot is the worst robot special effect since Undersea Kingdom or even Santa Claus Vs. The Martians. Compared to this hunk of junk the Tin Man from the Wizard Of Oz looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the foundry in T2. The Aztec Mummy himself is well designed and executed he's recognizably undead familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet distinct from the Boris Karloff bandage collection familiar to most American audiences. But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. They could at least have given him some knees for heaven's sake. In addition the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. I've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing. Then the movie basically just stops. That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.In spite of all these problems the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to Monster AGoGo or Attack of The Eye Creatures RVTAM is like a Coppola film. It's just kind of dull and boring and silly. The actors are competent in a mannered B movie way and reasonably photogenic Dr. Krupp in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and Phantom Of the Opera suit. I often found myself rooting for him in spite of his being the villain. Anyway I've seen much much worse. File this with Samson Vs The Vampire Women under interesting Mexican juvenile oddities.".

One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions. Oh and of course the Aztec mummy looked really really crappy.However into this standard but boring film there is a supervillain. Why? I dunnoit sure didn't make any sense to have one. It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots dummy! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.You've got to see these humanrobots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. Both battle in superslowmotion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chucklescertainly not thrills.Overall the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled messespecially at the end.

However I was gratified for their inclusion because at least scenes in which detail was indistinct in the prints utilized for the other two films in the set were far clearer now... Anyway this hastilywritten third and final chapter of the saga provides standard excitements  with yet another attempt by the villain who miraculously escaped the grisly death set out for him at the end of the preceding entry! at hypnotizing the heroine in an effort to locate the dormant mummy and its valuable artifacts which will enable him to lay his hands on the mythical Aztec treasure. All in all it's a very painless way to kill an hour.The Bat's ravings are at their ripest here assisted by his acidscarred lieutenant the result of an unfortunate encounter with the Mummy in the second film  and whose vengeful predicament introduces an unexpected poignancy to the proceedings! he conceives a radioactive human robot! in order to fend off the inevitable marauding mummy. It's not clear just why the robot needed the body and the brain of a man to function but the hulking automaton  with its clumsy movements yet deadly exterior  is obviously a topical nod to Nuclear paranoia which from what I've seen wasn't so much a concern of the Mexihorror subgenre.The oneonone between the two 'monsters' is O.K.  the robot has the upper hand at first but once the controlling device is destroyed the mummy is able to take it apart in a matter of seconds! While the appearance by the hero's pesky brother is thankfully limited this time around the latter's sidekick  somewhat incongruously  also reverts to his cowardly persona here.With this film's ending the Aztec Mummy saga is brought to a nice closure  as heroine Rosita Arenas the reincarnation of the mummy's lover returns the Aztec breastplate and bracelet to Popoca and appeals to it to seek a definitive and welldeserved rest in the ancient temple. I've failed to mention in my comments about the two earlier films in the series the important contribution of the musical score  simply but perfectly evoking the requisite aura of mood mystery and dread.".

La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano however was not that bad. Well of course it's BAD  it's silly dated corny cheap etc. there's an Aztec mummy a tin robot a fat masked villain a mad scientist Mexican mobsters etc. the montage is poor the lines well let's say the lines are not theatrical the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production could've offered etc. etc. Still the movie is FUN. it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. Sure it depends on one's sense of humor however I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note the movie lasts for about an hour and I think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. There's also another thing  watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SFHorror genre concept back in the fifties when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows movies like this are special alright and very often receive a standing ovation.".

My favorite scene the villain and two henchmen are stopped in a cemetery by the night watchman who holds them at gunpoint  and proceeds to stand there doing nothing while one of the goons in plain sight calmly walks around behind him and conks him cold with a blackjack. The mind reels! Later on the poor chump gets fried by the radioactive clampers of the titular robot and runs screaming into the night smoke pouring from the blanket draped over his shoulders while the camera holds on him for an impossibly long time.

Some guy gets a face full of acid there's a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is not that I really cared and it's a whole noir mess.

	schema:reviewBody "23 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. And somehow it feels like a ripoff even though I haven't seen the stuff before. It's like that episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. I've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest ripoffs ever foisted on the motion picture public.I got to see it in the theater in a 16mm print which is good enough I suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. I give the movie some credit for semiconvincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but that's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. But the robot is pitiful although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. It's a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. I think that's considered an android. So technically in hard scifi terms this movie should be called Android vs. the Aztec Mummy but I doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. In fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. Even the dubbing from Mexican into English is lazy and weak  for example at one point the hero says I might as well begin at the beginning.... what the heck kind of translation is that? Couldn't they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn't sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. It's the epitome of utilitarian filmmaking just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. They put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage I would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.I will now cease posting about it on the principle that I don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.".

This short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial setup does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times.One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.

The film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller much like Memento does not play chronologically it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films this the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. He has gone on to compose Nolan's other films. Overall I would recommend this I intend to get all of Nolan's films. This is a low budget gem. ".

Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes.  Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Memento one might well wonder how Christopher Nolan pulled off something that audacious that brilliant in what was his major directorial debut. Watch Following the nobudget thriller which was Nolan's actual directorial debut and you begin to understand. With no money with an amateur cast and doing pretty much everything writing shooting directing himself Nolan created a little masterpiece. Whatever it is that enables someone to make great movies Nolan clearly has it. And had it right from the beginning.Fans of Memento will see a lot of similarities hints of what was to come in Following. The most obvious parallel is the nonlinear time structure as the story here unfolds completely out of order. Whereas the story in Memento proceeded more or less in a straight line which just happened to be moving backwards here there is no line at all. Scenes are placed in a seemingly random order. We're all over the place. At the end in the beginning somewhere in the middle back to the end again...it really could have been a jumbled mess. But Nolan gives us a little assistance in orienting ourselves with the shifting appearance of his main character. He has three distinct looks to him and once you figure that out you can figure out where you are in the story. But there are still enough twists and turns to make your head spin to keep you guessing right up to the end.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to piece the puzzle together for yourself. Much like Memento you really have to see it all the way through to fully appreciate the true genius of it to understand how any missteps from Nolan along the way could have unraveled his whole story. When the movie concludes you can't help but be amazed that Nolan could pull this off essentially by himself. At least with Memento he had a little help. Here it's just Nolan and his small cast. There are really only three roles of any significance in the film maybe four if you're being generous. But this little troupe and their firsttime director combined to create something really special. The acting may at times seem a bit amateurish but that has to be expected from performers who are certainly not acting pros. And any little quibbles with the performances do not detract at all from the overall moviewatching experience. The actors do more than well enough to get by well enough in fact that you're surprised there were not bigger acting roles for them somewhere down the line if they wanted them. That the performers have a great story to work with certainly helped their cause.Things do get a little convoluted in the end as Nolan's story takes its final turns. You worry that things may be getting away from him a little bit. But he manages to ultimately pull it all together. You may have to really think about it after things are through but it all makes sense when you run it back in your mind. And it's nice every now and again to have a movie that actually requires you to think isn't it? Christopher Nolan seems to specialize in movies like that. He just makes great movies. Here he did it with no money all on his own never having made a movie before. It takes a special talent to pull that off. And among his many talents Nolan also apparently possesses the ability to see into his own future. When you watch Following note the Batman logo on the main character's apartment door.".

In that sense both reminded me somewhat of In the Company of Men also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow given that the bw scenes progress in a constant chronological direction and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD I'd highly recommend DVD since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order not just in the scrambled albeit ingenuous order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want to.As another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous. They were characters not bigname actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.Given certain similarities in the plots I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following but intended to reach a bigger audience like Edward Burns made She's the One in the mold of  and with largely the same cast as  The Brothers McMullan.".

	schema:reviewBody "A debut movie of a great filmmaker is either a stinker Alien 3 David Fincher or a statement that he is there to stay. Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino and Following Christopher Nolan. Following is a very well made film considering the circumstances under which it was made. The film is in fact a rulebook or a template of future Nolan films. Most of his future movies can be found in Following in the sense that most of his future movies have  broken timeline and non linear storytelling making the movie more thrilling crime or criminalish adventure manipulation of people and a surprising reveal that's either mindblowing or in the case of The Dark Knight Rises 2012 studio's insistence. This movie is a crime thriller. Keeping away the circumstances and knowing nothing about other Nolan films it's very good. Not excellent not great but simply very good. The pacing of the story feels rushed. There is character development but the pacing is so quick that we do not have enough time to get invested in the characters. Some things about the protagonist are simply addressed in the story by the characters in it rather than telling it dramatically. The fight scenes and some acts of violence are a bit poorly choreographed. However the suspense was excellent and the twists were mind blowing. Consider now that you have watched Nolan's other movies as well. The rushed pace was inevitable for a movie which wanted to deliver a lot but had only an hour of runtime. The issues with fight scenes and acts of violence are still the same however we can get a clue of how things played out off screen when a character addresses something about the protagonist. It's like the future Nolan films made it better. If you've seen any of his future movies containing a theme of manipulation it's quite easy to figure out. The awesomeness of the suspense and the twists are retained. At last consider that you also know how this movie got made. Man! It was lucky even to see the day! A budget of 6000 during the 90s for British film? It's probably gonna be forgettable. It might not be as good as it was supposed to be if it got a made under favorable circumstances but surely ain't forgettable. I don't find it appropriate myself but this movie is a masterpiece  in the sense that an almost no budget flick was made to be so good! I have seen other almost no budget films like A Fistful of Fingers 1995 or so made by Edgar Wright and it was just plain bad for me. I would never watch such films ever again except for this one and any other such film if I find them in the future. It was my fifth Nolan movie. I watched all three of his Batman movies and I absolutely loved the second one the first one was excellent and the third one was just good. Then I watched Memento 2000 which made me a Nolan fan. But it was this movie that made me appreciate him as a filmmaker in the way I do today. Judging it in a plain manner I would give it an 810 and an A. But for the reasons explained in this review it gets a special 1010 and an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this intriguing noir thriller looking like the Forties but with a  psychology befitting the Nineties Director Christopher Nolan employs  a number of techniques he would perfect in his internationally  acclaimed Memento 2000 most notably scenes presented out of time  sequence for effect and a naive protagonist taken advantage of by  others.  The film opens with Bill the Innocent as I might dub him played  by Jeremy Theobald trying to explain to someone perhaps a social  worker perhaps even a police inspector John Nolan why he took up  following people just for the fun of it. He doesn't just follow women  he points out.  He's not a stalker as such. He's just curious. He's an intriguing and  sympathetic character a Brit writer with a lot of time on his hands  who seems something of a throwback to an earlier age with his clanking  manual typewriter and the photo of a pursedlips Marilyn Monroe on the  wall of his shabby apartment.  Things began to go wrong for him he further explains when he broke  some of his following rules and got too close to his prey. What he  doesn't know and what we don't know yet is that his clumsy following  technique has allowed him to unwittingly become the followed himself.  Enter a juicy blonde Lucy Russell walking down some steps from her  apartment. This scene is out of sequence as far as chronological time  goes but psychologically speaking her appearance signals his  entanglement. Enter now a scheming sophisticated psychopathic  thrillseeker named Cobb Alex Haw who entices Bill with his  apparent practice of burglary just for the powerful feeling one gets  from invading the sanctity of another's life.  Although justification for the temporal inversions here is not as  clearly established as in Memento nonetheless the technique works  well and Nolan provides us with a clever ending that sneaks up on us  and makes in a few seconds all that went before clear. Or mostly clear.  You might want to rewind and view the first few minutes of the film  and then everything should be clarity.  This lowbudget black and white deliciously ironic little film 71  minutes marked the auspicious debut of a film maker who has already  made quite a name for himself not only with the aforementioned  Memento but with Insomnia 2002. It will be interesting to see what  Nolan does next.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Jeremy Theobald is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. Bill also has an odd and strange habit he likes to follow people.Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway metro and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone  after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. One day Bill follows Cobb Alex Haw home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. Amazingly good lowbudget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in Hollywood with his groundbreaking and original motion picture classic Momento some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. Following is actually a much better movie then Momento because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. Compared to Momento's which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. Whats makes Following so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. The movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like Momento did. Following is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending if you watch the movie again and notice the clues that you'll ever see.Made with an unbelievably small budget of 6000.00 thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffeebreaks with a noname cast in black and white and just over one hour 71 minutes long. Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'povertyrow' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time he's able to implement touches of homage things like black and white photography a given due to the shoestring budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit and casting of the actors the John Doe lead the slick male counterpart and the beautifulinagritty way femme fatale while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That and as well in the filmnoir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch here the nonlinear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the caf to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both that and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big setup by Cobb and his lady just called 'The Blonde' maybe a tooobvious homage to noir but why carp. But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this Russell almost makes it too easy even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense with the fadeinfadeouts not too quick to leave a lasting impression but enough to add to the 'thiscouldleadanywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in handheld form as if he knows where his limitations lie and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials closeups when need be one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes as mentioned the line between seeing something in 'presentday' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of lowlevel criminals with mindgames and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapidediting and biggunfiring dogs of the mainstream even in independent films it's a bright little 71 minutes.".

But as it was I figured out who was pulling the wool over whose eyes pretty much from the word go. Perhaps I've just watched too many doubleor triplecross thrillers.This is basically apprentice work. Nolan wrote a film he could shoot for peanuts. In that respect there's no denying he's done a great job. Despite the fact you can hear the camera running in most shots he's put together a well directed film that manages to rise above its zero budget. But the script needs so much more work  it really could've done with a couple of more drafts. It falls into some very basic traps like characters constantly explaining the plot to other characters for the benefit of the audience. The acting is okay though funnily enough the best performance comes from someone who never had any intention of becoming a professional actor he's now an architect.I thought all the twists and turns a bit tiresome. Very much handmedown Mamet. The actual idea of following complete strangers is quite intriguing. Too bad the movie doesn't bother to pursue it after the first few minutes.Still Nolan designed this as a calling card movie. Like an eyecatching student movie it got him noticed and he's now working in Hollywood. And I wish him well. In fact his Director's Commentary on the DVD of Following is much more interesting than the film itself.Watch it if you're a bit curious. But really it's no great shakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Nolan is a sick man.  I say this with all due respect after witnessing his almostlegendary first feature Following.  This is not a normal film.  Even if its narrative were presented in strict chronological order it would still not be normal.  Its stark monochrome cinematography weird music bizarre performances which range from the subtle to the wooden often in the same sentence and disturbingly warped plot all serve to instill a deep sense of unease in the hapless viewer.  Why do we watch films like this?  Certainly part of the pleasure comes from seeing characters with whom we can identify and empathise carrying out acts most of us will never do burgling beating safecracking you know the sort of thing.  Oh and breaking people's fingers with hammers.  This is not a nice film.  I would recommend it to anyone with the warning that they may not enjoy it but they should definitely see it.  It's seedier than Memento Nolan's recent cult classic and cuts up the narrative for no real reason other than because it can.  This has the mindbending effect of for example showing someone's beatenup face long before we find out who provided the beating.  Why does Nolan do this?  Because he can.  Because it's cool.  Because it all adds to the menace and unease and perverse pleasure of this strange strange movie. The follower becomes the followed.  Victim becomes assailant.  Telling the truth lands you in prison.  Lover becomes victim.  Movie audience becomes deeply impressed. Christopher Nolan you are a sick man and I applaud you and wait with baited breath for your next excursion into mindfck cinema.".

He never did anything to the person or followed the same person twice but he just did it. However on one occasion he breaks his own rules and follows a man more than once.

However one of the positives of the summer was that the BBC launched a season of British films from across many decades. Rather than wheel out the Bank Holiday classics though the season screened many films that I had never even heard of and are rarely shown. This is not to say that all are that good but at least many of them were interesting. With Following I must admit that it took me a while to get into it because it does move slowly at first and the slightly disjointed timeline did break up the flow.As the film goes on this becomes less distracting and it started to get my interest. After this we hit the final third where the twists start to happen and suddenly the reasons for Nolan's delivery becomes clear in the way where with some of his other films everything falls into place all at once. Despite the slow start the writing is strong and makes for a satisfying story that ends on a strong note. Nolan plays the script well and this part of his work is good. He doesn't do quite as well with the cast though and the performances are more a necessary evil rather than something where it feels like a lot of effort has been put in. Theobald was OK in the lead role but I wasn't convinced by him as he didn't really change across the film. Haw was much better OK he plays like Rupert Everett but he at least fits his character and remains a slight enigma throughout. James is OK as indeed are many of the supporting cast but nobody is anything special or memorable. I can understand why things turned out this way but it does leave the film open to accusations of the reveal being the all.Overall though this is an interesting and engaging film that starts slow and is hard to get into but falls into place the longer it goes on. The total delivery doesn't get even effort put into it across the board and the performances and characters are weaker than I would have liked but the plot and structure carries it making it more than a curio from Nolan's career.".

	schema:reviewBody "At 70 minutes long Following is Christopher Nolan's shortest feature though it certainly isn't his best. But you've got to hand it to him just for coming up with the fantastic story idea. Following juggles quite a lot of ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer Jeremy Theobald follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day he decides to follow a clean cut smartlooking fellow who goes by the name Cobb Alex Haw. Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman Lucy Russell whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest Following starts off spectacularly skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous and Nolan slowly builds the tension the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters the young man and Cobb are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight into their minds what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the secondhalf the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw who plays the cunning Cobb certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell on the other hand lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress she comes off as wooden instead of charming thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. Following has wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. It is a film that won't disappoint you though when the plot concerns a mystery I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly Following fails there.".

And if the calibre of your cast reflects your importance in cinema then Nolan's experience with the likes of Pacino Johansson and the continued use of Bale stamps credit on his achievements. However looking back at Nolan's budgeted and auteurish feature debut Following it might be difficult to understand how such an English filmmaker is enabled to make such huge leaps into the Hollywood mainstream. On first impressions  Nolan's deconstruction of the linear narrative is admirable and has since become a recurring technique for the director most notably in his critically praised followup Memento. We are constantly on the edge of our seats with Following with the film revealing future scenes that seem unclear until Nolan is ready to clarify them. Despite always knowing more than the protagonist the audience are presented with a puzzle to solve though naturally we reach the conclusion at the same time as our man Jeremy Theobald  the end. On a stripped down viewing Following rarely veers from classical conventions  it begins with an introductory voiceover a man enters a life of crime the thrillerstyle music peaks where it ought to there is a love interestfemme fatale Lucy Russell the same man receives his punishment and the film is even shot in a contrasting black and white no doubt a financial conclusion. Nolan also makes a predictable nod to Hitchcock with a string of voyeuristic shots as well as a perfectcrime plot with the character Cobb Alex Haw. In conclusion it's a clever way of presenting a somewhat dull plot and given Nolan's growing success a proved way of grabbing the attention of the mass audience. The film also provides an interesting social commentary with Cobb. His ability to read the robotic of the average person shows a disturbing side to comfortable living.".

The performances are mediocre. The photography and other technical aspects show promise but it's not especially impressive craftsmanship.

	schema:headline " Low Budget filmmaking at it's absolute finest";
	schema:reviewBody "Even with only 6000 bucks and a cast of parttime actors Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent.Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am Glad that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it his own.The script here is Nolan's finest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities I all ways imagined that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with Following. It is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible.My only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting.Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century filmmaking at it's finest.".

	onyx:emotionText "Even with only 6000 bucks and a cast of parttime actors Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent.Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am Glad that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format.

The four corners of this quadrangle in order are engineer Jim Leonard Humphrey Bogart who is the protective brother of chorus girl Linda who is the secret mistress of Bruce Hardy who is the financial adviser and suitor of poor little rich girl Carol Owen Dorothy McKaill who falls for Jim Leonard. As Jim Leonard says to Carol Can you read blueprints?. If you can you might have a chance of following this busy little precode film. Add in one more important character  a sleazy guy who wants to star Linda in a revue financed by Hardy's money. What really hurts this movie is that the subplots don't really gel that well into one well integrated plot of a movie. Also there are some lines that you wait to hear that you never do. For example when Carol brings Jim over to her mansion for a party the serious upright young man is obviously disgusted by Carol pretending to auction off her servant Kibbee like he was a piece of furniture to her drunken guests to offset her losses in the stock market. Jim walks out without saying goodbye. However the next time the two meet Jim soft soaps the entire affair. I really wanted him to tell her off. What saves the film are the fine performances and the fact that the subplots are interesting enough even given the lack of motivation for the players' actions. It's truly interesting to see Bogart playing a rather shy very scrupulous engineer  what a great smile he has! Dorothy McKaill is quite good as bored rich girl Carol who is trying desperately to fill up her day with fun things to do when her real problem is that she's lonely in spite of her busy social life. She really had a great voice and did good work here. It's a puzzle to me why she didn't really do that well in talkies. I'd recommend it to fans of McKaill andor Bogart and to anyone interested in films of the early 30's.Best precode moment  Jim has spent the night with Carol and is standing at the base of the stairs wearing the clothes he had on when he got there last night  a tuxedo. He's surprised by Carol's butler Kibbee. Jim then tries to stutter through an explanation of why he is there at 8AM in formal attire. Kibbee plays the part of the father figure that pretends to be convinced of his grown daughter's chastity when he knows otherwise and this is one of the few times you'll ever see Bogart behaving like a tongue tied teenager on film.".

However when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and waterthey just don't mix.While Bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankvillehaving met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister whew! but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then I might have scored it a 4 or 5this sunk the movie to a 3 how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me.The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that it's all wrong for Bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the manone of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here.By the way those who love PreCode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses in the filmthings you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love Affair 1932  out of 4 Predictable and rather boring love story about a rich social girl Dorothy Mackaill and a hard working man Humphrey Bogart who hopes to build airplane engines. The two of them start up an affair but he slowly begins to lose sight of his dream while falling in love with her. She also has other things on her plate including a rich man Hale Hamilton who has his own plans for her. I was really looking forward to this small drama mainly because it was the first major role for the young Bogart. I must admit that I found a little entertainment in watching him play the cleancut good guy but the screenplay is so predictable that one will quickly lose interest in the film. To make matters worse the films runs a brief 68minutes but it feels double that. The screenplay really doesn't do a thing right as it's never really romantic it features no laughs and in the end it seems as if you've really not even watched anything at all. I'm really not sure what the purpose of the movie was as the screenplay is so confused in what it wants to say that we never really know if we should care about Mackaill's character or if we should see her as some sort of villain. Even worse is the ending that really comes out of nowhere and amounts to nothing more than silly melodrama. What keeps the film watchable is Bogart who actually manages to turn in a nice performance even if it is a tad bit strange seeing him act without that Bogart persona voice and attitude that we'd see even in his smaller Warner roles. Bogart plays the happygolucky role pretty well and he doesn't seem to have a problem with the smiling and charming. I must admit that he has one of the strangest ways of standing around with his arms behind his back but this too is rather funny. Mackaill isn't bad in the film but she's not all that good either. I think she has a little charm but the role of the rich spoiled girl has been played so much better by so many people. It does seem she has a rather bad timing as there's one scene where it appears she accidentally hits Bogart in the face the driving sequence and then another where she walks straight into a chair when their going to get her a cup of coffee. In the end this isn't a horrible movie but it's not a good one either and without Bogart it would have been totally forgettable. I think even Bogart fans will find themselves bored so this is certainly only recommended to those who want to see everything he's done.".

When Jim hears about all this he makes a dashing effort to chase her down at the hanger to stop her from flying  grabs hold of the plane as it is taking off  climbs into the cockpit to take over the controls.The movie has some great scenes of some daredevil flying stunts which is kind of entertaining. This is a very different Bogart very early in his film career  one we're not used to seeing. But to audiences of the early 1930's it was not a surprise to see him in this type of role as a romantic lead. Bogart often played romantic Juveniles on the Broadway stage in the 20's  30's. He shows no signs of what he would later become except for one scene when he discovers that Carol's suitor Hardy is also courting his sister. Enraged Jim confronts Hardy  punches him out. A sneak preview of his tough guy image established 3 years later on stage  screen as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest  later refined as Roy Earle in High Sierra leading to his stardom. Bogart was quite handsome as a young man  he looks like a matine idol. This was at a time when movie stars had to be good looking  it's ironic that Bogart achieved stardom later when his features turned rather grim  rugged but as a handsome young man he didn't get noticed. Bogart's prestar film career is interesting  fascinating because these movies show a different kind of Bogart unlike what he later became  what he's most remembered for. It looks like in this early stage the studio was trying to turn Bogart  George Raft  other good looking young men into Rudolph Valentino's it didn't work. Fans of precode cinema  Bogart fans should watch this at least once for it is an interesting curiosity  a revelation into Bogart's earlier acting career.".

Our Man in particular and Bollywood in general have a knack for turning Hollywood ridiculousness into something dignified. He did overdo it playing the drunk though.Rani Mukerji was fantastic.

Only one good song in this mess and that was picturised on Raveena and Salman. Rani was totally wasted what was she doing in this movie. Raveena also looks out of place in a small second heroine role. Salman does what hew does in every movie but this time looks bored doing it.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is apparantly a remake of The Wedding Singer. I say apparantly because I couldn't swear to it myself. I did see The Wedding Singer but all I can remember is Adam Sandler's goofy hair. So it's safe to say I watched this movie as an 'original'. Just as Adam Sandler Salman Khan plays a wedding singer. He falls in love. Gets stood up at the altar. Falls in love again. Gets 'stood up' before he can tell her he loves her. And then has to find the courage within to tell her and win her back may the force be with you Salman!.The story is like any other romance. Full of misunderstandings and people who won't tell the other how they feel but just jump to conclusions. Which just begs the question are all men in Bollywood movies stupid? Women CANNOT read minds!!! The same question could be asked about women. Men CANNOT read minds not even their own!!! But then if it wasn't for these horrible depictions of the human nature the Bollywood industry would probably be reduced to a quarter of its current movie output.Like any movie this one also had serious flaws. My first question would be how can a wedding singer who rehearses in his bedroom afford to pay an entire team of approximately twelve dancers and six back up singers to sing at weddings for him? He must charge his clients a fortune. Then there is his nasty drinking habit. Let me say that Salman makes a really horrific stupid drunk. He is totally not believable as a drunk and should try to take a page out of SRK's Devdas. Speaking of alcohol there is a scene SPOILER in which Rani downs three glasses of Scotch I believe instantly starts hiccuping and is drunk. Give me a break!!! Naturally there is also a scene involving an electrical guitar that doesn't seem to be plugged in but that doesn't even bug me anymore cause it seems that in India or any other country Indians can play electrical guitars without plugging it in take for instance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And how about a girl SPOILER who has spent her entire life dreaming of an acting career giving up the opportunity to star in a hot directors movie to be with a womanizing alcoholic. I mean please would you say no if Quentin Tarantino asked you to be in his movie because of your sexist chauvinist boyfriend who has spent most of his life with his lips pressed to a glass of Scotch and his hands on some girl's ass?But leaving all the inconsistencies aside it's a nice movie. Salman is just bearable. It's hard to spend three hours watching a man who spends half the movie drunk a quarter of it crying and the rest talking about love. Salman grow a spine. Rani was quite adorable. Spunky and sweet. And she shows us that bhajjia can stop us from sneezing. The setting of the movie is also refreshing and quite picturesque. Some of the characters are unnecessary. Obviously added to offer a little comic relief but in the end just plain annoying. The same goes for the songs. They just seem so fake. And... they don't stick. In one ear out the other.All in all this is a nice movie. With a little work it could have been a great movie. But no work so no great movie. Watch it if you like Rani because otherwise watching Salman is a punishment with no rewards to make the pain go away.5 stars".

One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. He shrieks and whines too much. Why can't he just take it easy? He doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but she's no Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname Hi I'm Mrs Pugalia doesn't match up to Barrymore's version Hi I'm Mrs Julia Gulia.

Although definitely aimed at the kid market I'd say 5 to 13it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch  particularly younger children.The story revolves around Ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on onboard a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a topgun on his computer flight simulator. This comes in handy when the pilot and copilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is noone left to fly the plane. I don't want to give away any more of the plot.".

It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children and so this is a rare find. Some of the acting  realism isn't quite there at times or maybe is a little corny but children don't seem to notice or care they love it. Parts are predictable but other parts are not  like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.

However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb  complex. While it is not a literal biography Schrader  his coscreenwriter Leonard Scharder his brother have taken several incidents from his life including his sucide and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning. Mishima's homosexuality is almost not there due to legal threats from his widow but in spite of this the film is still terrific and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who did the score which adds an additional texture to the film and is superior to the one he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar. Hopefully this film will soon be available on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mishima A Life in Four Chapters is one of those films which is extremely hard to write about simply because it hit me on such an emotional level and stunned me with its artistry to the point where writing a review or comment on the film seems trivial and useless. Hence this will be rambling and poorlywritten but I'll give it a shot anyway.The easiest thing to talk about when discussing Mishima A Life in Four Chapters is the technical elements of the film. The narrative is superb and fairly original with a fine script by Chieko Leonard and Paul Schrader and Schrader's decisions as director are pretty much faultless. Every stylistic turn the film took every sequence which took a risk and pretty much the whole time the camera was in motion I was utterly enthralled and fascinated with how well the film works as a film. Paul Schrader may not be as great a storyteller as some of the great directors are but in Mishima he proves that he is more than capable of being a wonderful storyteller if necessary. The film moves at an extraordinarily fast pace and one barely notices the passing of the two hours.I have to say despite being a literature buff to an extent I have never read anything by Mishima. I knew one or two things about Mishima including the big ending to his story which I won't reveal to keep this spoilerfree prior to seeing the film but not much else. Perhaps this is why I felt contrary to some others that the film got progressively stronger and ended with a breathtakingly brilliant final act. I also found it completely refreshing how this biopic took no position on Mishima or the final act of his life it is simply a portrait of a man not a comment on his life. The Phillip Glass score is utterly brilliant. There is very little of this film that doesn't prominently feature it which can come off as the result of a lack of confidence from the director but in this case it is used superbly well in the film. The score is original vibrant interesting and memorable much like the film itself.Mishima A Life in Four Chapters is a film that is certainly ripe for interpretation and analysis. I am not going to attempt to provide either of those mostly because I'm not really in a position to and also because I found this a profoundly emotional experience a film of such artistry that it is a film that everyone should experience without preconceived notions of quality or content and one that everyone should attempt their own analysis of.

This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor. Failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does. This makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. Of the three story adaptations Temple of the Golden Pavilion Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional. It also is the story that most closely matches Mishima's mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without a mention of Philip Glass' striking musical score. Not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals. Paul Schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter. Have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears. Mishima A Life in Four Chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone else put his finger on where this magnificent film falls short when he said Mishima has already said it all the film simply repeats. Ultimately Schrader has made a movie which refuses to comment on Mishima one way or another and which becomes somewhat lifeless and stilted in the final segment as a result. Because he is bending over backwards not to criticize Mishima Schrader simply refuses to examine the uglier implications of his public suicide. Ironically this approach hurts the film precisely because Mishima himself was capable of much more perceptive selfcriticism. In the first two chapters  Beauty THE GOLDEN PAVILION and Art KYOKO'S HOUSE Schrader's work is nothing short of brilliant. With great subtlety he interweaves black and white scenes from Mishima's early life with lush fullcolor scenes from his early novels. What makes these sections so haunting are the subtle suggestive differences between Mishima and the people he is writing about. For example Mizoguchi the acolyte who destroys the Golden Temple is not a homosexual nor is he a talented writer. His stammering could be a metaphor for those things or it could be a metaphor for nothing at all. The mystery of creation and imagination wordless and inexpressible really seems to come to life here  particularly in the dissolve where the schoolboy Mishima morphs into the slightly older Mizoguchi. The problems start in the third chapter Action. Here Schrader films scenes from Mishima's RUNAWAY HORSES one of my personal favorites as if they are not just similar but absolutely interchangeable with Mishima's militarist activities with the Shield Society. Schrader seems to assume that the hero of the novel Isao is simply a stand in for Mishima. How can you tell? Because Schrader cuts out precisely those sections of the novel in which Mishima actually analyzes Isao's emotions and his illusions. The Isao of this movie is merely a straw man who spouts platitudes about the emperor and Japan's greatness. The Isao of the book is a courageous unselfish but very human teenage boy whose callous and narrowminded parents are unable to love and who plainly have had a crushing effect on his psyche. Mishima whether consciously or not included some truly vile scenes of parental cruelty and manipulation in this book precisely because he understood on some level that Isao's decision to end his own life was not entirely unselfish. The connection between the sordid ugliness of Isao's loveless home and his desire to die a violent death is clear enough in the book. But it is absent from the movie. Oddly enough Schrader thinks he is protecting Mishima in the last section by not moralizing about the suicide but he is actually diminishing him as an author. The RUNAWAY HORSES section is by far the weakest of the movie. The final scenes in which Mishima at the moment of death attains oneness with his heroes really are quite exhilarating. But they would have been still richer if Schrader had taken a more nuanced approach to RUNAWAY HORSES instead of just viewing it as a blueprint for the last events in Mishima's life. This is unquestionably a brilliant inspiring film but it's not quite flawless.".

Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen with the exception of this and Affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima Japan's most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way. The acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing. Truly an underrated gem of a film.".

Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen with the exception of this and Affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima Japan's most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way. The acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing. Truly an underrated gem of a film.";

And given Schrader's choice to use an English language voiceover in nonJapanese versions of the film to avoid double subtitles in some shots one wonders why the main body of action was not filmed in English or at least dubbed? Schrader briefly tackles this in his audio commentary and the main reason seems to have been financial.The same is not true for the actual film which devolves into a stylized melodramatic mess that recalls much of Akira Kurosawa's late film Dreams as well as being filled with the most mindnumbing platitudes about art imaginable. Yet equally bad is what is missing above and beyond any portrait of Mishima's family life such as his manifest Napoleon Complex. Mishima was only 5'1 tall and severely lacking in macho confidence so much so that he insisted on only marrying a woman shorter than he was. Yet any connection between these elements and those depicted is left for only the curious and that likely will not be most people who watch this film. Thus since the film fails on most artistic fronts and does not generate any real further interest for its audience in its main subject matter the very reason for the film is a puzzle unless one feels Schrader is positing himself into a Mishimalike role. Not that it would matter since Mishima A Life In Four Chapters portrays its lead as a rather unsympathetic and idiotic character albeit one with likely more talent than Schrader has.If only someone like an Ingmar Bergman or even Michelangelo Antonioni who started out as a documentarian would have tackled this subject matter the film would likely have been shorter tighter more purposive and coherent for if there was one thing that even his biggest critics could not hold against Mishima it was that he was driven and almost monomaniacal. Schrader is the opposite desperately larding his film with almost everything that plays up his vision of the writer as madman and ignoring all that went into the artist as a man something Schrader seems not to really get which reaffirms my idea that his great screenplay for Taxi Driver was a fluke that blindfolded over the back toss of a dart that somehow hits the bull'seye. Yet it was that lucky moment which doomed the rest of us to decades of profoundly dull and vapid films churned out on the strength of that one toss. Lucky Schrader. Unlucky us. As for Mishima? The real man's somewhere around just as he must be in the film right? Right?".

Unlike virtually any other film I can name I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art?  I think so.  Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script.  I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film but while his writing  often seems to border on the bombastic his directing style is usually nonexistent. This is deliberate I think because his films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world ugly and harsh.  His style suits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation.  Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead instead of Scorsese. But like the protagonists of those two films while Mishima the man was ideal Schrader material rightwing vain and at odds with society his works were subtle and beautiful.  In fact he had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers.  So you wouldn't necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film.  I think the film shows that he was. The script he helped fashion splits Mishima the man into three parts his life his death and his mind.  His life is represented in black and white still camera formal compositions.  His death for which he will always be best remembered is handheld documentary style.  And his mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from his novels each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man who hardly ever wrote a character that wasn't a reflection of himself.  These dramatisations are beautiful to look at thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative staging.  In all parts the acting is superb especially from Ken Ogata as Mishima who captures the essential charm arrogance and narcissism of the man.  The photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever.  Finally the music is simply superb perfectly matching the images although written and recorded before shooting adjusted during the editorial process and then rerecorded.  How much the music influenced the shoot I do not know but it bonds perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is what Schrader is trying to say.  You know the big stuff about life death etc.  But I do not think the film is saying anything.  Mishima has already said it the film simply repeats.".

At the beginning of the film we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appear in black and white. The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours. There is a different novel staged in each chapter. Between each chapter the narrative returns to the present as Mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide. This means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end.I suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and arthouse. I respect that this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line. If on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by Philip Glass you will love it. I loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mishima A Life in Four Chapters is an emotional mosaic of a film there is as the title suggests a clear structure of four chapters but inside these are three separate  but cohesively linked through what they observe in the character of Mishima  modes of storytelling. They can be broken down as past From childhood to the last day of his life present a realtime following of Mishima ending with his famous act of public seppuku and imagination Three of his novels brought to life. It's rare that a film is so interconnected through style substance and structure the organised wholeness reflecting the subconscious lifelong mission of perfection that Mishima embarks upon ending in when observed as a whole what seems like a predestined fusion of artistic expression destruction and a longing to change the world. There is a rolling development to the character glimpses of ideas and emotions in his past are exposed and consciously studied in his novels and are fully realised in his final act of selfcrafted spiritual beautification an act which can be viewed as culmination of the depths probed in the first three chapters of the film art beauty and action. The final chapter The Harmony of the Pen and the Sword is the most honest and brutally real no novel to hide his extreme personality and ideals baring his soul forcefully through protest and finally destroying himself at his highest point of honour and power.The film is incredibly arresting the style different for each mode each with its own visual language and manner of exploring Mishima. His past in harsh black and white is shown in an unprobing way in a near historicalrecollection fashion and we simply follow his life. At first the novel sequences are quite jarring they are so vibrant raw and colourful full of telling compositions and beautifully crafted hyperstylised sets. They are all rooted in total blackness like they've just sprung up in Mishima's mind occasionally the novel sequences are preceded by a scene of Mishima writing the absorbing artificiality of it all is at odds with the shutout realistic style of his past. It's a bold move to blend such opposite visual storytelling techniques but the events of his past amalgamate with the beauty and emotional forwardness of the novel sections to fully conjure up Mishima. Neither would work on its own but together they work as one and fill in the gaps that they other left out the lack of expression in his past is filled with the constant rampage of passion found in the novel sequences and the lack of conjunction of each novel sequence is an irrelevance as they compose of crucial elements we are now able to see reflected in Mishima's past life and most importantly his final day. Starting with Mishima getting ready there's a roaming kineticism to the camera. The focus is stuck on Mishima gliding over his immaculate army uniform and watching him button up in close up. It's a very finalised way of shooting like everything is being seen for the last time so is given a grand sendoff. He is followed documentary style handheld camera and tracking shots structured in realtime. This almost displaces Mishima in the external world in some ways casting him in a different light making him seem like a determined mad man in a world full of coasters. Philip Glass' score is outstanding punctuating Mishima's fixed path with absorbing rushes of sound. Like Mishima the score has an evocative presence a complicated array of short stabs of strings and bells repeated over and over again but never faulting in aiding the visual climate.The film is an interpretation of Mishima but is surprisingly without conclusion. This is not a flaw Schrader bravely chooses to avoid judgment or criticism putting Mishima in an ascloseto objective light as possible. Through the sociological fundamentals of sexuality political action art and the body Mishima attempted to perfect himself. He achieved great literary success he bodybuilt himself into a towering statuesque figure he formed a private army of dedicated fellow traditionalists. What conclusions can be drawn from these achievements? Many but I believe that Mishima is a man who never lost his childlike yearning to change the world. He carved his own destiny out of his body and his work set his mind on a clear path early on and obstinately followed it to the glorious end. Whether or not one agrees with his life's work I cannot help but admire his yearning for fullness. Someone who is so rigid and immovably confident in everything he does may seem unlikable and he most certainly isn't a likable character in the strictest sense. He is simply put a selfformed piece of art. A piece of art that I cannot help but be fascinated by. Mishima A Life in Four Chapters does the impossible and shows a life eternally connected to art a life defined and destroyed through art and fittingly it is a colossally profound and ambiguous work a ravishing exploration of a man who melded integral desires of creation and impact together to shape something unique and special in himself in death he was his own vision of perfection even when the world was not.".

Mesmerizing cinematography accompanied with Philip Glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novelists whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this film. As any gifted character Mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being conflict between a pen and a sword as the director puts it in his final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of Mishima himself.All Schrader's films and the ones he wrote scripts for are basically stories of inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. That also goes for Mishima who apart from Japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words. His demise consisted of both of these key points in his life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play. Film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10!!".

Director and script coauthor Paul Schrader's fictionalized biographical film of Yukio Mishima who was a wellknown multitalented and mentally unhinged Japanese artist from the middle of the last Century. Apparently little known in the West Mishima seems to have caused quite a stir in his homeland some 50 years ago the effects of which may still be lingering on by publically committing seppuku after a failed attempt to convince members of Japan's SelfDefense Forces to mutiny and join his small private army to overthrow the government and reinstate the Emperor as the nation's sovereign. Schrader recreates events that occurred on the last day in the writer's life in November 1970 and inserts stunning vignettes based on scenes from some of Mishima's novels three of which are defined by unique color compositions as well as longish flashbacks in black and white. The result is well worth repeat viewing see below. Shot with mostly a Japanese cast and crew entirely in Japan apparently the movie has never been released there due to family legal action studio timidity andor political pressuretake your pick of rumors!. Schrader relies extensively on voiceover often the mark of an impoverished script andor production under financing to help the viewer make sense of what's been distilled on screen. This time out however extensive voiceover is really needed for those unfamiliar with Mishima monogatari which is likely to be most viewers in the West to catch a multitude of nuance and add a richness of depth. The DVD offered endtoend narrations in Japanese the speaker's identity remains in dispute and English one is cohosted by Schrader. Although it rambles a fair amount the Director's input will really help the viewer struggling to make headsortails out of the movie the struggle is well worth it so turn on the narration with your second viewing. There are two de facto stars in this picture lead actor Ken Ogata always as pleasure to see in action and the cinematography with a very significant assist from the set designer and colorcoordinator specialists it is simply outstanding!. Other performances are mostly workman like as is the direction. Score by Philip Glass delivers a symphonic knockout! Subtitles fail to catch sets of symbols and lines of dialog here and there.

Early in life he saw beauty in women Beauty chapter weaved in with The Temple of the Golden Pavilon. Then he had sex which made him realize true beauty didn't lie in women. Then he began to think that dying for a cause exploding like a firework would be the only way he could reach this beauty. He was too cowardly however and didn't truly want to die. He then began to think that achieving a perfect body is the true form of beauty. Then finally by training his army which he tried to make as pure as his art by practicing samurai beliefs and devising a plan to unite art and action so that he could finally achieve harmony of pen and sword something he had always striven for.The way the film is structured is utterly genius. It is a wholly unique film. It is obviously cut into four chapters all of which I've just described Beauty Art Action and Harmony of Pen and Sword. The film delves into each of Mishima's attempts to find true beauty showing his real life past in black and white and dramatizations of his novels in vibrant color with extravagant stagelike sets and lighting cutting both his life and segments from his novel together to show how his life mirrored his art and vice versa and finally cuts between the very end of his life in color leading up to his final harmony of pen and sword through his impassioned speech after kidnapping a military general before finally freeing himself through death. The structure of the film in four chapters also represents how Mishima himself viewed his life as a constant struggle to transcend mere superficial and materialistic forms of art and to free himself from his constant search to find beauty which included his own body and novels which were both ways to attempt to find true beauty. The style of the film is perfect for the subject and this is one of the only films I've seen which could truly tell the complete tale of the life of an eccentric genius and show us how he thought. The urgency of the constant score of the film also fits perfectly with the urgency of Mishima's search for beauty and the urgency at which he wrote.".

The film delves into each of Mishima's attempts to find true beauty showing his real life past in black and white and dramatizations of his novels in vibrant color with extravagant stagelike sets and lighting cutting both his life and segments from his novel together to show how his life mirrored his art and vice versa and finally cuts between the very end of his life in color leading up to his final harmony of pen and sword through his impassioned speech after kidnapping a military general before finally freeing himself through death. The structure of the film in four chapters also represents how Mishima himself viewed his life as a constant struggle to transcend mere superficial and materialistic forms of art and to free himself from his constant search to find beauty which included his own body and novels which were both ways to attempt to find true beauty. The style of the film is perfect for the subject and this is one of the only films I've seen which could truly tell the complete tale of the life of an eccentric genius and show us how he thought. The urgency of the constant score of the film also fits perfectly with the urgency of Mishima's search for beauty and the urgency at which he wrote.";

Um.But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually our heroes stole the egg LOOOONG ago in another movie entirely which would have been a GREAT movie to watch had they made that movie.Instead we see a 30 second clip in blackandwhite about how they robbed some college student of his backpack. You heard me... the daring caper the ultimate heist the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap is them stealing a backpack from a college student by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him and replacing his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? Ugh. I'm telling you this was so bad I didn't even realize just how bad it was just how badly I'd been robbed until I got home.".

Um.But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually our heroes stole the egg LOOOONG ago in another movie entirely which would have been a GREAT movie to watch had they made that movie.Instead we see a 30 second clip in blackandwhite about how they robbed some college student of his backpack. You heard me... the daring caper the ultimate heist the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap is them stealing a backpack from a college student by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him and replacing his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? Ugh. I'm telling you this was so bad I didn't even realize just how bad it was just how badly I'd been robbed until I got home.";

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Benedict Andy Garcia catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him in Oceans 11 plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply this film is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is cool and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to Hello magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent Hello magazine readers. Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this isn't really working out lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor this accurately sums up the movie. Stick with the original.".

Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe too hot to work in America they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where not so coincidently Rusty Ryan Pitt has an exlove ZetaJones who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri ZetaJones aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of nightfox  Vincent Cassel is keen to battle it out with Ocean and his team to decide who the best thief or thieves are. And there you have Ocean's 12 a film which falls too short in terms of wit appearance plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.One thing must be made clear however the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone even Catherina ZetaJones newcomer to the Soderbergh film. And it is indeed very rare to jampack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them Julia Roberts George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Catherina Zeta Jones Bernie Mac Andy Garcia Don Cheadle... just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11 you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....If you were like me absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots every single take camera angles were all very cleancut solid and very stylish. In this film however Soderbergh decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film unlike the first one the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet Benedict's deadline and I suppose Soderbergh wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.Secondly the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quickwit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for Clooney Do i look 50?. The plot is predictable from Julia Robert's 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing past tense there's that shaky cam again!. I cant give too much away but my personal opinion is that the explanation of how the team pulled of the robbery is a little confusing and a sort of huh? moment which you will need to disucss with other's who have seen the film to make sure you absolutely understood everything.All in all the film is a let down. By all means go and see it if for no other reason than to drool over the gorgeous Matt Damon Brad Pitt and George Clooney.... But do not get your hopes up. As the credits roll you will find yourself feeling cheated somehow. Ocean's 11 was a real gem but Ocean's 12 just leaves you pining for the original.... 5.510".

The strength of Ocean's 11 was that it started at point A and it ended at point B and it did so in a convincing and entertaining matter and threw in a believable plot twist at the end. It was very simply and straightforward.Ocean's 12 is nothing like this. The film is in desperate need of a better editor as it is so bloated and ponderous that towards the middle of the film if you've even managed to keep track of who's stealing what from whom and why they're doing it you won't even care any more. You'll just be begging for the ending. The film is filled with bizarre camera angles such as a shot of an incoming airplane that for some inconceivable reason is filmed sideways. There are also some VERY bizarre scenes such as a scene where Julia Robert's character has to pretend to be Julia Roberts and a thief breakdances through lasers.However the biggest flaw of the movie is the absence of a good heist scene. The heist in Ocean's 11 was masterful and there is nothing in this film that even comes close. I didn't go to see this movie to watch a cop get reunited with her father who happens to be a master thief I went to see a team of funny people go up against the odds to steal a lot of money.Bottom line You will hate this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all Ocean's 11 was a truly great Hollywood product. Its rapidfire jokes incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen. Of course with all the money it made a sequel was on the way and I for one was excited.Needless to say I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything going for it the return of the entire original cast the same director news stories of crazy on and offset antics. How could it possibly have gone so wrong?It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between PittZetaJones and ClooneyRoberts the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene telling each individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcia's running time because without these ridiculously awkward shots his screen time would be WELL under five minutes.This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film. The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story and only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early on and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 2025 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.This would all be excusable if the film was funny. At all. 90 of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. The plot is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film the team takes on a job worth 2.5 million of the nearly 100 million they need to raise before Garcia's twoweek deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than 2.5 million to pull off. Obviously because of this they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here they pull so many jobs in so many different ways that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh not because it was funny but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.I was excited to see this film after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....110".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into 'Oceans 12' as being a big fan of the first installment but my hopes were not astronomical. And for the two or so hours that I watched the movie I was not disappointed. However I cannot say that I enjoyed it nearly as much as I had enjoyed 'Oceans 11'.'Oceans 12' was a very fun but at the same time flawed movie. The movie was every film students dream come true full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. But this could not hide the fact that at its core it was still a studio movie. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. However when the final credits rolled I could not help but wonder about some of the loose ends and there were many. It almost felt as though the scriptwriter had too many ideas that really did not fit with one another but he threw them in anyway. At times it could be a little frustrating and leave you wondering why they even showed the last ten minutes of the movie.By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. Brad Pitt was excellent again and Matt Damon was probably even better then he had been in '11'. The rest of the gang was about as they had been previously with the possible exception of Shaobo Qin whom I felt was even funnier this time around. Catherine Zeta Jones turned out to be a welcome addition and she fit right in with the movies flow as Pitt's love interest. She perhaps looked the most comfortable in her role out of all of them despite the fact that it was her first hand in the series.All in all I was pleased that I had spent the eight dollars to go and see this the day that it opened. But by the same token I doubt I will be purchasing it when it appears on DVD.My Overall Rating 6 12 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "I went into 'Oceans 12' as being a big fan of the first installment but my hopes were not astronomical. And for the two or so hours that I watched the movie I was not disappointed. However I cannot say that I enjoyed it nearly as much as I had enjoyed 'Oceans 11'.'Oceans 12' was a very fun but at the same time flawed movie. The movie was every film students dream come true full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. But this could not hide the fact that at its core it was still a studio movie. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. However when the final credits rolled I could not help but wonder about some of the loose ends and there were many. It almost felt as though the scriptwriter had too many ideas that really did not fit with one another but he threw them in anyway. At times it could be a little frustrating and leave you wondering why they even showed the last ten minutes of the movie.By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. Brad Pitt was excellent again and Matt Damon was probably even better then he had been in '11'. The rest of the gang was about as they had been previously with the possible exception of Shaobo Qin whom I felt was even funnier this time around. Catherine Zeta Jones turned out to be a welcome addition and she fit right in with the movies flow as Pitt's love interest. She perhaps looked the most comfortable in her role out of all of them despite the fact that it was her first hand in the series.All in all I was pleased that I had spent the eight dollars to go and see this the day that it opened. But by the same token I doubt I will be purchasing it when it appears on DVD.My Overall Rating 6 12 out of 10";

I liked the style of the teaser trailer and was probably one of the only ones who didn't mind the name so naturally I was looking forward to the movie. Naturally it's a sequel so it's inferior to the original which I liked more than the original of the original. The entire cast is back plus one more obviously for the necessary foreigncountry locations and trendy scene transitions. There's the constant music the people with the general European accents well villains and every other caper movie clich in the books.Danny Ocean George Clooney and his eleventwelve compadres are forced to pay back the money that they stole from Terry Benedict's Andy Garcia casinos three years earlier. To get the money they have to steal it in Europe.Where the first movie was fun this sequel was mildly entertaining. It went on a little long but was never boring. It's watchable as all crime movies like these should be but not really entertaining. I wasn't having fun while watching a lot of Ocean's Twelve. I wasn't bored either. I was in Limbo of the movie world. All of the Vegas glitz added to the first and here it's drab European backgrounds. Steven Soderbergh's directing also makes the film harder to enjoy. The film's choppywe don't see events that happened until after the fact if that makes any sense and there are so many subplots and characters with similar sounding names that eventually we stop caring. Whenever a movie makes me do that I usually focus more in on the fun aspects of the movie. And sure the movie had its fun moments and never left me bored but overall it just lacked that ultracool style that the first one had.Then again every actor's back in cool form. Catherine ZetaJones is the newbie here and although her character is barely defined she still manages to be cool. George Clooney Julia Roberts Brad Pitt being on screen probably more than anyone else Matt Damonthey're all cool. But it's obvious that this isn't the best sequel that could have been made for Ocean's Eleventhe movie was originally written for a completely different movie and then readapted to a sequel. Because of that there aren't really any reminders on who these people were. I remembered Clooney Roberts Garcia and a few character names and quirks such as Pitt's obsessive eating but really who were these people? Did Soderbergh think that we would all rush out to see the first one before seeing this? I'll bet as many people did that as the number who went to see the Russian Solyaris after Soderbergh made Solaris.The caper this time around isn't as interesting the major one doesn't come in until halfway through nor as easy to follow. In fact the whole movie's basically a convoluted mess. The subplot about Isabel's father things like that...if there's a definition of worthless that's it. Also that Julia Roberts bit went on for too long. We got the joke there. At that moment I think that the movie thought it was funny enough to abandon basically the entire plot and go with a ten minute schtick when there was basically no other humor in the movie. Still Ocean's Twelve isn't terrible and can offer a good time if you're the right person.My rating 610 Rated PG13 for language.".

It was more like the story of Brad and ZetaJones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.With O11 the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict Garcia. They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tipoff and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puhlease...This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt ZetaJones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.Slow moving movie not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed.SPOILER!!! The twist  the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.END SPOILER.Wait until it comes on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this.".

I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.The actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. Most embarrassing are leading ladies Roberts and ZetaJones that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon Clooney and Pitt aren't brilliant either. To be honest I really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie. May contains spoilers  Camera and editing sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects  NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean Julia Roberts playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???To summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Ocean's 12 I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ...".

If you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh and seen all of his films you'll just love it.I don't want to talk about the plot here because frankly you wouldn't believe me. Just when you think the film is going to settle down into some kind of recognisable rhythm something entirely unexpected is thrown in turning everything on it's head. You know the moment at the end of the first film when everything you thought you saw turned out to be something different? Pretty much every scene here is like that. Which is probably were I and nearly all the mean spirited reviews I've read part company. The general feeling seems to be that the plot was thrown together and the story lacks structure. Well yes that's the point. Soderbergh's messing about with what you're allowed to do in a socalled typical Hollywood sequel. It's experimental rather than erratic.I'll admit to a degree that is a greatest hits of Soderbergh's greatest hits with a variety of film stock and messy camera angles on display. Flashbacks are in full evidence as are the freeze frames and captions in multiple fonts. But so what? Would it have been better if some hack had been hired to trot out a clone of the first film clinically perfect without any passion? He should be applauded for not making the same movie again opting instead for something which resembles his own Full Frontal with obscure film injokes intact.

If that's not enough to make you reconsider and see a good film like Finding Neverland then you'll be in for a treat. Perhaps the worst thing about this disaster is that in the middle of the film in a failed attempt to have some laughs Julia Roberts has to play Julia Roberts in a heist operation. And if that's not bad enough they also hide a pillow underneath her shirt to try to make her look pregnant and have Bruce Willis in a cameo playing himself meet up with her and that add to the chaos.

The locations are wellshot and the action scenes get as crazy as the budget will allow however the good guys are just too outnumbered for the outcome to have much believability and the fight choreography is nothing to write home about. Andrew Divoff makes a convincingly slimy and hateful villain while Erika Eleniak is a knockout in more ways than one I don't want to spoil her best scene but it involves a barrel full of water. Nice to see Matthias Hues again  but is it just me or did they cut out his final scene? And why is Burt Reynolds  even if he appears in only 1 scene  not credited in either the opening or the closing credits? He shouldn't be ashamed of his involvement  he has appeared in worse films than this! ".

	onyx:emotionText "Strike Force AKA The Librarians is strictly routine Bmovie action fare about a team of mercenaries who are trying to locate a kidnapped girl the granddaughter of the team leader's best friend and bring down a powerful and sadistic crime boss operating in Miami. The locations are wellshot and the action scenes get as crazy as the budget will allow however the good guys are just too outnumbered for the outcome to have much believability and the fight choreography is nothing to write home about. Andrew Divoff makes a convincingly slimy and hateful villain while Erika Eleniak is a knockout in more ways than one I don't want to spoil her best scene but it involves a barrel full of water. Nice to see Matthias Hues again  but is it just me or did they cut out his final scene? And why is Burt Reynolds  even if he appears in only 1 scene  not credited in either the opening or the closing credits? He shouldn't be ashamed of his involvement  he has appeared in worse films than this! ";

He's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the Bloodsport series also B movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable. Here he is a shell of his former self  sure he's older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... I just don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another heavy that I've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in. I'm not going to even mention Mr. Reynolds  his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff as usual a creepy evil pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk  the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs.

Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kickboxes her way into an alliance with Simon.

Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels...maybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money just cut some stuff in and forgot about the plot. Its low budget and appears so. I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad but they used none that were quality. I would say this film is the quintessential bad script with alright production. It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effects I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like. Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie.

But these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kid.But then again I didn't really expect much either how could I from a action movie named The Librarians? And it actually delivers about what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I am unsure if I can call it entertaining it didn't keep my interest very long.310";

An army doctor a major played by Judith Light accompanied by her black colleague is designated to investigate it and uncover its source and its treatment.  They manage to trace the infections back to Africa thence to a mysterious government facility in Alabama.  It turns out that the virus was developed somehow as part of a governmentsponsored investigation by a private research organization into genetic restructuring.  That's basically the source.  The treatment is discovered serendipitously through the exposure of identical twins to the virus one of whom had a transfusion from an immune person and who's blood now carries the antibodies.  That's it.Did you find that confusing?  I can only call them as I see them.  There is the germ of a great suspenseful movie in these ideas and the production blows its chance.  This has to be one of the murkiest plots ever.  Murky plots are okay in some kinds of movies.  I suppose I'm still not sure what 2001 A Space Odyssey was about.  But this is supposed to be a scientific detective story.  A subplot is thrown in about a despairing mother Pamela Reed whose two children disappear while visiting their father in Gabon.  We get timewasting discussions between Reed and Light about how it feels to be a mother and worry about your children.  The time wasted should have been spent on exposition.  There is nothing about various levels of protection against infection about how those alienlooking suits work or about sterilization procedures.  They use Lysol!  As the story unfolds we learn practically nothing about viruses let alone THE virus.  There's a tensecond glimpse of what looks like a strand of spaghetti during a slide show.  If only we had learned as much about viruses here where it's essential as we learned about ants in Them.  Or about alien microorganisms in The Andromeda Strain before that story collapsed during its last few minutes.  As it is Andromeda stands next to this flick as a model of explanatory clarity.  At any rate I couldn't follow this plot. It's too bad.  Because anyone who wants to learn just how thoroughly creepy the real possibilities of such an outbreak are should read a wellwritten book about the subject Hot Zone by an author whose name now escapes me. The symptoms of the ebolalike virus are described in this film by offhand references to the liquifying of internal organs.  Read the book if you can find it and discover exactly what this involves.  We've already had a couple of close calls in real life that virtually no one seems to know or care much about.  The influenza outbreak of 1918 flattened the United States and Europe but that was nothing compared to the viruses we are on the verge of unleashing on the world because of our penetration of heretofore unfriendly environments like tropical rainforests.  In these secluded areas a virus may be endemic among a population of monkeys or wild boars where they may cause no more serious symptoms than a common cold.  HIV was basically a nuisance to chimps.  But we are in the process now of providing them with a new host the largest most populous land mammal around and one who travels rapidly all over the place by airplane.  In the movies when there is a threat posed like this science comes to our rescue.  The experts are called up.  Only as regards this particular threat there are no experts  and no protection at all.The acting in this film is perfunctory.  Judith Light is pretty convincing as a commanding officer or commanding person.  You can probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of times she blinks while the cameras are rolling.  The big militaryindustrial conspiracy is the usual stuff detracting from any realization that the real demon here is so small.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hoods doesn't deliver the goods. This halfbaked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast including Joe Mantegna Kevin Pollack Joe Pantoliano Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one. Writer  director Mark Malone best known for writing Dead of Winter for Bonnie  Clyde director Arthur Penn has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss Louie Martinelli Seymour Cassel dispatching his son Angelo Joe Mantegna of House of Games to whack Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob firebombed one of Pop's warehouses in the opening scene and Martinelli wants payback. Trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy such a complication might be amusing but here is just plain flat. Angelo and a carload of wiseguys including his best pal Rudy Kevin Pollack of Deterrence spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform the hit so they track down a crazy mob hitman Charlie Joe Pantoliano of Bad Boys to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit they have to locate him and Charlie's slutty wife Mary Jennifer Tilly of Bound reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital. Our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break Charlie out. About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in short pants Vincent Berry who is bland and harmless. Indeed Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot. Instead he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds. Angelo and he struggle over the automatic. The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground goes off and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place and Angelo and he argued over the wrongheadedness of the hit. So Rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun.There is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending. Things gets worse and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laughless. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny. Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. If he was he missed by a mile. Bigbreasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna but she doesn't do much of anything else. She's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially I had hoped that this might be a Ransom of Red Chief knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts but no such luck here. Of course the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution.I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD labelSevilleand it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning.".

It looked like it was going to be a good mafiacomedy film full of surprises and humorous plot twists and I got what I expected for the first hour. Then the film went totally downward and decided to change from an entertaining and interesting comedy to a tragic drama filled with sorrow and a few unanswered questions. The acting was fantastic. Kevin Pollak was the scenestealer as a mafia hitman opposite Joe Mantegna who was equally good. You can't blame the actors because they all were good. Joe Pantoliano portrays an insane hitman who HATES FRENCH CIGARETTES AND FRENCH MODEL AIRPLANES and it is a remarkable performance. However the last half hour began to get worse and worse every minute because it never got back to the subplots of the coffee shop owner who wanted to trouble his competitor by using his mafia pals and the tobacco shop owner's son who was brutally assaulted by a hitman because the son accidentally bit the hitman's crotch. What happens? You never find out. Maybe in a sequel? I doubt one will ever exist because no one really cares about this movie. After seeing the whole thing I can understand why. Best Scene A hitman walks up to the godfather and says I quit and the godfather begins to swing his arms around in a circle and pushes them in the hitman's face and says OOOH The hitman burns!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent lowbudget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100 accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography. It isn't a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film Dahmer 2001 was. The movie begins with Dahmer played quite convincingly by Carl Crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment. His thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of Dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times. We get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life. It isn't anyone's fault but Dahmer's that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student I was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain. You do see two deaths that I remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid. While you don't see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results. There is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive. Besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible. Although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing. The film actually concludes before Dahmer's death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior. That's about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as I've stated very true to the facts. The film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters IS a bit hammy but it's not overboard. In my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of America's most remembered serial killers. I think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent Carl Crew as Dahmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey DahmerCarl Crew brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishlyinwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. Every person that he lured back to his apartment he was attracted to and had feelings for and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him. In the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what I noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. It was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby  for both evil and emotional reasons.The scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real I was shivering in my seat. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio Private PyleLeonard in the film 'Full Metal Jacket' looked just before he gunneddown the General in the toilet barracks.If your an emotional person I wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not than go ahead and watch it.".

Carl Crew who also scripted and coproduced is Dahmer and the film follows him from Bath Township Ohio to his subsequent arrest in Milwaukee. Using the prospect of money for nude pictures he lured dozens of men to their deaths. Scenes of him dismembering bodies with an electric saw dipping live people in acid performing botched lobotomies and caressing skulls and various body parts are appropriately disturbing and hardtoshake.

Its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest.

The final victim who survive has some of the funniest acting ever. His eyes are huge his mouth is opened wide and all he says is Oh my God oh No Oh Jesus. The crimes of Milwaukee's Jeffrey Dahmer is nothing to laugh about but this movie is downright funny.And funniest of all this is the best movie about Jeffrey Dahmer. It details his gruesome killings of men in the 90's but doesn't really go too deep into his mental state. It is funny because of the bad acting but it is also chilling too because you know that at any moment Dahmer was ready to kill rape and eat his victims. Dude was hungry and he didn't have money for food. He hunted his food in the streets of Milwaukee. Dahmer still continues to live in the mind of Milwaukee and it seems like every few years people make movies about Dahmer in order to keep his spirit alive. Milwaukee is known for one thing and that is Jeffrey Dahmer. This is a good movie to watch might make you squirm at some scenes and laugh at other scenes. This movie surprisingly has a great soundtrack. When Dahmer is killing his victims the filmmaker decided to put these really cool 80's sounding music in the background. It is a weird thing to do but yea if you are a fan of Jeffrey Dahmer or are interested in the phenomenon behind Jeffrey Dahmer the most memorable American serial killer then give this movie a watch. It is a cheap looking movie but worth your time.".

And frankly the constant I should have stayed with God diatribe becomes annoying after a while.For a more realistic and subdued look at Dahmer's life see the new film Dahmer with Jeremy Renner.  Renner's performance as Jeffrey is so deadon it's scary.  And while it doesn't get into as many of Jeffrey's killings everyone should already know the basic story by now.Bottom Line  If you can see this movie cheap it's worth a look.

This picture's key triumph is that it manages to make Dahmer a recognizable and sympathetic human being without whitewashing the severity of the atrocious acts he committed. Moreover there's some pointed social commentary on people giving too much trust to complete strangers and the ineffectualness of rehabilitation programs for convicted sex offenders. The matteroffact presentation of Dahmer's gruesome misdeeds gives this movie a genuinely clammy and chilling edge while the subtext about Dahmer's guilt and shame over his homosexuality adds a touching element of pathos. Ronald Vidor's rough cinematography provides a convincingly gritty look. Bowen's melodic and unobtrusive score likewise does the trick. A sound and evenly handled docudrama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilersI've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time. This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on Dahmer himself. The film called Dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.I did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. But I might be wrong about that.What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway. That is ok  but what I then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened. It's not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out. What wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. Again I don't mind they didn't SHOW it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.Conclusion I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. This movie was just a cutout excuse the pun of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.410".

His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits the class 'fat girl' a nave immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive drama teacher. So far interesting. In theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a builtin audiencethe thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand peppered with a dose of selfdeprecating humor.Unfortunately rather than a nuanced dramedy Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikeable derivative twodimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. Sabrina Fink is a quasiGoth bitter navelgazer. She is such a prickly unsympathetic person there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney Christian registers zero. This may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. Consequently one is left wondering when there is such a nonexistent bond what could possibly warrant their nearconstant companionship throughout the story.Sabrina's newfound boyfriend Rudy de Jesus and Rodney's mother Judy Theaker are among the most exaggerated of the clichd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrantnerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of TV or film. Judy is the bornagain obsessed with Jesus talk and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser. However he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jockhunk Ted Miller. Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment most gay teens filled with raging testosterone just like their hetero brethren would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby Bruening an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot. Like Sabrina Bobby is an icy angry smart aleck and the viewer is left headscratching as to his magnetic appeal. Much to his delight Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival the boyfriendtobe promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. As tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown patronized by attractive men no less? Apparently the place is not so backwater after all.Ten years earlier Todd Stephens' Edge of Seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film.".

He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again I didn't know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work.There are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema. My friend described it as a gay AngusNapoleon Dynamite but it's something more than that. It's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified. I look forward to seeing more of Ash Christian Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.".

It was a great comedy  very original and heartfelt  and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state  with LOTS of small towns  and of course plenty of teenagers who grew up as fat girls. I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were awesome  they were so great in these rolls it was like the script was written with them in mind. And speaking of the script it was very well written very believable and Ash is a great actor his facial expressions alone made me giggle. It IS an independent film  but don't let that fool you...It's a good one! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring.".

The bigger budget wasn't really needed as it's nothing you and I couldn't do with our phones and friends. Though I'm sure renting prom props wasn't cheap.This is a fairly entertaining movie if you like movies that rely only on the verbal exchanges of supposedly witty teen angsters. It's got no real plot but the general idea is something about the slice of life revolving around the prom. People have compared it to Napoleon Dynamite but there's a heavy dose of a Will  Grace inspiration but if Grace was overweight instead of underweight and Will got laid.None of the 20somethings who played the teens look young for their age. Ash doesn't look like a fresh teen but a man in his 20s who has been sleepdeprived and stressed out from being a triple threat on his first real movie project.However if you do enjoy this movie I recommend watching 29th and Gay.

There is no character development whatsoever the plot is a garbled mess the style is nonsensical the shot selection is appalling and the editing is worse.

From his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions. He spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less then 0.1 seconds his face will turn not just serious but mangafighterstyle life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record. It's hilarious.If that wasn't enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything. The one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like American Pie you'll love this.Rirathcom".

It certainly isn't that I like naked cartoon girls. In some ways Keitaro Oe the main character is analogous to Johnny Bravo except instead of being an obnoxious musclebound jock Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of him as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. He's easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed but he grows on you either way if you give him a chance. He IS the Goldenboy. The formula is the same for each episode. Boy meets girl boy tries to win girl's heart despite being a dorky pervert boy somehow succeeds against all odds. Typically the girl doesn't realize she likes Keitaro until after he's beaten to a pulp andor pulled off some spectacular stunt like engineering a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a gasolinepowered motorcycle using his bicycle.Episode 1 features a rich software tycoon. I think animating her boobs put a major dent in the budget because she's the only female that has this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessionally. Most people who rate this negatively probably never got past the first episode.Episode 2 has the rich young daughter who likes to tease. She's only 16 but that's legal age in Japan and in some states in the US I might add. Her father is also a brutal yakuzza type that has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter. Girl 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner that's mixed up with a bad boyfriend. Aside from Keitaro running interference for the maiden and being kissed by a guy there's almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode  a sharp drop from the previous two. Nevertheless Keitaro and the evil boyfriend really pound each other.Episode 4 has Keitaro trying to impress a topnotch swimming coach. Keitaro seems more 'direct' about his intentions with this particular girl than any other... and she's pretty direct in return...Girl 5 is the biker babe. She's probably the most topheavy of the 6 although not superbuoyant like girl 1 and 'raciest' in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily the most overthetop in terms of lack of realism. Keitaro should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the biker babe but I think the producers and writers said It's just a cartoon! We can do anything! This lapse in realism makes it a fan favorite.Finally episode 6 introduces a new girl that's works in animation and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro as he tries to cope with impossible time and resource constraints to get an OAV out the door by the deadline. In terms of ecchi this one's very tame as well but there's plenty of humor. The ending has all 5 extremely pretty girls from the past team up to hunt Keitaro who slips away unnoticed ostensibly with the intention of gangraping him. Yeah that ALMOST happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana ala Samurai Shodown with Steve Urkelala Family Matters...All in all there's no middle ground for this. You'll either hate it or love it. If you're new to anime you probably don't want to start with this. At the same time if you can stand characters like Happosai from Ranma 12 or Johnny Bravo... or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards silliness but have very sexual overtones you should give it a shot.".

You can still die laughing if your humor knows no political boundaries.This anime is very philosophical. Kintaro is an almost Buddhalike figure. Though this aspect as everything else is way over the top Kintaro inspired me a lot during my youth to the point that I chose to cycle through Japan which I did two years ago.But really not to forget this anime is ridiculously funny. I rarely spend so much time laughing to the point I can't breathe even though I've seen all episodes for about ten times now.I recommend this to any one who can laugh about themselves who is interested in Japanese culture or who's looking for some inspiration on how to lead his life.".

Each episode sees him arriving in a new town acquiring a new job developing something of a love interest before each episode ends with him leaving.Gently sexist juvenile very immature at times this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face.Not one to start with if you are not a fan of anime as this certainly won't convince you about the genre but for those who are already converted this is entertaining fluff.";

Visuals  The animation is some of the best I've seen so far in anime. Character movements are smooth and fluid and the character designs are incredibly detailed. I know that anime backgrounds are often incredibly detailed but the images combined with the constant movement of characters is just gorgeous. Story  The basic premise is fairly simple. A perverted genius travels around taking on parttime jobs which he quickly masters before moving on. Wherever he goes he improves the lives of the people he meets. This show actually has several sweet messages about life in there buried beneath the sexual comedy. Characters  Though there is a new cast in every episode pretty much all the characters have depth and interesting personalities. The writing is very good. The girls featured in this show could've been onedimensional bimbos but all of them have lives and are written well enough so that while watching the show it feels like the characters are real and have lives outside of the episode.".

The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son Ryan Latshaw son of the director has one continuous perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave. At least he's a kid. The mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.So what about the name actors? You see Stevens Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen they're used to pad out the time. Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it. Her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit. There's also one outofnowhere laugh when an ultraconservative couple who watch a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it.

	schema:reviewBody "My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad movies. Among the flicks we watched the strongest contender for quality badmovie fare was easily JackO. It's ludicrous that movies such as Gigli Glitter and You Got Served are listed in IMDBs bottom 100. While they're certainly bad movies they don't belong in the bottom 100. They're robbing JackO and Keeper of Time etc of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve.So what makes JackO so great in bad movie terms? For starters Steve Latshaw the director decided to cast his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being outacted by a block of wood. The kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever. The end result unintentional comic gold. The kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessness.The other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming sequences. What is a doubledream? Well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again. Basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare. Clever device no? I believe the character of Sean Kelly experienced no less than 3 doubledreaming sequences.Let's see... what else? Oh yeah! This movie has a veritable cast of thousands. It's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie. Best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story. They're either killed by JackO or they serve no purpose whatsoever.JackO himself was pretty sweet. Like most other Bmovie monsters JackO has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances. He's invariably hangingout somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character. What's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shamblingstumbling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting.That's all for now. Closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you can't go wrong by renting this beast.Bad Movie Score 710 Good Movie Score 3.510".

	schema:headline " JackO offers strange enjoyment";
	schema:reviewBody "I bought JackO a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well. It seems strange I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is JackOThe movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Greatgrandfatherunclecousinetc and now that the villain has been resurrected Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hellbred mission of vengeance. Anyway much horror ensues as JackO hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that JackO is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded 150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this antithriller and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his moviemaking.And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people including some of my friends will find this movie intolerable and needlessly timeconsuming and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously you'll find JackO an instant classic which is also understandable.That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating JackO's quality as a film I wouldn't give it anything. In fact the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion.".

	onyx:emotionText "I bought JackO a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well. It seems strange I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is JackOThe movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Greatgrandfatherunclecousinetc and now that the villain has been resurrected Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hellbred mission of vengeance. Anyway much horror ensues as JackO hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that JackO is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded 150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this antithriller and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his moviemaking.And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people including some of my friends will find this movie intolerable and needlessly timeconsuming and that's understandable.

But also because It's has my two fav scream queens in it. Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens. Linnea did a bang up job in this movie. I was actually surprised because her acting so good. And it interesting to see Brinke in a cameo role as a witch. But there were some cool death scenes and I liked the way it was shot. 16mm. My favorite besides digital. Anyway just rent this movie and eat some pizza. Make sure it's extra cheesy!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "JackO was scripted by my good friend Brad Linaweaver so I'm prejudiced in its favour. Lowbudget filmmaker Fred Olen Ray had a few minutes of footage of John Carradine sitting in a forest at night and a bit more footage of Cameron Mitchell staring into a camera and telling a spooky story. Ray challenged Linaweaver to write a featurelength script using these snippets of footage. Carradine and Mitchell appear VERY briefly in JackO and not together.JackO is a bogstandard spookfest. JackOLantern is a homicidal maniac who died in arcane circumstances but who still comes back for one night every year guess which night. Yes Hallowe'en. The crucial dual role in this film is a small boy in modern times who's related to JackO's first victim also a small boy from more than a century earlier on. When I saw that the child actor cast in these roles Ryan Latshaw is the son of the film's director Steve Latshaw I expected a vanity production. But young Ryan is actually a decent actor in this film at least his performance is better than his dad's directing.I always expect zero production values in a film like this so I was pleasantly astounded by the realistic 19thcentury prologue. Brad told me that this was filmed in an historic village in Florida. Unfortunately the first few minutes of the film look much much better than anything afterwards.There are several very attractive actresses in this film notably scream queen Linnea Quigley as the heroine and Catherine Walsh as a bad girl who MIGHT have supernatural abilities. Untalented Helen Keeling is attractive but she speaks her dialogue with one of the most bizarre accents I've ever heard.There are some REALLY grotty special effects notably the lightning why didn't they use a stock shot? and the scene in which one character gets electrocuted. I've seen more realistic electrocutions in Tex Avery cartoons. The postdubbing of the soundtrack is worse than it really needs to be for this low budget.JackO isn't very good but it isn't nearly bad enough to be one of those Ed Woodish camp classics. I strongly recommend it as a study aid for those who want to learn Bowfingerstyle filmmaking techniques. And some of the actresses are very watchable. Otherwise JackO is a JokeO. For thrills and chills look elsewhere.".

The pumpkinheaded killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while.

I liked some of the small touches like the Halloween garage spook show and the weird conservative neighbors who are killed. Also good to see is Linnea Quigley in a role that is probably too small but it's still Linnea and she brings an element of fun to the film even if her role was almost useless. The cameos from John Carradine and Cameron Mitchell are from some unknown archive source but still I liked seeing both of them here. The bad stuff. The plastic JackO pumpkin mask is really lame. And the acting is the cheesiest! Then again that only adds to the fun. The little kid son of the director might be the worst child actor I've ever seen but it's hilarious to watch! The adults aren't much better. There's one woman in a flashback scene who you must see in all her monotone glory to believe. The woman who plays the psychic is also quite awful. You will be rolling on the floor in laughter! There is a bit of gore and one topless scene from Rachel Carter who plays the Quigley character's sister in the film.

And believe me this movie couldn't have killed that spirit more. To save you from being bored silly with the plot let's just go straight to the check listAwful plot. Check! The story layout appeals to a Friday night flick fan but has about as much emotional depth as dinner theatre. The film is disastrously long and dull. About 30 of the film is designated to Sean Kelly's dream sequences don't ask 25 to introducing people who have no effect on the plot 15 to Sean's dad's haunted mansion 10 to trickortreating with kids no one knows who the heck they are another 10 to some moron his girlfriend and his Harley and a remaining grand total of 5 to Jacko. The remaining 5 is reserved for shots of nudity storm clouds and people talking about food. Totally nonfrightening antagonist. Check! I've screamed more in an episode of Murphy Brown than this. Jacko himself is about as lame as a duck with one leg in front of a pack of hungry wolves. He kills a few but there are absolutely no tense and heart racing chase sequences no real climax. His overall presence lacks fright and bite something that Freddy Krueger in Elm Street Jason Vorhees in Friday the 13th and Ben Affleck in Gigli all achieved. Awful FX. Check! Normally in a standard slasher flick a victim to the creature's blade will be shown being gutted in all it's bloody disgusting glory. But of course we don't see this happen. That would require effort something the crew of this film wern't ready to commit. However they were generous enough to buy fire crackers and glue them to a crucifix and set it alight. Somebody call the KKK. This selflighting cross idea could really takeoff.Awful acting. Check! The boy who plays Sean Kelly is horrendous. At times it seems like the director slipped him a sleeping pill just before shooting. This kid just mumbles out his lines with no care in the world. The director obviously could not give a damn whether the boy's acting was up to any kind of par. Ironically the young actor is the directors son! That's nepotism is it's purest form folks!Obligatory shower girl. Check! I think no further comment is necessary.Various other scenes of obligatory nudity. Check! see aboveAll in all Jacko deserves a few points for making such a disaster and fooling some poor film company into distributing it. Other than that this film deserves to be dead and buried much like Jacko himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any film that has horror veterans Linnea Quigley Cameron Mitchell and John Carradine all in the same feature must surely be worth its weight in gold. JackO is notorious for being the second to last movie to include a role for Mr. Carradine senior. He died in 1988 and this was released in 1995 which means that his performance was obviously lifted from stockfootage. It's ingenious how Steve Lathshaw made it work really. I wish I knew more about where the scenes came from but I have been unable to track down any information at all. If anyone knows anything further please let me know. The screenplay was adapted from a story by Fred Olen Ray whom himself has helmed a host of Bmovies.  He was behind slashers Scalps and Final Examination and to the best of my knowledge he's still working today. After this Lathshaw went on to direct a couple more flicks including Death Mask before settling for a more lucrative career in writing. Unlike most American direct to videocable horror films from the midnineties this actually got unleashed in the United Kingdom. The Midnight Movies label that distributed it released so few that original copies have now become somewhat of a rarity selling for fairly good money at film fairs. Although it's by no means brilliant the qualities lie in its utter trashy cheesiness with comical characters and tongue in cheek horror. Many years ago the families of Oakmoor Crossing tracked down a vicious murderer named Walter Machen Carradine and lynched him. He was a powerful warlock and just before he died he summoned a demon from the depths of hell to seek revenge on the townsfolk. The assassin attacked and butchered lots of people until a man called Arthur Kelly found a way to stop him for good. Now present day three rowdy teens accidentally revive the pumpkin headed fiend much to their disadvantage. Armed with a decidedly nasty scythe he heads back to the same town to continue where he left off his killing spree. He couldn't have picked a better night for murder because it happens to be October the 31st or in other words Halloween. Arthur's great great Grandson Sean Kelly Ryan Lathshaw is only a young boy but little does he know that he is the only person alive with the power to stop the bloodthirsty killer. Will he realise his potential before the demon reaches his parents or will he be too late?They don't come much cheesier than this lowest of the low' budget Halloween flick. Everything from the killer's laughable JackoLantern head like they had them in the 1890s! to the way they touted his rhyming urban legends Mr Jack will break your back and chop off your head with a whack whack whack! was certainly topdrawer entertainment. The most amusing thing was the woefully out of date cool dude' character that looked more like Fonzie than anyone from the present day. Complete with quiff leather jacket and motor cycle his dialogue alone wouldn't have sounded out of place in a Grease remake! Over the years since her debut in Psycho from Texas and inclusion in tonnes of cheapo flicks including Graduation Day and Fatal Games Linnea Quigley has gained herself a devoted cult following. She doesn't disappoint here taking a long gratuitous shower displaying at least two minutes of customary TA in her first scene alone! Her only real rival for the crown of queen of the schlockhorrors' is that other Bmovie favourite Debbie Rochon. Quigley is probably the better actress of the two but really it's only down to weather you favour Blondes or Brunettes as to decide which you prefer. They've both done their fare share of trash!Unfortunately the lesserknown faces were all mostly pitiful. Gary Doles was the only one that attempted to add a little life to his character and even though he wasn't exceptional he scores ten out of ten for effort. If you blink you'll miss Cameron Mitchell's brief cameo. He plays Dr.Cadaver a creepy TV presenter that hosts a show filled with all things horror. His inclusion in flicks ranging from The Toolbox Murders to Memorial Valley Massacre made it a part that he was undoubtedly born to play. There were two antiliberal toffs that were there to supply the comic relief which really wasn't necessary because the whole thing was little more than an inadvertent giggle in the first place. Their joint talks of people being blind to the Government and the like made them an instant cert for a gruesome demise. A grisly fate for the snub twosome was as predictable as death and taxes.The special effects were perhaps the lamest that I've ever seen. The lightening looked like it was drawn onto the negatives with a felt tip pen and the killer's lantern head was so blatantly a shoddy mask that it was ridiculous. It isn't really fair to criticise the lack of production though because I'm sure that this was made with the best intentions from a shoestring budget. They at least manage to chuck in some gooey redstuff and a fairly well modelled decapitation which pushes the boundaries of the 15 certificate. Together with the fairly strong nudity it acts as further proof that the censors must have been either from another planet or smoking an eighth of crack when they rated Christina's House as an 18! Lathshaw tries a few interesting camera angles and the woodland scenes are all surprisingly well lighted. You won't get bored whilst watching and it doesn't hang around to introduce cheesy horror as the central characteristic. Keep a look out for the director's son Ryan in a starring role. You can't deny that he's an authentic actor' if nothing else!What did you actually expect from a movie called JackO' with a pumpkinheaded killer on the cover and Linnea Quigley in the cast? Of course it's going to be cumbersome clumsy and misbegotten! But thankfully it's bad in a good way and fans of mature cheddar circumstances will find more than enough to fill their hunger. It's better than that other Halloweenbased throwaway HackoLantern but I wouldn't expect any brilliance because you'll be fairly disappointed. Come October the 31st don't you dare forget that Mr. Jack will snap your spine and cut you in half with a scaly vine? Oooooooh!".

	onyx:emotionText "Any film that has horror veterans Linnea Quigley Cameron Mitchell and John Carradine all in the same feature must surely be worth its weight in gold. JackO is notorious for being the second to last movie to include a role for Mr. Carradine senior. He died in 1988 and this was released in 1995 which means that his performance was obviously lifted from stockfootage. It's ingenious how Steve Lathshaw made it work really. I wish I knew more about where the scenes came from but I have been unable to track down any information at all. If anyone knows anything further please let me know. The screenplay was adapted from a story by Fred Olen Ray whom himself has helmed a host of Bmovies.  He was behind slashers Scalps and Final Examination and to the best of my knowledge he's still working today. After this Lathshaw went on to direct a couple more flicks including Death Mask before settling for a more lucrative career in writing. Unlike most American direct to videocable horror films from the midnineties this actually got unleashed in the United Kingdom.

The actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that I've never heard of or seen before.

But the monsters are very well done if a bit pred like.Stirton does an amazing job with not very much and I'd love to see his take on a real Hollywood movie. It least it wasn't predictable and I almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off!!! OK so it is a little derivative of other scifi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a scifi film for 8 g's is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry.Good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting Making of. No standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like Lost in Mancha only with a film at the end. But why no commentary? KEEP GOING SCOTS!".

Perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's deference to other Carpenter works. Not least Dark Star which it has something in common with. I'd be interested to know how much it REALLY cost? 8000? Is that even possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost 8000? But I did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died. They are so underplayed that it's like watching a documentary at times. Having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and I'm not sure the big guy playing the Captain is one of them. But his gun is AWESOME!! Give it a chance if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it just don't expect 2001.".

Cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually quite effected when they died. In particulare when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well its a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered. This will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me. But nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from Sturton.".

For a mere 8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original scifi films for a long time.Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell the film is a mix of great special effects strong storytelling and well planned action. From the opening space battle to the pounding finale everything about this film appears well above it's budget.To start with the special effects while certainly not Revenge Of The Sith standard they are on level if not above the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a snip of a price as well. The detail and the movement is superb and captures the imagination from the off. The design of everything ships weapons entities is second to none. The imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for a film of this budget.Another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc it takes. There are a few twists and turn most of which are well written into the script surprising and well played out. I was surprised that two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago how relevant some aspects of the story are to today's society. With the happenings around the world there may be a certain resonance with the lengths the mercenaries are forced to go to in order to survive.Even the sounds effects are spot on as is the atmospheric music. The use of light and costume add further to the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks a desolate and lonely place.In all honesty this film looks 10 if not 100 times the budget spent and that's testament to a creative hard working team of people from the director to the cast to the effects via the producer and sound team. Wonderful effort I recommend you get your hand on a copy ASAP".

	schema:reviewBody "On many levels it's very good. In fact considering that this was a lowbudget British indie by a first time featuredirector with a largely neophyte cast it's a magnificent achievement. I don't know how much it cost. The figure of 8000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is. The point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that Great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. Even having said that much of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless faceless blanks but these were ten characters  mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. Throughout the middle act when the plot was developing the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film was like the second act it would be stunning.Before the ship blows up twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'epods' which blast away from the ship. They're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped cramped and have no real idea where they're going  but that makes sense. I like the epods  they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice roomy escape capsule. I also like the way that we are specifically told later that they are designed for shiptoship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency  because let's face it these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. That said it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused epods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an epod  but in he gets. And it has just occurred to me shouldn't the Captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there? Anyway the epods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation  or at least on a sandy sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah it's a planet in a scifi movie  it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the epods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up firing flares into the sky to locate each other.The Captain a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two epods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on antigrav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired epod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way that he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it treating him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterisation.".

On the surprise scale this would rate as sharing a hot tub with Jessica Alba whilst a band consisting of Elvis Jimi Hendrix John Lennon Phil Lynott and Keith Moon play you music for the night. The reason why this film will surprise you is that for the meagre budget they had 8000 and that this was done by a bunch of mates who just wanted to try it out they have produced something very slick and looks easily 100 times more than its budget.The plot is simple a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space come under attack and are forced to crash land on a nearby desolate planet. After some checks not only does the planet not exist according to star charts but they are not alone as it seems and something very unfriendly begins to pick them of one by one. It sounds like very standard SciFi fare mixing elements of Aliens. Predator and Pitch Black but it takes all these and makes them into something that feels fresh and original.The Location shooting in this is fantastic utilising Balmeddie beach in Aberdeen to the maximum and you genuinely feel that you are one an alien world. The seemingly never ending sand dunes and clever lighting effects give it a very bleak feel  you truly think the crew are stranded on an alien world. Also the action sequences are superb the opening assault on the freighter a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and the firefights as well as the stunning finale all showcase the inventiveness of the film.As for the team of mercenaries the cast excels themselves. For a low budget independent movie the casting here was done via local media outlets and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future. Local body builder Mike Mitchell whilst not a natural actor slots into his role as the ArnieEsq leader of the mercenaries. From the rest of the cast there are two stand out performances Patrick Wright as second in command McNeal and Scott Ironside as the rough and ready engineer Vince. Both have some the best lines in the movie and Scott injects a good bit of humour into the movie with his performance. Patrick gives a well rounded performance as the cool as ice second in command.Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that Scottish cinema need not all be 'Kilts and Ceilidhs' or 'Slums and Drugs' Scottish films can be fresh inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun. This film is Scottish with a north east flavour to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece. Although the budget limitations show from time to time the only fault i could find that is to be expected. This film its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then some more. I for one wish Mark and his crew every success and theirs is a career to keep a very close eye on.Rating  910 The first Scottish scifi is bold fresh and inventive a real triumph.Movie reviews news and opinion like no other plus the kick ass biweekly podcasts.www.fightrunner.co.uk contactfightrunner.co.uk".

	schema:reviewBody "i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!!!the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent a 'escape pod' a few guns uniforms camping gear and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props. Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights starwars.The cgi is fine. It is not exactly 'seamless'... but imho it still works. why? because there isn't too much of it and what there is is not 'taking over' with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination... it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition especially the heavy freighter shot.. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds...that tracks the entire length of the ship... it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds and some relation to the story. it might look old or not 'state of the art' but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story.The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them. Now as for the plot.... mostly it is good... why? Because it doesn't try to explain itself. It just happens. It's called 'the planet' its a mystery get it?? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they don't find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? This isn't War and Peace. And thank god it's not star warstrek either. No midichlorians no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things... it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. It is mysterious and i liked that. I don't know why maybe I can identify with these guys more  since they don't know whats happening and i don't either... they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. Anyways. What can I say. This was well worth the dollar I payed at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket. It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3. Like I said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and I couldn't stop watching until the end.".

Mayhem ensues a lot of ammo is expended.The special effects were spare and properly done emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky cheap looking plastic props. Plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart.I peg this one as a lite Saturday afternoon flick. You can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable. Even better your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment and she'll be happy after all she got to TALK to you! It's THAT type of movie.Anyways the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet but hey this is a Guns 'n' Ammo action movie. Cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have Beer and chips at hand. So don't get get yourself into a braincramp over the ending.".

After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in Aberdeen.1st off Im not a big SciFi fan baring Star Wars I was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location I was presently surprised. This didn't turn out to be a standard SciFi more like a mix of scifi and survival horror.Had a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with 8000. Acting was better than average for a low budget film. The way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice.Weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe mode.All in all I will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next Hint Hint. The extras on the DVD were very informative on giving background for the producers I would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next DVD release.Excellent work keep it up".

Some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story starts out very airtight. And then... And then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. No real believable end game for the villain? No real explanation of what's going on. Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. I still get offended believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? Don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. Why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? No female actorscharacters either? None at all? This had the makings to be another Predator but alas fell far far short. My final comment  poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. Make sure you got a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects  it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway since I love low budget scifi like Dr Who Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell even Outland wasn't a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.The story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems.The effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of Hollywood's offerings.Whilst none of the actors get Oscar material it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much but then they didn't in Predator either which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn.Some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further.A cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 910 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself or one of his mates has written that review? Naughty naughty.I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very very good for a low budget film and some of the acting wasn't that bad either but most of the acting was really awful but well done for trying as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended.

	onyx:emotionText "I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 910 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself or one of his mates has written that review? Naughty naughty.I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very very good for a low budget film and some of the acting wasn't that bad either but most of the acting was really awful but well done for trying as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a 910 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.";

But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TVshow have to do I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you before you haven't seen these guys doing there work can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it.

But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TVshow have to do I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you before you haven't seen these guys doing there work can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it.

I have to say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 19952000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show.

It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts.  Claudio comes across the stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson.  Johnson plays the dastardly Edmund Rackham a man who is able to manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deepsea diving creatures they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Deep by convincing Cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives.Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis Rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures.  Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations.  In one memorable scene Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination.

This Italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo volcanic eruptions mutant fishcreatures the mysterious continent of Atlantis treasurehunting a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists! All this and much more in one simple movie? Yes please! Closeminded opponents of Italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of The Island of Dr. Moreau but the truth is that this is so much more! Island of the Fishmen delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camerawork. The story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners survivors of a shipwreck washing ashore a tropical island. They encounter the sadistic Edmond Rackham who rules over a native tribeand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island's swamps. There are so many twists and additional subplots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but trust me this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercialminded and creative at the same time. He makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive. The staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation. I don't quite understand why Roger Corman reworked the original so much and released it on the American market under a different title Screamers because there are very few elements open for improvement. The cast members are all Sergio Martino regulars with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a neat supportive rule and give away great performances. In case you can get your hands on the recently restored German version you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action. See it!".

During the film's opening at drivein's irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off. So Corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves.

	schema:reviewBody "Note this review pertains to the Americanized version known as Screamers devised by Roger Corman. The balance of the original Italian film Island of the Fishmen was kept and a new prologue written and directed by Miller Drake and featuring Mel Ferrer and Cameron Mitchell was filmed. All in all this movie is great fun. It's pure nonsense but it throws a couple of different ideas into its brew with irresistible results for schlock lovers. We have treasure hunting in two separate eras biological mutations the supposed Lost City of Atlantis and an international cast also including Claudio Cassinelli Barbara Bach Richard Johnson Joseph Cotten and Beryl Cunningham.Cassinelli plays Lt. Claude de Ross a military doctor who's one of a handful of shipwreck survivors. They come across an isolated tropical island populated by Creature from the Black Lagoon type monsters and a number of humans chief among them the dastardly Edmond Rackham the charismatic Mr. Johnson of The Haunting and Zombi 2 his female companion Amanda the stunning Ms. Bach and her scientist father Ernest Mr. Cotten.The additional American footage actually doesn't stick out that much from the Italian film the material was pretty hokey from the start. But it's got tons of atmosphere a whole lot of beautiful scenery some pretty gnarly creature suits and flavourful music composed by Luciano Michelini. The acting in the main story is pretty good with Cassinelli making for a studly hero and Bach as an appealing leading lady. Johnson comes off the best he's one of those villains you actually can't help but like. People such as Mitchell Ferrer and Cotten were clearly hired for name value and don't get to do all that much.If you're like this viewer and are partial to this kind of thing to begin with you should have a fine time watching this.Eight out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Note this review pertains to the Americanized version known as Screamers devised by Roger Corman. The balance of the original Italian film Island of the Fishmen was kept and a new prologue written and directed by Miller Drake and featuring Mel Ferrer and Cameron Mitchell was filmed. All in all this movie is great fun. It's pure nonsense but it throws a couple of different ideas into its brew with irresistible results for schlock lovers. We have treasure hunting in two separate eras biological mutations the supposed Lost City of Atlantis and an international cast also including Claudio Cassinelli Barbara Bach Richard Johnson Joseph Cotten and Beryl Cunningham.Cassinelli plays Lt. Claude de Ross a military doctor who's one of a handful of shipwreck survivors. They come across an isolated tropical island populated by Creature from the Black Lagoon type monsters and a number of humans chief among them the dastardly Edmond Rackham the charismatic Mr. Johnson of The Haunting and Zombi 2 his female companion Amanda the stunning Ms. Bach and her scientist father Ernest Mr. Cotten.The additional American footage actually doesn't stick out that much from the Italian film the material was pretty hokey from the start. But it's got tons of atmosphere a whole lot of beautiful scenery some pretty gnarly creature suits and flavourful music composed by Luciano Michelini.

Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key those last three starring the socalled Queen of Giallo Edwige Fenech girlfriend of Luciano at the time the lucky bastid! I still have not seen the Martinos' 1973 giallo entitled Torso which is supposed to be excellent. But as most of their fans know the brothers often ventured outside of the realm of giallo and with some surprisingly good results if their 1979 effort Island of the Fishmen is any example. Originally released under the Italian title L'isola degli uomini pesce and later with additional gore footage shot here in the States as Screamers the film turns out to be a pleasingly oldfashioned Saturday matinestyle monster bash with a hissable villain in black a hunky good guy dressed in white a beautiful damsel in distress a mad scientist jungle natives bugeyed creatures and an explosive climax. What kidor kid at heartcould ask for more?In the film a prison ship sinks in what the viewer infers to be the Caribbean in the year 1891. Only Lt. Claude de Ross charismatically played by Claudio Cassinelli and a half dozen or so convicts manage to survive their lifeboat washing ashore on a mysterious volcanic island. The men are quickly done in by various island perils poison water staked pitfalls and most especially some lumbering bipedal amphibious creatures! until only the lieutenant and two others remain to encounter the island's HUMAN inhabitants Edmond Rackham who is exploiting the island creatures in furtherance of his own schemes deliciously well played by Richard Johnson who had starred in the scariest movie ever made The Haunting back in '63 as well as Lucio Fulci's cult item Zombie that same year a beautiful young woman who the viewer automatically assumes is his wife Amanda Barbara Bach apparently game for some physical stunts here a halfmad biologist the great Joseph Cotten here cashing a paycheck for perhaps three minutes of overacted screen time and a whole gaggle of voodoopracticing natives who carry out Rackham's every wish. And before long treasure hunting the lost continent of Atlantis and a volcanic blowup has there EVER been a volcano shown in a film that failed to eventually blow up? are all conflated into this truly wild and crazy tropical stew....Island of the Fishmen features surprisingly solid acting from its three leads endearingly cheezy monster effects the fishmen look like something out of an old Outer Limits episode for example the monsters in the 122363 episode entitled Tourist Attraction and a fairly thrilling windup as the titular monsters go on a murderous frenzy when the island tears itself to bits. Sergio's direction is imaginative and stylish as his giallo fans might have expected and the music by Luciano Michelini is by turns lovely and gripping. I don't want to oversell the film which in essence is a somewhat hokey schlockfest but darn it for those of us who love their BEMs bugeyed monsters and their matine material of this ilk the picture should prove a nicely winning diversion. Think Jules Verne's Mysterious Island crossed with H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau and you might start to get an idea of the pulpy fun in store. Further good news regarding the film is that its current DVD incarnation from an outfit apparently called Mya is a nice one with a very decent print on display and proper framing of the film's CinemaScope image. Sadly no subtitles have been provided but a very adequate job of dubbing does serve to compensate. Break out the popcorn sit down with your 8yearold nephew and enjoy!".

And before long treasure hunting the lost continent of Atlantis and a volcanic blowup has there EVER been a volcano shown in a film that failed to eventually blow up? are all conflated into this truly wild and crazy tropical stew....Island of the Fishmen features surprisingly solid acting from its three leads endearingly cheezy monster effects the fishmen look like something out of an old Outer Limits episode for example the monsters in the 122363 episode entitled Tourist Attraction and a fairly thrilling windup as the titular monsters go on a murderous frenzy when the island tears itself to bits. Sergio's direction is imaginative and stylish as his giallo fans might have expected and the music by Luciano Michelini is by turns lovely and gripping. I don't want to oversell the film which in essence is a somewhat hokey schlockfest but darn it for those of us who love their BEMs bugeyed monsters and their matine material of this ilk the picture should prove a nicely winning diversion. Think Jules Verne's Mysterious Island crossed with H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau and you might start to get an idea of the pulpy fun in store. Further good news regarding the film is that its current DVD incarnation from an outfit apparently called Mya is a nice one with a very decent print on display and proper framing of the film's CinemaScope image. Sadly no subtitles have been provided but a very adequate job of dubbing does serve to compensate. Break out the popcorn sit down with your 8yearold nephew and enjoy!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very enjoyable lost island adventure movie. A group of men are shipwrecked on an island ruled by a white master accompanied by an attractive white woman Barbara Bach inhabited by voodoopracticing natives as well as some CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON type fish men. The plot is silly as in most movies of this type the acting and the lines are cheesy in most cases but it is a very polishedlooking effort. The scene of Barbara Bach secretly leaving her manor at dawn or dusk crossing a shallow lake and feeding the fish men a potion on the seashore is especially very poetic looking. The undersea footage of the ruins of Atlantis is also very impressive. One minor defect the voodoo subplot seems to go nowhere. Surely there are elements of THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU in the plot but I think the idea to make this movie was kicked off by previous year's WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS from Britain. By the way I think the man whose inside turned outside tagline in the movie's US publicity refers to the scene of a man in the lab tank who is slowly being mutated towards a fish man.".

	schema:headline " Oldfashioned fantasy adventure from Italy";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all a word of advice  don't buy or watch this thinking of it as a horror film. It most definitely is not despite the best efforts of the American distributors who recut the movie added in an opening sequence complete with graphic gore of men turned inside out put in cameos from genre standbys Mel Ferrer and Cameron Mitchell and gave the film a horrorsounding title. All that aside the film reviewed here is Sergio Martino's original Italian movie which plays it straight as an adventure film in the style of those Doug McClure movies of the mid '70s with slightly rougher edges and a little bit more mild gore than they gave us. Despite being bestknown for his series of aboveaverage gialli in the early '70s Martino is a perfectly capable director who also gave us a handful of adventure and postapocalypse type movies in the late '70s and early '80s.ISLAND OF MUTATIONS begins well enough with a boat of assorted guys floating in the middle of a desolate sea. The film's first problem is apparent  half of the men are dubbed with some of the most appallingly fake British accents you're ever likely to hear making this scene pretty laughable. Thankfully they all die pretty quickly. Soon enough the boat is attacked by some unseen rubbery creature which smashes it on the rocks and washes the men up on the shore of an island somewhere in the Atlantic. After encountering mysterious maneating monsters jungle traps and treacherous lands our sole survivor as played by Claudio Cassinelli then gets to meet the island's various unfriendly inhabitants.These include a tribe of natives a mad scientist on the brink of death a voodoo priestess an evil goldhungry bachelor an army of geneticallymutated fish men an erupting volcano a laboratory of slimy mutations and lots more. The few things that aren't trying to kill Cassinelli include the underwater city of Atlantis quite impressively shown and enhanced by some fine underwater photography and love interest Barbara Bach. The special effects are of the cheapbutcheerful quotient especially those rubbery fish men which you just have to love as they throttle minor cast members and threaten others with their gnashing teeth. Although the plot is somewhat familiar it's helped along by various adventure staples including a man being put in a cell filling with water somebody shinning down a rope over a pool of killer monsters enduring fistfights chases and a number of exploding models.ISLAND OF MUTATIONS isn't an intellectually demanding movie it rather feels like Martino is simply treading water for the first hour and preparing for his denouement. But what a finale it is offering up tons of excitement and neardeath experiences for our heroes. Castwise Cassinelli is a somewhat ineffectual hero who doesn't actually do anything heroic for the first hour but instead just stands around and watch other events playing out. Only in the climax does he get to fight baddies and monsters as a hero should in this type of movie but never with the same cheesy determination as a Doug McClure would. Barbara Bach is the attractive love interest with a partlydeveloped character so that's better than most for a start. Overacting honours go to Richard Johnson who really enjoys himself as the wicked greedy ruthless selfish bad guy plus half a dozen adjectives along those lines while the ancient Joseph Cotten has fun as the atypical mad scientist on the verge of death. Then there's Beryl Cunningham again in a wasted caricature role of a voodoo priestess who doesn't actually do anything and just seems to be there to free Cassinelli from his imminent watery demise and a bit part from an unrecognisable Bobby Rhodes DEMONS as one of Johnson's native servants.Although it seems in retrospect to be aimed at kids or undemanding young adults ISLAND OF MUTATIONS is actually an enjoyable and tight little film done well on what quite clearly is a low budget. Although it has its misses  it repeatedly fails to be scary or chilling when it attempts to be  the hits are more memorable and the film is often exciting and the last thirty minutes are what an action movie should always be  fastpaced and with lots of battles and stuff going on. Despite its predictability this is perfectly enjoyable stuff and great in an oldfashioned way in fact it's nice to see they could make oldfashioned films like these when they wanted to in an era and country most recognised for its sadistic violence and bloodshed in its genre films.".

	schema:headline " A really enjoyable part adventure part horror and part Jules Verne film from Sergio Martino.";
	schema:reviewBody "An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross Claudio Cassinelli. It's night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fishman creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose Franco Iavarone not to drink the water as it will kill him. They both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners Peter Roberto Posse Francois Francesco Mazzeri and Skip Giuseppe Castellano. Francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food he finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn he is killed himself by one of the fishmen. Claude Jose Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they put Francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. Soon after Skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. Now only Claude Jose and Peter are left. They stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. A woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin Barbara Bach is revealed to be Claudes saviour. She tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a Edmund Rackham Richard Johnson and he doesn't like visitors. Claude Jose and Peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding Rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp Peter quickly becomes food for the fishmen. And a Voodoo priestess called Shakira Beryl Cunningham who lives with Rackham performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. The next day Claude and Jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about Rackham and think he is lying to them. Jose rides off on horseback and is lost. Claude is saved from one of the fishmen by Amanda and is again told to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist and Amanda's father named Professor Ernest Marvin Joseph Cotten who he needs to be kept alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet. He is using the fishmen as a means of getting at the lost treasures of Atlantis and needs Amanda and her father to control them. He claims the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep Ernest alive. Later Claude remembers the name Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. Finding Ernest's secret laboratory he discovers Rackham had lied to him and the fishmen aren't descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this film that mixes various genres. The script by Sergio Donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. I must say at this point that I've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's US release by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off I thought it was more than a little distasteful. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a likable hero. The fishmen themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and I've seen worse. Some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again I've again seen a lot worse. There's no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didn't really bother me actually. The photography by Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design by Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very nice looking film. Period costumes props and sets like Rackham's house and Ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment. The lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. I really liked this film and I was entertained throughout it's running time. I'm not sure who I'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres I guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. If you can find a copy give it a go I'm glad I did.".

	onyx:emotionText "An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross Claudio Cassinelli. It's night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fishman creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose Franco Iavarone not to drink the water as it will kill him. They both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners Peter Roberto Posse Francois Francesco Mazzeri and Skip Giuseppe Castellano. Francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food he finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn he is killed himself by one of the fishmen. Claude Jose Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they put Francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. Soon after Skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. Now only Claude Jose and Peter are left. They stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. A woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin Barbara Bach is revealed to be Claudes saviour. She tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a Edmund Rackham Richard Johnson and he doesn't like visitors. Claude Jose and Peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding Rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp Peter quickly becomes food for the fishmen. And a Voodoo priestess called Shakira Beryl Cunningham who lives with Rackham performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. The next day Claude and Jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about Rackham and think he is lying to them. Jose rides off on horseback and is lost. Claude is saved from one of the fishmen by Amanda and is again told to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist and Amanda's father named Professor Ernest Marvin Joseph Cotten who he needs to be kept alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet. He is using the fishmen as a means of getting at the lost treasures of Atlantis and needs Amanda and her father to control them. He claims the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep Ernest alive. Later Claude remembers the name Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. Finding Ernest's secret laboratory he discovers Rackham had lied to him and the fishmen aren't descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this film that mixes various genres. The script by Sergio Donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. I must say at this point that I've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's US release by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off I thought it was more than a little distasteful. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a likable hero. The fishmen themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and I've seen worse. Some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again I've again seen a lot worse. There's no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didn't really bother me actually. The photography by Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design by Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very nice looking film.

	schema:reviewBody "I first read about Sergio Martino's Island of the Fishmen in Chas Balun's '80s book Horror Holocaust where it went by the alternative title of Screamers. Since Balun's book was all about the splatter I immediately added the film to my mental list of must see gore movies but have only recently been able to track down a copy of the film via YouTube. Unfortunately what I had forgotten was that Screamers released by Roger Corman's New World company was a reedited version of Martino's movie with extra footage added to make it more marketable to the US market and that the original version which I had found was virtually bloodfree!The untampered Island of The Fishmen is a formulaic Jules Vernestyle adventure in which a small group of castaways are washed up on an uncharted island where the owner Edmond Rackham Richard Johnson has creating halfmanhalffish mutants in an effort to retrieve a valuable lost treasure from the submerged ruins of Atlantis. There is lots of dreary talking and plenty of unremarkable action but graphic violence is limited to a man having his face clawed and another falling into a trap full of spikes making it far from the gloriously gory epic I had long hoped it would be. The film doesn't even make the most of the presence of Bond beauty Barbara Bach who remains fully clothed throughout unless you count her strip down to Victorian underwear which practically covers her entire body anyway!.Shot in the same tropical locations as Lucio Fulci's Zombie and with atmospheric cinematography from Giancarlo Ferrando Martino's film has the look and feel of many a classic Italian gorefest but remains a remarkably dry affair and while the fishmen themselves are entertaining thanks to their ridiculous design and expressionless faces the film as a whole is a rather tedious affair. I guess I'll just have to satisfy my yearning for excessively gory fishman horror with repeat viewings of Corman's Humanoids Of The Deep 1980at least until I can get my hands on a copy of 'Screamers'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am sure I'm not standing alone when I say that Italian cultfilmmaker Sergio Martino is one of my favorite directors primarily for the brilliant Gialli he made in the early 70s including Lo Stano Vizio Della Signora Wardh The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh 1971 La Coda Dello Scorpione The Scorpion's Tail 1971 Tutti I Colori Del Buio All the Colors of the Dark 1972 I Corpi Presentano Tracce Di Violenzia Carnale Torso 1973 and my personal favorite the masterpiece Il Tuo Vizio  Una Stanza Chiusa E Solo Io N Ho La Chiave Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key 1972. While his Gialli are doubtlessly his most outstanding achievements Martino has been active in many other fields of Italian Cult cinema including the Spaghetti Western Mannaja aka. A Man Called Blade 1977 the Cannibal genre La Montagna Del Dio Cannibale aka. The Mountain of the Cannibal God 1978 or crazy Apocalyptic SciFi Action 2019 Dopo La Caduta Di New York aka. 2019 After the Fall of New York 1983. Or this fantastic little gem. L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce aka. The Island of the Fishmen aka. Screamers of 1979 is a criminally underrated and outrageously entertaining blend of creature feature and island adventure a film of which kind could only come from 70s Italy.The story seems like a crazy mix of the literary models of H.P. Lovecraft hideous mixtures of fish and men H.G. Wells the Island of Lost SoulsIsland of Dr. Moreau influence is undeniable and Jules Verne. Of course a film of the kind especially one with a modest budget like this one is being dismissed as 'cheesy' by the majority of viewers. And it is undeniable that The Island of the Fishmen is a little cheesy however it simply is the epitome for and insanely entertaining film. To be honest I expected this film to be a whole lot cheesier than it actually turned out to be. While the film is cheesy enough to have the certain 'camp' charm the special effects were a lot better than I expected them to be and while the story is maybe a bit farfetched it is exciting from the beginning to the end. After their ship has sunk Lt. Claude De Ross Claudio Cassinelli and a bunch of prisoners strand on a remote island full of lethal traps. The island is ruled by the sinister Mr. Rackham Richard Johnson who lives in a majestic mansion with his native servants and the ravishing young Amanda Barbara Bach. But there is one other species of 'native' islanders Hideous fishmen of superhuman strength...I do not wish to give the best parts away but I can assure that The Island of the Fishmen unites many aspects that should be adored by my fellow cultcinema buffs. Remote islands have always been superb Horror and Adventuresettings. This one includes Voodoo Mutants an insane villain mad sciencefiction ancient subaqueous worlds and mysteries and many other notable elements the most convincing one being the gorgeous Barbara Bach. The performances are better than one would expect in a movie like this one the supporting cast even includes the great Josph Cotten in the role of a brilliant though somewhat naive scientist. The cinematography and settings are very good and as mentioned above the effects are a lot better than I would have expected. Overall The Island of the Fishmen is fantastic entertainment from start to finish and I cannot understand why it has a ridiculously low average rating of 3.510 on IMDb. My only tiny point of criticism is the fact that the lovely Barbara Bach keeps her clothes on for the entire film. What the hell? L'Isola Degli Uomnini Pesce is a film that promises incredible entertainment from start to finish and should be seen by every cultcinema fan. My rating 8.510".

Some of the dialogue is in places pretty sharp but the basic message remains entirely unchanged from World Wide's fifties films.Billy Graham is as usual eloquent while actually saying very little.

The film's other outstanding performance is by a very young Kim Darby whose character  and even her eventual fate  remains strangely undeveloped as if the film's makers decided she was beyond redemption and just discarded her.".

Basil Rathbone so young! is charming and funny with that hint of edge that he could do so well. The twopart scene in which he invites Norma Shearer for a little supper at his apartment and is then verbally rebuffed by the butler only to return to kiss the hem of Norma's garment is priceless. I watched it four times. Basil Rathbone is believable as an English lord in ways that Robert Montgomery in the 1937 version is so painfully not believable. George Barraud as Charles effaces himself effectively in the beginning scenes as the butler and his scenes with Rathbone are not marred by the hint of effeminacy Montgomery brings to his fraternization scenes with the butler when that is not called for in the script. As much as I love William Powell and I think he's the only reason to see the 1937 version he can't manage to efface himself effectively in the beginning scenes as the butler. He's always William Powell. As enjoyable as Powell is when you see George Barraud move from effacement to boldness you really see how it should be done.".

For MGM it was their first talking picture that featured the sound being recorded optically on the film stripas opposed to their previous practice of recording the sound on a separate record. The previous method was a mess as synchronizing the film and music throughout the showing was difficult and the phonograph tended to wear out after only a few uses literally a half dozen or less!. So whether or not this is a great film or as good as the 1937 remake at least it should be remembered for ushering a new era at the studio.Unfortunately while the sound technology was a breakthrough the film's sound was still very antiquated. First with all the early talkies the studio hadn't figured out how to add sound to the finished product. Instead they literally had an orchestra just off camera performing music LIVE as the actors acted! So incidental music is mostly absent from these early films. Second the style and delivery of the dialog in this film is VERY VERY old fashioned. The actors often overannunciated and seldom sounded real. Instead they sounded like stage actorsand very bad ones at that. Third microphones and recording equipment still were very poorand at times particularly when people are talking in the background it's hard to hear what people are saying. Too bad this one isn't closed captioned at least this goes for the version shown on Turner Classic Moviesit would have made enjoying the film a bit easier.As for the plot well it is also VERY old fashioned. The story is pretty much the same as the 1937 remakeand I hated the plot of the remake as well. Too much talking and some amazingly unbelievable plots make this a hard film to enjoy today. After all who would believe that when society people find out one among them is a lying thief that they decide to forgive the person and actually help them financially?!? So this combined with the antiquated sound make for tough viewing. Of interest to film historians and diehard cinemaniacs like me!".

Ms. Shearer is charming and theatrical. In his sound debut Mr. Rathbone makes a good impression despite raccoon eye makeup. Handsome rival George Barraud as Charles is impressively natural and Herbert Bunston as Elton chews into the script. MGM tried a remake in 1937 with Joan Crawford  but it failed to move The Last of Mrs. Cheyney off the stage. The plot has appeared in dozens of other stories.

From first to last he acts as if were emoting on a theater stage rather than a movie sound stage. Of course director Sidney Franklin is also to blame. He should have taken Rathbone aside and told him to tone himself down and there was no need to raise his voice to reach the last row in the dress circle. Fortunately the other actors are not half as bad and all the women are actually very competent. The play itself however is also partly to blame. It's so old hat that we really don't care a hoot whether Norma Shearer is playing Mrs Cheyney as a sneak thief who wants to get away with the loot or as a con artist who has decided to reform. Sidney Franklin's bland uninspired but decidedly stagey direction doesn't help either. Available on an excellent Warner DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last of Mrs. Cheyney The 1929  12 out of 4 The rich British society welcomes Mrs. Cheyney Norma Shearer as one of their own but what they don't realize is that she's actually connected to a group of jewels thieves. THE LAST OF MRS. CHEYNEY was a hit on the stage so it's easy to see why MGM would want to produce it for the screen. It must have done well as the studio would go on and remake it twice including once in 1937 with Joan Crawford. Early film buffs will be interested to know that this was MGM's first talking picture that had the sound actually recorded onto the film instead of the Warner method of recording the sound on a separate disc. That is certainly a historically important thing but it's doubtful very few outside of major film buffs are going to care about that. The finished product is what's going to really make one interested and sadly this is a pretty poor movie all around. You can start with the fact that this is obviously an earlytalkie and we get nonstop dialogue scenes that just go on and on and on to the point where you really do forget what they're talking about. It's as if you're watching the start of the scene and listening to what the characters are saying but within a minute or two you're completely zoned out and this happens quite often. There are some plot points that pop up ever so often but not a single thing is believable and more often than not you just sit there wishing everything would be over with. The performances are all rather bad and that includes Shearer. I haven't seen too many of her pictures but it's clear she had talent but it's also clear that this is perhaps the worst I've seen from her. Her line delivery is extremely bad but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that she was just working with a new system and doing what she could. Often times it seems as if her and the other actors are leaning towards where the mic is just so that the dialogue can get picked up. Basil Rathbone is fair in his part but at the same time his line delivery is quite poor. The supporting players include Hedda Hopper Herbert Bunston and George Barraud but none of them add much. The sound quality isn't the worst that I've heard but at the same time it's easy to tell that this was very early in the game. For the most part the voices are heard just fine but the added sound effects really come off poor and the constant hiss in the track becomes annoying after a while. All of this is just a part of its time but sadly the film itself is just hard to sit through.".

For a title 'a brief history of time' it's rather talks about anything about time at all. The movie forget to add the subtitled in the book in which the movie based on. It should had the subtitled From the Big Bang to Black Holes added to it. A Brief History of Time was supposed to explain a range of subjects in cosmology including the Big Bang black holes and other superstring theory to the nonspecialist thinker but the movie doesn't follow that. Although they share a title the film is a biographical study of Hawking and not a filmed version of the book. While the movie gives a great insight of the life of Hawking and how he end up in the wheelchair. The movie doesn't mix the story of his life with that of his research that well. The theories come out of nowhere like the Big Bang and leaves while we move back to the story of Hawking's personal life then back to another theory and then back to the story. It doesn't seem intertwined. I would rather have the movie address the subject using examples of Hawking's life rather two different subjects trying to share screen time. While the choice of topics is well balanced and gives you an interesting introduction into the modern view of our universe. The movie is a bit outdated with its facts. In particular the introduction of sometimes contradictory models explains how physics works the evolution of ideas. Yes since we live in a static which means a fixed or stationary Multiverse. Space and Time are illusions according to scientific principles. Each of our now's are like a succession of snapshots that we chose with our free will to form probabilities to make our reality. According to Quantum Mechanics nothing at the subatomic scale can really be said to exist until it is observed. Until then particles occupy uncertain superposition states in which they can have simultaneous up and down spins or appear to be in different places at the same time. The mere act of observing somehow appears to nail down a particular state of reality. Because our concept of time means ever thing has to be moving in linear fashion it is very difficult to fathom that time and space are illusions but since science proves that they are illusions everything is static and eternal. Ultimately this documentary postulates the theory that there must have been a beginning of time and the universe but then suggests that perhaps that the universe is indeed eternal in origin without a point of creation in some oval shaped model he showed as opposed to the classic point model where the laws of time and modern science breakdown and the dawn of time. Watch Lawrence Krauss's lecture for a much more completecontemporary cosmological painting. Still an interesting personal perspective of Hawkin's experience but the audio quality is terrible though. The other people sounds like they are speaking through a computer like Hawking. After a while it's get really annoying. Still it was very interesting movie.".

Step by step we are led up a ladder of more amazing concepts. At the same time we are always reminded of the physical struggle of this man how he has more than endured but triumphed.";

The film was pulled 3 days after its release but I happened by chance to be visiting the strip mall where the theater was located on its last day.  I feel very lucky although I wonder how a film of this nature ever made it to the big screen in the first place.I don't recall having heard of Hawking before this film mainly because I was fresh out of high school and carefree at the time.  However I am now well versed in many of his theories and althought I disagree with many of his opinions I still find him to be one of the most amazing individuals of our time.  Simply his willpower is enough to put us all to shame and his cosmic imagination is unfathomable.  A Brief History of Time should be required viewing for anyone with any interests outside of mundane popular culture.  I also recommend it if you are a writer a thinker or an admirer of cosmology.  Anyone can enjoy this film and I hope that you enjoy it as much has I have.  We need more films like this at the theaters!  Please?".

He has contributed more to Science despite his debilitating disease ALS than an able bodied Scientist could only dream of.The film begins by telling of Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student that was recognizably bright. He slacked his way through college and university where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions of his body but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly.Morris discusses how the brilliant mind of Stephen developed from childhood to the present at one point his mother tells how when she was pregnant she prophetically bought a astronomical atlas to read while in the hospital. Hawking himself narrates the timeline of his discoveries while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to befriend the magnificent man. He tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the Universe was expanding similar to how a star would expand. We also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as black holes if this is the casewill the universe not too begin to contract reversing itself until we reach the big crunch? as Hawking puts it. And when the universe does begin to recede will time not reverse? When posed this question I began to think that death may not be the end perhaps one day time will go backwards and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. The universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life. This is what Hawking is telling us everything in the universe recycles itself. This is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions pondering it. This is why i love this film and why isay it is a MUST SEE!!!

These members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed uncomfortably. Mostly their accounts came across as very acted and forcefully directed. The deliberate noninclusion of asked questions manipulates the given information into a very harsh and impersonal format. I do not know who are responsibly for the interviewing but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experience.Overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented.".

	schema:headline " Part Biography  Part Science";
	schema:reviewBody "I confess that I have never read the book of the same name by Stephen Hawking and although I have a broad interest in questions about the origins of the universe I lack the scientific background knowledge and training to really be able to do more than scratch the surface of the subject. Having heard many people over the years speak highly of the book I thought this movie might help me do more than scratch the surface  but it really didn't. In fact the movie in many ways is less about science than it is about Stephen Hawking's life. It's a documentary style biography as opposed to the dramatized biography presented in the 2014 movie The Theory Of Everything. And I have to say that the biography part of this is excellent. One does get a feel for Hawking's life from his childhood really from his birth onward. I've always been something of a fan and admirer of Stephen Hwking  feelings that are enhanced today quite honestly by his willingness to make regular guest appearances on a TV show like The Big Bang Theory. Aside from his TV appearances and his scientific research Hawking is probably best known for being afflicted with ALS in every day terms Lou Gehrig's Disease. What we learn from this movie at least it was speculated by his mother is that it was his ALS diagnosis that really motivated him in his work. Before the disease he was a very bright but often unmotivated young man. Perhaps it was the prospect of having a limited time to live that made him what he is today  at least that seems to be what's suggested here. This is an interesting look at his life  even very inspiring. If Hawking could overcome the challenges he faced and become what he's become how can I complain about my relatively minor inconveniences? So the bio part of this movie is well done.The scientific part of the movie I thought though was a little bit lacking for two reasons  which are a little bit contradictory I confess. First. a lot of what was offered was admittedly over my head. I could be impressed by Hawking's knowledge  but it's kind of like being impressed by anyone who says a lot about things you know little about. I have to accept that he's right because I don't know enough to say he's wrong or even to question his ideas  which as one of the interviewees in the movie said is the very heart of science. But I don't know enough to raise the questions. And yet at the same time and here's the contradictory part while I may not have the knowledge to question what Hawking says or his theories I also felt there was a little bit of a lack of depth to this. We hear a little bit about a lot of his theories  which is maybe all the average scientific lay person can even begin to process but the lack of depth was still noticeable. He raises a lot of intriguing ideas  but they don't seem to come to any real definitive point. Perhaps that's appropriate given his conclusions about the universe having no real singularity and thus no real beginning and the ongoing lack of the infamous theory of everything. I shouldn't be bothered by the lack of depth  because if this had been any deeper it would have been even more inaccessible to me  but somehow I was.Having said that this was an interesting film. If I thought there might have been a lack of depth in the presentation of the science the interviews that were at the heart of it from family members friends and colleagues gave us real depth into Hawking the person. He's is an intriguing even fascinating man. I'm not onside with some of his conclusions. Admittedly as I've confessed my scientific knowledge about the origins of the universe is limited but I still see nothing that was presented here or that I've seen from Hawking since that convinces me that there's no God. His research likely blows holes in some of the creation myths of various religions  but they are of course myths that seek to reveal truth rather than fact and truth and fact are not identical  the former is philosophical the latter is scientific. Even one of his colleagues interviewed in the movie acknowledged that he personally believed that the universe has a purpose  which is a philosophical and potentially even theological statement. As a person of faith I've always found that science which I'm fascinated with deepens faith rather than detracts from it.In any event this movie was one that I found thought provoking. Perhaps not without its weaknesses  but definitely thoughtprovoking. 710".

The distillation of scientific information is a tricky process and I don't envy the film makers for tackling this project because it must have been a real challenge to formulate and codify in an emotional vein Hawking's writings.The film makers chose to portray the man in a hope of getting people to connect emotionally with his ideas and in this way better understand what it is he discovered about the universe and where such information might take us. I think this angle of attack partially successful but perhaps lacking in the more mathematical underpinnings of Hawking's theories. But that's just the way things are. Unlike Sagan whose purpose with his films was to explain how science itself works and the history behind the molding of the scientific process we have Hawking's theory on essentially everything. Why the universe seems to go in one direction in terms of what we call Time and why things don't operate differently. Such a topic requires more of a sharper focus on the math and how that math describes the physical world. That's a tall order and it's one the film maker's adroitly side step in this piece.Still I enjoyed the film for what it is and I truly hope to own a copy on DVD someday. Until then I'll have to look to my old VHS for a night's entertainment on Hawking's theory of life the universe... and EVERYTHING! with a nod to Douglas Adams.Take if for what it is an emotional retrospective on the genius that is Stephen Hawking.Enjoy.

Perhaps I didn't know enough about Hawking going in I always knew him as 'that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you know' that he is British that he was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus.According to Errol Morris's equally curious and coolly visually dazzling portrait in A Brief History of Time Hawking was already brilliant in spurts when other Oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations he answered more than three times the amount in an hour's time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists he bounced back with his own. Beneath some of the complex scientific talk and if you got any less than a B in astronomy like me you'll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of time's possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole there's a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday.Morris captures Hawking just right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account Einstein and time. But he also captures the backstory on the man and his condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. Too much talk about the cosmos would make one's head hurt and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on bestseller lists for over five years.Almost in spite of his appearance Hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which he observes he won't be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another 10 billion years from now. Through it all in A Brief History of Time we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility not to mention his colleagues and family's' ten cents here and there through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.".

But she's a loose living girl and that kid certainly cramps her style. Veda Ann never fails to steal a film no matter how brief her brassy part is.The Boy Scouts have undergone a lot of change since Mister Scoutmaster was in theaters.

The book if you can find it is an excellent read and offers profound insight into the life of a scoutmaster.

I thought the dialogue could have been a bit sharper  even in the British version which is 15 minutes shorter than that released in the U.S.A. I suspected that the deletions were made from the opening sequences and that everything dealing with the TV program Spectrum was also cut. Now that I've seen the complete version I'm not so sure. The only addition I noticed was a singingaroundthecampfire sequence. There was still no sign of the TV material  an absence that makes the whole point of the movie rather like tilting at imaginary windmills.

But as such things happen the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of Boy Scouts and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER' ... in the host so Jordan he takes the position.Problem solved RIGHT ???WRONG !!! This being a movie there are other problems.For example it turns out one of the Scouts is the son of his boss at the TV station which causes a little friction especially since the kid is overweight has asthma as well as an attitude.And he is the more reasonable one.Also there is this Cub Scout Mike George Winslow who wants to hang around being the 'stray puppy' type.As it turns out the reason is that he has no folks of his own but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him.It is things like this that makes his job harder than expected. All in all Webb becomes more understanding of kids and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson and eventually even adopts Mike.Still a great movie after all these years.".

The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition the viewer is presented with numerous hamhanded references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as overreverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age. However once you've heard it you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Unfortunately he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. Still Clifton Webb in the traditional broadbrimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.".

Trying not to think about her problems Kristen goes away for the weekend with Jason and a group of their friends.

Surprisingly she does quite well as Kristen a spoiled richbtch who suddenly finds herself dirtpoor but with a conniving streak and a twist of fate that will possibly change her fortunes back around.  The twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard Robin Dunne a sociallyradical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning 23 million on a lottery ticket.  Now put Richard Kristen her jockboyfriend Jason Wade Carpenter and their camcorderobsessed mutual buddy Graham Dave McGowan together for the weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by storms and just guess what unfolds.The film suffers from congesting both the story and characters'personas and motives too much.  Everyone is pretty onedimensional and it doesn't take a rocketscientist to figure out that some things and some people are going to go very bad very quickly.  I don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more.  The acting is OK McKeon is spoton as the manipulative female lead and Dunne is very good perhaps a little too good at times but no one else is worth writing home about.  The only other real credit I can give the film is the one twist I didn't see coming towards the end not the very end though that one is so obvious it hurts.  Regardless I sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so I can't say it was a complete writeoff.  410.  A somethingtowatchwhennothingelseison type movie.".

The Man with the Golden Arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society an eyeopener to a Southern country boy in 1955 when I first viewed this film in the theater. After some serious consideration about being too young I was allowed to go. It was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp painful moments of the soul stripped naked.  As a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being it succeeds.Filled with angst Frank Sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He conveys his helplessness and ineffectualness in a beautifully restrained performance. As a voice of common sense in the deadend urban jungle Kim Novak as Molly is quite good. She is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground.  The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good.  Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well.  Eleanor Parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic Zosch the crippled wife of Sinatra.  Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. Regarded as pitiful and despicable his character Sparrow provides tart comedic moments.  The music is almost the star of this filmbrooding frenetic moody poignant. Elmer Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually. I know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one.".

But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.First Bob Strauss who wants him back dealing especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back. Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all just to keep him around.Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that Marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken.Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler.

It was the first Grownup film that made me realize there was more to cinema than just SciFiHorror Westerns and Kids' movies!

The MPAA Motion Picture Association of America refused to give its seal of approval to GOLDEN ARM forcing ProducerDirector Otto Preminger and Distributor United Artists to release it without the MPAA's seal. This of course contributed greatly to both the films commercial and critical success! It also opened the door to new ways of making distributing and classifying films.Before my recent third viewing I had only seen it once at age 8 mentioned above and again in my late teens Perhaps the 10th Anniversary ReRelease?.

The acting Bernstein music photography and editing all contribute to the mood of the movie precisely as Otto Preminger intended! The scene where MachineSinatra undergoes withdrawal pains is still unbelievably hardhitting today.In general Sinatra's performance is quite surprising. His Oscar nomination was very well deserved.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story.  I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol' Blue Eyes.  However I've never seen any of his movies.  So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing.  Well...it was!  I was blown away by his performance in this movie!  He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band.  Otto Preminger's direction is great as well.  I haven't seen any of his other movies.  I read his biography on the IMDB.  He seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood and people had conflicted thoughts about him.  Seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts.  I haven't seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant but now I'm curious.  I want to see more of his films because judging by his attempt with The Man with the Golden Arm this guy has talent.  I also loved the music for this movie.  The score definitely contains the kind of music that I'll remember if I ever happen to hear it again.  That's when you know you have a great score.The supporting performances are fine as well including Darren McGavin as the local drug pusher Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wheelchairbound wife and Kim Novak as his lover.  It's interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream.  Back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level. There's only one scene where Frankie is actually getting heroin injected into his arm and they showed a closeup of the reaction of his face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into his veins.  But it delivered its message without making it feel watereddown.  In a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you don't need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued. The Man with the Golden Arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out.  It really is an amazing piece of work!My score  8 out of 10".

I haven't seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant but now I'm curious.  I want to see more of his films because judging by his attempt with The Man with the Golden Arm this guy has talent.  I also loved the music for this movie.  The score definitely contains the kind of music that I'll remember if I ever happen to hear it again.  That's when you know you have a great score.The supporting performances are fine as well including Darren McGavin as the local drug pusher Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wheelchairbound wife and Kim Novak as his lover.  It's interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream.  Back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level. There's only one scene where Frankie is actually getting heroin injected into his arm and they showed a closeup of the reaction of his face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into his veins.  But it delivered its message without making it feel watereddown.  In a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you don't need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued. The Man with the Golden Arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out.  It really is an amazing piece of work!My score  8 out of 10";

The film ends up being just as much about moving on from the past as it does about drug addiction. Sinatra's junky is a bit amorphous we never really learn whether he grew up here or what led him to his addictions. However the story is strong and told with a nice brisk pace. There are some real memorable moments the Gamblingsequence Frankie coming off smack etc. Preminger's direction is great some subtle camera work adds a lot to a number of scenes.

	schema:reviewBody " Spoiler in fifth paragraph  This was an amazingly frank uhhuh uhhuh picture for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took a chance by making it the Motion Picture Association of America balked at certifying a film that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringe full of heroin into his arm. Frank Sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as he'd ever done. All in all these gambles paid off the movie is a classic though it's not perfect.Nelson Algren's novel may be great but it has far too much going on to fit comfortably into a two hour movie 'The Man with the Golden Arm' is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However in my opinion it's not just Frankie Machine Sinatra that makes the film but the other characters and their subplots all involving Frankie. Ultimately it's not just Frankie who has the addiction everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it keenly. When the pressure gets to be too much the drums start pounding on the soundtrack and Frankie steps across the street with his welldressed friend Louie.It's an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's music career was ever really in the doldrums but in the early 50's he was in limbo between his days touring with big bands and the Las Vegas era. 'From Here to Eternity' established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer rebounded as well but 'The Man with the Golden Arm' was still a significant challenge the whole show sinks or swims with his performance. He pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time I forgot I was watching Frank Sinatra he must have known junky musicians and exploited that knowledge to the utmost.Set side by side with Billy Wilder's masterpiece 'The Lost Weekend' there is more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in 'The Man with the Golden Arm.' Whereas Don Birnem Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend' seems to struggle mostly against himself Frankie Machine is beset by external forces and he takes refuge in the needle. Neither approach is wholly right or wrong mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain but it seems like this film might have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's internal struggle. Spoiler  One of the problems I have with this film is the clichd reliance on quitting cold turkey. I realize that 'The Man with the Golden Arm' was probably setting the trend rather than following it but that doesn't make it any better. In the beginning of the movie Frankie has to all appearances kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some sort. Naturally the drama of the film requires that he backslide but I found the AllAmerican ideal that a man has to face his problems alone or maybe with the help of a good woman out of place here. Going cold turkey and riding off into the sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar but in my opinion was a little less rosy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic and in some respects the message the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's nowhere near a great film but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch if you can get through it anyway besides the point but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives. He expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician. But he has his crippled wife Zosch who can't work and needs money and often complains and then there's the old neighborhood he can't escape seeing Louie Darren McGavin who is still doing backroom card games and yes pushing dope. Like Mean Streets it's hard to escape the minutia unless you leave.But then again it's hard for Frankie Machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter. It's just that he can't escape the temptation of junk when he's booked on a phony theft charge with his friend he sees a junkie freaking out and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self. And personifying Frankie is Sinatra and I can't see anyone else who could've played him even original choice Brando. He fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game. But there's also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see him going 'cold turkey' in Molly's apartment it's believable even if it's not the kind of thing those from 'my' generation would think of heroin i.e. Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream. If for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character.The flaws however come in some of the other performances though it's a little tricky. Eleanor Parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie fooling Frankie that she's really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer as it goes along she's supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better. Meanwhile Kim Novak is good though not Vertigoworthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story. Then there's a Detective Bendar who might be one of the most onenote charactersperformances ever. And also Sparrow Frankie's nerdy friend and the characters of Louie and Schiefka and they're all played as one might expect them to actually McGavin is better than OK. As far as casting other talent around Sinatra Preminger doesn't do all that great. And frankly some scenes kind of fall flat.But there's a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest. It works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy. It's a genuine article just not exceptional.".

But there's also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see him going 'cold turkey' in Molly's apartment it's believable even if it's not the kind of thing those from 'my' generation would think of heroin i.e. Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream. If for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character.The flaws however come in some of the other performances though it's a little tricky. Eleanor Parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie fooling Frankie that she's really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer as it goes along she's supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better. Meanwhile Kim Novak is good though not Vertigoworthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story. Then there's a Detective Bendar who might be one of the most onenote charactersperformances ever. And also Sparrow Frankie's nerdy friend and the characters of Louie and Schiefka and they're all played as one might expect them to actually McGavin is better than OK. As far as casting other talent around Sinatra Preminger doesn't do all that great. And frankly some scenes kind of fall flat.But there's a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest. It works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy. It's a genuine article just not exceptional.";

Unaware that a wheelchair makes her stock nearly worthless in a 1950's slum she's also the world's biggest most neurotic drag. It's really sad that filmnoir gave way to this unsubtle overproduced schlock.All that and an overpresent Elmer Bernstein score that leaves no room for the characters to breathe.

Perhaps it was Sinatra notoriously antsy when it came to being too far away from Hollywood or Vegas who insisted that Preminger shoot the story on those phony soundstage interiors which passed once for real city streets. Sam Leavitt the cinematographer seems to have overlit many of these studio sets as if he was afraid of being too dark and depressing. Another minus but much lauded in its time is Elmer Bernstein's heavy handed bigband score which often only punctuates what is obvious. Sinatra really tries working hard committed to making the role seem both real and sympathetic. The primary failure of this film can only be blamed on that most vastly overrated of directors Otto Preminger whose gift for selfpromotion and controversy can no longer disguise the fact that at heart he was a rather mediocre director.

THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM sees Frank Sinatra playing an excon who works as a dealer in illegal card games but dreams of becoming a famous musician. Unfortunately he's also a former heroin addict who must attempt to resist the temptation of another fix.This kind of story tends to write itself and indeed there aren't many surprises in the narrative. Sinatra is adequate as the lead but I found his character rather underwritten and difficult to warm to. He has a lot of negative qualities but few genuinely likable elements to his personality. Still with a plotdriven film such as this such lightness of characterisation is easy to overlook when the rest of the plot ingredients are so interesting.The supporting characters are enlivened by some actors giving very good performances. Particularly fine are Kim Novak in a dry run for VERTIGO as the object of Sinatra's obsession and Darren McGavin THE NIGHT STALKER in an early part as a completely amoral drug dealer. My favourite character is the morally murky Eleanor Parker playing Sinatra's wife who has a few hidden secrets of her own she gets all of the best scenes and is involved in the dark heart of the movie. The setpiece in which Sinatra attempts to kick the habit is dramatic but Hackman had it beat in THE FRENCH CONNECTION 2.

	schema:reviewBody "A strungout junkie Frank Sinatra deals with daily demoralizing drug addiction while crippled wife Eleanor Parker and card sharks continue to pull him down.While this is not the first film to deal with drugs it is probably the first to deal with them in a very serious manner. Reefer Madness and Cocaine Fiends for example can be written off as humorous nostalgia. This film on the other hand is decades ahead of Trainspotting and Requiem For a Dream. Did you even know heroin addiction was prominent in the 1950s? Variety called the film a gripping fascinating film expertly produced and directed and performed with marked conviction by Frank Sinatra as the drug slave. I agree for the most part though I really did not enjoy Sinatra's acting as much as many others did I think. Otto Preminger is a firstrate director and I hope this film gets the respect it deserves over the long run I found the 50th anniversary release to be not nearly cleaned up enough.While the focus is heroin and addiction one could also make a case about this film being about love. Frankie's wife brings him down encourages him to go back to his old habits turns him away from his dreams. Molly Kim Novak does just the opposite. Divorce and adultery are hardly ever positive topics but in this film you almost hope that Frankie goes that route.".

And considering this was his first feature film he was the 2nd Unit Director on Highlander he makes this film look like he's been directing for years!Peter Levy's cinematography is BRILLIANT! He's still in my opionion one of the BEST cinematographers in the world! I'll see anything that Peter Levy is the DP on.So if you're in the mood for a Die Hardish kind of film  that looks good and has a lot of tension this is the movie to see. It's a very underrated thriller that didn't get too much attention in US it's an Australian film.".

The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes facetoface with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet does nothing serious quite often. There was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story and may've worked better if say for example the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid...although granted even that is clichd.What a shame too that it could not have been a better thriller considering a funky cast of young Australian characters. Even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture. Instead it started out fresh and sure did have plenty of action sequences but wound up verging on the ridiculous.".

You can't help but think the film's craftsmanship caught the eyes of the Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child producers for them to hand him the gig. Watching his debut feature I can see why they did.This gripping little homegrown suspensethriller with a few offbeat strokes uses a very familiar setup Unistudents in a department store after hours being stalked by a mentally disturbed individual a police patrolman  with an axe to grind and no not literally. Don't go looking for a body count let alone slasher as its slow rhythm virtually plays out in a longwinded cat and mouse concept. What starts harmless turns into damage control when the harassment leads to something fatal.The premise is straightforward and fairly slight on the exposition with an inkling of dementia from an antagonist with more than a few loose screws but it's Hopkins' stylised direction and camerawork leaving quite the lasting impression. By the end the plot simply eroded into a canvas of see what sticks. Its use of imagery and a fruitful principal performance an excellent Steven Gries is where the excitement mainly lies. Visuals show creative flair in camera positioning as if it's on a string alongside hue lighting and slowmotion. Nothing quite like the firepower of a shotgun and not just one captured in slowmotion. The colouring on screen at times can be vibrant  definitely the toy section sequence and some tension infused setpieces anyone for dominoes or rooftop stroll? are spectacularly presented for such a minor lowbudget production.I would love to see this film get a restored bluray release in the near future as I think it would scrub up rather well.".

Well it takes a few things a decent concept some really good dialogue and as always some barnstorming acting. With every thriller you have to have a really good villain and not since Inseminoid has Stephen Grives had the chance to exercise his acting chops but equipped with some exceptional dialogue his freak out speech when he toys with Marcus Graham's character Jack and that of Kathryn when he realises that they have never seen a dead body before just rocks! When I had the movie in my collection I always had to rewind that one scene just to hear every line of dialogue.What of the rest of the cast yes it's true that Grives is the star of the show as the Irish cop working down under but the young cast more than hold their respective own Miles BuchananBliss as the computer nerd who holds a serious torch for ZiggySandy Lillingston and Marcus Graham who for the majority of the movie is the main aim of psycho cop Murphy psychotic attentions.Whilst not a very bloody movie it does deliver the Medusa Home Video cover was always the coolest and whilst this movie has all but fell beneath the radar if you can find it check it out and get ready to experience antipodean horror in your life.Ps the ending promised a sequel thankfully such a thing never materialised.A Dangerous but very true 10 out of 10 for this lost little Australian gem".

When I had the movie in my collection I always had to rewind that one scene just to hear every line of dialogue.What of the rest of the cast yes it's true that Grives is the star of the show as the Irish cop working down under but the young cast more than hold their respective own Miles BuchananBliss as the computer nerd who holds a serious torch for ZiggySandy Lillingston and Marcus Graham who for the majority of the movie is the main aim of psycho cop Murphy psychotic attentions.Whilst not a very bloody movie it does deliver the Medusa Home Video cover was always the coolest and whilst this movie has all but fell beneath the radar if you can find it check it out and get ready to experience antipodean horror in your life.Ps the ending promised a sequel thankfully such a thing never materialised.A Dangerous but very true 10 out of 10 for this lost little Australian gem";

The thing with Sheperd is that the whole set up is great A postapocalyptic underground world where religious factions fight for the mind and souls of the populace? That sounds great doesn't it?In the hands of say Enzo Castellari or Joe D'Amato this would have been a great film and although the film is full of nice quirks and strange characters the film just seems to meander along and regularly falls into clich. On the quirky side you've got Roddy Piper as a messiah type leader and truth be told he's good in this David Carradine as a John Wayne impersonating crazy ventriloquist also good and various scantily clad women but the action is terribly filmed and the story is just what you would expect. C Thomas Howell Nursie just doesn't cut it for me as an action hero. His beard reminded me a Gary Bushell of all people. I suppose with more to do he would have been more acceptable but he just runs from one scene to the other with a chick and her kid in tow.You see Thomas Howell our hero is a Shepherd who kills other religious leaders on behalf of Piper but balks at a hit and has some guys sent after him one of which was his old cop buddy with a secret. His hit turns out to be another Shepherd with a kid whom our hero takes a fancy to as his wife and kid were murdered by someone or other. Did I mention that Howell does all this so he can watch his past through sunglasses? If you want to see Carradine acting really strange or Piper carrying a cross then this film has that but if you want a film where you can guess the ending except for the head scratching motives of the excop buddy then well I guess this film has that too. It's remarkably unremarkable.".

In many ways it was ahead of it's time and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several betterknown films Copied by many equaled by none this truly is one great movie.The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a postapocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns. C. Thomas Howell is a Shepherd' one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society. The whole idea made me think about our society. It's really a brilliant social commentary which is more than I can say for certain recent scifiaction blockbusters. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS didn't make one feel that any real innovation was taking place just dull videogame effects. But SHEPHERD scores on the action scale too...Not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath. Peter Hayman proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors. We're talking 100 high grade down home kung fu fighting! It was excellent. Really good special effects shootouts bleakfuturistic cyberpunk noir style the film really has its own elements.When talking about SHEPHERD it's impossible not to mention how much style it has. The vision of this city is really stunning. It recalls images of Tim Burton's very memorable vision of Gotham in BATMAN. And these sights are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that puts Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall to shame. Even the special effects proved amazing. Doubtless the scenes where fighting occurs are landmarks in all of filmmaking. This movie is a ballet of awesome visual display.Still at the base of it all there lies an interesting story carried through by a strong cast. The acting especially Rowdy Piper and the plot are both great and excellently directed. In contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit. I'm always proud to see a great film like SHEPHERD come along. It's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office. It's a rarity worth searching for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler for having seen it!".

He was an up and coming star in the 1980s  with hits such as Soul Man also. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in Hollywood. Put it this way  Tom Cruise had a bit part in The Outsiders while Howell had the lead. Look at Cruise today !!! But picking material like this drivel will only denegrate Howell's career even more  if that was possible. Why does he pick stuff like this? A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish. Essentially the story here takes place in a postapocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a Shepherd  protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables. He's a hitman in other words. The sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode. The use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity. Oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too. I hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which I really like the star  but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it. I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie. In short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film. It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell. Come on C  give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these nonhit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part  however small.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of C Thomas Howell's career ever since The Outsiders and The Hitcher. He was an up and coming star in the 1980s  with hits such as Soul Man also. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in Hollywood. Put it this way  Tom Cruise had a bit part in The Outsiders while Howell had the lead. Look at Cruise today !!! But picking material like this drivel will only denigrate Howell's career even more  if that was possible. Why does he pick stuff like this? A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish.Essentially the story here takes place in a postapocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a Shepherd  protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables. He's a hitman in other words.The sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode. The use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity. Oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too.I hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which I really like the star  but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it. I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.In short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film. It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell. Come on C  give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these nonhit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part  however small.110  and only because there is no setting for 010.".

Roddy Piper is entertaining as a religious cult leader but his appearances in the movie are sporadic and he doesn't interact with the other lead stars at all during the movie.The overall production however is very impressive on such a shoestring budget. The set design could give bigger movies of the time a run for their money and David Carradine is also delightfully deranged as the creepy ventriloquist.This could have been a much more successful movie with some tweaks here and there but as it stands its still a good point of interest for a 90's low budget retro fix.".

Great wars were waged on land which have driven the survivors underground. Now a handful of crazy religions are fighting it out down there. Roddy Piper plays the major villain a Christian preacher who is sick of losing ground to a cult of women under the watch of Sophia Marina Anderson. Howell is tasked with assassinating a member of her cult Heidi von Palleske but she and her son remind him of his dead family so he saves her and tries to keep her from other assassins instead. Oh and David Carradine is along for the ride as a ventriloquist.

That's because despite having a low budget the movie's computer special effects sets and props were a lot better than you usually get in a Corman movie. However the movie soon collapsed in my eyes. The story is pretty incomprehensible at times and it was hard to get interested in the characters' plight at times. The action is also not that special coming across as dull and badly edited at times. Howell does try hard even taking off his clothes in one scene but we didn't need to see that. If you're a fan of Carradine be warned  his appearance lasts less than five minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying. My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frillygirly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover she's always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioning.These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person. Yes what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. For such a promising premise better executed in a film like Different For Girls the final film is a letdown.".

In truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioning.These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte a very complex character full of energy selfloathing desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with malefemale characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person. Yes what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. For such a promising premise better executed in a film like Different For Girls the final film is a letdown.";

The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter.The second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is irrespective of gender. So would you still love your partner if heshe were to change hisher sex? The movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one.But there is one point where the movie fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. That what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end. But watch it and post your thoughts on it here.......".

It shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. It has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show. Clips from both of Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show. If you were a South Park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made. Now obviously the show has changed but this is still interesting.What we have here is an amusing documentary where Trey Parker especially and Matt Stone come off as arrogant jerks and that's exactly what they wanted to come off as.

It was funny when I saw it in the commercials but I was used to seeing it by the time I saw the actual documentary.Overall Goin' Down to South Park is a fairly funny and interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and of the series' history going back to when Matt and Trey came up with the idea in college.  However there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing.  It's not as fastpaced rapidfire and as lively as the actual South Park episodes.  Instead it kind of has a slow drywit style which at times can be funny but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen.  If you get the chance to watch it by all means go for it but I don't think you're really missing much if you never see it.My IMDb Rating 710".

As with the spaghetti westerns the lone gunman enters into a town where the people have lost the will to fight back and proceeds to kill off the bad guys singlehandedly. But once he is outnumbered totally and wounded some do find the capability to fight back. Chief of those who try to aid him is a widow Stacie Foster with a young son. Brion James plays the general in charge of the marauders.";

Even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in Mad Max is there.That guy from Blade Runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie.Favourite bit  for me the punchup on top of the oil refinery  if you look closely you can see the postapocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other.Get several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel.".

At first my suspicions seemed justified the typical trailer which revealed most of the plot and action setpieces was present and correct and the opening to the film was fairly cheesy. But as it continued something occurred to me Steel Frontier isn't that bad. Although it's not particularly groundbreaking in any way it's obvious that this film has a fairly big budget due to the amount of explosions on show here and it's these combined with the fairly nonstop action which give this film a fast pace which puts it ahead of many of its rivals. The acting on display is fairly competent too and the presence of B movie icon Brion James in particular adds to Steel Frontier's credibility. All in all this is a film which won't particularly stick in the memory but is a great way to pass the odd hour or two  kind of the film that wouldn't be out of place on late night scifi channel for instance.".

In this movie the hero is even more blatantly a Savior than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeoplea pretty transparent reference to a Second Coming. I watched the movie on a hot humid morning. Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 430 am there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertaining...at least at 430 in the morning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steel Frontier brings us to a stereotypical postapocalyptic future of sorts. It conjures up a man without a name or title Joe Lara beyond that of a drifter similar to Clint Eastwood's versions. A gunwielding vagabond on a spiffy motorcycle who facially resembles Jesus Christ wandering through a toxic wasteland of society reduced to rubble and sand. At first glimpse he finds a dying man with both legs torn off left to die in the middle of desert. This dying man pleads to the stranger to quickly end his life as the stranger ponders over him for a few brief moments and decides...As the film's introduction continues a recovering town by the name of New Hope shows a community of people ambitiously moving around tires which now are being used as a natural resource film does not elaborate on that it does not really need to in the given context as a harbinger of MadMax styled vehicles seemingly gang members approach the timid town of citizens.Once the vehicles arrive we start to see all sorts of random oddballs armed with rifles and pistols step out of the vehicle and ensure their grandiose of chaos on these innocent people while the supposed leader of the outfit General J.W. Quantrell Brion James casually enters into a barber shop with a rather frightened barber.The town's police force enters the scene and is obliterated in mere minutes. After the General's done with his shave in the barber shop he comes out to proclaim the town as a self designated military outpost under the United Regime. Later we see him discussing plans for new leadership for the town as he dresses down the cowardly Mayor Kissmich Quinn Morrison who was nowhere to be found during the siege. The General appoints his son as the 1 leadership of the town a little to the chagrin of Ackett Bo Svenson.A few of the town's henchmen ride out onto the dusty roads to find runaways and more or less runs into their possible Grim Reaper...the longhaired vagabond on the motorcycle. The henchmen taken by surprise to find someone crazy enough to be hanging out in such dangerous and desolate desert all by themselves with no care in a doomed world. One can observe fairly quickly that stranger is very much toying and play childish games with them. A stereotypical but yet very excellent choreographed action car chase takes place. The stranger slips up... or does he? He enters the town as a man that no one has seen before and the chaos really hits up. The film borrows elements from The Man with No Name and the Mad Max series but it holds its own water very well. The ending actually turns out be a bit of surprise and kind of ironic ... not quite as it seemed at the beginning of the film. The action scenes remain topnotch and exhilarating as usual like with most PM action produced films. The characters are actually wellwritten for what most would consider to be a runofthemill Bmovie.".

One day a band of marauders known as The Deathriders roll into town. Through violent tactics they sack the town of New Hope and institute J.W. Quantrell James as leader. Quantrell then makes his son Julius Victor Mayor. Their plan is to institute what they call the United Regime. But a savior arrives in the form of a gunfighter named Yuma Lara. He pits various factions against each other not forgetting about Bo Svenson as Ackett Kane Hodder as Kinton and Brian Huckeba as the immortal and showstealing Chickenboy. Yuma attempts to save the lives of Sarah Foster and her young son as she is a widow trying to make it in this tough world. But there are many pitfalls along the way not the least of which are desertdwelling cannibals named Roach Eaters. Will Yuma save the day and ride off into the sunset?PM attempts to marry two genres here the postapocalyptic actioner in the vein of the Mad Max series but perfected by the Italians and the Spaghetti Western started and perfected by the Italians with generally entertaining results. Like in the Italian postap's cars have wacky contraptions glued to them and people wear wacky outfits. But because this is a PM it has much more action than the usual slog. There's pretty much nonstop shooting chases stunts fights and blowups. There's even minimal dialogue at the outset of the movie telling the story mainly visually which is difficult to do. But this is a PM synthesis of Yojimbo 1961 hence For A Fistful of Dollars 1964 and For A Few Dollars More 1965 and any number of Clint Eastwood's 60's70's output  including a bus chase reminiscent of The Gauntlet 1977 along with a futuristic twist. So you get what's going on here.Even the name Steel Frontier indicates what you're in for Steel indicating the future and Frontier indicating the Western. There's also some biblical symbolism worked into the storyline a lot of which revolves around Joe Lara looking especially like Jesus this time around. He puts in an especially charming performance  this really is Lara at his absolute best. A location in the movie is even reminiscent of fellow Lara vehicle American Cyborg Steel Warrior 1993. Maybe he lives in that industrial wasteland for real. You know Kane Hodder because he wears a hat with a Jason logo on it and the guy who plays Julius has orange hair making him naturally Orange Julius. Svenson puts in a standard performance. Brion James should have been more involved.Because there is terminology such as The Drylands and the tire farmers are derisively known as tire suckers this would seem to be PM's Neon City 1991. But Steel Frontier is far better than that movie. To see PM's take on not one but two classic genres together in one film don't hesitate to see Steel Frontier.

Falon's new partner senses that he's anything but interested in finding Winch's killer and slowly puts two and two together. The two dirty cops Holloway  Orlaski trying to cover up their role in both Levinson murder whom they killed fearing that he's about to turn evidence on them as well as their drug dealings. The two crooked cops set up excon Jerome Johnson Perry Moore by breaking into his apartment and planting drugs there and then to make it look like a drug hit brutally murdering him and his wife! This happens right in front of the couples two year old son in one of the most shocking and sickening murders scenes ever put in a movie.Not satisfied with killing Levinson and Johnson together with his wife Holloway and Orlanski get to Falon's girlfriend Sally who was a junkie and being supplied with her drugs by the late Det. Levinson. The two corrupt cops stick a needle in Sally's arm forcing her to overdose not realizing by sticking the needle in her left arm that she's lefthanded! Which would make it physically impossible and which also alerts Falon who finds her body that Sally was in fact murdered and didn't kill herself voluntary or by accident.Falon begins to come to his senses when he's later approached at his old watering hole by Holloway and Orlanski and asked to join them in their drug dealing operation. Falon angrily refuses but now he knows that like his partner the late Sam Levinson that he knows too much and is now a marked man. Meanwhile Det. Murrow now a lot smarter and wiser by getting to know what his partner Falon is all about confronts Falon about Winch's death only to get knocked out and cuffed to a sink at the bar that Falon was at. With Falon now smashed from his drinking but with a full head of steam goes outside to meet Holloway and Orlanski knowing that no matter what happens he'll end up on the losing end.Tough and uncompromising movie about police corruption with Sam Elliott as the old veteran who thinks he's seen and knows everything about crime and police work but has a lot to learn. Still he overlooks his partners Det. Levinson whom he worked with for 20 years secret life as a drug dealer that not only leads to him murdering an innocent man but ending up being killed himself.".

The internal and external stories are firmly linked but the movie's emphasis is on the wrong half of the combination.The best scene comes when Elliott has a tense strained dinner with Morales and his wife the excellent Jessica Steen who matches Elliott line for line expression for expression. The worst scene comes when Elliott later visits Steen's residence and offers her an apology of sorts. Even Elliott can't make us buy this outofcharacter moment.Sam Elliott seems to have a tendency toward physical exhibitionism. Remember his gratuitous nude scene in The Legacy? Here we see him barechested in bed when he answers a latenight phone call. There's no need for beefcake in this scene but it gives Elliott yet another chance to show off his lean hairy torso  never touched by a razor  and even at age 51 this torso still looks mighty good.Elliott also deserves notice for the scene in which he delivers a kick to a man's crotch. You can almost hear the testicles squish. His aim is perfect and his kicking style would do a Rockette proud.".

Despite its bad wrap although it does have its fans mostly modernday setting and rather goofy tone it still remains quite a competently enjoyable good and evil swordandsorcery comic strip venture. For most part it seems to be playing for laughs sometimes intentional other times not and the fish out water novelty Dar trying to stop Arklon getting his hands on a dangerous weapon while in Los Angeles has its amusing moments. The tone and style had me thinking of another swordandsorcery caper with a very tongueincheek approach Deathstalker II and no surprises why as Jim Wynorski had a part in both screenplays. Dialogues are risible but there are few humorous injokes within and the direction is constantly spirited. The performances are fairly animated almost mocklike. Bryan Singer returns as Dar the Beastmaster. Bringing all the right qualities to the role although it does feel like a selfparody and there's no doubts he really likes to boast about his friends. Along for the ride are his animal friends although the panther has been replaced by a tiger. Wings Hauser decked out in long blonde hair phantom of the opera style of mask a cheesy grin goes about his evil shtick with great aplomb by waving about his magic wand  bow with little respect and having organisms when reading minds. Sara Douglas who parades around provides the wit as the witch Lyranna and the lovely Kari Wuhrer perks it up in her role as the modernday girl who gets caught up helping Dar. Some other faces show up like James Avery and very minor parts for Michael Berryman and Robert Z'dar. It's not perfect but it's a breezy and theatrically hammy timewaster.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil. with a nine mil. budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day. You can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races. If the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesn't do that for a second in our world Dar sees a movie theater that's advertising The Beastmaster 2 enough said. To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies This movie knows it's limitations. It's more of a comedyparody then usual adventure. Soundtrack for the time was also great. Actors aren't taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young Kari Wuhrer turns out good. So if you are nostalgic for the 80ies90ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and don't mind going out on a cheese limb you'll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 90ies literarly. This is not really the sequel to the first and don't watch it if that's what you want. It's more of a what if fantasy sequel.As for the why different dimension and not just different time question When in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1? By the way the movie ends in the Zoo because of an attempt at a cheap moneywise big finale. It's suppose to be the best place for Dar to show all his moves him being the manipulator of animals.".

This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasn't meant for you.

Actually there's one part of this movieseries that are in some fashion a work of art and that'd be the work they did with the animals. No you say?

Its up to Dar to follow them through and errmm...stop this catastrophe!Firstly the portal they go through apparently leads them to another dimension a parallel universe not through time at all but that is merely one huge plot hole of many. The entire film is a complete pile of dingo doo doo it has nothing to do with the first film and doesn't follow on from that in any way. The only continuity plus points are the character of Dar looking as he did and his creature companions.The main issue I'm sure most fans had was the simple fact this isn't a fantasy film. Its starts off as one but descends into utter gimmicky cheesy nonsense when the characters end up in LA. We then get this horrific trashy Bmovie that is filled with pop culture of the 90's instantly dating it horrendously. Its all virtually exactly the same as the live action film of 'HeMan' with Lundgren accept it doesn't have any decent visuals sound characters effects etc...Hell they even parody the film by having a film in film moment when Dar and his new badly acted yet admittedly hot bratty rich teen girl friend drive past a cinema and it has 'Beastmaster 2' showing! That's the type of stuff saved for comedies not fantasy action flicks the pinnacle of lampoonery right there and out of place.I dunno what the writers were doing but for some reason they decided going down the hammy parody route would work for this franchise. All the action is pantomime stuff with no blood or gore not that the original had much of that but there were some nice icky bits of darkness. The villains are farcical even though I love and adore Sarah Douglas her constant silly quips and one liners were awful whilst the main bad guy was like a low rent Jake Busey...with a Phantom of the Opera mask on that didn't quite fit.I think the term tongueincheek is too kind for this disaster its...a disaster! There is audio dubbed on badly everywhere the direction is poor and its all looks like a homemade video. The only one thing that is quite good is seeing the late great James Avery as the strung out police chief. Hearing him bellow out 'Bendowski!' in that deep voice of his is the highlight.3.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one. Now don't get me wrong I absolutely love the first Beastmaster I even liked the third one pretty good but this movie is atrocious. I am a huge fantasysword  sorcery movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well where do I begin? First of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklonwho was nowhere mentioned in the first movie..Huh? cross over into our world via a handy dimensional timeportal gate. Ya see Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dar's world. Whereas with the first movie you're led to think the movie just takes place in the past but with this one you're shown it's a completely whole other world altogether...that's just one of the many things I hated about this sequel. It didn't work with Masters of the Universe and it sure doesn't work here either! Movies like this should take place and stay in their own timeline and their usual surroundings. For Christ's sake what's next? Hercules in New York...er uh..bad example! Moving on...Arklon's after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. So it's up to Dar his ferretshis eagleand his tigernot a spraypainted one this time to go off and save the world...but along the way they have the help of a young cool and hip Senator's daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show's Dar around L.A. takes him for a joyride in her BMW and helps get him out of tight situations here and there. How convenient right? And speaking of convenient I found it awfully convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen highly destructive nuclear weapon...even with half the U.S. Army and L.A.P.D. after him....waaaaay to easy even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are sooo many plot holes in this I don't know where to begin like why did Arklon go to the L.A. zoo for at the end of the movie?!? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there and wouldn't that be like the last place you'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS?And don't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy they still don't manage to hit him? The police in this movie belong in the Police Academy series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie makes no sense Beastmaster 2  Through the Portal of Time...they never actually went through a time portal because the movie isn't set in the future of Dar's world it's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane so they NEVER actually go through time only a dimensional world along theirs so NO actual timetravel is involved at all! This movie tries to come off as funny and it does...not because of the humor but because it's just so bad...and that's putting it mildly. The acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy it's hilarious. What more can I expect from the guy that brought us Return of the Swampthinganother bad sequel? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one!! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there's nothing better on T.V.".

It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in Heman or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Bean starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s and I probably first saw it when I was around ten shortly after it ended so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens just a few years ago which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before it made me laugh many times and since then that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes! Mr. Bean is a mysterious selfcentred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy! He is pretty much isolated from society and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child. He finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces! Not only does he often cause trouble for himself but sometimes for other people as well which he often doesn't tend to realize! In other words Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! The humour in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what the show is about. While there may be an occasional lacklustre gag I would say the vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights! While Mr. Bean is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made it's still great for many of those who like visual humour and due to the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show which is why it has received such a worldwide reputation! The show ran for a few years but the episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total. Nonetheless it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal!".

His mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks. But he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.To look at the sorry state of modern British humour with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at one time. There's nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean U rated humour of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s. And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s.Although I can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him. As others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact I'm so convinced about it that I really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him I think Mr Bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's Syndrome.If you'd like to see some truly hilarious British humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended. Shows like Little Britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon. ".

Shows like Little Britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon. ";

	schema:reviewBody "What exciting television adventure to England wouldn't be the same without a quick glimpse of the hysterical Mr. Bean? Superbly played by comedian Rowan Atkinson Mr. Bean takes us into the doldrums of day to day life to show us that even the smallest gesture can be the funniest. He whirlwinds us through England in the most unconventional way either in his sporty yellow car with lock or in his dentist office or his doctor's office or around the countryside stopping at several childish playgrounds. No matter where he takes you the laughs are sure to follow and remain with you for a very long time.Atkinson has mastered the ability to bring this verbally challenged character to life in ways that comedians today falter. Atkinson weaves this richly developed character into simple settings where he transforms into part social satirist and part MacGyver of the common man. His ability to take any common item and transform it into a new bit of comedy is rare today. The fact that you never knew what Mr. Bean was going to grab next on the set always allowed endless moments of joy. Now I can watch him over and over again thanks to AE and the power of DVD. Released as a set I can see Mr. Bean morning evening and late afternoon whenever I have the urge to laugh at life.This series is enjoyable for the newest Bean follower to even those of us that have been following him around for years. While some novice viewers may be disappointed to see the cuts that AE made to some of the episodes the packaging and supplemental features should suffice. It is packed full of fun information about Bean especially a very informative feature on how Bean was created by Atkinson himself. It also allows us to see some of Comic Relief UK that showcased the talent of Mr. Bean right next to Alan Cummings himself. The extras are just more icing on an already sugarpacked cake.Overall this collection is amazing. I love Mr. Bean and the style of humor that he brings to each episode and situation. He is funny without being crass or vulgar allowing us to build so many new dimensions on this simple character. Atkinson is a master in his trade and has created a character that will be remembered for years to come. So if you are a fan of slapstick humor with intellectual stimulation than Mr. Bean is right up your alley. The set is not expensive so I say go ahead and splurge on a DVD that you will never regret purchasing. You are definitely in for a hysterical treat! Mr. Bean is a role model for all and the true face of comedy! Grade  out of ".

	schema:headline " Mr. Bean Takes You Away";
	schema:reviewBody "Many reviewers here compare the Mr. Bean TV series to The Simpsons King of the Hill and other comedy shows. Though many shows at times employ slapstick Mr. Bean is very different from the majority of these shows and their characters. The most glaring contrast is between what constitutes as humor in The Simpsons and Mr. Bean. The Simpsons can sometime present gory themes in an offhanded way eg Itchy  Scratchy making ethically questionable images and situations funny to the audience. The humor in part lies in the blase way in which the characters treat something like murder torture etc. However I don't find that very enjoyable. That is why I applaud Rowan Atkinson for proving that slapstick humor can still be funny without turning murder and torture into lighthearted entertainment. Mr. Bean maintains an innocence that for me is a welcomed relief from the harshness of the TV landscape in general. From reality TV shows where participants backstab each other for money to shows like South Park and The Simpsons that fuel their comedy with questionable material TV land can be a harsh place thesedays.Many people may feel that Mr. Bean is childish and foolish but his is by far a gentler character than many you would meet on TV nowadays. I don't wax nostalgic for shows like Leave It to Beaver or any of those black and white TV shows where everyone is super cheery and pretend death and homosexuality don't exist. But need we go to the other extreme and portray the world as treacherous dangerous and continuously in conflict? Maybe what some people want when they get home from work is to sit down on the couch with a cup of hot cocoa and forget all their problems as they indulge in the foolish yet heartwarming character that is Mr. Bean.Mr. Bean takes you away from your divorcing parents your backstabbing coworker your bills piling up on the table your annoying household chores the clogged drain in the kitchen your sister's frantic wedding plans and all the depressing murders and robberies on the nightly news. Mr. Bean takes you away from all this for 25 glorious minutes and into his simpleyetcomplicated little world where the biggest problem is learning how not to bite off more than you can chew.It is nice to go to a simpler place where problems don't get more complicated than a stuck fly while trying to impress the queen.".

It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality  without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubberfaced social 'tard so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times exasperating at times lovable Mr Bean is an innocent unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words you have to see for yourself.The show gets almost too depressing at times like in the infamous New Year's Eve sketch or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy. Still there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets himself out of trouble like when he disposes of said stake in numerous cleverish ways or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. Finally I'd like to point out that although Bean is classified as a program for children it is just as enjoyable for any grownup with a sense of humour. Because the more adult jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick yes there is such a thing is funny no matter what age you are Bean is the truest definition of a family show. This is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day.".

And importantly this makes the show amazingly easy to export abroad. It's so amazing how the show is able to make you laugh even without the use of much languagejust wacky situations and terrific pantomime by Atkinson.The bottom line is that if you don't like this show you are either dead or have absolutely no sense of humor!

In fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. 10 out of 10.".

I do agree there may be the occasional gag that doesn't quite work but an overwhelming majority of them work brilliantly. Mr Bean does have minimal dialogue so a lot of the humour comes from the visual gags and slapstick. That is not a bad thing whatsoever because it actually works wonders.The story ideas are really interesting and are always constructed really well. The photography scenery and costumes are great to look at and the music is delightful. Other than the gags and slapstick it is Mr Bean himself who makes the series. Mr Bean is naive selfcentred and clueless he can't do anything right but we love him anyway. Rowan Atkinson is perfect at conveying these character qualities I thought he was brilliant in Black Adder but he was just amazing in this. His facial expressions and the situations his character gets into are simply priceless. The guest appearances are also excellent but it is Atkinson's show all the way.Overall a complete delight of a comedy series. It is hilarious and original like a comedy series should be if anything though I think it should have lasted longer. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "MR BEAN THE CHILDISH COMEDIC GENIUS! Reviewed by Blake de Raat.Mr Bean has beans for brains in The Curse of Mr Bean. Starring Rowan Atkinson featuring many other women as well as a fine gentleman Mr Bean's childish convulsive humour will have you rolling on the floor like a child in a tantrum. Therefore you must see Mr Bean!Mr Bean's blunders are widely used are effective and will bring out the cheeky child that is in us all. Your sides will split when you see Mr Bean unable to reach the payment machine and use a claw to reach it especially as he races like a drunk driver in and out of the shopping centre. In addition you will almost feel sorry for Mr Bean when he leaves the pool naked bumps into goodlooking girls and ends up striding backwards to avoid them. Also Mr Bean embarrasses himself when he can't fit through the slide which exposes him to the public. We laugh at his blunders because he acts like an immature infant in the public when he makes mistakes running into people falling over and putting himself out there to effectively convey silly overthe top humour in the midst of developing caricature. His use of caricature in fact is even more welldeveloped and sophisticated developing from his blunders. You will never regret the moment when you see Mr Bean be the popcorn monster where he intentionally tries to spook his girlfriend in the cinema building tension as deathly gruesome music fills the atmosphere. You WILL laugh at this because you see the priceless reactions from both Mr Bean and his girlfriend as they react to a movie which does not seem scary. But to them through Mr Bean's actions this changes. Furthermore the comedic genius entertains us once again by placing popcorn in his nostrils which is utterly confusing for the fine gentlemen adjacent to him. He also cannot sniff affecting his breathing and thus bringing forth the humour that was intended by the actor. For caricature to be most effective Mr Bean has taken some of the most idiotic things that anyone could do to emphasise his immaturity. Clearly he must have gotten out on the wrong side of the bed. But nonetheless Mr Bean develops his acting ability from the caricature and slapstick he develops in these actions. If you thought the caricature was funny we are only getting started! Mr Bean uses his slapstick riotously to help him build tension in the mostly wordless script. In fact when he reaches the top of the diving board he looks like a crawling baby looking for his mum as he looks over the edge in pain wishing he could go home! To add to the tension two teenaged children happily want to dive but see Mr Bean in pain scared for his life. It was as if Mr Bean was a baby and the children were supervising adults. In doing these actions he also walked strangely waddling his arms side to side hitting people as they went past whilst catching the attention of the public to develop into this cheeky child. Once again making us laugh is easy Mr Bean is clearly a child in a grown man's body Mr Bean for he does senseless things which clearly evokes humour. Of course the legendary actor himself has clearly developed his caricature slapstick as well as his blunders to develop into the best TV show of all time!How would you feel if you missed a glorious giggle at the end your day? Mr Bean will bring you years of endless pleasure to free you from the darkness and let Mr Bean be the light at the end of the tunnel. It is hilarious wellacted and wellrounded. You just cannot miss out therefore watch Mr Bean.".

For caricature to be most effective Mr Bean has taken some of the most idiotic things that anyone could do to emphasise his immaturity. Clearly he must have gotten out on the wrong side of the bed. But nonetheless Mr Bean develops his acting ability from the caricature and slapstick he develops in these actions. If you thought the caricature was funny we are only getting started! Mr Bean uses his slapstick riotously to help him build tension in the mostly wordless script. In fact when he reaches the top of the diving board he looks like a crawling baby looking for his mum as he looks over the edge in pain wishing he could go home! To add to the tension two teenaged children happily want to dive but see Mr Bean in pain scared for his life. It was as if Mr Bean was a baby and the children were supervising adults. In doing these actions he also walked strangely waddling his arms side to side hitting people as they went past whilst catching the attention of the public to develop into this cheeky child. Once again making us laugh is easy Mr Bean is clearly a child in a grown man's body Mr Bean for he does senseless things which clearly evokes humour. Of course the legendary actor himself has clearly developed his caricature slapstick as well as his blunders to develop into the best TV show of all time!How would you feel if you missed a glorious giggle at the end your day? Mr Bean will bring you years of endless pleasure to free you from the darkness and let Mr Bean be the light at the end of the tunnel. It is hilarious wellacted and wellrounded. You just cannot miss out therefore watch Mr Bean.";

Fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. Cat in The Brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it.

Years of violent film making have finally began to reach him. It starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is some rest. But that doesn't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state Lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately that does more wrong than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from Fulci's films in real life.The film retains all the trademarks of Italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here. So any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film. It is a visual experience no doubts about it. Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything he's made. Amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in Cat In The Brain. Some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director's less profile movies but they don't stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here. As I noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece. The way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea. Such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that Fulci's character is directing. This sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore. But in no way does it make it an easy to watch film. Oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact.Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate his work or love it. Cat in the Brain won't convince any of Fulci's detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really check out.".

	schema:headline " Bizarre selfreferencing gore fest from cult director Lucio Fulci";
	schema:reviewBody "Things open with a shot of cats hungrily devouring a gigantic human brain. We see a director devising the screenplay for his next horror yarn. Chainsaw murders... evisceration... sadism... he mutters to himself. The description could aptly describe the next eightyeight minutes of this movie which contain more severings slashings and body parts than most gore films put together.Lucio Fulci's oddest movie is a real mixed bag. On one hand it has a really interesting premise in that Fulci is essentially playing himself on set while directing his gory movies so it's a movieinamovie type plot like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE only this came first that has the opportunity to explore the link between the violence in horror films and the violence in real life and if movies have any effect and what prolonged exposure to gory violence might do to a man! As well as this it's a study of Fulci's supposed psychological state so gets a bit confusing as you can well imagine.On the other hand the movie is simply an excuse to string together a series of incredibly gory setpieces from previous Fulci films and others and then to insert Fulci's character into these scenes as if he is witnessing the murders first hand. The effect is an interesting if muddled one marred by some extreme technical faults skies and backgrounds are different colours in film segments which are par for the course for nobudget productions like this.Fulci himself takes the leading role of the confused director making this a mustsee movie for his diehard fans. Realising that he himself is not and can never be an actor Fulci instead opts for a tongueincheek performance which seems to be a case of either love it or hate it for horror fans. Personally I think he copes admirably with the role and the comedy. Speaking of comedy some of it is intentional but a lot of it is not such as the cheesy dubbing and the overthetop extravaganza of some of the setpieces. Take for example David Thompson's turn as the crazed psychiatrist  this guy goes so overthetop as the crazed slasher that his performance has to be seen to be disbelieved! The hilarious highlight in my mind is when Fulci repeatedly runs some poor fool who got in the path of his car  classic stuff and for some reason extremely funny.Gore hounds certainly get their money's worth with this movie even if the majority but not all... of the effects and sequences are taken from previous films thus Brett Halsey is billed in the cast as the Monster even though he never actually acted in this film  hmm wonder how he feels about that?. Kicking off with a corpse being chainsawed minced and fed to pigs the film includes a Nazi sadist orgy lots of eyeballs beheadings behandings a melting head in a microwave maggotty corpses bloody stabbings a PSYCHOderived but even more shocking shower murder chainsaw and trunk decapitations a pianowire throat garrotting and oodles more. Of course it's all pretty cheap and fakelooking but there's so much of it it all becomes a bit overwhelming  especially to the BBFC who banned it outright when the film was subjected for video release in the UK.Definitely a mustsee for lovers of the bizarre or those looking for something a bit different from Fulci although it's a lot different to the zombie films he is most widely known for. Although there is lots to hate about it I think there is even more to like and find interesting which is why I recommend this as a at least see it once kind of movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Things open with a shot of cats hungrily devouring a gigantic human brain. We see a director devising the screenplay for his next horror yarn. Chainsaw murders... evisceration... sadism... he mutters to himself. The description could aptly describe the next eightyeight minutes of this movie which contain more severings slashings and body parts than most gore films put together.Lucio Fulci's oddest movie is a real mixed bag. On one hand it has a really interesting premise in that Fulci is essentially playing himself on set while directing his gory movies so it's a movieinamovie type plot like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE only this came first that has the opportunity to explore the link between the violence in horror films and the violence in real life and if movies have any effect and what prolonged exposure to gory violence might do to a man! As well as this it's a study of Fulci's supposed psychological state so gets a bit confusing as you can well imagine.On the other hand the movie is simply an excuse to string together a series of incredibly gory setpieces from previous Fulci films and others and then to insert Fulci's character into these scenes as if he is witnessing the murders first hand. The effect is an interesting if muddled one marred by some extreme technical faults skies and backgrounds are different colours in film segments which are par for the course for nobudget productions like this.Fulci himself takes the leading role of the confused director making this a mustsee movie for his diehard fans. Realising that he himself is not and can never be an actor Fulci instead opts for a tongueincheek performance which seems to be a case of either love it or hate it for horror fans. Personally I think he copes admirably with the role and the comedy. Speaking of comedy some of it is intentional but a lot of it is not such as the cheesy dubbing and the overthetop extravaganza of some of the setpieces. Take for example David Thompson's turn as the crazed psychiatrist  this guy goes so overthetop as the crazed slasher that his performance has to be seen to be disbelieved! The hilarious highlight in my mind is when Fulci repeatedly runs some poor fool who got in the path of his car  classic stuff and for some reason extremely funny.Gore hounds certainly get their money's worth with this movie even if the majority but not all... of the effects and sequences are taken from previous films thus Brett Halsey is billed in the cast as the Monster even though he never actually acted in this film  hmm wonder how he feels about that?. Kicking off with a corpse being chainsawed minced and fed to pigs the film includes a Nazi sadist orgy lots of eyeballs beheadings behandings a melting head in a microwave maggotty corpses bloody stabbings a PSYCHOderived but even more shocking shower murder chainsaw and trunk decapitations a pianowire throat garrotting and oodles more. Of course it's all pretty cheap and fakelooking but there's so much of it it all becomes a bit overwhelming  especially to the BBFC who banned it outright when the film was subjected for video release in the UK.Definitely a mustsee for lovers of the bizarre or those looking for something a bit different from Fulci although it's a lot different to the zombie films he is most widely known for. Although there is lots to hate about it I think there is even more to like and find interesting which is why I recommend this as a at least see it once kind of movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "As most Fulci fans would agree his best movies came out in the late seventies and early eighties. In 1988 he had to pull out of directing the terrible Zombie 3 after only a few weeks due to ill health. What that ill health was is anyones guess. But judging by Nightmare concert of 1990 vintage he is obviously still suffering. I am of the opinion that producers were pressuring him to put his name to something and in the end this is what came out.It is a real mish mash of a slasher story spliced with scenes from other movies. Of course fulci plays the lead. Or rather is on screen with things happening around him. He is supposed to play himself though i doubt anyone could be that wooden in real life. It is often difficult to tell WHAT is happening as the film jerks from scene to scene with nothing to link them together. Fulci spends most of his time looking puzzled and shocked just as i am sure you the viewer will be.It has plenty of gore in it as you would expect and will be most peoples reason for acquiring this movie. Fair enough. Just don't expect the cinematic punch of Zombie or the Beyond. At the end of the day its a horror movie albeit a confusing one. I think it did its job as i was left feeling somewhat disturbed and unwashed afterwards. Get it if you're a real gore hound or a fulci fan other than that theres not really much to recommend it. Very strange psycological gore fest. Hmmmmmmmmmm....... Poor Fulci.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fulci is one of my all time favorite Italian splatter directors. He is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well. This film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as Voices From Beyond. The story is simple as Fulci plays himself a horror director. After years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that Fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people.Fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time. These films I don't believe he directed but certainly produced. Some of those films are Massacre directed by Andrea Bianchi Burial Ground Touch of Death directed by Fulci The Murders Secret and I can't remember the rest of the films.Nightmare Concert is a very underrated film even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and have watched it many times already. It is sad that Fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and I do recommend it to any Fulci fan whether you like it or not. 910 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "In many interviews Fulci showed himself very enthusiastic about Nightmare Concert. I really don't know why. Certainly the idea of a horror movie director haunted by the nightmares he has created was still interesting and novel at that time but I really cannot figure out what kind of movie Fulci wanted to make A comedy or a serious horror moviethriller? Are the selfirony and selfcriticism real or pretended?Anyway the movie is a rather uninteresting affair. Half of it features Fulci wandering from gore scene to gore scene. Fulci had to play the leading part because the actor intended for that role didn't show up on the set. Fulci tries his best to make a disgusted face but overall he seems to be rather unaffected by what is going on. On the contrary David L. Thompson as the psychiatrist is shamelessly overacting. The other half consists of recycled footage from other movies like The ghosts of sodom or When Alice broke the mirror notably the chainsaw dismembering and feeding to the pigs scene and from movies Fulci hasn't even directed like The massacre. This means in particular that most special effects are cheap crude and unconvincing. Moreover Fulci has problems in patching everything together The Mercedes model he drives in Nightmare concert is different from the one Halsey drove in When Alice ... so that the scenes do not fit exactly.When he says what am I doing while watching a Nazi orgy he has filmed this refers probably to the extremely low budget efforts which Fulci has delivered in his last period of activity.Well the movie has only few interesting scenes. The opening when Fulci recites a poem about women hacked to pieces and so on followed by the shots of the cat in the brain is indeed the testimony of a man gone mad through his own creations. The steak tartare scene is quite funny. The ending is ironic Fulci goes on to make horror movies despite his terrible nightmares. Beware this ending has been altered by the producers so that the wrong ending might appear in some versions.After all I still had enough fun watching the movie largely because Fulci played the lead so that I voted it 610 for this the idea and some of the more interesting scenes.".

After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films. The gore is overpowering and copious to say the least. The amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version referred to with the akaNightmare Concert. Decapitations all around victims ' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime! The film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon since it's so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge. Of course from a more professional viewpoint this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece! There's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely emptyheaded. In order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. Especially compared with Fulci's highlights  like The Beyond or Don't Torture a Duckling  this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack. The best way to interpret Cat in the Brain is like a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack towards censorship. Perhaps after seeing so many of his films  especially the latter ones  being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudoartistic critics he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can't be cut! If you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick makeup effects you only got about 10 minutes of footage left! Especially because the insane killings reoccur later in the film as Fulci hallucinates about them again. You can almost hear our director think stuff like Let's see how you're going to censor this now! Even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background. Are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives? Are there any police officers looking for clues that'll lead them to the killer? You don't know and Lucio doesn't bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that don't require cutting. Oh and it's pretty damn pretentious as well! The name Mr. Fulci or even Lucio is mentioned every 3 minutes 34 times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change. Hey I certainly don't blame him...After over 30 years of delivering amusing movies he deserved to have a little extra fun. You're a God Mr. Fulci!".

	schema:headline " Fulci's swan song is a good time for all!";
	schema:reviewBody "Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director's decent into madness. The director in question is Fulci himself who stars in the film. Fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as 'the godfather of gore' and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like 'Zombi 2' to a man been hacked to death with chains in 'The Beyond' all the way to the full on gore fest known as 'The New York Ripper' if you want gore and let's face it who doesn't Fulci is your man. However all this catering for gorehounds like you and I has taken its toll on Fulci's mental state and he's quickly delving into madness brought about by what he films. Fulci's problems don't end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders!I've got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious. There is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it's only fit to be laughed at for both it's acting and it's stupidity. Fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously. He's not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film. It's even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course nobody goes into an Italian horror expecting good acting so it's somewhat forgivable but I do think that Fulci could have hired some better ones. Bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either. However something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and it's extreme to say the least! People get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike Psycho here we REALLY see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon  the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end. The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a 'spoof' feel but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway.It would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and Fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie. His name is mentioned often and he's on screen nearly all the time it's not too much unlike 'New Nightmare' in the ego stakes but it's obvious he had a good time making this and I for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism. The film's ending lets it down  I saw it coming a mile off but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route but I was wrong it did unfortunately. The ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes. However despite it's ending and terrible acting Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended.".

Fulci's problems don't end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders!I've got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious. There is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it's only fit to be laughed at for both it's acting and it's stupidity. Fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously. He's not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film. It's even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course nobody goes into an Italian horror expecting good acting so it's somewhat forgivable but I do think that Fulci could have hired some better ones. Bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either. However something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and it's extreme to say the least! People get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike Psycho here we REALLY see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon  the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end. The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a 'spoof' feel but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway.It would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and Fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie. His name is mentioned often and he's on screen nearly all the time it's not too much unlike 'New Nightmare' in the ego stakes but it's obvious he had a good time making this and I for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism. The film's ending lets it down  I saw it coming a mile off but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route but I was wrong it did unfortunately. The ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes. However despite it's ending and terrible acting Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors by the time of his death in 1996 yet his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his earlier work. For much of the '70s into the mid'80s he cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as City of the Living Dead The Beyond and the brutal giallo The New York Ripper fondly remembered by fans like myself. And while Cat in the Brain falls in with the era of Fulci's decline as a filmmaker it is a shocking darkly hilarious headtrip that while a clearly inferior work the framing effects and acting are below par proves an interesting openended meditation on pop psychology and film's ability to desensitize. Make no mistake Cat in the Brain is a total gorefest and as disjointed as Fulci's previous films but it deserves credit for trying to be something more. In a deliciously tongueincheek touch Fulci plays himself a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perversemurderous hallucinations after visiting a shrink who puts him under hypnosis his dreams and reality begin to intersect to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two. The recent DVD from Grindhouse Releasing mentions Cat as an heir apparent to the likes of Eraserhead and it does carry a similarly disquieting awkwardly funny quality associated with the best surrealist art.".

The movie is virtually plot less or instead of a plot it basically has only plot holes think the size of Nebraska tied together with hints at a plot. There's a hint at a murder mystery here about a deranged murderer killing random people though it's merely reduced to a background story. And as you all have probably read by now it stars Fulci playing himself. It's also one of Fulci's most incoherent films. It also is quite ridiculous. And it all feels like it was meant to be this way. Literally stuffed with gore footage both new and some lifted from his previous films it's undoubtedly Fulci's most insane movie. Good stuff!".

Before his movies were not only gorefilled but they had a story great writing and great camera shots that were very beautiful for something any other Italian director besides Dario Argento could not produce. Near his death his movies seems very poor and somewhat distasteful. The only two movies I could watch of his were Aenigma 1987 and The House of Clocks 1989. Though Un gatto nel cervello The Cat in The Brain is a very entertaining movie that Fulci produced near his death. One of the main reasons is that Fulci actually stars in it... AS HIMSELF! The plot line is basically Fulci has been driven insane by his movies or whatever and he starts imagining scenes from his movies being played out in real life. What this means is that there is a lot of stock footage with in the movie mainly from Touch of Death and Sodama's Ghost two recent movies Fulci had produced before. I liked how the scenes were integrated into the movie though you could tell that the footage was stock somewhat if you've actually seen the movies. Anyway's the movie is entertaining though the gore kind of does lose the touch of any other Fulci gore epic before. Though the thing that surprises me is that Fabio Frizzi composer of some Fulci films such as Zombie The Gates of Hell and The Beyond is actually the composer of this movie's music. You can actually tell by the bass line sort of. I wish I could find a soundtrack for this movie if there is one.".

Though the thing that surprises me is that Fabio Frizzi composer of some Fulci films such as Zombie The Gates of Hell and The Beyond is actually the composer of this movie's music. You can actually tell by the bass line sort of. I wish I could find a soundtrack for this movie if there is one.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer yes! Cat in the Brain also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself who plays... well horrorsplattergore director who thinks he is slowly going insane. It's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. Being Fulci flick you need to know it's gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me it's a hard to archive. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about Fulci who after being hypnotized by khmmm evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2 this IS the goriest Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where Fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness Ending is very good considering that Fulci and most of the Italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. If you are fun of the Fulci make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat Its only a movie ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie Chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being putted in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face...".

Even mainstream movies such as Romero's Zombies and Day of the Dead are much gorier as is Fulci's own Zombie Flesh Eaters.  If you want serious gore check out Peter Jackson's marvellous Brain Dead aka Dead Alive the Flymo massacre at the climax of which is probably the single goriest scene ever committed to celluloid. There are numerous gory moments sure but most of the time the SFX are really shoddy and unconvincing many  most?  of the murderous vignettes are lifted from Fulci's Italian TV movies and boy does it show.The movie itself is very cheap and unbelievably inept.  One gets the impression Fulci cobbled it together in about half an hour.  The narrative is hopelessly disjointed and the acting would disgrace a school play. There's also a nasty vein of misogyny running through it  nearly all the murder victims are women often nude or seminude and their deaths are dwelt on lovingly and at length.  This is a lamentable trend in modern horror movies and Fulci bless his little cotton socks has consistently shown himself to be one of the worst offenders.  The guy clearly got off on showing women being tortured and killed  New York Ripper anybody?  and by watching his films we the audience are participating albeit vicariously in the vile behaviour depicted.  Where does that leave us I wonder? Incidentally Brian De Palma's thriller Body Double offers an interesting commentary about this uneasy relationship between actress director and audience in a stalk and slash movie.Nevertheless this is an interesting film if only for the ironic selfreflection in which Fulci indulges.  Okay so it's not a totally original conceit but the notion of a horror film director feeling constrained by audience expectation such that he can no longer make movies in any other genre is one worth exploring.  Compare the career of Alfred Hitchcock who complained that if he made a version of Mary Poppins the audience would be asking where's the body?  Also Fulci does appear to be saying that he himself is sickened by the atrocities he depicts to the extent that they're sending him loopy.  Whether or not Fulci really felt the way his character  a film director by the name of you've guessed it Lucio Fulci  feels is debatable after all horror made him famous and presumably rich.  And coming from the director of New York Ripper any protest he might be making does seem rather disingenuous.I also like the notion of a film within a film within a film playing around with the audience's viewpoint and emphasising the voyeuristic nature of the whole filmmaking process.Whatever else Cat in the Brain is worth seeing just for the scene in which Fulci molests a woman during one of his funny turns.  When he apologises later the woman gushes Ooh Mr. Fulci that's the biggest thrill I've ever had in my life! or words to that effect.  Fulci's reaction?  Well you'll have to see it for yourself but it had me in stitches.".

It's an interesting thoughtprovoking idea and Fulci proves to be a rather capable actor. But I have to warn everybody that the gore although plentiful has no impact most of the time and this can be perceived as either good or bad depending on you. Much of the gore exists in the moviewithinamovie so it's obviously meant to be fake and much of it  is in visions and hallucinations and we know that it's not the real thing as well. Anyway there are some truly impressive effects especially a throatslashing near the end but in several key scenes like in some decapitations the editing is botched.
