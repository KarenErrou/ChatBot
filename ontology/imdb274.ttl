The only welcome character in the movie was Vincent Pastore aka Big Pussy from Sopranos. Even the couple of scenes he was in could not save this movie. It was one of those movies where everything goes wrong. Like this has not been done to death . Very juvenile and watchable in the sense that you can not believe how bad a movie you are watching. Just when you think the movie can not get any worse it surprises and it does. In my opinion the best part of movie besides Mr. Pastores scenes were the clips that showed the Vegas strip or downtown Vegas.I did not expect much and thats exactly what I got. Kal Penn already has a slew of these movies with those White Castle flicks. I wonder if this guy has any acting range at all. Than again white castle burgers are small and evidently so is Kal Penns acting range. If you must watch this please watch it on cable already paid.".

But this is a pretty decent adventure movie with a fantastic story to it. You may feel let down because the movie did pretty horrible but if you watch the entire movie and follow the story you will find it to be a little better than the story of comedies that have made it big at the box office.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people have made terrible reviews on this movie but I think people have just watched the movie with their expectations low and have just watched it to criticise it and to pick out all the bad bits but the things they missed were the good bits. This movie is entertainment through and through its quick paced its got good actors and its got a good story. The only thing that let it down was the script which luckily enough was pepped up by the actors and the other thing that let it down also was the over use of half naked women. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any I understood there was going to be quite a lot it being a bachelor party and all but you know it's gone too far when you begin to feel uncomfortable watching it by yourself. There seemed to be a hot girl round every corner and they kept popping up in the most bizarre places... but that's my only criticismIt's a fun movie which takes you on an entertaining adventure with these five guys all of whom have very good characters. Some jokes made by them did just pass by me but I did smile and laugh at some others which I think is a huge accomplishment for a movie because I know there are some big Hollywood comedies out there which people don't laugh at yet they're big movies. Also the reason some of the jokes aren't so funny is not because they're bad jokes it's because they just glaze over you. But when watching this movie look out for the character Eli played by the talented actor Aaron Himelstein he's the one that makes you laugh and the majority of the funny jokes come from him and his awesome nervous character. I liked the ending simply because as the movie was getting closer to the end they gave you enough clues to guess what was going to happen so therefore it was less disappointing than it could have been. The ending was also well explained rather than it being a simple unexplained twist it actually had a nice story behind it and it made you smile. This is a movie that I would have probably enjoyed a lot more if I hadn't of read all of the terrible reviews simple because no movie can be enjoyed when you know the bad bits that people have found. I'd say the only down fall was the over use of sex and gross out humour which I don't particularly mind in a movie but in this movie it just lasted a bit too long. Over all I was entertained I enjoyed it which in the end is all you want from a movie. So ignore the bad reviews and try and forget about them when you watch this movie because it really isn't that bad it makes you laugh and smile and has a good story and good actors which is all I wanted from it.".

The plot starts off rather simple as we are told that a group of guys are going on a trip to Vegas and bought the Ultimate Vegas Bachelor Party Package. Well if simple means complex then this movie is simple. And if this simple means simple then this movie is NOT simple.The supporting cast is reminiscent of an Oceans 11 movie. We have Big Pussy Chuck Liddell Jaime Pressly Daniel Stern and Kathy Griffin giving some very impressive performances. You are all wondering how what the heck are all these celebrities doing in this movie? Well if I told you then it would take all the fun out of the movie  The musical score in this movie treats you to a John Williams type experience as if you are listening to the Indian Jones theme for the first time. The way they incorporate the metal music with Chuck Liddells screen time was beautiful. Also I have to add there a twist at the end of the movie that even Rod Serling would have never guessed.

	schema:reviewBody "The wave of straighttoDVD sex comedies that has been flooding video stores for the last decade reminds me of a lot of the whole slasher boom back in the 1980s both genres look incredibly easy to make but both genres are pretty hard to get completely right. They're also both easy to distribute and thus alluring to less gifted filmmakers and God have we been learning that the hard way. Bachelor Party Vegas is one of those typical movies by people who've seen stuff like American Pie and Porky's but drew completely wrong conclusions from them. Yeah I love disgusting humor but I also love interesting though not even necessarily complex characters coherent stories and actors that look like they want to be there. The crude humor is supposed to be icing on the cake not the sole reason the movie exists. Ten minutes into this movie I had already seen dildos penis cream nudie mags porn flicks a foulmouthed grandma an elderly stripper and a nude fat guy who humps the entire cast. The phrase tries too hard doesn't even begin to cover it. The movie does get gradually better throughout but better is still nowhere near good. It's nice that eventually they do create some kind of plot and even put in a genuinely clever twist but as far as laughs go I still counted about zero.

	onyx:emotionText "The wave of straighttoDVD sex comedies that has been flooding video stores for the last decade reminds me of a lot of the whole slasher boom back in the 1980s both genres look incredibly easy to make but both genres are pretty hard to get completely right. They're also both easy to distribute and thus alluring to less gifted filmmakers and God have we been learning that the hard way. Bachelor Party Vegas is one of those typical movies by people who've seen stuff like American Pie and Porky's but drew completely wrong conclusions from them. Yeah I love disgusting humor but I also love interesting though not even necessarily complex characters coherent stories and actors that look like they want to be there. The crude humor is supposed to be icing on the cake not the sole reason the movie exists.

My only problem is that they didn't take the jokes quite far enough. They were funny enough to get you to start giggling and then switched out before they got Hangover like extreme. The characters were great and the cast world make a great sitcom if they could build on this.The locations in Vegas are good. A lot of running around off strip. Good supporting guest stars.Watch it with some buds and have make a drinking game out of it. Say take a shot each time you see Chuck Lidel or Scrubs guy touches one of the other guys..

After saying the wrong things Adam Hemsworth an upandcoming employee at a powerful corporation finds himself and his friends out of a job. After the owner Nicolas Wyatt Oldman recruits him to spy on rival Jock Goddard Ford to find out what his company is coming up with Adam finds himself stuck in the middle of a dangerous game. When he wants out he realizes that it's not just his life is threatened unless he completes his task. I was looking forward to watching this for two reasons. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman also Richard Dreyfuss is in this but in a lesser role. I cannot recall a movie they have been in that has been bad Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was bad but its still Indiana Jones so I can't hate it and I blame Lucas for that anyway. I did find out how to mess up a movie with those two legendary actors...add baby Thor Liam Hemsworth. I'm not saying he was a bad actor in this because it wasn't terrible but when you have those two in a movie and you make baby Thor the main focus you have screwed up somewhere. I'd compare this to the movie Son Of No One in the way that you have Ray Liotta and Al Pacino and you make Channing Tatum the focus. Nothing personal against Hemsworth or Tatum but when you have such high caliber actors why waste them? As far as this movie goes the scenes with Oldman and Ford are amazing as expected as far as the rest goes it was slow a little boring and not exciting at all. With the plot being about the seedy underworld of the cellphone app industry though you don't have much to work with. Overall a movie that could have been so much better but ended up being almost not worth seeing. It pains me to do this but I give it a C.".

Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman also Richard Dreyfuss is in this but in a lesser role. I cannot recall a movie they have been in that has been bad Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was bad but its still Indiana Jones so I can't hate it and I blame Lucas for that anyway. I did find out how to mess up a movie with those two legendary actors...add baby Thor Liam Hemsworth. I'm not saying he was a bad actor in this because it wasn't terrible but when you have those two in a movie and you make baby Thor the main focus you have screwed up somewhere. I'd compare this to the movie Son Of No One in the way that you have Ray Liotta and Al Pacino and you make Channing Tatum the focus. Nothing personal against Hemsworth or Tatum but when you have such high caliber actors why waste them? As far as this movie goes the scenes with Oldman and Ford are amazing as expected as far as the rest goes it was slow a little boring and not exciting at all. With the plot being about the seedy underworld of the cellphone app industry though you don't have much to work with. Overall a movie that could have been so much better but ended up being almost not worth seeing. It pains me to do this but I give it a C.";

	schema:headline " Another Luketic film on a Worst of list.";
	schema:reviewBody "Privacy. Absolute myth. There's no such thing.The film starts off on the wrong foot and never manages to get on track. In the very opening scene you have Liam Hemsworth using voice over narration explaining to us what we are about to see and you realize that you are going to watch a clichd unoriginal action thriller. Then there is a scene where Gary Oldman's character is looking at some art pieces with Liam and he mentions how Picasso once said that there are no original ideas that everything is either copied or stolen. You kind of get a sense of a similar thing going on with this script. Paranoia is an action thriller that seems recycled with no fresh ideas and unfortunately lacks thrills. The script was adapted by Jason Dean Hall Spread and Barry Levy Vantage Point from Joseph Finder's novel but nothing about it feels inspiring or original. It is a shame because I was excited to get to see Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman face off once again but Paranoia easily belongs on my worst films of 2013 list mainly because these talented actors can't do anything to improve a weak script. Paranoia gets half a star for Amber Heard who looks stunning despite not adding anything to the story and another star for Oldman and Ford's presence alone. I could forgive the uninspiring script if at least this technological thriller actually had some thrills but it doesn't. There aren't any interesting thrills either and the narrative is pretty straight forward and predictable.Adam Cassidy Liam Hemsworth has been working for an important technological company known as Wyatt Corporation for the past six years. He hasn't been able to ascend the corporate ladder the way he pictured it as he continues to be an entry level employee but he and his team are expecting a break through when given the opportunity to present their next project to the boss Nicolas Wyatt Gary Oldman. The presentation doesn't go as planned and Adam is left unemployed along with the rest of his team. Feeling bad about the way things turned out Adam invites them to a fancy club where they use the company's credit card. The next day Adam is called back to Wyatt's office as he is confronted for his crime. Taking advantage of Adam's hunger for wealth and power Wyatt recruits him to spy on his nemesis Jock Goddard Harrison Ford. Goddard happens to run another billion dollar tech company which is his biggest competition. Wyatt wants Adam to win Jock's trust and discover what they are working on and in return he promises him the life he has always dreamed of. Blinded by greed Adam accepts and soon will find himself way in over his head.Richard Dreyfuss has a small role in this film as well and his presence only reminds us that a film focusing on him or the other secondary characters such as Oldman and Ford would be so much better. Instead they allow Hemsworth to play the lead role and he simply doesn't have that on screen charisma to carry a film on his own. I don't think he's a bad actor but he needs stronger material to keep the audience's interest. He is just outclassed in this film by the other talented actors and we are left out wanting to see more of them. Another issue I had with Paranoia is that the plot doesn't make much sense and it is so dull that it allows you to begin to think too much about it and find all sort of holes. Robert Luketic has just directed his third straight flop after the disappointing Killers and The Ugly Truth. I will defend him for 21 which was a film that at least kept me entertained but his latest efforts have been really disappointing. Paranoia might just top them all stay away from this film.".

	schema:headline " Not even paranoid... Paranoia  Noodles Review";
	schema:reviewBody "What a misleading title for a movie? Nobody's even paranoid in this movie at all so calling it Paranoia doesn't really make sense to me. Instead they could've titled it Generic Conveniences. Know why? Because everything in this movie is written in so conveniently for the characters to succeed in the most generic way. So I guess you can tell it's not a very likable movie. Before seeing this movie the premise sounded pretty cool. One guy is spying on a company for a rival company but not everything goes according to plan and then stuff happens. Plus the CEOs of the companies are played by none other than two of the best actors in the business! We got Gary Oldman one of the most diverse actors of modern cinema and Harrison Ford Indiana Jones  Han Solo 'nough said. On top of that it stars Thor's brother Liam Hemsworth who's good in The Expendables 2 and The Hunger Games but this could have been his breakout role as a leading actor! Sadly it's not.Hemsworth's character in this movie is so unlikable the only reason an individual would enjoy him in this movie is because he's an attractive guy. However his acting in this movie is pretty bad. I found myself comparing him to Taylor Lautner's performance in Abduction but at least with that movie we knew it was gonna be bad. Just as bad as his acting are the choices made by his character. The whole plot is put into motion because he got fired from a company and then he decides to go out clubbing with the credit card that's issued by the company he got fired from that he still luckily has! How stupid is that! And then through a sequence of events they choose him of all people to be a spy this irresponsible guy who just goes out clubbing after he's fired? Wow. The writing in this movie clearly is offputting but we'll get to that later. The chicks too that Hemsworth gets with in this movie are really weird as well. One tries playing hard to get even though he already got with her while the other chick tries to seduce him while he's already trying to seduce her. The only semiredeeming qualities of this movie are that Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford actually try in this movie. It's undeniable that they're phenomenal actors and they are for the most part good in this movie for what they're given. Nonetheless they're given crap dialogue and stupid plot points. I cannot bag on the writing of this movie enough it is so bad. The dialogue is unrealistic and not enjoyable while the plot is so convoluted and uninteresting that I kept wanting to stop watching the movie.Additionally the directing of this movie is a huge weakpoint. It looked like a madeforTV movie from the '90s. The directing and camerawork were horrible. Sometimes there was a person talking but half their face was off the screen. In another sequence Hemsworth is running like a little girl flailing his arms around and whatnot. There's no purpose for him to be running like that who said that was okay? It's funny seeing how stupid it is but it's not even supposed to be funny. And with it being a spy thriller with convoluted twists you'd think that it'd be unpredictable right? Well it's not. It had those clich moments like when he has to break into a vault and he's failed two out of three attempts with the next failed attempt triggering the alarms. And then it tries to build tension in that moment but you already know he's gonna be alright and his last attempt is gonna get through. The movie has no suspense whatsoever despite trying to be a suspenseful summer thriller. It's not suspenseful because you always know what's gonna happen and don't really even care for the characters. It's not summer because it's boring and uninteresting rather than being fun. And it's not a thriller because there are absolutely no thrills. The only thing remotely okay about this movie are the performances of Gary Oldman and Harrision Ford and that sometimes even gets old since Ford never gets the chance to say Get off my plane! It's not worth seeing in the theatre or even worth renting. It's one of those movies that will be on cable and you'll have to think about if you actually have nothing better to do than invest your time in it. But you'll probably end up passing anyways".

We basically with comments above poor acting except Ford and Oldman below standard story plot empty dialogs etc.... We just wanted to point out how so many parts in the movie lack logic and basic common sense. For exampleExample 1 Adam gets completely drunk and wakes up freshly groomed with his hair are perfectly combed and no hangover whatsoever the next morning. Really??Example 2 If there are cameras in his Adam's dad's house how come Wyatt did not see that the FBI came to the house and heard the conversation?Example 3 He's in bed sleeping and while Emma goes take a shower he quickly gets up to steal Emma's files from her computer... And he has the time to put on pants?? When the plan is to run back into bed for when she comes out of the shower?Example 4 Towards the end after Adam steals Emma's phone and fingerprint to rob Eikon Occura how did Emma get into his apartment? He sure didn't give his keys away....Example 5 how in the world did he have Goddard's sports car as a rental after his whole ordeal with the FBI? Did he have money to throw away when he still had to pay for his dad's hospital bills? Or did those fly away just like the logic of this movie...The biggest question is why on earth would Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman decide to join the cast? Money money or money?The second biggest question is what man walks around with one hand in his pocket? Does he think this is Project Runway?".

Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford are the ruthless CEOs of rival cell phones companies. Liam Hemsworth is a young hotshot that works for Oldman's company but he is fired after a lousy presentation. After spending thousands of dollars of the company's credit card in a nightclub he is blackmailed by Oldman into getting hired into Ford's company in order to steal the blueprints for their new cell phone. Many more things will happen including Hemsworth romantic involvement with one of Ford's company marketing head played by the beautiful Amber Heard.

	schema:headline " Mostly juvenile thriller that tries very hard but saved by Hollywood royalty";
	schema:reviewBody "Paranoia was my latest attempt at choosing a movie at random and walking into it. This one was slightly different because I had at least heard of it and when I saw Harrison Ford's name on the poster...it was a must. I love him and see everything he is in. Don't mistake my negatives for this film being a wash. It wasn't bad...it just was okay. It could have been so much more but really doesn't try hard enough to be anything great. The entire concept seems like it could make for an intellectual solid thriller but then it never leaves the realm of being just too juvenile. It is a thriller made for teens or something of the like because it misses the mark somehow. It isn't the performances in the movie because it is actually saved from completely monotony and movie of the week TV status by solid performances by two masters of their craft Ford and Oldman who are terrific and even better together. The few scenes they share were riveting and there was something undeniable about seeing them together for the first time since the amazing Air Force One. The film has its share of twists and turns but even the big reveal feels a little anticlimatic when its all said and done. I was comparing it to another thriller I saw earlier this year which was done so much better and smarter and that was Side Effects.Liam Hemsworth seems to be getting a lot of flack for this performance. I've read that he seems bored and delivers his lines in an excruciating way but I disagree for the most part. I think he does a solid job in the role and does what he can with a part that is really sub par. His character is a pompous egotistical floater who keeps making awful decisions regardless of whom it hurts. He plays the role well enough and because the character isn't exactly likable you have to give him respect for pulling it off. Gary Oldman is his former boss who blackmails him into doing some corporate espionage. Oldman is really really good in the role. He is so much better than the script and the story. They are so fortunate to have him in this film. His eccentric and equally egotistical billionaire is a great villain and has some great scenes. Most of them are shared with the iconic Harrison Ford who plays Steve Jobs. No that isn't who he plays but the character sort of reminded me of a fictional Steve Jobs. A self made cellular phone pioneer and former mentor to Oldman. Ford was terrific playing this man whom wins everyone's respect but there is clearly so much more to him going on. He certainly looks old in this film but his charisma hasn't changed on screen. Amber Heard one of my Hollywood crushes is decent as Emma Jennings. The chemistry between her and Hemsworth is decent but their whole relationship feels a little forced because teens won't watch a thriller without romance in it. She is better than Hemsworth but just barely. Embeth Davidtz tries hard in her role but the role is so brutally stereotypical. There is nothing to her character we haven't seen before and it feels almost campy watching her do it especially next to Oldman. She felt like Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle. Julian McMahon and Josh Holloway were both decent in their small supporting roles. And finally another legend in his own right Richard Dreyfuss plays Hemsworth's Dad. It was great to see him on screen and he was very good in another role that was excruciatingly cookie cutter.I was a little surprised to see the director of this film was Robert Luketic. He is actually a talented director but a lot of his talent has been in romantic comedies Legally Blonde Win A Date the hugely underappreciated MonsterInLaw He is perhaps the wrong genre of director to be taking on a thriller. Though his film 21 was decent enough he is too comfortable in a late teen early 20 demographic and this thriller should have been more than that. The film deals with espionage and corporate business and high end wall street type dealings but feels like you're watching teenagers play it out. It was just unfortunate that it will likely be left in the dust and forgotten about. Still if you're willing to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy a run of the mill story with two particularly strong actors then you'll enjoy it for what it is. High expectations will leave you disappointed. 6.510".

The way the story has been filmed is messy and the story in itself is made so ridiculous that I cannot take the movie seriously. I mean... the story concerns this new mobile solution that would revolutionize the whole market. And... that's okay... but the feeling I get is that this should be a serious and realistic movie. I mean... I think a movie have to pick a side either its completely fictional Minority Report style which is a good movie or it is serious Departed style. This one seem to want to take some of both. It tries to become this serious thriller that have a modern theme. Sorry but a completely unrealistic technical solution almost Sean Connery's James Bond style... I mean of course a private businessman can control any TV camera or anything... and of course a tech student can copypaste fingerprints and anything just like that! And this while the movie tries to make everything look planned by having people talking completely nonsense technical terms that doesn't even mean anything! And then...the rest of the story is also completely strange! The guy meets a woman... that rejects him. He starts at her company... she still rejects him. They go to a company event... and she suddenly loves him? And this is how the movie goes on... completely nonsense and it's pretty much going on the whole movie. Sorry. It had potential with a promising story  but they screwed it up completely!And the ending... yeah it doesn't get better. This guy wants to present his product in front of a big tech company and does a lousy job and is therefore rejected. The manager tells him to infiltrate a competitor. So they fix the guy a job with the competitor where the guy just walks in and presents a product like a god nice coincidence right?. And you can guess from the start what happens  he falls in love with a woman at the competitor company and the competitor himself seem like a good guy. So how is he going to get himself out of this one? He lies to his new love his new employer and commit several crimes trying to steal a top secret technical device funded by the government... ...just to realize its a setup and both the tech company managers are bad guys. But this student tech guy is a genius and fools them both working with FBI in secret... gets them arrested and does not get himself arrested as he helped FBI out.... And then he starts a tech company on his own because there are no shortcuts to success like looking for a job at someone elses company?! And yeah he gets the girl... even though he hacked her computer lied to her stole her phone and used her identity to steal a top secret government property. But... yeah that's nothing right?

	schema:headline " Paranoia  Doesn't Cause Any";
	schema:reviewBody "I am reasonably certain most people have not heard about this little film even with its star packed cast. What a lot of folks don't know is that August is often considered a death slot for the summer season. This is where studios send movies to die that they have little faith in. Schools are coming back in session last minute summer vacations and just the dog days of summer keep people away from the theatres by comparison to the May June and July releases. Studios will spend less time marketing with rare exceptions anything in August and if something sells its a blessing to them more than anything else. Why do I tell you all this? Because it's clear to me this is how the studio felt about this movie. A director Robert Luketic best known for his mostly unsuccessful comedy work such as Legally Blonde the Ugly Truth and Killers was given what should be a high tension corporate espionage thriller. Odd match right? The movie shows it as well with a definite lack of finesse and technique through and through.Nearly every twist and turn is telegraphed a mile away by anyone paying the closest bit of attention. Because of that moments that should have you wondering what will happen next you already have the answer. Ultimately the movies greatest sin is a lack of consequences for actions. Sure the big bad pays but there are other elements to the film that should not be tied up as neatly like a Christmas present. That isn't to say this is a bad movie folks. It sounds it but it's not bad. Bad is reserved for the equally uninspired World War Z. This film has the benefit of a relatively strong and motivated cast that I didn't feel was going through the motions. It's a testament to the actors natural ability that they could do what they did with what they had to work with.Liam Hemsworth Thors little brother yes he is as cute plays Adam Cassidy a young technician for a multi million dollar cellular company. He is up to his eyes in bills paying for his sick father Richard Dreyfuss. He is offered the proverbial golden goose by his boss played by the eternally awesome Gary Oldman who per normal puts all his passion his accents and his ability to blend into any role he does into the part. All Adam has to do for his boss is fake being a successful executive in a rival company to steal ideas from them. The owner of the other company is played by an oddly shorn Harrison Ford who felt that he needed to go toe to toe with Oldman in the acting department. Thankfully he is more than capable of keeping up though once or twice I wanted him to yell Get off my plane. The supporting cast is surprisingly talent and believable in their roles. Amber Heard as the love interest Lucas Till as the geekier best friend Julian McMahon as the wanna be heavy the weakest of the supporting and Losts Josh Holloway as an FBI agent. There are some twists but as I said before most if not all of them are telegraphed long in advance. The pacing is off the entire film however keeping you just off balance enough that it is awkward more than tension building.TLDRParanoia isn't going to be a summer sleeper but you may fall asleep watching it. Save this one for the DVD or TV you aren't missing anything.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am reasonably certain most people have not heard about this little film even with its star packed cast. What a lot of folks don't know is that August is often considered a death slot for the summer season. This is where studios send movies to die that they have little faith in. Schools are coming back in session last minute summer vacations and just the dog days of summer keep people away from the theatres by comparison to the May June and July releases. Studios will spend less time marketing with rare exceptions anything in August and if something sells its a blessing to them more than anything else. Why do I tell you all this? Because it's clear to me this is how the studio felt about this movie.

I was multitasking whilst trying to pay attention so I only caught some parts of it but I still knew the movie was horrible. Now I turned the movie off about halfway through so I can't say the WHOLE thing was bad but I'm sure Liam Hemsworth's acting didn't improve within 30 minutes. I didn't think Amber Heard was too bad but the plot and Hemsworth made no effort to make this movie work. I should have rated this a 1 but I feel so bad for everyone who took part in this film that I'm willing to give a 2.

This movie is great if you just want an entertaining thriller to keep you occupied for a few hours. I saw a lot of reviews calling it dull although it was not a boring movie if it was lacking anywhere it was in depth and intrigue but it was engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention.

That kind of story can build up some real tension in a movie. The film called Paranoia PG13 146 gets that formula backwards and actually extinguishes tension. This movie shows us all the reasons that the main character SHOULD be paranoid but he doesn't know what's happening behind the scenes so instead of being paranoid he's just oblivious.Liam Hemsworth is Adam Cassidy a cocky and ambitious young technology developer who is forced by his boss Gary Oldman to steal corporate secrets from a rival technology company CEO Harrison Ford. Embeth Davidtz does well as a woman who teaches Adam the art of corporate espionage while Richard Dreyfuss' talents are wasted in the role of Adam's ailing father.Let's see this movie has some great shots of New York City! That's about the best thing I can say about Paranoia. Unfortunately those beauty shots are few and far between much like the moments of real tension in the story. And those moments are connected by dialog and plot points that range from lame to silly to ridiculous. Of course it would've helped if more members of the cast could actually act.There are a couple halfway decent twists near the end of the movie but by then I was more interested in what time it was than what was going to happen to these characters. It's almost as if there were a conspiracy to put out a movie with a cool title and a few great actors then distribute an interesting trailer all to get ME into the theater to waste my time and money.Maybe that's just my paranoia talking.Or not.

	schema:text "    Five bittersweet vignettes that span the entire human history about five different men all called Hector and played by the same actor Robin Williams who find themselves at a critical juncture in their lives. In prehistoric times Hector lives in peace with his wife and their little son and daughter in a cave on a quite uninhabited island somewhere in the north. His world is shattered when a group of foreign pagan raiders led by a young chieftain and a somewhat pacifistic priest arrive there. In Ancient Rome Hector is a loyal welltreated slave of Lucinnius a somewhat naive big trader with political connections. When his latest shipment fails to arrive and the local corrupt governor Cyprion refuses to lend him money for his further endeavors due to bad omen that a professional soothsayer saw while reading the future from a chicken liver he is ruined. To make things worse just as Hector plans to ask his master for freedom and elope with his master's female African slave Thalia ...";

After learning it there's evolution and wisdom. This is what can be said about this film except that it presents its stories without having this sort of spiritual value. It brings this idea of the eternal returning throughout this main character but it is developed almost like a fairy tale taken out of a children's book.Travelling through different countries and periods of time going from the Celts cavemen to the modern New York businessman Being Human has Robin Williams playing a character named Hector and his appearances in distinct centuries trying to learn what means to be an human being. In the five short stories created here Hector living as an Celtic in the highlands had his wife and children taken away by barbarians was the slave of a dumb master John Turturro in a more civilized era an married man who fell in love with an foreign woman a few centuries later a military during the Portugual's Maritime Expansion on Africa conquering new lands and new treasures and as troubled divorced man trying to reconciliate with his children of whom he hasn't seen since the end of his marriage. The movie fails in being real or accurate enough in all of the stories except in the last one which is very close to us.Slow of mannered delivery and hardly getting better as the stories unfold Being Human is the kind of film that really follows its lessons it'll only grow on you after countless views. In my case four attempts of these in two I fell asleep but always believing that there was something interesting there one in which I watched the whole thing and didn't like and the last one in which my perception changed and end up being a good film far from being a masterpiece that it could be. So you'll have to watch this film over and over until you get something from it then you can evolve into really saying if this is a good or a bad film. This whole idea of a man trapped in strange and quite horrendous situations where every kind of decision ruin his life but always running to something else thinking it'll be better and lead him to a good life was brilliantly presented in a book called The Star Rover by Jack London. In it the main character is a prisoner that can recall his past lives as a way of escaping from his current pain of being tortured. But in those lives things don't get any better and he's always getting into more and more trouble. Being Human falls as an pretentious art film with symbolisms that never work and stories that are difficult to be involved with. Luckily they have Williams as a main actor and we root for him whatever the Hector he's playing. We care for Hector in all of his situations because there's something there that is involving enough to make us imagining what kind of decisions we would make if we were him. In at least one of the stories you'll put yourself into Hector's shoes. Won't blame directorwriter Bill Forsyth for the flaws presented here since this is not his original project Warner Bros. forced him to cut the film and include an narration that is quite excessive and too much explanatory. The narration provided by Theresa Russell of a film destined to grown up's treats its audience as children explaining many things we're seeing on the screen. It ruined some parts of the film. Result poor criticism an boxoffice failure and now who knows this film? I sincerely hope that one day Forsyth come out of the shadows and show to the world this film in its integrity in a director's cut DVD even the known version is hard to find. The things that attracted me into Being Human are the quality of the performances not only Williams but also Turturro Lorraine Bracco Hector Elizondo Jonathan Hyde Anna Galiena William H. Macy among others the beautiful cinematography Michael Gibbs fantastic musical score specially the music presented when the movie enters into the 20th Century an highly agitated theme. The story at times knows how to hold our interest but only for those who have an open mind to accept the concept of a man living over and over a similar life that bears only difference of costumes and periods of time. Hector's conditions and the way love acts in his life are quite the same yet he fails to learn something from these experiences. Very problematic but not enough to make you feel bad about it Being Human comes as a good film about valuable and noble lessons that sometimes crosses our paths in this long journey of life. 710".

I unaccountably became a bodhisattva for some months i. e. you could say I flipped my lid. My coworkers were terrified of me when I returned to work but my family and most everyone else I knew marveled at the change and soon grew to approve of it. For a while I was like John Travolta's character in Phenomenon. This kind of effect from watching a movie isn't unheard of in history. In fact it occurred to me on another occasion upon reading a tiny little book by an author with the pseudonym Alcyone. That a movie or book can have that type of effect on another human being implies that it's nothing short of marvelous some kind of mystic key. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll say nothing more than that. I saw it only that one time and it worked magic on me that I still can't comprehend. What a director...".

	schema:reviewBody "BEING HUMAN starts with two off screen characters in conversation with each other which does give the movie an unwanted light hearted tone . Were then introduced to Hector  Robin Williams  who is looking after his two children in a period of history that feels like the dark ages . Then a ship sails into view which heralds danger . It was at this point that I thought the story was going to revolve around Hector and his children so its a shock to the system when later on in the movie the action switches to a shipwreck in the 16th century which again features Williams character . I could forgive this because the shipwreck story is so compelling with dozens of people facing certain death because all their supplies are running out and theyre a very long way from any type of civilisation . My heart was in my mouth wondering how these poor people were going to survive . We will never know how because the action then cuts to modern day America with Hector going through a divorceSo there you go three stories linked by someone played by Robin Williams that have no real connection with one another and I felt totally disgusted by the middle story featuring the shipwreck that comes to a complete halt without any type of resolution . Talk about feeling cheated . I should also point out that if the subtext of this movie is supposed to reflect what its like to be human then surely the characters and situations on screen dont accurately reflect this . In fact theres something arrogant about the whole idea behind this movie because every single feature film from the classics like THE GODFATHER  THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and SCHINDLERS LIST all the way through to straight to video fare like CROCODILE 2 DEATH SWAMP all deal with aspects of human nature . If you want to know what its like to be human watch any film not just this one . I doubt if Ill be watching it again The only interest to be had by watching BEING HUMAN is spotting Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlysle before they became famous and several British actors before they got a role in THE BILL".

But good intentions can only carry a film too far. Despite its good intentions this film is a bust. It has its moment of fine filmmaking but it could have had way more! My Grade D";

I would rather eat popcorn staring at the wall at home. Robin Williams is my favorite actor but this is my least favorite movie. It started so peaceful the trailer was nice the cover was interesting but the movie was like walking through thick goo it takes you ages to get through and you are not comfortable. Now what a movie ay? If you want a story read a book. There was not much music practically no good effects or camera moves. Costumes were alright the dialogue was good but tedious and plus no real excitement through the whole thing. Lets just say it is a bit different hmm? The story is meaningfu but i would understand it more on a book. While you watch it you don't concentrate on the movie but the things around you. You start counting your teeth or the tiles on the floor. You bite your nails and do whatever you do when bored e.g. eat. It is truly a movie for your home with a hot meal and while its raining. But watch it anyway it may be appealing to you but no matter what happens prepare for a sleepy adventure!!!!!".

But most moviegoers are unaware of which characters or group of characters has been filmed most often. Not counting silent animated and short films madeforTV movies and foreignlanguage films TARZAN not surprisingly is 4 on the list just a few films less than were made featuring Sherlock Holmes. Topping Holmes is another detective a Chinese cop from Honolulu Charlie Chan who was in 45 pictures in all. By the way none of the actors who played him was Oriental. At the top of the heap is that gang of ruffians from the Big Apple the Bowery Boys who were in a total of 48 flicks. Not all the actors or the characters they portrayed were in all 48 but the three or four main actors and their characters stuck together for a good share of them. And before that the gang made 38 more movies as the East Side Kids and Dead End Kidsall told more than Chan and Holmes combined. What you ask does this have to do with SNOW BUDDIES? Well this AIR BUD sequel is Disney's longest running film series of all time even surpassing the LOVE BUG bunch. The sixth film prior to this AIR BUDDIES featured Bud's puppies as the main stars as does this one and presumably the next one still in production called SPACE BUDDIES. While SB has some fine voice talent in supporting roles notably Whoopi Goldberg and Kris Kristofferson the story stretches credibility with the young puppies pulling a dog sled in a grueling Alaskan race against adult dogs. But hey it's only a movie so I'll cut Disney some slack over that. But I do give the studio some grief over the way they treated their canine actors. As an animal lover who loves to watch them in movies SEABISCUIT is among my personal alltime Top Ten favorite films I was appalled that the producers cut so many corners and disregarded so many guidelines and regulations by organizations like the American Humane Association which is responsible for the endcredits line in movies with animals that states No animals were harmed in the making of this motion picture. If you want to know more of the grisly details leading to the death of five puppies during the shoot check out the blogs which accompany the User Comments and other info about this film. Sad as this case was it is to be hoped that Disney and other film makers learned some lessons from these mistakes. I would not have watched this picture if I felt Disney had no remorse over its actions. I believe their next AIR BUD picture should carry a dedication which reads something like This film is dedicated to all past and present animal actors in the AIR BUD series who have performed so well and given so much of themselves in the production of these films. As moviegoers we should insist the studio that is home to Mickey Donald and Goofy does no less. Dale Roloff".

BDawg makes the mistake of chasing a kitten whose mom is the angry Himalayan Miss Mittens. One of the other puppies sees an open ice cream truck so they all have to sneak in and have a treat. BDawg watches for humans. But he too must hide when Miss Mittens shows up so our adventure begins.It seems the ice cream is headed for Ferntiuktuk Alaska home of a legendary dog sled race. And our heroes are trapped.In Alaska Adam wants to race like his father Joe who also runs the local general store. But Joe says it's too dangerous. And he lost some of his dogs when they fell through the ice the last time he raced. Among those dogs were the parents of Shasta.Adam is good at hockeyif you're on the other teamand he is less than a model student. But we later see that if he really wants to do something he is very determined and a hard worker. He makes a wish that he can have five more puppies to join Shasta.Christmas arrives and there are five very sad children in Washington. The parents Buddy and Molly make an effort to find their puppies.Adam is sad too when he opens his presents but there is a special surprise later which he must keep hidden from his parents. Yes somehow the shipment with the puppies ended up out in the middle of nowhere and they couldn't understand why it was so cold and why the world was covered in vanilla ice cream which didn't taste very good. But Shasta rescued them and all is well. Believe it or not Adam is going to train these dogs to enter the race.With the help of Talon a wise old husky he just might do it. And this implausible plot line can only succeed because of the kindly but incompetent Sheriff Ryan whose trained rescue dog is St. Bernie.But there are many obstacles. Among them are the evil villain Jean Georges last year's winner who admits he won only because Joe lost his dogs. Francois and Phillipe are Jean Georges' mean dogs that taunt the puppies and remind them that if by some miracle they make it into the race they will not win! Other competitors come from Iceland Russia and Japan. Jean Georges has no morals and will do what he can to sabotage their efforts.So will Adam race? Will he win? What do YOU think? This is part of the Buddies series after all.This is no masterpiece and you shouldn't look for great acting though Kris Kristofferson impressed on the same day he and other country music legends performed at The Grammys. Charles Stevenson as the bumbling sheriff is also quite good.John Kapelos as the villain is the only human here who is genuinely a cartoon.The dogs are very intelligent. But it's more than a little obvious several dogs play each part. And some of the dogs don't look quite real. But a lot is demanded of them.There are a couple of only in Hollywood moments where a kid proves he can accomplish a lot.Other than that you pretty much know what to expect. But I can't say anything negative. if you're a kid it's great. And there's nothing offensive except for some potty humor that apparently qualifies as Grated these days and some minor but necessary violence in a race with an evil villain.If you already enjoyed the Buddies series and I did even though I don't like dogs you'll surely like it. If not and especially if you don't care for kids' movies well ...".

The ice cream truck's shipment is put into a plane and dropped in Alaska. The puppies meet a husky pup named Shasta and they find that the dog's owner young Adam has prayed hard for 5 more puppies so he can start a dog sled team. Must I go on yes they race they win their owners in Washington come up there and find them and it's all happy endings...Bonus though NO ONE is trying to kidnap them this time.This was just another film exploitation Disney style  this is part 7 of the series and it is fine for kids I suppose but I think adults are getting rather tired of them coming out. If your kid has air buddies he can stop there because they get worse as it goes along. C.G.I. effects and talking puppies get old very quickly.This movie is set around Christmas as many of the other Air Bud films are. There is a dog mentioned on here named Nanook and thats an obvious reference to Corey Haim's Husky in The Lost Boys movie from 1987. One stupid thing is that two Huskys had died in a previous race on this film Shastas parents yet race 2 is in the same location and the bad guy gets his dogs stuck there. Why would anyone race in a place that is an obvious danger zone...these Air Bud movies are full of little flaws like that.Robert Vince is back again as director and he is nothing special his whole career has been exploiting various animals for his films. His C.G.I. effects are hard to set through at times. Acting wise most of the cast was back Richard Karn as well as all of the kids except the main kid Noah. The adult dogs Buddy and Molly were back being voiced again by Tom Everett Scott and Molly Shannon. Whoopie Goldberg voices a cat James Belushi voices a dog and Kris Kristopherson voices Talon a huge Husky and that dog even resembles Kris.Jus another crazy talking animal movie that will shut your kids up for 80 minutes. 210 stars".

This musical version is watchable enough on its own terms but could have been better the musical version of Tom Sawyer from a similar time frame was a better film from personal perspective. The Sherman Brothers' songs apart from Freedom and Cairo Illinois are disappointingly forgettable and some of them are either not very well placedRoyalty though the number has some amusing moments or pretty lifeless most of their songs generally are timeless but Huckleberry Finn is one of their weakest overall scores. The story does lack sparkle sometimes and pacingwise there are some dull stretches. There is some evidence of Twain's writing coming through but with the political correctness treatment of Jim things can feel diluted and some of the dark tone and strong language can have a tendency to be at odds with the rest of the film. Huckleberry Finn has great costumes and sets and is very handsomely filmed especially in the ending and with the raft. There is some very funny comedy and heartfelt drama too and the ending is very moving. J Lee Thompson directs and stages things very competently and with precision if on occasions a little too carefully. The performances are good though the singing is not the best there is. Jeff East's Huckleberry is both spirited and sincere and even with the political correctness diluting Jim's character Paul Winfield is still very touchingly dignified. The chemistry between the two looks and feel really genuine. Harvey Korman and David Wayne were clever casting and both are a lot of fun and they seem to be having a ball. All in all disappointing but still watchable. 610 Bethany Cox".

'Huck Finn' is a serious novel aimed at older readers and as i recall was some 500 pages long which was why i could'nt finish it. being a darker more serious story than 'Sawyer' it weathers being a musical far less.it does'nt help that a couple of the songs really stink either. the movie gets off to a decent start and the title song 'Freedom' is actually quite good. so are the songs 'Honey Dar'lin' and the excellent 'Rose in a Bible' but pretty much all the rest are sub par. the Harvey Corman number 'Royalty' is just plain awful. and so is Corman. it's hard to imagine Harvey Corman as giving such a horrible performance since he is always so talented and funny and you think he would be just right for this role but he's not. he over acts so terribly and the song is so bad it pretty much sinks the movie at that point and it never recovers.i actually really love the Sherman bros. music for Disney but outside of Disney they are pretty much a miss. did'nt like 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'that song is obnoxious and Van Dyke is oddly wasted in that bomb hated 'The Slipper and the Rose'remember 'protocoligorically correct'? unfortunately i do. did'nt care for 'Tom Sawyer' either. his music for 'Little Nemo' was cute but not very memorable. when the Sherman Bros. are good they hit it right out of the ball park as with Disney favorites like 'Mary Poppins' and 'One and Only Family Band'. but when the Sherman Bros. miss it's like PEE YEW plug your nose. remember the mind bogglingly awful 'Monkey's Uncle' song? but at least 'Monkey' was so bad it was funny.but i'd take the 'Monkey' song over most of this uninspired tripe. i love musicals usually but here is a example of DON'T SING!!!.the cinematography is good the acting by Jeff East and others is goodespecially the actress playing the Widow Douglas. and Paul Winfield is an excellent choice for the character of nigger Jim.all in all this was one big Nonesuch.

And that awful voice he used made it hard to understand what he was saying or singing not that it was necessarily worth understanding of course.I thought the 1960 version of HF was disappointing but this one is pretty sickening.";

Of course stigma still exists around the subject but this movie brings a compelling human face to the tragedy and neglect that was brought about through ignorance and prejudice. The haunting images of the past coupled with the story telling create a 'must view' for today. As others have said it packs a powerful punch so be aware of the difficult outcomes of those involved.

The external scenes are unfortunately a little bit spoilt by the early cinema technology but still there are some rather catching shoots one worthy considering is the one where the directors shoots the young man and the wanted lady from behind while they are side by side enjoying the landscape. The two male actors are quite into their part as the student playboy and the shy bookish boy while the girl looks just like a mere inanimate object around which the whole plot is carried out but her lack of expression and preferences is perfectly undertaken by the actress and definitely wanted by the director.On the whole it's a nice easy film that shows how young students lived like in those days besides we get to know that things have changed little and that some things are common in any part of the globe. The typical lovetriangle is well carried out and in the end the friendship between the two mates is not spoilt by their misadventures and neither the playboy nor the shy could take advantages of the young lady. Moreover all their efforts ended up to be vain but since they are young and happy they could accept the fact without regretting to much about it. Ozu tells us perfectly how sometimes we should laugh at our youth mistakes or bad luck instead of letting them driving us crazy.

Ozu's filmmaking is more mainstream than what he's known for utilizing dissolves handheld camerawork and clever point of view shots to capture the thrills and spills of the ski slopes. Ozu's characteristically lovely moments of human intimacy are in evidence but they have yet to be as sharply composed pared down to the graphic simplicity that is his hallmark. It seems evident that a younger more carefree Ozu directed this  it's relatively slight but extremely affable depiction of youth  one wonders what wonders Ozu would have done with AMERICAN PIE.".

I can see where you're coming from if you think like this but Ozu's too good of a filmmaker to suffer what I think is a serious simplification.Following Ozu's career is a like film school really. Here already he's ferociously adventurous when it comes to framing and the techniques and angles he's implementing show a great understanding of what film can do  remember that film was very new then only 34 years old.

Like most college movies of the era the academic life is something to be dreaded and handwaved away and after they get through finals it's off to the ski resort where the real plot of the story begins the competition over pretty Junko Matsui that has been simmering since the first scene.When looking at the early works of a great artist you try to find the roots of his future greatness but there's little of that here. The Ozu that is revered is still and contemplative and Japanese. This one has a moving camera and pratfalls an American movie poster on the wall in this one it's SEVENTH HEAVEN and product placement for Sun Maid raisins and Libby's canned vegetables. Chishu Ryu is present in a small role as a fearsome professor the core of Ozu's troupe but the film is very international in its tenor as if he is waiting for William Fox to swing through Japan in case the recently hired Leo McCarey doesn't work out. Ozu was 26 when he made this and still at the stage of his career when he probably didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up. A buddy comedy about two college boys?

One day Raja seen a young village girl Gauri and sent her a photo of Shankar. Gauri liked him and agreed to marry but Raja was in his place during the so called marriage and now she is trapped in his mansion. Shankar felt really sorry for Gauri and after a really bad incident Shankar was provoked he took Gauri  ran out and that is where the action starts with many unpredictable twists  turns. Koyla was inspired by many action movies including Rambo First Blood  Hard Target but it doesn't mean that the film is bad.

Sure we have hybrids such as the romanticcomedy and comedyhorror and perhaps even actionthrillerromance...but we ain't got NOTHIN' equivalent to the glorious Bollywoodtype films from south asia India in particular.One moment Koyla is a brutal action flick a la Bronson gratuitous and graphic violence and carnage the next moment Shah Rukh Khan is lipsyncing cheezyyetinfectious pop music to the woman he loves yes my friends musicals CAN kick butt followed by Shah Rukh Khan's comedic thwarting of his persuers only to be jolted back by the ruthlessness of Rajasaheb an overthetoptothepointofinsanity performance by the veteran actor Amrish Puri who played Mola Ram in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Amrish Puri can certainly play a villain but whereas the character of Mola Ram is a generic arbitrary villain the character of Rajasaheb is truly despicable because the audience witnesses the injustices he perpetrates. Give me a compelling reason to hate the bad guy and root for Indiana I demanded.  Spielberg fails to do so and so i have always rooted for Mola Ram in Temple of Doom.  Similarly I rallied behind the Decepticons and C.O.B.R.A. in my youth as a T.V. casualty.  But honestly what did you expect from a crapmaster like Spielberg?.Ahh Rajasaheb is a badguy you love to hate!  Actually bad guy is an understatementhe's a loveable elderly sadistand I guarantee that you too will love to hate Rajasaheb!  A convincing antagonist is a crucial ingredient for any action film because it drives the whole drama of the film.  Unfortunately few films successfully succeed in delivering a villain you love to hate.  Koyla delivers.Shah Rukh Khan is great as well and really hams up his performance playing Shanker. I must however admit that i am a sucker for any film starring Shah Rukh Khan.  I encourage you to see all his filmseven the countless bollywood romanticcomedies that he is inyou will rarely be disappointed.KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN for one of the most ludicrous ridiculous  insanely POOR special effects occurring at the CLIMAX of this film.  Without spoiling this cinematic delight let me simply say that it involves an axe slowmotion etc... Even if we ignore the poorly executed FX the heavyhanded use of slomo harkens back to the glory days of primecheezeUSAaction films circa 1980's.SEE THIS FILM NOW.  Even if you hate the film you'll dig the musical sequences with the bangrahindipop music.  Yes the actors are lipsyncing to other artists' songsbut you won't care.Bonus trivia Koyla means coal by the way.  Now do you see the significance of the this film's title?IF YOU LIKE KOYLA but want more blood and less comedy then I recommend Shakti The Power 2002.  Shah Rukh Khan has a minor part in it providing the only levity in an otherwise brutal film the spirit of Cannon's action films of the 80's lives on!!!".

	schema:headline " A different kind of Bollywood movie";
	schema:reviewBody "At first I hated this movie. Amrish Puri was so evil he scared me to bits and Madhuri Dixit's character Gauri seemed to be a nitwit. I have always loved seeing Madhuri in intelligent strong and charming parts Dil Hum Aapke Hain Koun Dil To Pagal Hai so seeing her act like a 2year old was annoying. And then... Somewhere in the middle the movie all started to click and I really started enjoying it. Shah Rukh Khan put in a fantastic performance which I absolutely loved. He was raw yet charming simple yet mysterious and pulled off his role of deceived mute man who becomes 'enlightened' perfectly. A reviewer here said something about the fact that he could sing in the musical numbers but is supposed to be mute...but that reviewer obviously does not realise that songs are usually a suspension of reality in Bollywood movies. Characters usually can do anything and everything during a musical number! Besides in most of the songs it was a trick with Johnny Lever's character that 'enabled' Shah Rukh's character to sing. Madhuri Dixit's character Gauri actually grew up and became much more likable. Madhuri ended up pulling off a fascinating portrayal of a young childish girl who is dragged into maturity by evil. Who wouldn't grow up anyway when faced with the terrors of Amrish Puri's Rajasaheb? And the relationship between Gauri and Shanker SRK's character is really sweet complex and perfectly captured.Rajasaheb though terrifying irritating and very overthetop now strikes me as a fairly good characterisation. Like another reviewer said on here a villain that we love to hate is hard to find. see 'Dushman' starring Kajol for Ashutosh Rana in a fantastic portrayal of another 'villain you love to hate'  much better than the one in 'Koyla' in my opinion. I loved the other actors as well the girl who played Rajasaheb's secretary was particularly good. Johnny Lever though very silly as usual the actor who played Lever's father and Mohnish Behl in a brief but strikingly tragic appearanceall put in wellrounded and credible performances. Very nice work.The film is pretty violent and sometimes shocking one particular attack actually made me physically jump but I think it was a case of justifiable violence. The director Rakesh Roshan was trying to achieve a certain rawness and he definitely succeeded. It does make you wonder though if he was going through some kind of blood and gore phase at that point in his filmmaking career. All in all 'Koyla' is very unusual for a Bollywood film and that in my opinion is what makes it worth seeing.I started out hating it and finished it very happy. It is a satisfying and entertaining movie.".

Shahrukh on the other hand totally overacted like he did in the other few action movies he made with the exception of Darr of course but that was a different role. He kept screaming annoyingly loud and grunting in the action sequences. No wonder he has kept away from action movies for the last 15 years with the exception of Don but there was no convincing action on his part there  mostly car chases. The music is good and so is the story. Amrish Puri is as great as ever in his role. Could've been much better had they chose someone like Salman Khan to deal with the action sequences as effortlessly as he does.Verdict worth a watch once or twice.

Also the part in the song Tanhai Tanhai where Shankar braids Gauri's hair How romantic is that? It's a beautiful movie. Amazing plot and amazing editing. Worth watching it with or without subtitles. The songs and the lyrics are well prepared and good. it's really heartbreaking to see Shankar being mute servant and get beaten up by Birjwa. He can't even talk to prove his innocence but his eyes say it all. Amazing acting Shahrukh!

	schema:reviewBody "I am no expert on Indian films though compared to most other Americans I definitely am unusual because I have seen a couple hundred films from this country. In seeing these films one thing I have noticed is that in many of the country's movies which were made up to about 2000 is that the musical numbers were often very poor with music and singing that is obviously canned. This is NOT the case today...and the musical numbers are often fantastic in the films and the highlight of the pictures. But with Koyla it comes in near the end of this more primitive period...and the musical numbers are pretty awful. Add to that some terrible overacting by the comic relief in the film such as the Doctor and his idiot son and you've already got a couple serious strikes against this movie from the onset. The director Rakesh Roshan clearly can be blamed for much of this.The story finds Raja Saab Amrish Puri the Lord of the land. While on the surface he seems like a kind and just man it's all an act. At heart he's evil cruel and a total jerkfaceas is his awful younger brother. Saab is a dirty old man who has eyed the lovely Gauri Madhuri Dixit. But she refuses to consent to any marriage until she can see a photo of her fianc. Since Raja Saab is old he decides to substitute the photo of his handsome mute servant Shanker Shah Rukh Khan. Not surprisingly when Gauri sees the dirty old man on their wedding day she refuses to marry and Raja Saab's anger is unleashed and she's kept his prisoner. Rape and murder are among the infamous things Saab and his brother commit following this wedding rebuff. But since Shah Rukh Khan always seems to play the handsome hero you will likely assume that by the end of the picture all will be well and justice will be restored...or will it? After all once Saab's wrath in unleashed on poor Shanker he might not live long enough to do anything heroic. The shame of all this is that the plot is quite good and there is a good film hidden underneath the occasional overacting lapses in writing and mediocre canned singing. I cannot see giving this one anything better than a 5 because of these defects...and this is a bit generous. While I usually hate remakes this one could stand a remake. Put Shah Rukh Khan in it again...and get rid of the awful comic relief!!!The first musical number is the strangest. The song is sung by Gauri and a bunch of children and it's all about the cannabis they've just eaten!The Doctor behaves almost exactly like Le Fou in Beauty and the Beast. However Beauty and the Beast is a cartoon that is mostly for kids...so why does the Doctor behave almost like a cartoon?! Yes the acting is that broad and that bad with him and a few of the comic relief characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Nun might be just another very good possibly excellent and heartbreaking piece of religion is rotten and the people in it control people in terrible and soulcrushing ways moviemaking akin to Carl Dreyer if not for its last third or maybe second half it's something of that length. For a good while Jacques Rivette's film from the book by Denis Diderot is about Suzanne Anna Karina a young woman who is passed along from her parents one the mother wanting to go to the afterlife clean without the burden of her sin which was connected to Suzanne's father not really being her father to a convent and forced to say she will be celibate and devout and all that jazz. Jazz as in life as a nun forced to say that she believes wholly in God and will deny herself everything in order to serve him when he calls or feels like it of course.In this first half or so the film is about as close as one can get outside of Carl Dreyer to it being about the pain inflicted upon an innocent in a world dominated by a a natural prejudice towards women in this case to go completely rigidly by the rules  or b for that matter a hell placed upon those who dont want to be nuns and just want to experience something else in the world. We see Suzanne subjected to this convent at first run by a helpful and loving Mother Superior Mme de Moni only to die and her replacement be so hardpressed as to eventually see Suzanne as being possessed by a devil keeping her away from the other nuns locked up without food or water or any legal counsel. This part seems straightforward as does the eventual PriestsfindoutMmeisunrelentingandtransferher story progression... but something very fascinating happens something that makes The Nun from what is already a heartrending and tasteful story of repression and super 18th century Christian fervor into a great film. The second convent on first appearance is total bliss compared to the former one. Suzanne is treated to happy nuns a happy Mother Superior Simonin and even some lighthearted revelry like playing games outside something that would have never happened at the previous convent. But there's also an underlying uneasiness that is confirmed by the Mother Superior being how should I say clingy to at first Suzanne's story and then Suzanne herself. It's not just enough for Rivette by way of the book to show religion being domineering and cruel and at best complacent in the expected sense but for another look at what should be religious organization run by caring and spiritual people to be also total kooks. It's like Rivette puts down this section of some fun like the slightest of reprieves and then to bring it back under the rug and it's something really special to see. It's a bleak story not simply because a woman who has no rightful place in a convent of nuns is forced into it and made into another cog in the religious machine but for the lack of hope conveyed in what good there is the goodness of people devoted to a life of faith that is revealed. It's an incredibly precise indictment on organized religion and society that allows how it runs as much as captivating morality drama.The Nun can also be read as a searing feminist statement but going into this part might make this too long a review. Suffice to say The Nun a controversial film at the time made from a controversial book of its time conveys what it wants to say in stark locations and even starker performances from the supporting cast. The two actresses playing the significant Mother Superiors in the story deserve credit yet the main reason to see the picture is for Anna Karina. She makes a sense of purpose in every scene a performance that is startling for it being so removed from exhusband Godard's usual selfconscious comedydramas and into something that requires her to plunge the depths of whatever she can handle emotionally for the character. It turns out to be the best serious performance of her's I've seen to date outside of maybe Vivre sa vie. Suzanne thanks to Karina is so sad a character so right in her common sense and driven almost mad by this rigid and monstrous Christian dogma that you cant take your eyes off her for a second. It's rare to see a performance this tender and selfless to the dark and light in human being. A".

	schema:headline " Atypically formalist rigorous work from Rivette is one of his greatest and most moving films";
	schema:reviewBody "La Religieuse The Nun is Rivette's second feature not finished and shown until six years after his first Paris nous appartient and not given a significant release until the following year  and even then banned from being shown to anyone under 18 in France and completely banned in French overseas possessions.What was all the fuss about? There's no nudity no strong language no violence to speak of  what got the French censors up in arms about was in fact one of the harshest attacks on organized religion  or at least on Catholicism as it used to be practised in France two centuries earlier  ever filmed. La Religieuse based on an unfinished 1780 novel by Denis Diderot is the story of Suzanne Simenon a young woman in the problematic circumstance of being forced into convent life because of her mother's transgressions and her father's failures in business and her attempts to escape this situation which as you might imagine required much effort in the 18th century.Suzanne played in an extraordinary performance by Anna Karina is in fact quite pious virginal innocent and naive she seems to be fairly intelligent and musically talented but she is also very independent and for all her real and honest belief in God cannot submit to the structured life and rigorous discipline of convent life. At first she is somewhat comforted by a kind mother superior who admits to having had some of the same problems of having no vocation  of having no particularly feeling for monastic life. But her kind and understanding leader soon dies and is replaced by a rigorous and intolerant young woman who despises Suzanne  despises the slightest bit of nonconformity  from the first. Suzanne's life becomes intolerable more so even when she writes to a lawyer to try to be freed from the convent eventually some pity is taken on her once it is learned how badly she has been treated shunned given no food and no change of clothes not allowed to pray and that her mother superior is possibly deranged  and Suzanne is moved to another convent.This new location is problematic in its own way though  at first it seems lively carefree and joyous but Suzanne soon becomes the object of a different kind of unwanted attention from the young and very sexual mother superior and finds that here too freedom is completely impossible. Karina manages to show the slow progression from complete naivet to adult understanding  and despair  without ever seeming to lose faith in her God though she may be losing her belief in humanity. It's a powerful statement made mostly in the eyes a curled lip shoulders  there are a couple of manic scenes but they are never overdone or overlong we get what we need to understand a spirit in torture. When finally she does manage to make an exit she finds that life on the outside world for an uneducated and moral young woman without money is no better and Rivette finishes the film and Suzanne's life the only way possible...Most critics will remark that this is Rivette's most conventional film and so it may be on the surface the narrative is very easy to follow the scenes are quite fluid and the editing fairly simple the storyline lacks any of the fantasy whimsy or narrative play that most of his other films are full of  but look closer. Certainly this is the director's most overtly politicalsocially critical film  though even here it is careful in its balance. Suzanne is not an atheist does not hate the church she simply does not belong in this life and the film's anger is at a society and a religious organization that doesn't care about her feelings or even her life. It is antitotalitarian not at all antispiritual.The structure of the film is quite remarkable as well though its most obvious innovations or experimentations are with sound rather than image. The score is a modernist percussive and often harsh one and the sounds of nature of the world outside the convent walls are often powerfully amplified. Inside is only the life of rules and orders to be followed without question  outside are birdsong the howling wind bells and horses' hooves on pavement. Most scenes are composed of a single shot typically a minute or two in length Rivette's original design was to have both sound and image mimic the monastic cell though the end result didn't work out exactly as he had hoped. Still he and his collaborators most notably composer JeanClaude Eloy and the sound department headed by Michel Fano create a world terrifyingly powerful in its ability to destroy a body if not a soul and yet still exist as a false and beautiful incentive never to be grasped by a young woman without hope or ability. The further from her initial jaillike surroundings she gets the more she finds that she only eludes one kind of prison for another  and the further we go in the film the harsher and angrier the music and the aural surrounding become.Like every Rivette film I've seen this improves on multiple viewings I first saw this on the first release of the complete uncut film in the USA in 1990 later again video and a third time just now. Though I'm sure some will be put off by the subject matter or the depressing storyline anyone with an interest in this great director and certainly anyone interested in the plight of women in film  Rivette's model in many ways in this film is the work of protofeminist Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi  should really see this. It stands with the best of the New Wave and Karina's performance proves that she wasn't just the pretty face that she typically is in Godard's work.".

	schema:headline " A Major Work of the French Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "During the 17th and 18th centuries it appears to have been quite common in Catholic countries for young women to be forced to enter convents against their will this is for example the fate of one character in Manzoni's The Betrothed written in 1827 but set around 200 years earlier. La Religieuse by Denis Diderot is another work of literature which deals with the same problem. The main reason for this phenomenon was economic although many convents required a dowry from prospective entrants this was generally less than the amount of the dowry needed to attract a suitable husband and once the girl had taken her vows the family no longer had any responsibility for her upkeep. In the case of Diderot's heroine Suzanne Simonin however there is another problem. She is the offspring of an extramarital affair and her mother's husband is not her biological father. Suzanne's mother therefore resolves to shut her daughter up in a convent partly because she believes that this will prevent her husband from discovering the truth partly because the presence of the girl in the family home is a constant reminder of her adulterous affair about which she now has a guilty conscience. The film follows the unhappy Suzanne's life as a nun. It falls into three sections corresponding to the three Mothers Superior under whom she serves. The first Madame de Moni is a kindly woman who knows that Suzanne has only entered into the religious life with great reluctance and does her best to make the girl's life bearable. When de Moni dies however the new Mother Superior the fanatical and puritanical Sister SainteChristine takes a dislike to Suzanne whom she sees as rebellious treating her harshly whipping her putting her on a diet of bread and water and forbidding the other nuns to have anything to do with her. SainteChristine is also referred to by her family name Madame de Tourmont a name probably chosen because of its similarity to tourment French for torment. With the assistance of a sympathetic lawyer Suzanne asks to be released from her vows on the grounds that she was forced to become a nun against her will. This application is unsuccessful but at least she is transferred to another convent. SainteChristine is reprimanded by the Bishop for her treatment of Suzanne but is not otherwise punished. This change in Suzanne's fortunes however is not necessarily for the better. Whereas SainteChristine's regime was characterised by an excess of religious zeal life in the new convent is marked by an almost total lack of it. The nuns pay only the bare minimum of attention to their religious observances spending most of their time in gossiping eating and drinking and frivolous entertainments. Suzanne is befriended by the Mother Superior Madame de Chelles who despite her elevated rank is a gay in the original sense lighthearted young woman not much older than Suzanne herself. What the naive Suzanne fails to realise is that her new friend is also gay in the modern sense of the word and is offering her rather more than platonic friendship. There are some excellent performances from Anna Karina as the nave but spirited Suzanne Liselotte Pulver as the hypocritical de Chelles Francine Berg as SainteChristine and Francisco Rabal as Dom Morel a priest who offers to help Suzanne but might also have selfserving motives. For a French movie this one is surprisingly international Karina was Danish Pulver Swiss and Rabal Spanish. Another important role is played by the German Wolfgang Reichmann. When this film was made in 1966 it was promptly banned by the French authorities. It might have been the swinging sixties in the AngloSaxon world but De Gaulle's France was a surprisingly conservative place. The authorities objected to what they saw as a disrespectful attitude to the Catholic Church even though the action takes place 200 years in the past and the events depicted are fictitious ones. The film however is not particularly erotic in Diderot's novel Suzanne and de Chelles actually end up in bed together the younger girl is too innocent to realise what is happening to her but this scene is omitted from the film. The decision to omit this scene was I think the correct one as La Religieuse was not made as a softporn fantasy but as a serious examination of three different types of religious hypocrisy that of de Chelles that of Suzanne's parents and that of SainteChristine whose treatment of Suzanne owes more to an innate sadism than it does to genuine religious fervour. The serious nature of the film is emphasised by the austere look which director Jacques Rivette brings to it. Most of the action takes place in enclosed rooms giving it a claustrophobic feel and the predominant colour is the grey of the convent walls and of the nuns' habits. The moral climate in France gradually became more liberal the ban was soon lifted and today La Religieuse can be seen as a major work of the French cinema. 810".

Since today's standards mostly rely on 3D technology to capture realistic and fluid movements in animation this movie shatters the limits I thought really existed in 2D animation. Since animation marvels like Samurai Champloo back in 2005 Chinese and Japanese sword arts never looked so good in an anime. However yes 3D technology was used in making this movie but only to a limited extent to which it only deemed necessary like cameras panning to arrows panning fluidly on background terrain and such. All the organic character movements were hand drawn so perfectly well that even all the action was so clear which is just a marvel to see over and over again. The story may not be the most original but at the same time it isn't bad at all. In fact the characters of this movie retain their depth throughout the entire film which makes it easy for any viewer especially who appreciates animation to look past it as the movie alone offers plenty of intriguing visuals that sincerely complement the story backed by a superb soundtrack which captures the very essences and themes of the setting. Highly recommended for anime enthusiasts as well as anyone who appreciates cartoons. in fact they shouldn't miss this one as watching this film once simply isn't quite enough.".

You get a good sense of the main character without them going into a long epilogue. The characters are well drawn with great attention to detail especially in the action sequences which in my opinion are drawn very well. The score goes perfectly with all the different scenes of the movie. I am pretty good on what good anime samurai flicks are out and I am surprised that I never got a heads up about this one and also why this film wasn't nominated for any type of award. Honestly from the action to the music this movie will grab you. ".

In my opinion it is flawless in its way and even though I do remember that there was a movie not animated which felt almost the same because in it there was also a samurai walking around with a child it still felt fresh and cool and not old fashioned at all.

Voice acting is amazing and makes the characters believable. Watching in the original language is a must. the movie isn't perfect but then again nothing is and the little flaws it has may have been sacrifices for the greater good of the movie or simply don't get in the way of the main purpose of the flick. sword of the stranger is a great movie that has a mixture of elements in the exact measurement to do one thing and that is make the incredible action stand out never the near perfect art direction incredible music and voice actingthe well written plot or any of the other elements of the movie take the main stage but that is how it was intended. action is the most important element and the rest is there to make the action rock but like a masterful painting it shows what you as much as want to see it can be great action or much much more but that is for the viewer to decide. These movie is a classic in my book and must not be missed movies these good don't come close to one another and it may take many years before another piece of these magnitude takes form.".

Because the other parts of the movie have been worked out better than most of the movies I've seen so far. Let's begin with the looks of the movie. For a pretty much traditional drawn anime it is just beautiful. And it gets even better with the action scenes. They are drawn animated and captured very well. They are fast but clear they contain a lot of cool moves if you can put it that way and are supported by absolute wonderful sound effects and music. The thing that really captured me and makes me watch the final scene over and over again is the perfect balance between action and music.

The animation one of the best I've seen in recent animated movies with great design fluid animations and great image quality. While not many in number the battles are masterfully handled by BONES animation studio with great animated choreography. As I've said the concept behind the story isn't new but it's enjoyable nonetheless I really liked the trust relationship that forms between the main character and the boy he is escorting and there is also a special connection between Nanashi and the main antagonist. In the end you will be caring for the characters.Finally and it should not be overlooked. The Soundtrack for this movie is truly wonderful.

Everything that was great about the ninjasamurai animations in the 90's reemerged onto this film and I think its safe to say that the choreography far excelled that of its predecessors. The story as vague as it may have been did enough to keep my interest but in the end it was the fight scenes that kept me compliant to watch further. Not often do you find a final battle to be so intense pushing the boundaries of fluid animation that your eyes are glued to every moment of the fight. I really can't say enough about this film. At a time where many anime have become primarily viewed in a TV series format Sword of the Stranger was a breath of fresh air and nostalgic return to what I loved so much about anime feature films.

At a time where many anime have become primarily viewed in a TV series format Sword of the Stranger was a breath of fresh air and nostalgic return to what I loved so much about anime feature films. For any fan of Ninja ScrollDagger of Kamui Samurai X and other great anime classics this one is for you trust me.";

A noble house that is being used by the emperor of china to find and kill a small boy for his blood in order for immortality to be achieved. In the middle are the boy and the hunters yet in the grey corner is a lone wolf Exgeneral who's past is as mysterious as the ritual itself. And when the boy and this past soldier cross paths they develop a close bonding friendship which defeats the fanatical cultists. But not too far away is the samurai who is also hunting this boy for negotiations leverages. Between the Samurai cultists and one psychotic warrior who wants nothing more than to cut down any opponent in his path it's all or nothing for the no named soldier to save this small boy from inevitable death. This movie had every known element to give the fans a real look at what the life was to being a samurai. And how even the common folk struggled to get by each day between dynasties. Beautiful fight scenes and no holds barred sword play the music was top notch and the scenery was captivating. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys to watch the old school ways of what it was like to be a part of the samurai code. And what it means to understand those conflicts. Excellent film.".

Its one that even though is not a normal pick for me I do like it.The story follows a Ronin by the name of 'Nameless' and no that's a joke. His name really means Nameless but for this review we will call him by his Japanese name Nanashi. Nanashi travels with a young boy whose only companion is Tobimaru his dog who he would do anything for. You would be surprised to know that the dog is actually a really important part of the show. He is what keeps Nanashi and the boy Kotaro. The story his heartwarming and could bring a tear to your eye.I have a small feeling that this show was either done on a small budget or this was before Bones got good. I'm thinking the budget because this show's animation is actually rather low quality when the action isn't happening. Most of the characters have really large chins that seem to be more like tumors hanging there rather then actual things that connect to the rest of the face. Most of the unimportant characters have white eyes or are rather small. Other then that the faces and scenes most of the time are really well detailed in that you can see almost every little line that is in their faces. The animation does get better as the story goes on and started to grow on me. I believe they looked at old Live action movies in order to get the look and feel because the movements are pretty spoton. You can tell that's where the budget went mostly.The English dub is actually really well done. They decided to change things around a little like when someone is translating for other characters they use a more Japanese or Chinese language rather then just using actual English I believe Chinese for the enemy's names. This helps distinguish between the native people and the outsiders a bit.".

To me this felt a bit like Rurouni Kenshin Tsuiokuhen meets Juubee Ninpuuchou but at the same time unique in it's own way. A young boy is to be used in a sacrificial ritual. Boy hires a rounin for his protection. Some Chinese Ming clanarmy has been hired to catch the boy. The story though not bad is not mind boggling or very unique it's a retelling of stories we have heard before. However the way that it tells it sometimes just by pure action or visuals is very decent. 810Art... easy. Very good. Good shadow work. Rich and detailed. Colors backgrounds and scenery often felt very right. 910Sound... a bit harder. Ambient sounds are solid. The music was quite good and in some parts it felt just right in others... not wrong at all. However not epic either. At parts I couldn't help but feeling other movies had moments like this and with epic music lifting the whole scene. I would have giving it a 10 if it was a perfect match for every scene and moment. Still a very solid 910.Even though we have seen the types of characters before they still grow on you. This movie uses different ways to let you feel connected to them. What they have done is done before... but at least they did it very well. The characters don't develop a great deal over time rather you get to know them better and better. The Ming foreigner feels very unique. And his skills is popping on screen so hard a split second I almost rooted for him thus killing our main character.... A deserved 910.Enjoyment... 1010! Epic! Delicious! We want more! More!!And now I wish there was a separate category for choreography. Because it was very very very good. The action was a real feast. The unique and different styles all are shown really well. The Ming warriors with their different weapons and kung fu and are main hero's kenjitsu sword techniques if I use that correctly ... they are all animated so spectacular realistic. The fights are almost art at times. They have outdone and transcended themselves. So... choreography a perfect 1010.If only the whole movie was flawless. I really want to give it a 1010 but I can't in all honestly. But I feel giving a 9 is selling it short. Because this is something you just have to have watched at least once. Dmn this system. I'm not going to choose between a 910 and a 1010. I'll ignore the system and give it not only a 9.510 but also a VERY STRONG recommendation. Go watch this now. Seriously.".

The Story isn't new but there is just enough Charisma And Character development to make you care about the Antagonist. The Child and Dog Relationship feels real and unlike other anime kids that just annoy get in the way and frustrate the audience Kotoruo has a lot of strength for a Boy his age.The Movie takes a Lull after the amazing opening fight sequence to deliver some debatable but needed exposition which lost me for a few minutes but things begin to pick up again and it pulls together in a spectacular finish.The fight scenes. Oh the fight scenes. The attention to detail is Top Notch and the camera angles keep you in battle without being too nauseating and bodies drop enough blood to satisfy the most avid sword fight fans.The musical Score is catchy as it is beautiful. I do feel it gets a tad repetitive in some instances but is easily forgivable.All in all its a fine movie and I'm a little embarrassed it took me so long to see it post release.".

	schema:headline " Great Anime!";
	schema:reviewBody "Sword of the Stranger is highly unnoticed film here on IMDb and only has around 4 thousand people who have voted for it. This Anime deserves to be recognized for its beautiful animation its characters for its music and soundtrack and for the good film that is. It is just the perfect length around 1 hr and 40 mins and it is fun the whole way throughout. The director Masahiro Ando has previously worked on Animes such as Cowboy Bepop and Ghost in the Shell and this time he has crafted an impressive and stylish anime with lots of dedication.A young boy and his dog find themselves the target of the Ming a foreign dynasty that will stop at nothing. One day a quiet and solemn warrior crosses their path and becomes irrevocably connected with the two. A deal is struck and the warrior agrees to take the boy to a remote Buddhist temple where a kind monk is waiting to care for him and the dog. Unfortunately the Ming have sent their elite and they will test their strength courage and quality every step of the way.First off I want to say is that one of the things that really struck me about this anime was the amazing soundtrack. The music really comes to life during the battle scenes and the incorporation of drums like in the beginning sequence just alleviates the action even more and gives it that awesome feeling. Whoever composed the music should be proud of themselves. The story isn't really original and is kindof stereotypical but its numerous characters really make this a different kind of anime to watch. The characters are really well done and they also look great as well. One of the main faults is that the story could've been a bit more original but it didn't really affect the viewing experience for me.To all those who call themselves Anime freaks they should be ashamed if they haven't already watched this. It doesn't matter if you like anime or not because this film breaks those boundaries and offers a marvelous anime with lots of heart. A really good film! 810 'Over and out.' 16 April 2012".

	schema:headline " The best slasher film a real terror enjoyable movie from New Line Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Freddy Vs. Jason in my opinion is really enjoyable slasher film ever from two slasher icons Freddy Krueger A Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason Voorhees Friday the 13th. I have enjoyed this film a lot last night. Ken Kirzinger is a great Jason. Tough not my favorite Jason but I enjoy the kills. Jason kills mostly of the people. I appreciate Robert Englund's performance and the make up in Freddy Vs. Jason more.I love the end which is set in Crystal Lake. Kelly Rowland was great as Kia she was one hot babe. Monica Keena was great heroine she helped Jason to defeat Freddy. The actress really well acted. This is the best movie so far for me I wish there would be more horror movies like this one today. I am glad this movie come out in 2003. It was a good slasher movie fun and entertaining. Robert Englund is and always will be the only Freddy Krueger. Jason defeated Freddy on the end off the film in my opinion Jason won.The only enjoyable Friday the 13th film from New Line Cinema that they made. Ronny Yu directed well this film and it is really underrated in my opinion this movie also made the highest ranking in A Nightmare on Elm Street movies. It is my third personal favorite in Elm Street series but in Friday the 13th rank I gave it on eight spot I did enjoy however Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning a little more than Freddy vs. Jason because it is more an Elm Street movie than Friday the 13th movie. Both icons acted the way they are in the franchise. This movie is MILES way better to me than Wes Craven's New Nightmare that's my opinion if you don't like the film it is okay. I love the this film to death I love it so much and I appreciate more. I love the party at night in corn filed in which Jason kills people with his machete badass you have gore and bloody squibs wow.I have enjoyed this movie more than Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood and the last 4 films. This was a real horror movie and that a good one. It is definitely my favorite Jason movie of all time. This is the last good film and underrated gem in the horror genre franchise and it is my favorite slasher film I love it to death! This the last good Freddy and Jason film in which both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises were both rebooted. This is the last Freddy movie in which Robert Englund performed the last time his character Freddy Krueger. I watched making off this film in 2003 and I saw an interview with Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy for this film.These enemies fight and travel all the way from Elm Street to Crystal Lake. If you like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th or any horrorthriller for that matter then this movie is definitely for you. It is possibly one of the best horrors I've seen.I am a huge fan of Friday the 13th for the reason it's more gory classic horror movie franchise than jump and A Nightmare on Elm Street.I am giving a 1010  an outstanding score this is the final Freddy movie in the franchise that I consider the last good Freddy movie. Here we got a killer from Camp Crystal Lake and a killer who haunts in your dreams.".

This the last good Freddy and Jason film in which both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises were both rebooted. This is the last Freddy movie in which Robert Englund performed the last time his character Freddy Krueger. I watched making off this film in 2003 and I saw an interview with Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy for this film. I know Robert is old so his stuntman was doing the stunts for him. I rented VHS Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare in the video store that summer in 2003 because I am the biggest Freddy fan I always loved Freddy Krueger in all his movies except part 5 and the remake I still own Part 5 on DVD and Bluray collection. I am getting this movie on Bluray after new year that it is missing in my collection. I am a fan of Jason Voorhees the best movie that I really love to death is Jason Lives Friday the 13th Part VI 1986 the best one in the franchise apart from Friday the 13th The Final Chapter Friday the 13th Part III Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood and the original movie of course I love them so much to death.Plot The two biggest icons of the slasher genre finally meet in Freddy vs. Jason in a frightening showdown in hell! Banished there for eternity Freddy Krueger Robert Englund devises a plan to manipulate Jason into continuing his work hacking up the teenagers of Elm Street. All goes well at first until Jason realizes he's been duped by 'the dream master' and is none too pleased. Coaxed by surviving teenagers Will Jason Ritter Lori Monica Keena and Kia Kelly Rowland Jason and Freddy descend up Crystal Lake for a battle royale! I love this movie and cast did an excellent job. Chinese director Ronny Yu directed perfectly this short horror flick that I absolutely loved it. Robert Englund was excellent in his last role as horror icon Freddy. Ken Kirzinger as Jason Voorhees did a wonderful job. Ken even played Rusty Nail in Joy Ride 3 honestly he did a wonderful job and I like him. Monica Keena as Lori Campbell was great heroine in this movie and she was a great sole survivor. There was also Brendan Fletcher in this movie I remember him from Anatomy of a Hate Crime 2000 as Mark Davis a prisoner who escaped from jail and Jason Ritter as Will Rollins they both did great. Kelly Rowland as Kia Waterson was also good.This movie is not like any old crossover. The link between Freddy and Jason is really amazing and the whole concept of Freddy vs Jason is really cool. A great movie overall. This is no ordinary clash between to classic characters. At first it might seem that Freddy and Jason are working together but you are sorely mistaken this quickly turns into a fight to the death. These enemies fight and travel all the way from Elm Street to Crystal Lake. If you like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th or any horrorthriller for that matter then this movie is definitely for you. It is possibly one of the best horrors I've seen.I am a huge fan of Friday the 13th for the reason it's more gory classic horror movie franchise than jump and A Nightmare on Elm Street. So this made for the one of the best movies ever with the perfect mix of gore and jumpiness. Have a spare pair on underwear when you watch Things I love about this movie Freddy cuts Jason's fingers off gouges his eyes out and then proceeds to whack the hell out of him with his Own machete badass scene! Even though not completely a Freddy movie this one still deserves to be in the A Nightmare Elm Street favorite horror movies franchise. I enjoyed it. And I don't care what anyone says Freddy kicked the living  out of Jason.I liked the practical special Effects and special FX makeup for Freddy and Jason they were pretty good and I love them.The rest of the cast and the director does a really great job.Overall I am giving a 1010  an outstanding score this is the final Freddy movie in the franchise that I consider the last good Freddy movie. Here we got a killer from Camp Crystal Lake and a killer who haunts in your dreams. But they made Freddy loose his powers and he needed the kids to be afraid so he could be strong again while feeding on their fear but how can he do that when he's not that effective in his nightmares? Of course! Jason! I love this movie to death!".

I mean we got a killer from Camp Crystal Lake and a killer who haunts your dreams.

Of course! Jason! Jason is like his bubble wrap he assumes Jason will probably go away or he'll be easy to throw away after the job is done. But he surprises Freddy by staying and for the ultimate battle of who's victims are who.This was just such a blast to watch. Classic horror clich's and the best battle of the ultimate boogeymen were just too cool. The ending is a cliff hanger but you have too many votes going towards both sides.

And as we all know after the endless line of sequels by this entry the killers' are our friends so really you're rooting for them and not the idiot teenagers.Of the teens Jason Ritter is the only one who seems to know how to act shame about his dad John Ritter. Monica Keena is cute but she needs to lose the implants. What is Kelly Rowland doing in here? Robert Englund's as funny as ever and Ken Kirzinger is a capable Jason. I still don't see why New Line Cinema didn't want to bring back Kane Hodder though. They say they wanted to take Jason in a new direction but they DID NOT take Jason in a new direction. Jason's still the same hulking mute murderer he's always been just a tad taller and bigger than before and somehow he's got both of his eyes back. I don't see a big difference between Kane Ken and all the rest but Kane has professed great fondness and dedication to role of Jason so I feel that if Kane was willing to play the part again and it's hard to find people who are willing to be all painted up in gory make up mind you then New Line should have accepted his services. It did feel that they were trying to make Jason out to be the more sympathetic of the two killers but that doesn't change the fact that Jason killed the bulk of the film's teens.Well anyway you get the usual dose of sex drugs violence rock  roll and below par acting. So truly turn off your brain and enjoy the mayhem.".

Freddy Krueger is now powerless since the children of Elm St. are taking a certain drug to stop their dreams so he consults Jason Voorhees to kill the children until Freddy has power to kill again but Jason goes on a rampage and won't stop killing in what results in a final battle of evil vs. evil. Ronny Yu director of The Bride Of Chucky makes a neat direction in this movie and his certain style of filmmaking added a touch that none of the Elm Street of Friday the 13th films had before. Of course Robert Englund returns as Freddy but Kane Hodder who has played Jason in most of the films is replaced by another actor. Kelly Rowland and Monica Keena pretty much lead this movie. I also noticed Katharine Isabelle from 2002's TV movie Carrie. I have to say that fans of either series will be pleased but other horror goers may not. Also do not I repeat do not watch this if you have a weak stomach. It's about one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. Bottom Line Fans will be pleased others will not. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think I had never felt like this before when I walked into the cinema. It was an absolute dream come true for me. I had prepared over a year for this film this once in a lifetimeevent. I had chased every picture every piece of scoop I could find about this movie on the internet. It was very painful when Freddy Vs. Jason was finally released in June in the U.S. and I still had to wait until November until the film saw its theatrical release in Vienna where I live. Yesterday the big day had come. Is there a way that a movie that's been so hyped by myself can still live up to my expectations? Absofrigginlutely!WOW! Freddy vs. Jason is unbelievable. What sounds like a loony's idea to be honest die hardFreddy  Jasonfans like myself are mostly loonies was made into a kickass flick for a wide audience. Bring along your kids bring along your grandparents and enjoy the roller coaster ride that is Freddy vs. Jason.When I heard that Ronny Yu was going to be the director for this project I checked out two of his previous movies 51st State  Bride of Chucky and wasn't exactly blown away. These movies were okay but nowhere near as good as I wanted Freddy vs. Jason to be. Well I have to apologize to Mr. Yu. Not only did he revive both franchises like no one would have expected it to be possible he also managed to COMBINE the two and not make it absolutely ridiculous.Of course the horror that made the original A Nightmare On Elm Street so scary and the first Friday The 13th so hmm... dark is gone by now but it has been gone for more than ten years. Get over it people! A movie called Freddy vs. Jason HAS TO BE campy. No wonder the dialog is incredibly bad at times Freddy is afraid of fire Jason is afraid of water... how can we use that? no wonder the actors are no Academy Award winners. The right things are deliberately hammed up and selfironic like a boobiegoddess playing the main character who is supposed to be a 14 year old virgin. Come on nobody is really supposed to take that seriously!Let's get to the main attraction Freddy  Jason. I have to admit I was rooting for Freddy. I adored this character since he first scared the crap out of me as a child. I had trouble falling asleep for days and although I don't find Freddy scary anymore I still love his story his attitude and his oneliners. Freddy vs. Jason did him justice and that's also and mostly due to the great Robert Englund. I was down on the floor laughing my ass off as this man put up yet another great show with merciless jokes and dark comedy. Let's hope he never retires. As for Jason he's better than ever. Sure it would have been nice to have long timeJasonactor Kane Hodder in this movie but Ken Kirzinger did a very good job. Ronny Yu wasn't afraid of showing gore and Jason got some pretty original kills. Just why is he afraid of water all of a sudden?Another plus for Ronny Yu is the use of colors. Preview pics of Freddy vs. Jason showed that this movie was going to be very colorful which made me skeptic at first. Nightmare 4  5 had been red green and blue all over and it looked very cheap and comic like. Not so with Freddy vs. Jason. The colors look atmospheric here. The rain looked a little fake but that's probably just me.The story is simple which is good compared to the far fetched rejected drafts that are spread across the Internet. Maybe there were a little too many subplots in the final version which made the movie slow in the middle. I could have done without the character that was like a copy of Kevin Smith's Jay too. Apart from these little flaws there's no need to be nitpicky.The box office success of Freddy vs. Jason was just as exciting as the film itself. It helped bring back classic 80's horror. Studios considered and made sequelsremakes to movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacres  Halloween again. The commercial success of Freddy vs. Jason also proved that there's still enough life in both of these characters to justify more sequels. Freddy was killed off way too soon anyway. Only 6 sequels? Come on I want to see more of him but make the movies original for Christ's sake! I'd rather see Freddy die than going to straighttovideohell. That's why I hope a Nightmareprequel will never be made and why I beg producers not to make a Freddy vs. Jason 2 or any other obscure vs.movies. Freddy vs. Jason is the fulfillment of every fans dream and that is that.Phew... have I said everything? Have I expressed my euphoria enough? Let me just say this at the end A lot of people had eagerly waited for this project to be realized. Thanks Ronny Yu Robert Englund and New Line for making it come true!".

I had trouble falling asleep for days and although I don't find Freddy scary anymore I still love his story his attitude and his oneliners. Freddy vs. Jason did him justice and that's also and mostly due to the great Robert Englund. I was down on the floor laughing my ass off as this man put up yet another great show with merciless jokes and dark comedy. Let's hope he never retires. As for Jason he's better than ever. Sure it would have been nice to have long timeJasonactor Kane Hodder in this movie but Ken Kirzinger did a very good job. Ronny Yu wasn't afraid of showing gore and Jason got some pretty original kills. Just why is he afraid of water all of a sudden?Another plus for Ronny Yu is the use of colors. Preview pics of Freddy vs. Jason showed that this movie was going to be very colorful which made me skeptic at first. Nightmare 4  5 had been red green and blue all over and it looked very cheap and comic like. Not so with Freddy vs. Jason. The colors look atmospheric here. The rain looked a little fake but that's probably just me.The story is simple which is good compared to the far fetched rejected drafts that are spread across the Internet. Maybe there were a little too many subplots in the final version which made the movie slow in the middle. I could have done without the character that was like a copy of Kevin Smith's Jay too. Apart from these little flaws there's no need to be nitpicky.The box office success of Freddy vs. Jason was just as exciting as the film itself. It helped bring back classic 80's horror. Studios considered and made sequelsremakes to movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacres  Halloween again. The commercial success of Freddy vs. Jason also proved that there's still enough life in both of these characters to justify more sequels. Freddy was killed off way too soon anyway. Only 6 sequels? Come on I want to see more of him but make the movies original for Christ's sake! I'd rather see Freddy die than going to straighttovideohell. That's why I hope a Nightmareprequel will never be made and why I beg producers not to make a Freddy vs. Jason 2 or any other obscure vs.movies. Freddy vs. Jason is the fulfillment of every fans dream and that is that.Phew... have I said everything? Have I expressed my euphoria enough? Let me just say this at the end A lot of people had eagerly waited for this project to be realized. Thanks Ronny Yu Robert Englund and New Line for making it come true!";

It is not a masterpiece of cinema it is not a masterpiece of horror . . . look at all the F13 and NOES. You have 17 examples of what this movie is going to be like.Take your typical crappy Elm Street plot and cast your typical crappy Friday the 13th cast and you have your typical crappy horror movie. Am I criticizing this movie? Not really since that crapfactor is a staple to the F13 franchise and the NOES sequels. Does anyone really care? I hope not. The whole reason anyone should see this movie comes down to the three words in the title Freddy versus Jason. If those three words do not interest you don't even screw with FvsJ. I mean I don't think in film history has the title been more descriptive of the point of the movie.While it actually takes awhile to get to the slasher deathmatch you know it's coming . . . everyone knows there's going to be a fight to remember so Ronny Yu opts to prolong it as far as he can and just jam packs the ending with Slasher celebrities ripping into each other . . . because seriously 90 minutes of Jason and Freddy hacking at each other would get downright boring. At least there's some variety and nods to old school F13 and NOES some typical nods to the stereotyped horror formula which isn't scary but seems to be a requirement. Boobs booze blood . . . you know the routine.

Now ladies and gentlemen it has begun . . . now it's on. Now we rumble . . . now we see why horny teens had such a hard time killing these bad boys. Freddy makes more fatal blows against Voorhees than he did to the cast of all 8 Freddy films combined . .. and Voorhees keeps getting up. For the first time we see Freddy treated like a rag doll and tossed aroundcut up like another camp crystal lake sexaddictVoorhees makes no distinction.So who wins? Everyone . . . unless of course you're under the false impression that you're going to see Welles quality cinema in which case why are you even reading about FvsJ?I could go through and detail the plot characters acting etc like other amateur and pro critics alike but quite frankly I don't see the point. I mean this is still Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. I will say that it's a better Elm Street sequel and it is the best film featuring Jason.I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and I'm barely an Elm Street fan and am definitely not a fan of F13 . . . take that for what it's worth.".

I felt a little of both though I tried to be confident that the main show would be worth the Hollywoodish mishmash.The main show however is the only reason to see the movie  Freddy Kruger Robert Englund the old gent from Elm Street is down in hell wanting another grab at 'his' children so he implements a sort of decoy in the form of lakeboy Jason Voorhees who begins slaying far more than Freddy could want to see for someone other than himself.  So he decides that it's time to kick some a and that's when the fun begins.  To diehards of both series I like a few from each series and personally I'm more for Freddy than Jason in the genre because at least Freddy can give some funny dialog in terrifying moments while Jason stares blankly except for when his mother calls him this is like seeing two legends standing up in the ring for a prizefight.  Each one has their weaknesses but they each know who to throw their punches with style and we hope that they can stay invincible until the last round.  I won't reveal who wins they're enough skeeves on the message boards doing that but what I can say is that if it only wasn't for the people in the movie I'll exclude the Jay ripoff since he garnered the most laughs acting so blandly strategically like how they're told to do in such a piece this would've been a near excellent horror movie.  Nevertheless that could be considered moot since that's what's to ALWAYS be expected for these gobledygook slasher pieces.

It was a lot better than a lot of the Friday the 13ths especially the amazingly bad Jason X but it wasn't that great compared to some of the Nightmare films. Overall it was enjoyable.It has nothing new to offer except the fact that Freddy and Jason face off. It has all the horror movie clichs but never once uses them creatively. When a girl gets naked she might as well be saying look I'm naked! when someone is doing drugs they might as well being saying look I'm doing drugs! and when someone dies they might as well be saying look I'm dead! The gore is good though. Probably the best gore out of both series. Blood literally flies at the screen. It gets really gory once Freddy and Jason fight at the end. Now there's the acting. Horror movie actors have been getting worse and worse. Whatever happened to subtlety? Monica Keena who plays Lori is so profoundly horrible in this that it made me not like the movie as much. She is so whiny through the entire movie no wonder Freddy kept calling her bitch over and over. Even Robert Englund is at his worst as Freddy. With the exception of New Nightmare each time Robert Englund plays Freddy he gets cheesier and cheesier. Of course this movie's ridiculous plot doesn't help either. Then there's Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child fame. I thought she was going to be horrible like every other music star that decides to do a horror flick but surprisingly she wasn't that bad. Maybe even the best actress in the whole movie. She just played it real and she really has a great scene at the end where she is making fun of Freddy.Another thing that bugged me where the special effects. In all the other movies there where good physical effects makeup effects and camera trickery. Freddy Vs. Jason is just plain lazy. The only reason to see it is the end battle. I really think Ronny Yu was a bad choice to direct this movie. He's mastered the gore injokes and humour of horror movies but when it comes to actual horror he's clueless.But like Bride Of Chucky which Yu also directed this is just an unexplainable guilty pleasure. It was mindless fun. I guess it was fun to turn my brain off for 90 minutes even though that was hard to do since I actually respected some of the other movies. This movie I have no respect for.All in all this is exactly what you could expect from a cheesy concept like Freddy and Jason doing battle against each other. Yes it could have been better but it far more easily could have been a lot worse so I give them credit for that. Hardcore fans will love it.My rating 610".

There are moments where the film instead of making you jump in fright makes you laugh out load and sometimes it is easy to predict how a person will die. But other than a few flaws this films is a great film to see especially if you are a fan of either series. There is also little need to have seen the previous films although it does help as it recaps on the characters' pasts Freddy's more so than Jason however. The plot of this movie is that Freddy is trapped in Hell because the children of Elm Street have forgot about him and those that do remember him are in an institution and given medication Hypnocyl to stop them dreaming. So Mr. Kruger decides to acquire the assistance of someone from Hell who is just as sadistic and evil Jason Voorhees. Jason awakes from his eternal slumber and heads to Elm Street in the mood for slaughtering more helpless teenagers. Freddy's plan is that with all of these murders taking place the children will find out about Freddy and subsequently he will be able to go back to his old ways. However Freddy did not account for Jason's blood lust and soon finds Jason killing his potential victims. What ensues after is a battle of two equally evil forces although most of their fighting is purely comical. This film obviously appeals to fans of Jason and Freddy but it also introduces a new generation of young adults to two classical 'slasher' characters who should not judge the characters just on this film. Freddy and Jason are seen by many to be two of the best at what they do and to see them finally square off is a great experience. It is good to see horror characters finally battling it out if only to answer the question that was always brought up when watching a horror film of 'who would win?'".

After spending years in development hell the film was unleashed onto the public in August of 2003. Oh boy....First let me say that I am a huge fan of both franchises. I was raised on these films and although some of them in both series' hit below the mark in many areas Jason X Freddy's Dead etc. none of them reached the lows that Freddy vs Jason plummeted to.First the film really doesn't have the feel of either series. Instead of the stark visuals and above average cinematography that we're used to seeing from the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street films Freddy vs Jason looks like something you'd see in a directtovideo release.Next the acting in this film is absolutely dreadful. I know some would say that neither series was known for it's Oscar caliber performances but never has it been this bad. Plus even if the acting was up to par we wouldn't care because none of the characters are likable... AT ALL.Of course what would Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street be without their respected patriarchs Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger? Neither are given justice in this film. Jason seems to have changed ethnicity between films and the Freddymythology that even the lesserquality Freddy sequels was built on has been drastically altered.Who could forget the trademarks of these films The special effects? Well in this one Jason looks like a sevenfoot homeless person who thanks to a particularly robotic and stiff performance by Ken Kirzinger who should not be mentioned in the same sentence as Kane Hodder and Ted White does nothing more than stand on his mark and slowly swing his machete which even seems to grow by several feet between scenes.The Freddy makeup in this one isn't consistent either. It looks like a paint by numbers project which not even Robert Englund can bring to life.The writing is also particularly bad. Many scripts for FVJ were rejected. The question is Why wasn't this one thrown into the fire with the previously rejected scripts? It's THAT bad. Characters spout exposition in nearly every scene Jason disappears for a good 30 minutes without explanation and the dialog is brutal. Freddy died by fire Jason by water how can we use that? See what I mean? The film is more of a spoof on the genre than a fullfledged entry.The title is also misleading. This film is not really Freddy vs Jason but Freddy and Jason vs Teenagers. Only in the last 20 minutes do the title characters fight and it doesn't really pay off. To say that this film is anticlimactic would be an understatement.As fan of these films I find this movie insulting to both the previous films and the fans as well. As bad as some of the other sequels may be this one takes the cake as the worst in both series'.110 although I'd give it a 0 if I could.".

The plot is that Freddy is forgotten on Elm Street because a townwide conspiracy is in place so nobody even mentions his name. Because of this he is losing power but not enough however to resurrect Jason. The bodies start piling up and the conspiracy slowly becomes unraveled giving Freddy the power needed to do what Freddy does best... Unfortunately it seems that resurrecting Jason didn't come with an off switch or something and they decide the town's not big enough for 2 of them. While it does feel as though it takes a while for Freddy and Jason to finally fight seeing them kill in ways fans know and love or even something I haven't seen and that's one where Jason kills people while he's completely set on fire! and Robert Englund hamming it up is so entertaining to watch regardless. Even the ideas of having there being one fight in Freddy's dream world and the other in the real world being clever considering one of them has an advantage and disadvantage in both worlds. I'd say if you're into watching cheesy fun then I'd recommend this. It does deliver what you would expect from Freddy and Jason being in the same movie or even moreso for me considering I actually think this is the best Friday The 13th related movie I've watched so far.

But to sum up I loved this film and gave it a vote of 10!I am looking forward to more versus movies in the future Alien vs. Predator Batman vs Superman Freddy vs. Jason 2 which I have heard Ken Kirzinger has already been signed to do who will they pit against them I personally would like for it to be Leatherface from the TCM Remake or maybe Michael Myers or both.

Ever since I was six years old I've been a Freddy fanatic. This style of horror movie was original and creative. Instead of him killing you in the dark at night like some cliche serial killer he kills you when you are the must vulnerable...in your dreams. Now I'm not a big fan of Jason but that's beside the point. These are 2 of the horror icons from the '80's.I went to see it opening night and it did not disappoint. Granted the acting was really lame especially the part with the father and son on the porch. The acting felt forced. And there was some nudity due on the part that this is half of a Jason movie and Jason movies always have nudity or sex in them. But that's not even supposed to be the main focus of the film. As the title says it's Freddy vs. Jason. You're supposed to pay attention to the 2 horror gods and then the little stuff can be judged.Besides my minor reservations on the acting I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't live up to all of my expectations but it came pretty close. The fight scenes were incredible and Freddy still had his sarcastic wit about him. Now the comments about the actor who played Jason here's my input. Anybody can play Jason. Jason walks around doesn't talk and kills people. If they said the other guy was playing him you wouldn't even really notice well I know I wouldn't of.To summarize yes there are problem areas with this movie but there are problem areas with any movie. This movie was a fresh reminder that all the horror movies that people put out nowadays aren't horror. They aren't remembered years later. But Freddy Jason Michael Pinhead Chucky etc. are. I give this movie 8 stars. I didn't want to comment too much directly on the movie so I don't ruin it for people that haven't seen it yet. But I say it's worth giving it a try you may be pleasantly surprised ".

I mean it even feels like your reading something out of a comic book. I still Think Kane should have come backbut Kin played Jason with a diffent side of him. His killing reactions were way to fastwhich made me jump a lot. Kane is still the best Jasonbut I would love to see his killing movements more fast. And Robertwill you never could go wrong with Robert. Even the jokeswhich ruined the seriesmade him look good. I mean think of Freddy from part 1  7but with more jokes.And kelly did way better at actingthen Beyonce. And I love the way they ended it with how Jason X and Wes Craven's New Nightmare got strated.

The concept of the story hasnt changed much but really doesnt tell you in detail enough on how most things happen maybe thats a spawn for several sequels to follow. The teenagers in the movie I would say have acted all very well and it doesnt go in all that typical teenager way they are quiet sensible.

In spite of the fact that Smith has spent forty years writing one acclaimed novel after another only a handful of his books have been adapted for the big screen  and of those films none have been hugely successful. Gold is based on one of the author's shortest novels originally entitled Gold Mine and features a very attractive cast including the thenBond Roger Moore the luscious Susannah York archetypal villainous actors Bradford Dillman and Tony Beckley and old stalwarts Ray Milland and John Gielgud. Much of the film was shot in South Africa amidst a volatile environment of political controversy while the more dangerouslooking underground action sequences were done on an impressive studio stage back in the UK. On the whole the film is highly watchable and polished though it is never quite as absorbing or exciting as it was obviously meant to be.An accident at a South African gold mine results in the mine's general manager being trapped and crippled. The underground manager Rod Slater Roger Moore tries his best to save his superior but his efforts fail and the general manager dies. Later it transpires that the managing director of the mine Manfred Steyner Bradford Dillman is actually a member of a secret syndicate that is deliberately trying to destroy the mine in order to increase the value of their own gold stocks. Steyner has had his workers drilling in a highly dangerous area close to a water dyke insisting that they are close to a precious gold strike when in reality they are metres away from flooding and destroying their own mine. Steyner is the grandsoninlaw of the megarich gold entrepreneur Hurry Hirschfield and is married to Hurry's granddaughter Terry Susannah York. However Terry is having an affair with Slater so Steyner's plan is to fulfil his act of sabotage for his syndicate whilst simultaneously exacting revenge on his cheating wife by ruining her family business. Eventually the dyke is breached and the mine is on the verge of catastrophic flooding with Slater the only man brave and foolish enough to go underground and trigger an explosion to seal off the flooded areas before it is too late.Gold begins and ends with two very powerful and convincing underground sequences that are extremely well put together. In between the plot unfolds rather slowly and laboriously seeming to take a long time to reach its conclusion though certain scenes along the way are quite well handled. Moore plays the hero fairly well even though it is a much grittier role than his Bond persona. York is even better as the deceitful wife while Dillman and Beckley provide thoroughly ugly baddies. Elmer Bernstein's very70s music score adds a sense of drama to the proceedings in spite of its dated sound. Peter Hunt formerly a Bond editor and director directs the film competently without doing anything out of the ordinary with his material. At 124 minutes Gold is a pretty exhausting movie  certainly worth one maybe even two viewings but beyond that it doesn't particularly endear itself to repeat screenings. Still if you like big oldfashioned adventure flicks or are a fan of the stars this movie is worth catching.".

For me the most interesting action sequence though is when the hero is trying to land a plane on a tailings pile at a speed low enough to almost stall out. Most interesting of all thirty years ago it was almost unheard of to see frontal nudity in a major film. When Susannah York's breast appeared out of the suds in the bathtub scene my jaw dropped open. I couldn't believe I was really seeing it. For sheer surprise it ranks right up there with Charlton Heston kissing a black woman in that science fiction film that I think was called The Omega Man.

Along with Hunt many  James Bond veterans worked on Gold and this shows particularly in how smoothly the location work in South Africa has been integrated with the soundstage work at Pinewood.Composer Elmer Bernstein uses Jimmy Helms' title song as an orchestral theme to stirring effect while Maurice Binder another Bond veteran gets the ball rolling with his uniquely designed opening credits.Gold comes highly recommended!".

Considering all its elements brassy theme tune comic book villains Maurice Binder's title sequence Gold is something of a Bond surrogate leveraging off Moore's alter ego at the time and incorporating all the villains and motifs appropriate for a 007 adventure  by any other name.

I remember seeing the TV commercials and wanting to see it because the scenes of the flooding mine made it look like another disaster film. I never saw the film and the film pretty much disappeared before it turned up on bargain DVD. Its a shame that the film isn't better known since its a super little thriller. To be certain the film suffers from the casting of Ray Milland and Dillman who seemed to be playing the exact same roles in everything at the time this was made but other wise this is a tense little thriller with some good action sequences good performances and a plot that keeps you watching. Its not the best film ever but it is is one that has been wrongly buried in the discount bin. Definitely worth picking up if you run across it.".

Susannah York provides classic English beauty in the form of the love interest and John Gielgud and Bradford Dillman exude villainy in it's most obtuse form. Simon Sabela is the quiet spoken understated Big King a giant of a black miner and champion of workers treatment underground.Filmed in 1974 this was Roger Moore's first film since his debut as James Bond in Live and Let Die and was sandwiched between his next outing in The Man with The Golden Gun. It was also Susannah York's first film for two years since taking time out to have children. Producer Michael Klinger wanted to take another Wilbur Smith novel Shout at the Devil to the screen but couldn't raise the finance so he made Gold first which allowed him to raise the finance for the former.This film is a fascinating insight into gold production and how both the price and availability of gold was strictly controlled and the lengths unscrupulous speculators would go to in order to cut production and increase the price. John Gielgud excels as the quintessential English financier a role he played again in the same year in 11 Harrowhouse.Bearing in mind that Moore was 46 years old he makes a fine handsome hero as Rod Slater and the 35 year old Susannah York oozes class as Terry Steyner the granddaughter of mine owner Hurry Hirschfeld Ray Milland. And a little golden nugget to boot is the performance of Tony Beckley the mildly camp but almost psychotic geologist turned henchman. The action underground is first class and indeed quite gory in parts. It is perhaps. surprising that a film showing a miner having his face ripped off in an accident only has a 12 rating on DVD but then we live in different times. The soundtrack for the film composed by Elmer Bernstein is both very hip for the period and has some beautiful orchestral pieces particularly for the love scenes. Jimmy Helms' title track rendition is superb as are the two Don Black penned songs Wherever Love Takes Me Oscar Nominated and Where Have You Been All My Life. Finally on a somewhat sombre note virtually everybody of note from the actors and crew are sadly no longer with us. Only the writer Wilbur Smith lyricist Don Black and title song singer Jimmy Helms remain. However the film is a poignant reminder of a world where the colour of your skin literally determined your worth in life and in death.".

The mining sequences are quite well done and I wish that they had stuck to a simple disaster film instead throwing in the romance.In fact Roger Moore intrepid hero that he is looks ridiculous because when the ocean flood starts he's out having a romp with Susannah York. Instead of applauding him for his eventual heroism Milland should have had him canned and banned from the industry. Unless you like Roger Moore I'd give iron pyrites a pass.";

	schema:reviewBody "Made the year following Roger Moore's incredible success with his first appearance as James Bond in LIVE AND LET DIE GOLD is in many respects a wannabe Bond film. From the cheesy and incredibly Oscarnominated at the time and utterly dated score by Elmer Bernstein to the stylised titles by Bond veteran Maurice Binder and the behindthecamera direction from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE Peter Hunt you can feel the influence of the Bond films throughout. Even Roger Moore plays a Bondstyle hero completely courageous and with a stiff upper lip of course who spends much of the film's time bedding his boss's wife  who is played by Susannah York.The film opens and closes with two riveting scenes set inside a gold mine where caveins explosions floods and amputated limbs are commonplace. Although the mine locations are clearly sets they're altogether realistic and have a really claustrophobic atmosphere. Throw in some racist South African workers abusing the blacks and you have a very volatile and gritty atmosphere. In particular the climax a race against time in a flooding mine is edgeoftheseat stuff and Hunt doesn't hold back on the horrifying accidents that were commonplace in mines one poor worker has his face torn off while Roger Moore suffers the most painful injury of his screen career.Unfortunately the rest of the film  all of the scenes set above ground in fact  is unbelievably dull. Things slow down to a snail's pace as Moore engages in a longwinded romance with the singularly unappealing Susannah York. There's some conspiracy involving the world's stock markets and increasing the price of gold but it's all very mundane and aside from a decent battle between man and car at the film's climax there isn't a shred of action to enjoy. Indeed the filmmakers come very close to making Moore's hero repulsive as he ends up cavorting in a lake with York while the men under his command are being killed in the flooded mine.GOLD is based on a novel by Wilbur Smith who also cowrote the screenplay. As you'd expect from this master author the locations and technicalities are all authentic although I could have done without the padded travelogue footage of the South African locations. Ultimately the whole film just feels like a lacklustre Bond flick with nothing happening in the middle  and with a two hour running time you'll really feel the boredom. The film just concentrates on having stars in throwaway parts like John Gielgud's corrupt financier who has about five minutes of screen time. Bradford Dillman just stands around as the villain leaving it to Tony Beckley to be imposing while at least Ray Milland has fun as the gruff shouty mine owner. Simon Sabela particularly shines as King a courageous worker who wins a solid gold helmet for his heroism! Aside from the mine sequences GOLD is a real bore perhaps FOOL'S GOLD would have been a better title.".

The soundtrack is beautiful no anarkali disco chali no item song but it deeply touches your soul a power possessed by the great himesh reshmaiyaa. The makeup and costumes could not be faulted no matter how hard I tried. Karishma was looking radiant as usual and perfect for each regression .The makeup covered 5 centuries perfectly.Although I would say that you require an IQ above 2 to understand and appreciate such a movie which unfortunately most people don't posses.All in all a terrific movie must watch and the twist at the end was spectacular. In conclusion soundstorycostumemakeuplocation all great. Couldn't ask for anything better.".

Though Karishma Kapoor did a good job I feel her sister Kareena would have been a better choice for this role. Rajneesh Duggal did not get much scope Jimmy was good as a cop Divya Dutta and Gracy Singh were okay but the major surprise was Ravi Kishen. This guy has emerged as a great actor.

They were a gross mismatch even if I take Karisma as some sort of cougar not considering the huge age difference she really looked as if babysitting her boyfriend. Jimmy Shergill a fine actor otherwise looked tired and worn out probably anguished with subjecting himself to Karisma's comeback tantrums. Seriously Karisma didn't find a single costar for her comeback movie. I heard her behavior isn't very good so that makes people keep distance.

But as it got over there was only one question in my mind that Why on earth Karishma Kapoor chose such a low grade movie to be her comeback venture in the Industry? The question was posted at Facebook and it got a very meaningful reply from an experienced friend who commented For the same reason she chose Prem Qaidi to be her debut film in the Industry. And I think that should explain a lot to the readers about her DANGEROUS ISHHQ which undoubtedly remains one of the weakest  worthless projects released in the year 2012.In short the review is clearly written in the film's title itself which warns the viewers that it's highly dangerous to see it in theaters spending your time money and efforts together. The subject of Past Life Regression which could have easily been the strength of the movie actually proves to be a curse for it. The poorly written screenplay taking the viewer into different eras of the past fails to impress completely and the film simply appears to be a B class project in all its departments ranging from writing acting direction and presentation. Probably that was the reason why many people were not on their seats in the second half as the film started post its intermission.As an experienced actress Karishma Kapoor tries her best to lift many lifeless sequences but in the process loses the battle. In reality she shouldn't have done this film as her comeback vehicle. Rajniesh Duggal continues to be in search of his talent and Jimmy Shergill Divya Dutta Aarya Babbar Samir Kochhar Ravi Kishan and more just perform as professionals working on an assignment. Himesh Reshamiya gives another average soundtrack of his career with nothing worth remembering. But more importantly don't get fooled by the 3D logo placed prominently in its promotions. The film had no need of 3D technology at all and its just a gimmick to bring in more viewers into the theater. In fact DI also gives out a clear lesson both for the producers as well as the viewers that 3D format is not required and should not be used in every or any kind of film without giving it a serious thought. It's all waste of time energy and effort to use it for a film like DI.Ending on a lighter note Past Life Regression might be a therapy or method through which people try to find their peace. But in DANGEROUS ISHHQ it actually takes away that precious possession of the viewer in a more cruel way. So it will be real dangerous if you opt for this past life Ishhq in the theater.".

The prowess with which Karishma carries this tough role on her shoulders she deserves a big laud and many accolades in the end year award functions. The direction is way too good and i can assure that it is Bhatt's best work after Raaz. Though the 3D work is good quality but apologetically there is no much scope for 3D effects. The film could have been made without 3D as well. Storyline and Final Verdict! Movie is about past life regression and hallucinations. If you don't believe in such things this movie would make you believe in reincarnation of true lovers. Such a flawless love story it deserve 8 stars and an additional star for Karishma's to date best performance after Zubeidaa! Go for it!".

Well imho this isn't anywhere near as good as Zubeidaa was but it's still a fairly entertaining 2D timepasser in this lifetime anyway.A woman's husband is kidnapped for ransom by baddies which so unhinges her mind she realises that she is simply on the Great Mandala and a prisoner of her past lives. With help she regresses to some previous states to find that their love was just as great and fraught with danger  an inseparable love throughout many lives causes many problems. Kapoor puts in an excellent performance my big problem is the drama veers from impressive storytelling to clichd corn and back again so much that most of the time I didn't know whether to silently applaud or laugh loudly. Also confusing to me personally is that the modern sequences alternate spoken languages between Hindi and English so swiftly between and within sentences I found that I was often reading the English subtitles for no reason! But concentration is usually rewarded and this film is worth it so I paid suitable attention. From the little music on offer I liked the lilting Lagan Lagi from the key 1535 segment and the Umeed Hai reprise in the modern nightclub was stylish.There's a convoluted  some might say a cheating  twist ending but at least everything adds up. It's a wellmade slick and thoughtful romance with much soapy melodrama nothing wrong with that definitely not as bad as I'd feared but I don't think it's a film I'll go out of my way to watch again.".

She is good in certain roles like regressed past as in this movie since she has that eternal lostlook that fits right in. Somehow Vikram Bhat fails as a director since the movie is not tight as you would expect from a Veteran like Bhat. There are no strong male actors attached to the movie. The beginning of the movie and the scene inside the hospital is totally confusing to an average viewer till the hypnotherpay sessions. Rajesh Duggal has talent in his blood..wish it was in his acting. Divya Dutta and other actors do fine. The one number by Himesh Tere Chehra is good. This movie hundred times better than the flicks by the 3 suvvar kuttae brothers and the 3 suvvar Kongs who are a disgrace to the movie industry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trust Vikram Bhatt to mix everything under the sun to come out with a suspense thriller. He is known for his concoctions mixing Past Life and murder Sex Music Romance etc in earlier successful and unsuccessful films from FarebKasoorRaazInteha to Haunted19201920 ReturnsShaapit and now Dangerous Ishq. Honestly DI has an interesting concept. I don't believe in Reincarnation but the concept is fascinating. Vikram Bhatt has woven several layers of past life in this story and slowly unraveled the mystery. The culprits here are several things. The pace which drops at many points in the film. The choice of actors casting. Karisma does a good job and looks great on screen too. But Rajnesh as her love interest is miscast. No she doesn't look older than him on the contrary she's still got it but he doesn't match up to her in terms of screen presence. Moreover he doesn't get a chance to exhibit acting skills either as his role is an extended guest appearance. Divya Dutta is dependable as usual and the rest of the supporting cast are good especially Natasha and Ravi Kishen. But when we talk about casting we look at the lead pair. And that clearly according to me has gone very wrong. Even the makers only publicized Karisma on the posters of the film. Moreover Karisma looks too modern to deliver those lines in Rajasthani or Marwari not sure of the language sorry! Himesh Reshammiya's music. The songs sound pleasant but baring Tu Hi Rab none of the other songs caught my attention. Thankfully VB has used them in the background. And the biggest problem if you ask me is the inconsistent screenplay. It's not confusing it is inconsistent. At some points you are engrossed at other times you are just bored!Overall what could have been a good thriller remains a good concept only.".

But there is a lot to redeem it namely the amazing scenery captured by the lovely cinematography. The soundtrack was a nice touch too the direction is good and the acting is actually above decent. Cuba Gooding Jnr is a likable enough lead and James Coburn the great actor he was matches him wonderfully. The really cute snow dogs steal the show though it could be said they are the film.

So I read the other comments and decided to add my own. Sure it was a predictable plot but what isn't? Almost no story idea is new these days just modified repackaged and directed differently. There's still a lot to enjoy! I have to say Cuba Gooding Jr. was perfectly cast in his role as Dr. Ted Brooks because he's so well suited to slapstick and not just serious dramatic roles which he excels at. I really enjoyed the way his character handled surprise situations. Being a Miami dentist and suddenly finding yourself across the continent in a completely different culture especially in wilderness Alaska can lead to some hilarious situations and this movie went there. The dogs were funny enhanced with some computer graphic features to occasionally make them humanized and the dream sequence was good too. I also enjoyed James Coburn who's tough guy image was perfect in this comedy role. Plus it was great to see Uhuru from Star Trek cast as Mrs. Brooks. Whatever others might say that this movie is great for kids but dumb for adults is just not true. As a welleducated adult I still found it fresh and fun. For those commenter's who thought the movie was silly for just for kids I guess some people just don't know how to have good clean fun!!".

But my mom insisted again and again so I finally went ahead and watched it last night yeah it was very silly and predictable but it was fun to watch because it's such a fun family film. It had cheesy jokes here and there but they made me laugh the great thing I that I really liked was that they didn't computer enhance any voices for the dogs it was just a natural performance for them and it made the story just a little bit more believable. I know everyone keeps claiming that Cuba Gooding Jr. ruined his career by making these films but he must be doing something right because at least he's still getting paid for these films.Ted is your typical Miami guy he's a dentist life is pretty decent for him that is until he finds out that he's adopted. He finds out that his mother lived in Alaska so he goes up there and finds out that his biological mother died recently so he meets a girl Barb who tells him that his mother left him her house and top race winning dogs. A man Jack offers a lousy price for all of them but he finds out that Jack is his father and after hearing the story Ted heads back to Miami. But he learns something different than Jack told him and heads back but Jack is trapped in the mountains and now Ted has to learn how to mush through the snow.Snow Dogs is predictable and a common story but it's all good it's a cute family film that has a few cute jokes. I just loved the scene where Ted first learns how to mush and the dogs know how incompetent he is so they play a joke on him and race him through the town while he's taped to the sled. It was silly but Cuba's look on his face was just priceless. This is a fun little movie that the whole family can enjoy I recommend it. The rating on IMDb is very harsh just ignore it this is a fun film.610".

But I was wrong this movie was a work of art. Now the only problem I had with it was it really wasn't that funny I mean yeah there was some funny moments in it where I even chuckled but it's not one of those laughoutloud comedys that I like. What I'm talking about is a movie to where a laugh out loud till I cry and disturb the people in front of me now that's what I call a comedy. Laughoutloud movies like Rush HourJackie Chan or Mouse HuntNathan Lane and BanditsBruce Willis which I thought was the funniest movie ever made. Now this movie was nothing like a laughoutmovie but there was two reasons why I loved it. The first was the dogs right when you see them you fall in love with them and second was the story. The story was great I thought it would be guy falls in love with dream girl and guy finishes first in the dogsleding race pretty pratictable you say well it was nothing like that the story is a great one which makes you want to know more about each character. If you want to see a great movie with a great story go see Snow Dogs but if you want to see a laughoutloud comedy then still go see this but just know that there might have been a better comedy at the Box Office. 910 James Coburn did a great job as ThunderJack and this is one of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s best movies yet!".

The story was great I thought it would be guy falls in love with dream girl and guy finishes first in the dogsleding race pretty pratictable you say well it was nothing like that the story is a great one which makes you want to know more about each character. If you want to see a great movie with a great story go see Snow Dogs but if you want to see a laughoutloud comedy then still go see this but just know that there might have been a better comedy at the Box Office. 910 James Coburn did a great job as ThunderJack and this is one of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s best movies yet!";

But before the change in the early part of the year Disney let us see some good old stuff one last time before it all went away. The first of this was Snow Dogs which was released in early 2002. Some of the stars included Cuba Gooding Jr. who played Ted Brooks the Miami dentist and another star included Sisqo who you might remember from The Thong Song!!!!!Ted Brooks one day received a summons to see his father in a small town in Alaska. At this point he was shocked because he didn't know all his life until that moment that he was adopted. While there he was asked to take care of several racing dogs which would be used for the annual dog sledding race that takes place in Alaska each year. He also met an old man who was a professional dog sledder he was lost so Ted Brooks finally learned this sport so that he can save the man just in the nick of time.Snow Dogs was a terrific film. I have just watched this on Disney Channel a few days ago. This is a great movie because soon then Disney wouldn't be making classics like this anymore!!!!!1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary when entering the theater to see Snow Dogs.  Anyone who has seen The Princess Diaries Operation Dumbo Drop and Jungle 2 Jungle should know by nowDisney usually sucks at making comedies!  There are few exceptions like The Santa Clause and the underrated remake of That Darn Cat but that's not gonna change my opinion of Disney altogether.  The producers of Disney should really stick to animation.  That's what they're good at. One slight motivation for seeing this movie was Cuba Gooding Jr.  But though he's a terrific actor even he could make a clunkerhas anyone seen Chill Factor?  It happens to the greatest of actors.  Every once in a while a great actor wants to take a recess from serious drama and do either a broad comedy or a Bgrade action flick.  Cuba has done both.  Serious actors always want to show their audiences that they CAN loosen up and they CAN be goofy and uninhibited when they want to be.  As expected the humor in this movie is totally lame and utterly predictable.  Gooding hams it up to the extreme in his most overthetop performance uptodate but there really is no other way to perform this sort of comedy.  Let me see  Cuba's character never mushed a team of sled dogs before living in Miami all his life.  Are we supposed to find it hilarious when he gets dragged across the snow by the dogs over and over again?  Geez we didn't expect that to happen!  In the back of the theater a kidprobably five or six years oldkept laughing hysterically whenever that would happen but that's the point.  If you're over the age of 6this is not funny!There are assorted gags here and there that worked.  For example we find out that Cuba's father is actually the big brawny white sled team owner who people steer away from whenever he approaches and is nicknamed Thunder Jack James Coburn.  In one scene Cuba spots him in a store and tells the clerk He's my Dad.  Don't you see the resemblance?  The chemistry between Gooding and Coburn is wonderful.  And in another scene Cuba is feeding the dogs a mishmash of all sorts of organs from different animals called slump.  He comments In Miami we call this hot dogs. Snow Dogs is not painstaking to watch and is somewhat harmless but it's entirely lame and predictable.  The kind of film you watch and say Why even bother?  If there's anything the movie is notable for it's the first film to feature a cameo by Michael Bolton.  What happened?  Vanilla Ice's phone was busy?  I have to say that Alaskan woman who plays Gooding's love interest is completely hot!  God she's a fox!  So guys if you do have to sit through this movieespecially you fathers out thereat least you have some great eye candy!  My score  5 out of 10".

I mean I've heard comments saying this turned out to be the downfall for Cuba it's laughable I actually expected to be pleasantly surprised unfortunately I was dead wrong. There is not one laugh to be had in this movie not one in fact it looks pretty cheap production wise and this is a Disney film!. As I've noted many times before I think Cuba is an underrated talent and not a fluke like many people have said but his choice in projects are peculiar. It doesn't help that the storyline itself wasn't very interesting it just felt like an awkward type family film to be honest even if the dogs were cute. It started off with great potential I was enjoying the whole dentist in Miami storyline but once it went into colder territory it started to become embarrassing. Cuba is better than this he's better than the countless DTV film's he's putting out now a days he just needs a good script again.Performances. Cuba Gooding Jr. tries hard but his comical skills are not up to par and he's nowhere near enough to bring it back to respectability. James Coburn looks embarrassing I assumed he did it for some cash. Sisq's character is heavily grating. Joanna Bacalso is pretty to look at but she isn't that great in her role.Bottom line. Yes. Snow Dogs is as bad as they say it is. Kids will be bored adults shouldn't even go near this film and Cuba fans will just be shaking their heads at how far he's fallen. Avoid at all costs.210".

I would define this movie as an entertaining several laugh comedy worth adding to your viewing list.Its cool how he sleighs with the dogs all the dogs look neat and its works out nicely. I like the part when Ted first does to Alaska then he meets James and James tells him about his dogs. Then James gives Ted a home and Ted goes in it so when he goes in it he's get a little surprise from all of James' dogs. It was sick how they all just popped up and attacked him.

It is that moment that he learns he is adopted and that his real mother lived in Alaska. Travelling up to her remote village with the lawyercumpilot George Murphy Ted finds he has inherited her possessions including her cabin and all the contents. Planning to just sell the lot Ted is shocked to find a pack of huskies in the cabin. Waitress Barb hopes he will stay for a while but he plans to still sell the lot  and only stops when she tells him who his father is none other than the imposing and white Thunder Jack Johnson.Even before I watched this film I had the urge to throw out bad puns on the word dog  this urge wasn't helped by my recent viewing of Cuba's Boat Trip. However I tried not to prejudge this but I must admit a certain mix of smug satisfaction and wasted time in finding out that my fears were correct. With the thinnest of plots this film mainly gets by on city boy in the snow gags that sees Ted being chased by anything in Alaska that could chase you  bears dogs women you name it. This never really made me laugh at any point which left me with an uncomfortable amount of time to look at the characters and the plot. This knackered the film totally because these are areas that should have been covered up  not exposed. The plot itself is weak in regards the motivations and characters and by the time a small group of dogs drag the dead weight of two men and a sledge up a sheer drop I had stopped being disappointed by it.The characters needed to be strong to carry the family issues in the story but they are as thin as paper and just as bland. I didn't care for any of them and was less than interested in their problems and interactions. I know it was a Disney film but I'm sure even children will come out of it saying was I meant to be emotionally involved with this adopted son and his distant father?  well maybe not but you know what I'm trying to say. Gooding Jnr. Need I say any more or do you know where I'm going with this? God love him he tries hard and he puts in more welly than the material deserves. Doesn't mean he is any good but gosh does he want to please everyone. Coburn should have known better and I hope he got well paid for this nonsense. Nichols is a strange find but at least Sisqo is limited to more or less a cameo. Walsh and DoyleMurray are wasted but Bacalso has the hardest job. With no time and no realism she has to fall for Cuba and in the end she just suddenly does it  she is a beautiful woman but he has so much against her that she cannot be more than just a cute support woman.Overall this is a poor film that maybe has enough motion and people falling down to distract children but god help any adult that tries to get involved in either the comedy or the characters. Both are basic and badly done  I laughed once at a man being hit by ice god help me and could have cared less about the simple relationship problems of the cardboard cutouts on my screen. Cuba Gooding Jnr yet again proves that Oscar was an one off with a film that I wouldn't even recommend to children in case it stunts their emotional growth.".

At the auction she realizes it's not the original statue and chaos reigns during which a man is killed  and of course Blackie Morris who had pulled his gun is accused. The statue has a piece that comes off in the back and it's used to hide the dead body. Of course Blackie's wealthy friend Lloyd Corrigan Winninger buys the fake one for 200.This film is grand fun with Faraday Lane as bumbling as ever Blackie getting away from him in no time. George E. Stone is funny as the runt Blackie's sidekick. Playing Blackie himself Chester Morris is handsome demonstrating the character's good humor and relaxed manner with his great line deliveries. There's a subplot here of an old flame of Blackie's showing up and trying to blackmail him. But we all know that Blackie gets around.Confessions of Boston Blackie directed by Edward Dmytryk is zany and keeps you hopping.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1930s and 40s saw a ton of detective series films designed as the second in a doublefeature. These short fulllength movies were relatively quickly made and had relatively low budgets so they and other similar productions were nicknamed Bmovies. Some commonly known B detective films included Charlie Chan Sherlock Holmes The Saint The Falcon and also Boston Blackie. Though the Blackie series wasn't quite as famous as most of these listed they were still very good and often better than the more famous competition. However today they are practically forgotten and haven't been seen on American television for quite some timethat is until they were recently revived by Turner Classic Movies.Chester Morris played the title character and unlike many detective series he played this character in all the films Charlie Chan conversely was played by four different actors during the late 20s to almost 1950. His character was a reformed thief who had changed his ways after a stint in the big house but despite his now being in favor of law and order he was usually presumed to be guilty by the detectives investigating a crime.In this case Blackie is assumed to be a murderer when he uses his gun to stop a murder at an art auction. Of course no one but Blackie saw the real murderer and Blackie is chased through most of the film until naturally the real bad guys are exposed at the end. All the action is pretty fastpaced and welldone. In particular Chester Morris does a good job as a detective who actually will fight and DO something something Chan and Holmes practically never did! The only lowpoint of the movie is near the very end when Blackie nearly gets everyone killedthis plan worked but boy did it seem farfetched! Still for this type of film this is a very good entry and well worth seeing.".

One of the bad guys thinks the simple thing to do  knowing there are cops in the audience  is shoot the owner! Blackiealso in the audience is conveniently armed and shoots at the shooter. His shot causes the original bad guy to miss and shoot his own partner through the heart.Of course the cops don't look any further than Blackie but he easily gets away. The bottom line of this fast paced Boston Blackie entry is the police apparently can't count shots or do geometry or they would have known Blackie could not have fired all of those shots at those angles from where he was don't even notice the body of the auctioneer for a good while and never stop and ask themselves WHY would Blackie shoot at all of these people.Now let's turn our attention to the IQ of the art thieves. They make hollowed out statue replicas that anyone that knows art could spot in 10 seconds install secret panels in their statues which is a big tipoff that this is not an original and insist on having their art studio in what is obviously an underground death trap under the right circumstances  it wouldn't take OSHA to spot the hazard here. And if their goal is to ultimately steal the original why not just do that in the first place rather than stage this elaborate ruse with poorly made replicas? So why watch this theatre of the absurd? Mainly because of the wit and wisdom of Chester Morris as Boston Blackie plus it's just plain fun. On the lighter side we get to see Blackies's sidekick the runt attempt to evict an amazon who claims to be Blackie's wife from Blackie's apartment. Recommended for the fun of it all.".

One of these consisted of series films with previously well known characters usually from radio. Some actually pretended to have a mystery while others like this did not. The main appeal was supposed to be in the characters and their traits. Boston Blackie's character is one of the more endearing which allowed the extremely low budget production room to continue.Blackie is a successful thief one of those charming superclever types that appeared in the 20s and early 30s. Blackie stole because the rich deserved it pure and simple not out of selfish greed and in fact his story always mentions how he gave the proceeds to the starving. He was one of the inventions we created during the last period where the difference in the wealthy and poor was immense.By this time 1941 he had been reinvented. Now he was a retired thief with his cleverness turned to solving crimes the police were too dumb to understand. Along the way the police always the same guy would suspect Blackie of the crime. So in addition to outwitting the criminals  which was ordinary in such movies  he had to more severely and embarrassingly outwit the police. That's the added piece here.His two sidekicks are runt a Runyonesquire character and Arthur a rich but clueless playboy. Arthur is important because he anchors the political reinvention handily. He always has enough money which is freely available for Blackie's escapades.I've only seen a couple of these but this has something a bit extraordinary. Quite independent of any story element or need we have a thread inserted. One of Blackie's affairs has resurfaced a tall tough redheaded moll who claims to be married to him and wants money... or else.Its a strange episode obviously inserted to tell us something about Blackie that is expected to build his appeal and thus the franchise. He's a wisecracking guy clever guy who almost never resorts to violence. He's slick and chatty. But we get the idea here that in the bedroom he can master this wild amazon. Because in the US we were deep in the stupid prurient code there had to be this amazingly indirect way of telling us this.I suppose its important and that it worked. Blackie lasted for 15 films.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

It's up to Mr. Blackie and his new found sidekick Lloyd Corrigan to unmask the truth all the while as his old police lieutenant pal Richard Lane tries to pin it on him. Another dandy entry early in the series this is so good that after the first two I could easily do a marathon of the entire series. But as I found with other Columbia detectives The Lone Wolf the Crime Doctor the Whistler I couldn't enjoy it as much rushing through. Yes like other series I know I would be disappointed by the decline in quality as predictable formula kicked in. Lloyd Corrigan is a nice addition to the series always the cheerful fat man always perplexed with that non stop Betty White like smile on his face. There's a lot of clever antics abound in this entry directed with style by Edward Dmytryk who went onto much bigger things. I've seen Harriett Hilliard Nelson in a dozen or so films and this is the first time I've recognized her as her famous TV housewife and mother. She doesn't sing here but is a decent if not exceptional actress. Morris is obviously having a ball here these quota quickies filled with amusing situations funny lines and great technical achievements that influenced a lot of hopeful directors who took what they learned from watching these films and turned it into a true art form.".

Perhaps now this strong contender for the best thriller of the year may find the audience it deserves. Missold as a more art house friendly addition to the Guy Ritchie school of crime films Layer Cake is a unique and remarkable experience. The plot is deceivingly simple and would wrongly be placed in the gangsterwantingtoretirepeacefully cinema staple seen frequently in Al Pacino movies. It is a much greater accomplishment that the audacious visual style superb script and excellent performances make easy comparisons to this film pretty difficult. If anything it is closer to Schrader's 'American Gigalo' where the morally questionable hero is engulfed in a situation going on around him. The predominantly male cast is faultless with everyone from Dexter Fletcher to Michael Gambon putting in superb turns to give the characters justice. Far more human than the cartoon stereotypes we've come to expect after so very many Brit gangster flicks. Craig has never looked in better shape for taking on Hollywood. Hats off then to Matthew Vaugn for filming Britain as it can look. Grimy in places but every bit astonishing in locations as our Stateside cousins. We've grown too used to seeing rain pouring and hackneyed clichs that have represented this country on celluloid. It's not foppish. It's not Bend It Like Beckham. So there really is no excuse left not to see it aside from the awful trailer. Layer Cake deserves a wide audience and there's more than enough of everything for everyone to enjoy. At times hilarious astonishingly frank and incredibly concise the whole film is a pure joy and clearly made for people that love film. Makes you wonder why they can't all be as classy as this.".

Usually when a trailer needs to draw reference to 'one's we made earlier' in this case Lock Stock and Snatch when the writer or director of said films has nothing to do with the project the end result is a poor copycat. After watching the film I am more than impressed!Layer Cake introduces us once more to the world of the cockney gangsters and the dealing of drugs. The medication of choice this time is Ecstacy and the set up involves an upandcoming name in the dealing trade being thrown a job by one of the big names. Sent to find a missing girl and also buy and sell on a large shipment it all seems like easy work. However as he soon finds things are not always as they seem and before long his life is at risk when the deal begins to go sour.For the first 20 minutes of the film I couldn't decide whether it was going to be a Lock Stock or Honest the dreadful All Saints film. The film uses the obligatory 'catchy' tunes from the past 2 decades and uses the same type of framing of scenes as the genre. For the first 20 minutes whilst we were introduced rapidly to the characters in the tale it was hard to discern where the plot was going and even harder to care much about the players. By the half way point I was engrossed! The plot twists and turns at various points throughout and you do begin to care about the lead character and the associates around him.The film oozes cockney cool and although not quite on par with the best of the genre it is still a worthy and very engrossing offering from director Matthew Vaughn. Stylishly shot with a great soundtrack this is one of those films that blokes will walk out of very pleased but their partners may not feel the same way. Whilst not really violent or sexist in nature this is a lads film through and through and it is one cake that I want another slice of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seven years ago I sat in a movie theatre with little to no expectations for the viewing of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a British crimecomedydrama from producer Michael Vaughn. I had never heard of the director the future Mr. Madonna Guy Ritchie and there wasn't a single cast member that I could say I had seen before.A few years later Vaughn was back producing another Guy Ritchie film that put American actors Brad Pitt Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farnia amongst all the chaos in the British underground in Snatch.Despite the low fanfare they have since become cult hits both movies were refreshingly fun flicks that ended up on my top ten lists in their respective years of release.Now five years since Snatch made a splash on North American soil producer Michael Vaughn is back this time behind the lens for the new crime thriller Layer Cake.Layer Cake follows a cocaine dealer without a name played by Daniel Craig who is working towards his retirement from the underground biz. He doesn't see himself as a bad man. In fact his voice over reveals that he is not a gangster. He's a business man. However if Carlito's Way taught us anything it is that escape from a lifetime in the seedy crime world is not easy to dissolve oneself of.And things start to go amok immediately when crime boss Jimmy Price Kenneth Cranham forcefully delegates the task of finding the lost daughter of an old powerful friend to our protagonist. Reluctantly but without option the job is accepted and this begins the wicked spiral deeper into the drug and criminal underworld than he had ever hoped to venture.Soon there will be a drug trade gone bad an introduction to a character named Dragon who lops off the heads of his victims friends who will both have a drink with you and kick the living life out of your body in the same afternoon and enough crosses double crosses and screwyou's to keep you riveted to the screen.Much like Lock Stock and Snatch there are enough characters in Layer Cake to keep your head spinning. Vaughn doesn't try and spell things out for the audience and throws the kitchen sink at our small brains leaving it up the viewer to try and keep pace. Probably requiring a repeat viewing if for no other reason that to try and understand what is being said under the cover of some very strong English accents Layer Cake veers from the traditional cookie cutter type drugcrime caper by delivering a complex mix of violence and drama that is anything but packaged with a bow on top.By the time we are introduced to yet another group of players headed brilliantly by the alwaysreliable Michael Gambon you may need a second to collect your senses and figure out which end is up. It was like watching Memento except with more lively characters and a story that's actually worth your involvement.I was surprised to learn that this was Michael Vaughn's directorial debut. As a novice he was able to weave a complex web of multiple stories like a seasoned veteran in what I can only suspect to be a more realistic depiction of hit men and drug lords than anything Bad Boys waved in our faces a few years back.Lacking the dark humor of Lock Stock and Snatch Layer Cake is more like Goodfellas and to some extent Reservoir Dogs than its two closest relatives an ass kicking scene to Duran Duran's Ordinary World was reminiscent of Dogs' Stuck in the Middle With You. It's a film composed with characters that are so unique and interesting yet violent and criminal that you don't know who to root for. Case in point Gene played by Star Trek veteran Colm Meany. As Jimmy Price's right hand man Gene is a gangster that wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet in your brain if so ordered but portrayed as a human being who is just doing what he is told to survive in a world to which he is too accustomed. He is maybe the most charismatic bad guy since Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.Rumor in selected Trades is that Daniel Craig is the frontrunner for the Bond franchise if Pierce Brosnan decides to jump ship and his performance in Layer Cake proves that he is up to the task. His steely blue eyes and Steve McQueen type looks can ensure that we haven't seen the last of him and if we are lucky in his next film his character will get a name.Layer Cake is definitely not for all types. If you have problems following CSI then this movie is not for you. But for those of you who do stick around through the reveals and character developments I can assure you that the payoff is worth the investment. Layer Cake will be one of those films that in a few years men will be talking about around the work watercooler using words like 'ultracool' and maybe even 'classic'.www.gregsrants.com".

Imagine THE BIG SLEEP with an eversoslightly more coherent plot and as its protagonist a prosperous wily drug dealer looking to retire after one last score instead of tough but noble private eye Philip Marlowe. Our hero's problem is that he's a careful calculating businessman in a dicey business where he's surrounded by loose cannons who shoot stab or punch first and ask questions later. Director Matthew Vaughn has been best known as Guy Ritchie's producer but in his directorial debut Vaughn is like Martin Scorsese to Ritchie's Barry Sonnenfeld that's meant as a compliment to all concerned I assure you. It helps that Vaughn gets excellent performances from Daniel Craig as our cool but inoverhishead unnamed antihero usually films and books that refuse to name their main character strike me as trying too hard to be clever but it works here Michael Gambon nearly stealing the show as a cultured but ruthless narcotics kingpin Colm Meaney and THE INTERPRETER's George Harris as our protagonist's partners in crime and many folks from Guy Ritchie's films. Sienna Miller doesn't get to do much beyond being eye candy but she's tasty eye candy indeed. I'm as heterosexual a gal as they come but after seeing lithe leggy Miller strip down to black lingerie and garters I couldn't help thinking That Jude Law is one lucky guy!  One of the things I liked about LC is that the protagonist while thoughtful and competent is never quite as clever as he thinks he is somehow everybody manages to be one step ahead of him if only because they're all so damned unpredictable. Though I've only seen Daniel Craig in three of his many films the other two were THE ROAD TO PERDITION and THE JACKET he's clearly one of those actors who never looks or sounds the same from role to role so if he does indeed end up being Pierce Brosnan's successor as James Bond as rumored it'll be interesting to see how he fares playing the same character in more than one film!  In any case Craig certainly lives up to the new Steve McQueen rep that LC has garnered him. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to seeing Matthew Vaughn's turn at directing a film and what better genre to see him make his debut in than the British gangster genre especially after his roles in the fabulous 'LockStock...' and 'Snatch' even though they were Guy Ritchie's. Fans of those two movies may notice a few references in this one most notably two of the actors used and some of the dialogue sounded fairly similar to a few lines out of 'Lock Stock' but they didn't detract from the films quality. For a while I thought I was watching 'Snatch' from a few years ago as the pace and the amount of characters that were piling up in the film was at times overwhelming. This may be the downside to many people's opinion of the film but I could cope. I realized the main characters 'got to know them' and focused very much on them. Characters like 'The Duke' and 'Morty' that way I wasn't totally confused at first sight.The acting was good and there are moments which creep along silently that will have you on the edge of your seat. This included the factory in Amsterdam being robbed by 'The Duke' and his cronies as well as the scene during which our main character 'XXXX' is pinned down in a park by a psychopathic Eastern European hitman whilst on the phone to him.The acting is faultless and flows all the way through. When there are scenes which perhaps do go on longer than you'd like them to the acting and dialogue just manage to keep them going to the end. The humour element is also there as I expected it would be. Most of the time they're 'chuckle to yourself' moments but there are two or three moments where you'll really find something funny and want to laugh out loud.Overall it was great fun and a damn good film. I think it can just about stand it's self up there with Ritchie's two acts of brilliance as a result.I think you can tell I enjoyed my piece.........".

	schema:reviewBody "I can IMPOSSIBLY outline the plot of Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake so I'll just say it's about a nameless guy Daniel Craig doing some criminal stuff in London.In my observation there are three approaches to gangster characters in crime films 1 The overlyamateurish 'gangsters' that are scared sht and mess up like in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 2 The kind of gangster who is an amateur but picks up on criminal ways quickly and effortlessly if the occasion calls for it like Max the cab driver from Collateral and 3 The stonecold professionals who can do whatever whenever with whatever like any mobboss contract killer etc.What is so endlessly refreshing about Layer Cake 2004 is that it applies none of these approaches to its main character Daniel Craig. He is a drugdealer but reluctantly resorts to violent ways. He hates guns. Murders and violence disturb him. He takes time to cope with things. He shows fear and hesitation. He actually bleeds when he is hit. In short he is an extremely realistic person and this facilitates the film's realistic atmosphere  there's no glossy visuals or overthetop violence.Now it is my opinion that Layer Cake could have perhaps used some of the latter to spice things up. Its director is the producer of Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it is clear here that he is trying to move away from flashy Ritchie editing and effects as much as possible making his own film just a bit too barren in order to be 'different'. It works fine but as a result the gangster characters aren't very funny or colourful  rather they are downtoearth London men trying to make a living. A shady living true but still a living.A few bland characters and an extratemplate romantic storyline featuring Sienna Miller I like her but she is redundant in this film drag this film down but overall it is a very solid crime thriller superbly acted by Daniel Craig. The score is great. In particular please note the great use of Ordinary World by Duran Duran. Layer Cake isn't gloriously entertaining or anything but it feels very real and engaging and it is interesting to see the acting abilities of future Mr Bond  as well as his bare chest.710".

I didn't like the whole cake idea it was okay to a certain extent I guess. I did however enjoy Lock Stock and Snatch. Layer Cake is a different kind of animal.Whilst Lock Stock and Snatch were more comedy based Layer Cake has this more serious approach no names flashing on the screen identifying any of the characters so you have to pay extra special attention!There are several flashbacksub plots which don't particularly help as they can confuse you if you're not paying attention. There were many characters introduced to you in a short space of time and then suddenly going off at a tangent involving some of the 'slightly minor lead' characters.You can see the influences of other directors in Matthew Vaughn's end product. The direction style is good and the montage is solid.Daniel Craig gives a good solid performance. His narrative does help place him well in the movie. His narrative in the beginning is definitely something that draws you in. The rest of the performances are pretty good. Tamer Hassan has a minor role. After seeing the major role he had in The Football Factory he can act he should have possibly had a larger character. His character does not shine across as that 'demented' as that in The Football Factory. Sienna Miller was underused also which was a shame.Although there are some problems with the story Matthew Vaughn has made a respectable movie. This being his debut he has nothing to be ashamed of. As long as he works on the clarity of the plot more he will have no problems securing full audiences. Layer Cake gives a good reputation to British films instead of the some rubbish released over the last few years.I enjoyed the ending it was good I'm not going to say anything about it!My rating 710".

In Layer Cake Daniel Craig plays a smart drug dealer who has made enough money to retire on and intends to do just that.

Against the misgivings of his righthand man and back watcher Morty George Harris and his own better judgment he accepts and is shepherded through the process by Jimmy's man Gene Colm Meaney. Right away things spin out of control and get worse quickly. As with many of the best British gangster films alliances are made and broken at a dizzying rate nobody is who they seem to be and nobody can be trusted. Director Matthew Vaughn is impressive even though there are a couple of moves that are kinda well illadvised he keeps the pacing fast enough to keep you offbalance much of the time. No wonder Fox offered him XMen 3 you can see he has an affinity for action. The cast is competent and I've gotta say I've always admired Colm Meaney from his Star Trek days on down. He plays a very dangerous man in this one and you absolutely believe he is capable of doing very bad things. The twists and turns get dizzying towards the end and the final one comes literally from out of nowhere. Layer Cake illustrates the strata of British gangworld from the wealthy bosses to the crack heads in the crack houses and is believable throughout. Clearly one of the best of an already outstanding crop.".

It is a more powerful film dealing with bigger issues with bigger and very nasty villains most are very clever but with some real stupid 'eastenders. From Dragon to the Duke.A very clever and fast moving plot which some may find hard to follow. The layers of the film just keep on coming with more twists in the last 15 mins than any film I have seen. It has a very strong ending which cannot be said for so many films which go for a 'nice happy' one eg the only flaw in Micheal Man's Collateral not to give the ending away the killing should have been reversed?Faultless acting directing and photography with the film starting off with a portrayal of drug dealing as just another business but by the end of the film its a business that just deals in money and death. It has a very strong message concerning organised crime with a portrayal nearly as strong as goodfellas. A fine film  910".

Conolly based on his novel of the same name  maybe I was expecting another Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998 or Snatch 2000 but I thought Layer cake was a dull  lifeless crime thriller that plodded along making me more bored by the second. For a start there are too many character's who are too similar men in suits who swear a lot  act tough for instance cocky young drug dealers  ruthless bosses  the fact that the main character played by Daniel Craig is so flat  personality free I mean he isn't even given a name let alone any sort of background. Then there's the fractured plot which I found confusing as things would suddenly happen or change  there would be no time to take it in it just seems to go from one situation or one set of character's far too quickly  it just ended up feeling like one big unfocused mess. Layer cake has to be one of the longest 101 minute films I have ever sat through. Unlike other notable British gangster flicks there's no comedy here the over the top eccentric character's are nowhere to be seen  there's very little incident. I also want to point out that the plot revolves around drug dealers  I just can't agree with glamorising this activity I know it's a film but it stresses the point that dealing in drugs is an easy way to make loads of money  it never shows the consequences of what drugs do. Besides being boring it just left a bad taste in my mouth.Apparently Guy Ritchie was set to direct Layer Cake but he dropped out  it really could have done with his humorous  sarcastic dialogue his pacing  his style of plot twist's rather than the lifeless dull affair we end up with. Layer cake is a lot lot more restrained than either of Ritchie's films  boy does it tell not a whole lot happens considering how long Layer Cake lasts. The title Layer Cake refers to the multi layered structure of the crime world most people probably won't know that so that point will be lost on them. The film has it's stylish moments but too many long dull stretches I saw this on telly after walking past a dirt cheap second hand Bluray in a shop for months  I ma very glad I didn't spend any money on it. As far as I am concerned it stay on that shelf gathering dust.With a fairly modest 4000000 Daniel Craig probably earns more than that per film now this looks good  has nice production values but I doubt I will remember much about it by the end of the week. The acting is alright but restrained  Daniel Craig is surprisingly flat  lifeless  just doesn't seem interested.Layer Cake is a film that I really disliked the average user rating on the IMDb would suggest that I am in the minority but that's OK with me just so long as I don't have to watch Layer Cake again. A big disappointment  contrary to the IMDb user rating noone I know who has seen it likes it either.".

However when he is invited to meet Jimmy the boss he is given two jobs  handling a shipment of pills brought in by the Duke and also finding the daughter of Jimmy's boss Eddie.

The trailer was awful but the reviews were mostly good so I decided to give it a stab even though I generally don't get the appeal of these geezer gangster comedies and all their copies. I was rather relived to find that this film was much straighter than the others that had come to revel in violence and swearing in favour of plot but this is not to say that it is a great film just because it is different. It has a good story at its core but it isn't delivered very well and at times is just a bit too messy with too much going on. The complexity of the story is not a problem it is more a matter of it not all coming together as well as it should have done. Side issues dilute the main thrust although they are necessary for the bigger plot and they take away from the tension and urgency of the whole story. It still engages though but at times it feels unsure of itself and will occasionally feel a little long  fans expecting Lock Stock will be trying to laugh as they were in the audience I was in as they try to work out why it isn't funnier while those looking for a more traditional gangster film will wish it would lose the modern style a bit tighter the plot and make it more focused.The cast was a surprise to me because I happened to have seen The Football Factory the other night and a great deal of them were in and around the support cast here. Craig is a very attractive man and he has good presence on the screen but he finds his character difficult heck he doesn't even have a name to read. He is cool but I would have liked more to him than the usual old 'getting out from under' stuff. Support is soso from everyone else they all just more or less fall into the tried and tested stereotypes  'fckrough chav' 'cool boss man' 'brutal middlemen' and so on. Gambon Fletcher Hassan Foreman Healy all of these and the others are all fine but none of them really make much of an impression. The film is directed with restraint in comparison to Snatch and the like and I did like the way that Vaughn didn't just go for the empty style but rather directed pretty well.Overall this was better than I expected but then I didn't expect much from it. The story is good but not that well delivered and often comes across as being a bit messy and hard to totally get into but it is still OK. As a British gangster film it is good and happily just not another Lock Stock clone trying to cash in but it doesn't totally have its own voice. Worth seeing for what it is but just don't expect too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the film that made Daniel Craig into a star and shows that Matthew Vaughan was a talented director.Layer Cake is a multilayered complex film but is surprising easy to follow and a fairly short film similar to a John Le Carre novel. The focus of the film is a successful middleman cocaine dealer Daniel Craig. He plans to retire young but he is asked by his boss Jimmy Kenneth Cranham asks XXXX to find the missing drug addicted daughter of Edward Temple Michael Gambon and at the same time negotiate a large deal with a wannabe gangster The Duke Jamie Foreman who just stole one million ecstasy pills from some very angry Serbian gangsters. This leads XXXX in a dangerous world of treachery and double crossing and murder. This leads XXXX to doubt who to trust and what do to. As well there are subplots involving a loveinterest with Tammy Sienna Miller and XXXX's right hand man Monty George Harris gets revenge against the man who put him in prison.Layer Cake is based on a novel by J.J. Connolly who wrote the screenplay. He shows he could write a complex film. Originally Guy Ritchie was due direct but he had to put out because of scheling conflicts. This was a blessing really because we all know that Ritchie would have just made Layer Cake a comical mockney fair. What Vaughen did was he played the material as straight as possible keeping comedy to a minimum and a made an good example of a British Gangster film. Vaughen shows that he could handle the material and do some stylist directing trick like a pro fitting in with the film. Vaughen assembled an excellent cast. Daniel Craig was brilliant and according to statements by Barbara Broccoli this was the film that gave him the Bond gig. Michael Gambon was excellent and they were good performances by Colm Meaney George Harris Jamie Foreman and Kenneth Cranham. Sienna Miller also shows she can act. As well there is a great twist to the film.I personally highly recommend this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was the film that made Daniel Craig into a star and shows that Matthew Vaughan was a talented director.Layer Cake is a multilayered complex film but is surprising easy to follow and a fairly short film similar to a John Le Carre novel. The focus of the film is a successful middleman cocaine dealer Daniel Craig. He plans to retire young but he is asked by his boss Jimmy Kenneth Cranham asks XXXX to find the missing drug addicted daughter of Edward Temple Michael Gambon and at the same time negotiate a large deal with a wannabe gangster The Duke Jamie Foreman who just stole one million ecstasy pills from some very angry Serbian gangsters. This leads XXXX in a dangerous world of treachery and double crossing and murder. This leads XXXX to doubt who to trust and what do to. As well there are subplots involving a loveinterest with Tammy Sienna Miller and XXXX's right hand man Monty George Harris gets revenge against the man who put him in prison.Layer Cake is based on a novel by J.J. Connolly who wrote the screenplay. He shows he could write a complex film. Originally Guy Ritchie was due direct but he had to put out because of scheling conflicts. This was a blessing really because we all know that Ritchie would have just made Layer Cake a comical mockney fair.

However big boss Jimmy Price hands down a tough assignment find Charlotte Ryder the missing rich princess daughter of Edward a powerful construction business player and gossip papers socialite. Complicating matters are two million pounds' worth of ecstasy and a whole series of double crossings.Here is a British gangster movie that will automatically be compared to Guy Richie film's Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels even though this movie is something of it's own. Where Richie's films were more of a comedic tone Layer Cake takes itself more seriously which is why you must pay attention to what is shown to you on the screen.Matthew Vaughn take special care with the translation to screen from JJ Connelly's novel. Here we see that he has an eye for great crimegangster movies. One particular scene will stay in my mind as one of the most memorable scene's in any gangster movie. When Morty is beating the crap out of Frankie in the diner while the music Ordinary World by Duran Duran is playing in the background. Beautiful camera work editing music all blending perfectly together to give you a raw emotional and jaw dropping scene.The music throughout the entire film is perfectly suited for the style. Right from the beginning we get She Sells Sanctuary with the guitar stringing cords played beautifully the music prepares you for the intense film you are about to see. Every piece of music used in Layer Cake fits that scene perfectly great ears were put to use here.Colm Meaney plays the same type of character in a lot of movies a p'd off I can kill you whenever I want attitude...and he pulls it off differently every time. Daniel Craig while I was introduced to him in Tomb Raider shows what he can actually do in with his talent and those freaky blue eyes. His character who's name is never mentioned can be the next 007. The only thing that I didn't like about the his character was that he fell in love with this girl who he just met. To me that seemed rather sudden and random.The movie's plot is clichd a bad guy will do one last deal before quitting but gets pulled into a twisting plot of bad things. Yes we've seen these bad thing happen before in numerous movies but this movie pulls it off with style and shock value I was shocked twice during this film. When the sniper out of no where gets sniped from Dragon. That was totally unexpected and worked so well. Of course the ending as well which again comes out of nowhere. Ironic how throughout the whole movie XXXX believes that his job dealing with drugs and whatnot would be the reason behind him dying and yet it's a woman. Not saying that he dies this is left unanswered he does get shot be we never see him die so his death is debated by the many fans of the film who indeed hope for a sequel.What else is there to say besides the fact that this movie is not only stylish but it's ultra cool. It's a different take on British crime from a Guy Richie movie but a step up from the film Gangster No.1. Layer Cake take twists and turns left right and centre and for once in a blue moon they actually make sense. So pick it up because this film has more then one layer to it itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was something of a sleeper hit and you can understand why it wasn't an overnight success on its release in 2004 .  Goodness me another Brit flick featuring gangsters haven't seen one of those since the last British film was released  . Come to think of it that's what everyone in Britain would have said in 2003  2002 and well what year was LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS released ? That said LAYER CAKE sticks out from the Guy Ritchie clones because of its leading man and its director with Daniel Craig and Mathew Vaughn going on to bigger and better things . Deservedly I might I add and for the most part LAYER CAKE is superb but then like so many British films it falls apart. The cake obviously needed a bit more foundation in its making It does get off to a great start where Craig's nameless antihero recounts his life of crime and right away it has social relevance as he makes a very cogent and simple point that drugs are bad but the criminalisation of drugs is much worse . This intelligent thinking is complimented by the use of intelligent language of cinema . All too often a British movie looks like it's made for television but despite having a relatively low budget Vaughn lays on an eye catching visual style that hypnotises the audience as we're told a tale involving a drug heist going wrong  Serbian war criminals on the rampage and a man who is willing to pay anything to find his missing daughter So far so good but as stated like so many and too many films from Britain the first half can't keep up with the second half . As soon as Michael Gambon's posh gangster turns up the film starts to meander all over the place . Looking at the trivia section it says that JJ Connoly's novel was 344 pages long whilst his original draft of the screenplay was 404 pages so he effectively wrote the screenplay for a film lasting 404 minutes and has had to ditch half of it . This explains the unsatisfactory nature of the narrative and aspects involving characters and plot turns appear and disappear for no reason . The screenplay is if not a mess then at least over complicated to say the least What stops the film being ruined by it  and which why it was a success with the critics who'd no doubt seen too many of these type of Brit gangster flicks  is that the audience will be swept up by the visual style of the film and its lead actor . It'd be very easy to say that it's style over substance and to be honest that's what it is . However the directing  editing and musical score is so good that all the flaws with the story telling can be instantly forgiven and forgotten".

	schema:reviewBody "Layer Cake may not be a particularly original film. Its plot seems reminiscent of countless others e.g. Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Nonetheless it is a stylish and entertaining one and keeps the viewer hooked right up until the final scene. Daniel Craig plays a drug dealer whose character is not actually named and who is referred to simply as XXXX in the closing credits in London. He regards himself as a businessman rather than a criminal. He professes to a hatred of guns and violence and he goes about his lucrative dealings in a lowkey manner and in a way designed to keep himself under the radar and out of trouble. His aim is to make some money and to retire to Spain or somewhere similar to enjoy the fruits of his illgotten gains. However his plans come awry when on the threshold of retirement he is asked by a powerful crime boss with whom he has done a number of deals in the past Jimmy Price played by Kenneth Cranham to find the missing daughter of a friend and associate of his. That friend and associate turns out to be Eddie Temple brilliantly portrayed by Michael Gambon who is even more powerful devious and ruthless than Price. It transpires that Price's motives in asking for his friend's daughter to be located are not as altruistic as they seem. Price also asks Craig's character to find a buyer for a huge consignment of drugs that have in fact been stolen by another dealer The Duke played by Jamie Foreman from a ruthless Serbian drugs gang whose leader Dragan has a penchant for beheading anyone who gets in his way. Craig's character finds it difficult to say no to the powerful Price and so he embarks on a course that raises his profile and makes him enemies. Layer Cake is a riveting film. Although its plot earns few marks for originality it is a well written one by J J Connolly who based the screenplay on his own novel of the same name and is clearly and accessibly portrayed. There are several clever twists that are plausible and unexpected. I have seen so many films of this sort in which the plot is either ludicrous or does not hang together properly. That is most definitely not the case here. The direction is very good and Craig himself is excellent in the starring role. The supporting cast which contains a number of wellknown British character actors as well as stars such as Gambon are all very good too. The soundtrack which features British rock music by the likes of The Cult and Duran Duran and which makes good use at the end of the film of Joe Cocker's version of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood perfectly complements what we see on the screen. There are some minor visual continuity errors. One such is that the injuries on the face of Craig's character after he receives a going over from his fellow gangsters for supposed disloyalty are not compatible with each other in succeeding scenes. I also think that the film's attempts at humour are somewhat misplaced. Here are two examples. Temple is portrayed as liking opera and in one scene is keen to complete a conversation so that he can get away to go to a performance of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. A northern hit man when travelling in a taxi with Craig's character is more keen on practising his oral French in readiness for an imminent test than on a more normal conversation. These two scenes are presumably intended to lighten things up. But they seem merely to be bolted on for the sake of it and add nothing to the development of either character. These are minor weaknesses though. Layer Cake is an entertaining film that is well worth seeing. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "This British gangster film was originally intended for director Guy Ritchie's typically heavyhanded approach but thankfully duty took him elsewhere and the gig landed in producer Matthew Vaughn's hands. Vaughn is now wellestablished amongst the Hollywood elite having since gone on to direct the underrated Stardust 2007 the hugely entertaining KickAss 2010 and the rather hitandmiss XMen First Class 2011 but he made his name with this nowcult and extremely stylish little thriller that also paved the way for star Daniel Craig to become James Bond and an Alister in one swoop. Vaughn's ability to stamp his quirky humour onto relatively familiar grounds is clear from the off with Craig nameless protagonist credited simply as XXXX giving us the narration to his world only this protagonist is about to get a massive lifelesson and one that is quite suitable to our times.XXXX is a successful cocaine dealer who along with his cohorts Gene Colm Meaney Morty George Harris Terry Tamer Hassan and Clarkie Tom Hardy is on the verge of making the big deal that could see his retirement. Have a plan and stick to it he tells us only crime boss Jimmy Price Kenneth Cranham has different ideas. He sets XXXX the task of finding the daughter of larger crime lord Eddie Temple Michael Gambon a promising girl who has taken to drugs and since gone missing. Meanwhile in Amsterdam cocky gangster Duke Jamie Foreman has made a huge ecstasy heist but has stolen from the wrong person. All roads lead to XXXX who finds himself pulled into a labyrinthine crime world where he starts to truly know his place.This world of loudmouthed gangsters and powerful old men in expensive suits that London and the UK film industry seems to enjoy mixing itself up with is frankly tiresome and has been done to death especially in the straighttoDVD market. Yet Layer Cake has less of the colourful wisecracking cockerneys and slowmotion bloodshed of Guy Ritchie's back catalogue and shares more with the sleek neonlit world of Michael Mann. Although it does quite often border on style oversubstance and the multistranded plot is not quite as clever as it thinks it is the film is funny entertaining and frequently surprising. The final moments especially pull the rug from beneath you when you think everything is nicely wrapped up.The title refers to the social stratification of XXXX's world and shows that it applies even to the criminal underworld as well as business social and political systems. XXXX thinks of himself as top dog and in the opening scenes we see him coolly going about his business  shades on snappy suit and he even takes the girl Sienna Miller of Duke's ridiculous nephew Sidney Ben Whishaw. But his world like our world doesn't quite work like that. In the past year or so we as the public have learned that we are mere cockroaches in a crushing capitalist country that vomits luxury onto the rich and powerful and steals from the taxpayer. Like us XXXX is chewed up by the system giving him a slapintheface dose of realism that he didn't see coming. The system is embodied by the towering Eddie Temple in an effortlessly brilliant performance by a ridiculously faketanned Michael Gambon. This aspect is the main reason why this film stands out amongst its imitators. An introduction to an interesting filmmaker and its intriguing star.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Yet Layer Cake has less of the colourful wisecracking cockerneys and slowmotion bloodshed of Guy Ritchie's back catalogue and shares more with the sleek neonlit world of Michael Mann. Although it does quite often border on style oversubstance and the multistranded plot is not quite as clever as it thinks it is the film is funny entertaining and frequently surprising. The final moments especially pull the rug from beneath you when you think everything is nicely wrapped up.The title refers to the social stratification of XXXX's world and shows that it applies even to the criminal underworld as well as business social and political systems. XXXX thinks of himself as top dog and in the opening scenes we see him coolly going about his business  shades on snappy suit and he even takes the girl Sienna Miller of Duke's ridiculous nephew Sidney Ben Whishaw. But his world like our world doesn't quite work like that. In the past year or so we as the public have learned that we are mere cockroaches in a crushing capitalist country that vomits luxury onto the rich and powerful and steals from the taxpayer. Like us XXXX is chewed up by the system giving him a slapintheface dose of realism that he didn't see coming. The system is embodied by the towering Eddie Temple in an effortlessly brilliant performance by a ridiculously faketanned Michael Gambon. This aspect is the main reason why this film stands out amongst its imitators. An introduction to an interesting filmmaker and its intriguing star.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather well made and flashy movie that in the end is still nothing more than an average British crime movie.The fact that this movie doesn't really raise above the level of average is due to the story. It's not necessarily a movie with a confusing story but its more a movie that makes things unnecessarily hard on itself just to let the story seem more complex than it in fact truly is. It's as if the movie tried too hard to be something that it just isn't. On top of that the story also isn't always interesting or original enough to follow. The beginning is good and so is the ending but the middle drags a little and offers little new.So you can say that the storytelling is worse than the actual story. Sure the movie is made with lots of pace and style but it seemed to me as if the director lost track of things at times. Matthew Vaughn is also still a beginning director so I'm sure of it he will learn from his mistakes and he'll become a better director one day. It isn't really a tough gangster flick though the intentions are definitely there. I feel that the movie would had been a better one of it was even more brutal and straightforward. Also some more humor and less serious characters would had worked out better for the movie. No this really unfortunately ain't no Guy Ritchie movie who still makes the best British gangster movies.But of course this still obviously is a good movie to watch. The actors carry the movie and in the end the movie also offers some nice and thoughtful twists like you always could expect from a British gangster movie.Daniel Craig was a surprising and great leading actor. It's not his best role but still he mostly carries the movie entirely on his own. The movie is still filled with lots of fine supporting actors such as Colm Meaney Michael Gambon Dragan Micanovic Sienna Miller Dexter Fletcher and George Harris. Especially nice to see Colm Meaney in a big production again. Sienna Miller's role seemed to be completely redundant on some other characters on the other hand got underused such as the Dragan Micanovic's one.A rather good movie to watch but not the mustsee everyone makes you believe it is.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

No though it is far better as an adaptation than Burbank Films Australia's version. Is it the best version? Again nothe 1973 Richard Lester film though not the worst. The story is charming and adventurous with the basic feel of the story evident in most scenes and the dialogue doesn't suffer from being too overlysimplified in fact it is suitably witty in spots. The music is wonderful with many classical music favourites like Night on Bare Mountain Pictures at an Exhibition Marche Slave and Lohengrin shown and used to good effect though the best used was the Charpentier Te Deum the most fitting to the music of the time period and suitably rousing. The characters I had little problem with Constance is far less annoying than she is in Burbank's version the villains are suitably antagonistic and the heroes are engaging. Milady doesn't quite have the haunting quality she does in other versions but is enticing nonetheless. I loved the colour and fluidity of the backgrounds also the character designs are not as fluid but serviceable at least. The voice work is solid. All in all liked it very much. 910 Bethany Cox".

A devout pacifist he undertook the difficult challenge of turning battlefield horrors into a story suitable for the screen. That accomplished Griffith actually took some of his cast  crew across the dangerous Atlantic to London and a meeting with Prime Minister David Lloyd George and then it was on to France for some quick filming at the front lines.All of which proved unnecessary. Infuriated by Berlin's unrestricted use of submarine warfare America declared war on Germany in April of 1917 months before HEARTS OF THE WORLD could be completed back in Hollywood.While not as innovative or groundbreaking as its two celebrated predecessors HEARTS OF THE WORLD can stand on its own merits. Filled with Griffith's special touches its principle value exists in its revelation of his contemporaneous feelings about the War even as the conflict still raged. He bestowed on it sequences as poignant and harrowing as any in his oeuvre. Who can forget Lillian Gish on her wedding day driven mad by the bombardment preparing to spend her bridal night alongside the corpse of her betrothed? Or the sight of three little boys secretly burying their dead mother in a cellar so her body would not be disgraced by the enemy. Griffith assures scenes such as these are not easily banished from the viewer's memory.Besides the numinous Miss Gish appreciation should be extended to Bobby Harron as the film's stalwart hero this fine young actor would die in 1920 of an accidental gunshot wound not a suicide as is usually reported. Dorothy Gish plays a feisty comedic role giving the film a light touch at welcome intervals. Josephine Crowell  Kate Bruce are memorable as the two tragic mothers both victims of the war.Also appearing are a couple of stars in embryo a young Sir Nol Coward is the extra pushing the wheelbarrow containing Miss Lillian's luggage in her first scene. Technical Supervisor Erich von Stroheim is easily recognizable as a bald German officer he would eventually dominate Hollywood's silent films of the 1920's using the full force of his own rather bizarre genius.Special appreciation should be paid to the splendid cinematography of Billy Bitzer who performed yeoman service for Griffith in several of his epics.".

And continuing into the silent era of the 1920s with some distance from the war such films as The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse The Love Light both 1921 The Big Parade 1925 Mare Nostrum What Price Glory both 1926 Seventh Heaven and Wings both 1927 were made.D.W. Griffith was generally a pacifist that's clear in many of his films despite their exciting battle sequences. Not unexpectedly however with Hearts of the World he gave his support to the entente cause and with the aid of the British government called for the US entry into the war. That had already occurred by the time of completion of the film though and so the ending has the US army saving the day. Yet the picture still contains a pacifist plea or regret over the situation.The excellent war scenes which incorporate actual footage from the front add power and realism to the sympathetic message. Cinematographer G.W. Bitzer or others under his influence as he was absent from location shooting in France due to his German heritage uses smallscale widescreen masking effects during the battle scenes as he had in Intolerance. It's effective as the scenes are generally shown from a distance more so and surely for practical reasons than in other Griffith films. As a result it seemed more real to me and much of it was real.Generally I welcome the drama of love between Robert Harron and Lillian Gish's characters threatened against the backdrop of war. Gish's episode with insanity is especially well realized and Dorothy Gish is delightful as The Little Disturber. But the drama does subvert the power and realism of the film at times. It is indeed an old fashioned play and there are some ludicrous moments in it such as a rehashed scene from The Birth of a Nation where Gish's virginity is threatened by a German officer.The following year Abel Gance demonstrated how a fictional story could add to the power and realism in his antiwar opus J'Accuse! And that's what separates these two films. In J'Accuse! there is rape by a German soldier and an analogous love triangle. Its approach is considerably more downbeat however and much more real rather than the oldfashioned sentimentality theatricality and naivety that occasionally creeps up in Hearts of the World. Yet that's to be expected in Griffith's work and it doesn't detract severely from the better parts of the film or the drama. Overall Hearts of the World represents and reflects an important time in both film history and world history.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a superb telling of war and how it affects the common people.  It begins with life in a small French village and how people go about their daily lives.  This is the story of two Americans Lillian Gish and Robert Harron who meet and fall in love.  But during their courtship Lillian's sister Dorothy takes a liking to Robert called The Boy on the movie title cards and tries to take him which leads to some interesting scenes.  She finally realizes she can't have him and decides to take what she can have.There are good action battle scenes that very well show the chaos that is a battle.  Chaos reigns supreme again when the town is bombed and the citizens have to flee.  They have to try and pack then get out and still survive the bombing.  Then there are those that don't want to leave.  The movie does a good job of showing the horrors of death and the impact that has on people.War is about people.  We tend to forget that today's news refers to the impact on nonsoldiers as 'collateral damage'.  D.W. Griffith shows that impact.  And yet when it is over how quickly we again look for the bright side of life and that is how it should be.One of the great features of this film is the limited use of title cards. They are used mostly as background filler and very little for conversations much like Sunrise.  Yet you know what is going on and the emotions of the moment.  There is nothing mechanical about the acting. 810".

Then there are those that don't want to leave.  The movie does a good job of showing the horrors of death and the impact that has on people.War is about people.  We tend to forget that today's news refers to the impact on nonsoldiers as 'collateral damage'.  D.W. Griffith shows that impact.  And yet when it is over how quickly we again look for the bright side of life and that is how it should be.One of the great features of this film is the limited use of title cards. They are used mostly as background filler and very little for conversations much like Sunrise.  Yet you know what is going on and the emotions of the moment.  There is nothing mechanical about the acting. 810";

The film itself was quite spectacular but it was made even more so by the incredible artistry of Donald Sosin. He played for the entire 2 12 hours without a break and with just a few notated markings. He presented a very operatic treatment of the story which suited the plot perfectly. I was fascinated by his ability to improvise many musical themes and leitmotivsall with such great flare and virtuosity. I must admit that these silent films can have very fragile plots but with the right kind of music accompanying them they take on real substance and even nuance.

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is one of the first generation of propaganda pictures. A few of these appeared in the final years of the First World War after the US had joined the conflict and just as young Hollywood was beginning to realise the influential power of its medium. This was a war in which nineteenth century pomp and nationalism combined with twentieth century military technology and as such it was sold with an aggressive and hypocritical zeal.Hearts of the World happens to be directed by DW Griffith who had probably done more than anyone else to make the industry what it now was. It appears however that the softhearted humanitarian didn't quite have it in him to be a gungho warmonger. On the one hand he does make the Germans out to be a bunch of barbaric wouldbe rapists but this is actually a fairly restrained portrayal compared to your average recruitment poster of the time as well as many other movies on other subjects  check out for example the superugly anarchist in 1928 white Russian film Tempest. Griffith even seems to be working in a message of sympathy throwing us some near identical closeups of a German soldier and Bobby Haron in the first battle scene. And rather than getting us all excited about the business of killing people Griffith focuses much more on the possibilities of peace and safe homecoming. This is in fact laid on a little too heavily in the early intertitles the street on which the characters live being called Rue de la Paix Road of Peace and a title pointing out that the goslings Lillian Gish fondles are harmless. Griffith would have been better off relying upon the strength of his images.And the images here are strong as always. Griffith's scenes of rural idyll are a far more succinct evocation of peace and happiness than his words. A particularly beautiful moment typical of the director is when Gish and Haron meet by the wall of his house with the actress neatly framed amid ivy creepers like a little portrait. Griffith employs some of his oldest cinematic tricks for example having villainous George Siegmann walking towards us showing his actions and mannerisms as he approaches and finally giving us a menacing closeup as he brushes past the camera all within one shot. As always one of the director's greatest strengths is the way in which he orchestrates a sequence. Take for example the point at which war is declared and the men go off to fight. We get some busy and intense shots of soldiers marching off and tearful goodbyes cutting dynamically from one vignette to another. The whole thing ends however with a slow and simple shot of Gish putting away her wedding dress a poignant ritardando to the frenzy that went before it.This is one of a handful of features in which both the Gish sisters Lillian and Dorothy appeared. As was usually the case younger sister Dorothy plays a comical secondary character alongside a comical secondary actor Robert Anderson to form a comical secondary romantic story. She spends most of this picture huffing indignantly and waddling around. It's not a very funny act. Even Lillian is not especially good in this one her performance being largely wideeyed innocence or wild hysterics. This was a problem in Broken Blossoms 1919 too and I think it has a lot to do with her being put into girlish roles that were beneath her. In the early 1910s Griffith seemed to be wanting the actress to grow up quick putting her in very mature roles in Musketeers of Pig Alley and The Mothering Heart. Perhaps influenced by the more popular Mary Pickford who had around this time rather disturbingly reverted to child roles Gish went through a phase of playing it young and cutesy. It didn't suit her and the poor characterisation really harms this picture.Hearts of the World is in an odd kind of way everything that the typical wartime propaganda picture is  nave formulaic and painfully idealistic. But it has also has the propaganda movie's capacity for wellmade action sequences and these are among the pictures few saving graces. Griffith has not lost his touch at putting together a rousing finale mixing the big canvas explosions hordes of soldiers with the small Haron's little brothers sheltering together from the melee in a crosscutting extravaganza. The story may be a little weaker this time round as Griffith's stories increasingly would be but the pioneering director has lost none of his ability to move and excite with the power of his images.".

Known as a propaganda effort Griffith brings forth his feelings towards war with opening intertitle God help the nation that begins another war of conquest of meddling. Brass bands and clanging sabers make fine music but let us remember that there is another side of war. After all does war settle any question? The south was divided  thousands of lives were sacrificed by the Civil War yet did it really settle the black and white problem in this country? Following the pattern of Griffith's controversial melodrama THE BIRTH OF A NATION 1915 HEARTS OF THE WORLD at two hours is very much a recycling of that epic moving its time frame from the Civil War South 18611865 to its more recent battleground of the World War 19141918 making this particular one something from the time capsule.The narrative begins during the peaceful days of 1912 in an unnamed French village where two American families the Hamiltons Jack Cosgrove and Kate Bruce and the Stephensons Adolphe Lestina and Josephine Crowell live in a double house on the Rue De La Paix Street of Peace. Marie Stephenson Lillian Gish having just returned from her visit with her aunt in Rheims and Douglas Gordon Hamilton Robert Harron an artist and poet just back from Paris with three younger brothers Marion Simmons Francis Marion and the littlest one Ben Alexander who worships him the neighboring boy and girl eventually meet start a courtship that turns to eternal love. On the day of their wedding war is declared. Douglas enlists along with his friends Cuckoo Robert Anderson and the village carpenter George Fawcettcalling themselves The Three Musketeers. As Douglas leaves Marie to fight for France so does Cuckoo who has fallen in love with a street singer known as The Little Disturber Dorothy Gish. As the men face uncertainties fighting in the trenches the once peaceful village is taken over by Von Strohm George Siegmann leader of the enemy Germans who once lived in that village not only has his regiment burn portions of it but places the women to extreme measures working labor jobs to be brutally whipped namely Marie when unable to fulfill their tasks. Part II Struggle of Civilization soon follows.In spite of its age HEARTS OF THE WORLD is fine storytelling with many elements now associated by Griffith from the development of his central characters the Griffith trademark where families affectionately kiss on the mouth to his attention to detail with the camera recording fine visuals of actual location footage around France and intercutting between war on the front and survival in the village. The scene where the younger Hamilton boys taking it upon themselves to bury their dead mother No prayers save childish tears is highly effective and quite moving.  With the large cast headed by Griffith's most frequent costars Lillian Gish and Robert Harron the center of attention is nearly drawn towards Lillian's sister Dorothy. The Gish sisters who share little screen time together work remarkably well in their assigned roles. Lillian an outstanding actress here in the manner of Mary Pickford sporting curly hair starts off her girlish charms as the aggressor attracting the boy next door maturing as the story progresses. Her most dramatic moment occurs following the death of her mother. Her facial change of emotions from disbelief to shock is realistically done. Under incapable hands this scene would have been laughable. Another scene worth noting occurs later as Gish's character walks aimlessly through the battlefield only to find her wounded beloved Harron whom she mistakes as dead. As for Dorothy she provides the lighter side to the story with her comedic flair as the flirtatious young girl who attracts men with a blink of an eye. At one point she forces herself upon the boy Harron the very moment to be spotted by the girl Lillian who loves him. Wearing a large beret over her very dark hair and sporting ordinary clothes her role could very well be the predecessor to Renee Adoree's performance in King Vidor's epic war drama THE BIG PARADE MGM 1925 or categorized as a predate of the highspirited Clara Bow of the 1920s. Regardless Dorothy Gish an underrated actress whose many movies lack availability today deserves praise for her work as The Little Disturber. Other members in support are include L. Lowery The Deaf and Blind Musician George Nichols The German Sergeant Erich Von Stroheim The German Soldier and Fay Holderness The Innkeeper. Appearing briefly are Mary Gish Lillian  Dorothy's mother and future playwrightactor Noel Coward as a man with wheelbarrow.With occasional revivals at New York City's Museum of Modern Art's film department HEARTS OF THE WORLD was introduced to New York's own public television WNET Channel 13 in September 1977 as part of its weekly series Films of Persuasionthe second movie following the premiere presentation of Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION.

	schema:reviewBody "Hearts of the World 1917  out of 4 D.W. Griffith's WW1 epic has two Americans Robert Harron Lillian Gish living in France and falling in love. When the German's attack the man goes off to fight which ends with devastating results. The actual making of this film is somewhat more interesting than the final product although the movie is still good but several notches below The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. After that epic 1916 film Griffith wanted to try something bigger and found that the British government was willing to give him full access to anything he wanted. Griffith wanted to shoot real battle scenes and that's what he did for the film and he nearly once again was killed doing so. The British paid for the film to be made in hopes that it would inspire America to join the war effert. As for the film it has some brilliant moments but sadly the love story really brings things down which was somewhat surprising since Griffith is usually good with the melodrama. Harron is decent in his role but not strong enough to carry the film. Gish on the other hands is terrific as usual as is her sister Dorothy. Erich von Stroheim plays one of the German's in charge. The battle scenes a lot of them real WW1 footage is the highlight of the film and like Griffith's previous two films it's rather amazing to see everything play out. This is certainly some of the greatest battlefield scenes I've ever watched. There's also another terrific scene where Gish fearing her love is dead tries to find him in the trenches. Gish's walk mixed with the beautiful cinematography makes this an unforgettable scene. In the end the film is certainly flawed but the battle scenes make it worth at least one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The relationship between this Herr Graf and Herr D. W. Griffith has been always complicated even tumultuous through the years due to artistic considerations and differences. These disputes don't of course lessen the Amerikan director's fundamental importance in cinema history for this German count. The basic problem with Herr Griffith is that he is sometimes simplistic in his stories and often paternalistic combining religion and conservative values that make some of his work seem very dated. Hearts Of The World has many of those irreconcilable artistic differences for this German count. The film depicts the loves and sorrows of two American citizens in France  Why do they have to be Americans? Surely there were lovers in France and their families in a little town during WWI.During the first part of the film Herr Griffith depicts the idealized and tranquil lives of the two sweethearts their families and their neighbours all in the typical and sentimental Herr Griffith style. There is so much sweetness in the air that this Herr Graf found himself looking forward anxiously to the arrival of Germans. Arrive they finally do invading the village and poisoning the idyllic life with their brutality and bad manners.Hearts Of The World it is not a pacifist film it is true that in 1918 the date of the film's release the world was still licking its wounds after such a big disaster but the end of the war was in sight and new perspectives were emerging making the film's lopsided and patriotic approach seem out of date. Obviously Heart Of The World is a fictional film not a documentary  although the film includes real war sequences besides a prologue for the British release in which Herr Griffith himself appears in the war trenches and at 10 Downing Street a good example of Griffith's sense of self importance  nor does it need to be one but the story lacks interesting and realistic characters.As this Herr Graf mentioned before the typical Herr Griffith mannerisms don't reduce his artistic accomplishments and there is much narrative vigor in this film especially during the war sequences. It has a number of strong scenes including one wherein our hero is paying a visit to his sweetie  well he's on some sort of secret mission while his comrades are being killed trying to retake the village. There is also a beautiful sequence showing our suffering heroine temporarily deranged and wandering in the field camp looking for her fiance. Also outstanding are the decors and the skillful combination of fictional and real war sequences splendid editing gives motion and emotion to those scenes.The actors do their best within the limits of Herr Griffith's particular artistic interests Herr Douglas Gordon Hamilton does well as the handsome hero a promising bourgeoisie writer before the war. Frau Lillian Gish and her curls is the typical Herr Griffith heroine conservative and candid. She will lose her innocence during wartime but emerge the stronger for it. Meanwhile Frau Lillian Gish's sister Frau Dorothy playing the Little Disturber overacts painfully while the German actors play their characters as America saw Germans brutal and ruthless utterly indifferent to the pain of others.Hearts Of The World is a Herr Griffith film that devotees of the Amerikan film director will enjoy a lot and those who have many differences with the Griffith style will still appreciate it to some extent if they put aside the Amerikan director's conventional and dated approach to the story and characters.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must attend a soire full of heartless Teutonic aristocrats.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

Director Griffith doesn't shy away from highlighting the evils of war complimented by the honor of those who fought in the trenches and the honor many of the village locals have for their homeland.

However please understand that it was a piece of blatant propaganda financed by the British governmentdesigned to get the Americans to commit to the war. However by the time the film was released the Americans had declared war on the Central Powers including Germany. Just keep in mind that the onedimensional view of the war is historical nonsense. And while folks in 1918 wouldn't agree the US really had no reason to get involved in this as EVERYONE involved was responsible for this long and senseless war. But in the film the Germans are mostly murderous guys bent on despoiling women and the French are 100 pure and virtuouswhich clearly makes the film propaganda. Want some more examples? How about the intertitle card that reads German militarists plan the dastardly blow against France and civilization! Heck the Germans in this one even want to blow up baby geese!!

This is a propaganda picture through and through and it has not weathered the years well.The plot is one melodramatic stock situation after another. Girl and boy promise to marry but war intervenes.

Lillian Gish is literally trapped inbetween the thighs of a lascivious Prussian officer out to threaten her virginity. Americans drop in to save the day.The characters are almost all onedimensional but unlike Intolerance or Way Down East 1920 they are not made compelling by the actors. It's a shame because everyone in this film was capable of better especially the great Lillian Gish. Here she overacts to an almost embarrassing extreme stuck between cooing at ducklings in a girlish manner or shrieking in a fit of madness.In fact this film suffers from the same issue as Griffith's later epic America 1924 it's too derivative of The Birth of a Nation 1915 with its bestial villains bland central love story and big battle scenes. Unfortunately unlike Birth or America Hearts' battle sequences are tensionfree and uninspired.The sole redemptive feature of Hearts is Dorothy Gish as the Little Disturber. Flirty and freespirited she actually comes across as a human being in a world of uninspired stock characters. She also avoids being passive in her suffering and even rescues Robert and Lillian from death at the hands of the Huns during the climactic sequence.Only for those interested in Griffith or WWI propaganda everyone else will leave disappointed.".

In this movie she combines with such recognized stars as Tommy Lee Jones and Brian Dennehy and takes a back seat to neither. Her fatherdaughter scenes with Mr. Jones are warm and real. The depth all three of the lead actors brought to their characters was truly remarkable.

However when Doc emerges from Billy's past looking for the money he stole things become more urgent.This is essentially the story of a father and daughter trying to bond after never being together. The story may take a more sinister turn as Doc takes them on a river journey to find the stolen money but it's still a family drama for the most part. The family drama is well observed with good characters  only the boy Wexel comes across as a slight Southern stereotype. However Doc's introduction doesn't take away from this side rather it adds a darker level involving murder revenge and eventual redemption. But over all this it works as a nice nonsentimental relationship drama.The film is the one that gave Martha Plimpton to the world and while that may not be a good thing she is good here  a child actress that isn't annoying. Also a prefame Tommy Lee Jones gives a strong performance as Billy who is slowly won over by fatherly concern for his daughter. Also giving a good show is Brian Dennehy long before he started specialising in TV movies about crooked cops here his bad guy slowly develops a tragic feel about him  just as his poison ivy wounds develop more to entrap him.The film is a clever relationship drama with a grisly edge to it. It's worth watching for it's simplicity and for it's good performances. Don't expect a masterpiece but it's a refreshing little drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "The River Rat is very much like a ghost story  not too much depth but plenty of adventure and cheap thrills to keep you interested. The acting is generally good. Tommy Lee Jones and Brian Dennehy are reliable as ever if Dennehy's character is a good bit too overthetop. It was interesting to see Martha Plimpton so young playing a role very much reminiscent of one she did three years later in Shy People.This is the only film both written and directed by Thomas Rickman. It's easy to see why. Not to say that the script is necessarily bad  the dialogue is clever and the characters are fleshed out for the most part. The main weakness is the schizophrenic overall quality of the story he's trying to tell. When he sticks to real life and family drama it works. When he tries to turn it into a thriller everything comes crashing down. In theory Rickman could have filmed it in a way that brought things together but he tends to direct in a very unrestrained sort of way lacking the ingenuity to really pull it off.I liked The River Rat mainly for it's nice visual feel and the occasional sense of reality that pushed through the lazier aspects of production. There's a lot of ways it could have been improved but it makes for good low expectation entertainment. A fun little movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'River Rat' was a surprisingly better film than I expected. If you have seen 'Square Dance' or 'Shy People' you learn to be weary of Deep South smalltown dramas especially those about broken relationships between parents and their children as they usually turn out to be quite depressing if nothing else. But not 'River Rat' what starts out as a decent drama about the reunion of a young girl Martha Plimpton and her father Tommy Lee Jones who was recently released from jail almost immediately turns into a Deep South caper when someone from the jail tracks down the father looking for some loot. And this is where the real fun begins.The father was in jail for a crime he committed as a kid when he another boy and a young girl who bears his child decide to break into an old woman's house and steal a load of money that she was rumored to keep by her bedside. Only things go wrong and the other boy winds up killing the women while both boys take off on the run from the cops. The father as a boy is eventually caught and incarcerated. To get his parole he didn't have to show remorse but he did have to tell all to the prison doctor Brian Dennehy who would give the recommendations or not to the parole board. Promised a cut of the money the father agrees and is released. Only the doctor wants his money now and is willing to kill the father and anyone else who stands in his way to get hold of that money. So the father the doctor the daughter and the daughter's young neighborhood friend all hop aboard the 'River Rat' and sail down to Memphis to retrieve the finds if all goes well.It seems unbelievable at points in the film especially throughout the climax when the doctor doesn't seem entirely dangerous or much like any kind of adversary since he goes about things sometimes rather more civilly than one expects. So that kind of detracts from the mood but otherwise it is a pretty decent movie. If you're in the mood for a good mix of drama and adventure they're almost like two distinct halves of the same movie with the drama part being resolved first then this is probably good for you. Or if you want to see the cast since it has both a young preGoonies Martha Plimpton and Tommy Lee Jones who never really looks young.".

On the other hand when don't parents worry about the next generation and what they're learning in school? And this was before we had the internet.Sadly the lovely world depicted in the movie has been given a setback by the recent hurricane. People will bounce back. It's nice others are helping them.".

He has to slowly get used to being out of prison and being a father.This is dating myself a bit but Tommy Lee Jones' reaction to his daughter saying she isn't a lezzie and her talking about not support of incest shows him to be a person ready to join the Moral Majority. On the other hand when don't parents worry about the next generation and what they're learning in school? And this was before we had the internet.Sadly the lovely world depicted in the movie has been given a setback by the recent hurricane. People will bounce back. It's nice others are helping them.";
