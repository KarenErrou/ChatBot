Laure Masrac appears in the dual role of VeroniqueLudivine with great ease. Gregoire Colin has only limited opportunity as well as Francoise Fabien.Secret Defense is not a film for everyone. Like anything from this French director he is more interested in what his characters are doing at any given time as he takes us along for those rides something that with another man at the helm perhaps those scenes would be edited. The film makes sense after all the evidence is examined but it might appear boring for those viewers that Mr. Rivette lost along the way to solving the main issue in the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a spectacularly successful mystery film by director Jacques Rivette who also collaborated on the screenplay. His films always contain long lingering shots and scenes that seem to go on forever. Sometimes this can be so irritating one wants to scream. For instance I tried three times to watch his LA BELLE NOISEUSE 1991 and gave up in exasperation each time because it was so boring so enormously long and like a vanity exercise. One would therefore think that the last person to make a successful thriller would be Rivette with his slow pace. But incredibly with this film his snail's pace works perfectly and turns the film into a masterpiece. This would have been impossible without the genius actress Sandrine Bonnaire who plays the lead and monopolizes the screen with complete success. Bonnaire made it clear to the world that she was at a higher level than most actresses in 1985 when she starred in Agnes Varda's extraordinary and searing film VAGABOND SANS TOI NI LOI. She is so quiet and meditative that she sucks the audience into the vortex of her thoughts and carries us right along with her as she swirls with silent unarticulated torment. She showed this again in the amazing L'EMPREINTE DE L'ANGE MARK OF AN ANGEL aka ANGEL OF MINE 2008 see my review. She really is one of the most intense and powerful actresses in the world today. In this film she plays a cold introverted determined woman who has withdrawn into herself and is unable to return affection without the greatest of difficulty. The man who is constantly courting her and assuring her of his feelings is barely noticed by her so absorbed is she in her own issues and preoccupied by what is troubling her. 'Secret dfense' is the French expression corresponding to 'official secret' in English. It is not necessarily a reference to military defence British or military defense USA. Although Bonnaire's deceased father had been the head of France's largest defence contractor succeeded by the mysterious figure of Walser played with appropriate ambiguity by Polish actor Jerzy Radziwilowicz which by the way means 'son of Radziwil' in Polish who is so well known to cinema lovers from Andrezj Wajda's classic films MAN OF MARBLE 1977 and MAN OF IRON 1981 these hints of military secrecy flicker in the background like the reflections on a wall in an indoor swimming pool but never come into focus. This all helps to create the air of menace and conspiracy which pervades this film and which expresses the French attitude towards the worlds of officialdom money and power. This film is primarily one of slow realization of what had previously seemed inconceivable to the normal and innocent mind. Bonnaire is brilliant at slowly coming to these realizations before our eyes in the lingering shots where there is nothing between her face and us but her thoughts. How easily this film could have failed miserably! But she and Rivette together pull it off almost as a miracle. I was on the edge of my seat for each and every prolonged scene and never lost patience. The slow pace merely serves to heighten and intensify the unbearable suspense. Somehow Rivette knew the exact instant to cut. As soon as a scene has served its purpose and been squeezed of the last of its juice it skin is thrown into the bucket and we reach for the next fruit. I watched this film twice because I wanted to be sure. Yes it really is a masterpiece of filmmaking. The music at the beginning and the end is viola da gamba music played by Jordi Savall one of the world's two best gamba players the other being the younger Paolo Pandolfo. The film's inherent ambiguity and theme of doubleappearances is intensified by the acting of the amazing Laure Marsac who plays identical twin sisters. Both of them are in a perpetual state of volatile and wavering uncertainty. After Bonnaire is informed by her younger brother that he has found evidence that their father had been murdered five years before and that he was pushed from a train by someone and did not jump and commit suicide as officially recorded she receives a curious visit from Marsac who is Walser's secretary and lover. This is one of the most ambiguous scenes in the film in which nothing which is intended to be said is actually said by Marsac and she reluctantly leaves without having made her purpose clear at all. The air of mystery is continually heightened by such devices of the story. Guns are continually being taken out of pockets and put into drawers or desks and we don't know where they keep coming from. We are constantly aware that they are there and could be removed and used by one of the many increasingly desperate people in this story. Then one of the twin sisters disappears and suddenly she is seen again by the shocked characters in the story only to be revealed as the unknown twin whom they had not realized existed. She moves into the country mansion known as 'the Domaine' and assumes the role of her vanished sister. Meanwhile Bonnaire's desperate younger brother is charging around on his motorbike with his gun threatening to kill Walser who he says killed his father in order to take over his company. A photo has mysteriously appeared we are never told from where showing Walser with his father on the train platform on the morning of the father's death contradicting Walser's supposed alibi that he was elsewhere at the time. This film has two parallel stories like two parallel universes the false and the true. At how many points do these intersect? And how can truth be separated from illusion in this double world where it is not only sisters who are twins but events themselves which exist in two forms and which bear an ambiguous and double interpretation?".

	schema:reviewBody "A warning first off that if you have problems with slow tempo in movies you really aren't going to make it to the end of this one because the tempo here is slooooow.The plot concerns a cellular biologist by profession called Sylvie Sandrine Bonnaire and her attempt resolve a mystery concerning the death of her father a decade previously prime suspect is his business associate Walser Jerzy Radziwilowicz. The story is a tragedy by structure.Secret dfense has been labelled a thriller by some but verging on three hours and with only enough action to fill a single conventional thriller hour at the most and that quite tame your adrenal gland is going to be taking a kip during this movie. Furthermore the elements of the thriller genre are mostly joshed. For example there's a datestamped intertitle at the start of the movie that announces that it's Friday May 9th at 10 o'clock it's the only title of it's kind in the movie and apropos of nothing cocking a snook at the pointlessness of this genre convention. Action scenes are drained of dramatic impact and woodenly acted as if they are reenactments or rehearsals. The scenes are pathetic in that they are designed to make you feel the wretched stupidity and irreversibility of violence. Effects are no more complicated than the old blood capsule in the mouth. The plot seems carelessly anachronistic hinging around a train murder that makes no sense unfortunately throwing someone off a TGV and making it seem like an accident due to modern safety precautions is slightly less plausible than it would have been in Hitchcock's day. One minor annoyance is that telephone conversations are carried out by obvious voiceover from the voice at the end of the line which carries no telephonic distortion. Still this is probably conspicuous lack of care.There are two great things going on with the movie though. The first is the simple joy in listening to people speak deeply that characterises the best New Wave films. Just simple things like the admission of the housekeeper Marthe that she never really had a childhood because she was always big inside her head. The second thing is the subtle photography of great New Wave cinematographer William Lubtchansky who unfortunately passed away earlier this year. The exact allure of his work is hard to point a finger at there is nothing mannered about his style. He manages threat very well here just through little things like having a coach driving up the road behind Sylvie whilst she is walking at night and pulling up in front of her perfectly normal yet alarming on an animal level or having trains crash past at the station. Warnings occur as well a yellow hazard sign in the corner of the screen at the lab a red warning light on the metro line used rather than placed all very natural. The value is often more to do with absence than anything else I never saw anything in the movie that was visually inappropriate that didn't feel right Lubtchansky seems to have a feeling for what fits for what works an organic economy and a lack of extravagance that filled me with slowburn joy. My favourite shot perhaps was in the mansion where Sylvie walks through a gloomy room towards the garden and becomes silhouetted from behind a sign perhaps of the darkness enveloping her. I also liked the psychological significance of the landscape backgrounds during train scenes Sylvie full of clarity and deadly intent travels to the visual accompaniment of flat verdant blur later with her mother the speed is slower the landscape cluttered with a sprawling carpet of white buildings disorganised encumbering again images used not forced.It's a movie perhaps about folly perhaps. Sylvie ignores the patient wooing of an urbane work colleague to concentrate on raking up the past. Both Sylvie and Walser are slaves of their work. A note to all platespinners the plates will carry on spinning without you! The one constant of any large organisation is the superfluity of absolutely any individual. Incidentally Sylvie's work world was rendered quite well back at university I used to do lab work in a cellular biology lab Sylvie was there using a Gilson's pipette correctly and expelling the tips which was quite nostalgic for me. According to the credits the scenes were actually shot in the labs of the Institut Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris.The soundtrack consists of only two songs which play over the start and end of the credits one piece is by Spanish Renaissance composer Pedro Guerrero and is a moresca called Di perra mora Variation Moorish whore the other an anonymous piece also from the same era Diferencias sobre las Vacas or Cow variations. Morescas were grotesque foolish dances where the dancers often posed as blackedup Moors. I think the implication is that we're seeing some sort of timeless farce with the characters condemned to repeat foolish steps despite the presence of reason.".

According to the credits the scenes were actually shot in the labs of the Institut Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris.The soundtrack consists of only two songs which play over the start and end of the credits one piece is by Spanish Renaissance composer Pedro Guerrero and is a moresca called Di perra mora Variation Moorish whore the other an anonymous piece also from the same era Diferencias sobre las Vacas or Cow variations. Morescas were grotesque foolish dances where the dancers often posed as blackedup Moors. I think the implication is that we're seeing some sort of timeless farce with the characters condemned to repeat foolish steps despite the presence of reason.";

	schema:reviewBody "For a start it's not as boring stale and jejune as Greek mythology. Really not up to Out 1 MerryGoRound etc. but definitely a nice watch.However someone has posted a comment making this movie a modern Electra. That's not true. Of course Electra must have been very much in Rivette's mind when conceiving the script. But the influences are far richer than just the Electra myth and Rivette presents a much more subtle story than just a modern Electra. The most significant difference might be the motif for the murder of the father. Agamemnon was not murdered for noble reasons as th father in the movie but because Clytemnestra had an affair and wanted to get rid of him. This takes us away from the primitive Greek A sleeps with B's C C's D therefore kills B and A's E but then E's F tries to sleep with A and F's G before killing himself but fails to kill C etc. Of course we never learn in the movie where the brother got the photo which reminds one of the oracle telling Electra's brother to get a revenge for the murder of their father but then again all the stuff about shooting the wrong person has nothing to do with the story of Electra. Well notice the complete lack of intervention by the gods in this case mostly Appolo and Athena in the movie once again something without which a Greek myth isn't a Greek myth anymore. Also the nice twist at the end of the movie  Sylvie getting shot herself again by accident  has no counterpart in the Greek myth. The story of the real Electra actually ends sort of well after Orest is found not guilty by the judges.On the side The story of Electra can only be told faithfully if there is a story of a war in the background. Well in the movie there isn't.So please... It's really nice for some people that they are ohsocultivated. But they should either come up with a subtle analysis of the links between a modern script and some Greek or otherwise classical subject or leave it.Anyway having read the comment which turns Secret Dfense into a remake of Vertigo I should have to apologize. At least Electra clearly is intended referencesource of inspiration... whatever. On the other hand the comparison with Vertigo and the comparison of Vertigo to Greenaway's Cook Thief Wife Lover is so far fetched you cannot even see where the commentator got the idea. I've noticed the tendency of some mostly Americans to think of Hitchcock as the center of the cinematographic universe. Let me tell you He isn't. He has made some entertaining films but they are mostly based on overacted simplistic scripts which fake psychogrammatic depth but really just display simple psychologically prototyped characters.About the title of Secret Dfense. Those nonnative speakers of French who are wondering about the strange ordering of adjective and noun in the title in French should go here httpfr.wikipedia.orgwikiInformationclassifiC3A9eenFrance In this light it is of course stupid of the US distributor to call the film Secret Defense in English  because that as far as I can judge means something completely different i.e. it just has its literal meaning in English.".

Its milieu is the familiar one of the Parisian haute bourgeoisie the smart city apartment and country chteau are a little hackneyed perhaps but attractive all the same. The photography is good. The direction is painstaking. It promises to be an intelligent production.To be honest however I found it very hard to sustain interest in it and my mind soon wandered to the question of why it so utterly failed to engage me. I think it is because it is not at all concerned with character or personality. I can readily believe the suggestion made by previous reviewers that the film is modelled to some extent on ancient Greek drama. Sylvie Paul Walser and Veronique are toys of the gods not believable individuals. Their responses to events lack credibility. The central relationship between Sylvie and Walser never convinced me.It might be argued that the people in Secret Defense are simply very coldblooded. Yet they are hotblooded enough when it comes to seeking revenge. The film also contains two of the absurdities often noticeable in more popular thrillers the police simply do not exist in the world depicted and the characters show no fear and little wariness even when dealing with people whom they suspect of murder.If your preference is for characterdriven drama and realism you are unlikely to find Secret Defense a satisfying experience.

It is as abstracted from the world of Vertigo as Vertigo is from life.In Greenaway's Cook Thief Lover the world is indeed bifurcated into the kitchen where things are created and the serving room. Moving from one to the other changes colors in accord with Vertigo. Cook Thief deals with the same issues as Vertigo but with more abstraction books love and watching movies as literally eating people.Now we have this which moves to the other side.

This is life embossed with a movie.That is until the very very last scene.

On the train to Berlin the 140 marks are stolen by a man with a stiff hat while Emil sleeps. Arriving in Berlin he tries to follow the thief and receives help from a well organized and nice gang of Berlin street detectives in his age. A happy end seems possible.While the movie contains a very entertaining story itself an even more interesting detail of this movie is in its backdrop an authentic Berlin of 1931 with open cabs cars driving next to coaches wide streets with lots of space for cyclists and so on. I always wondered when viewing older city maps what street life was like in the twenties of the last century when the streets were not as crowded as today when the speed difference between pedestrians cyclists cars and coaches was still comparable in human measures.The camera work special effects Emils dream on the train and movie music are distinctly thirtyish which made this movie even more interesting to me.

Very very old film. The writer is Erich Kstner who is still a legend in Germany today and he was not only alive when this movie was made but was fairly young and worked on the script as well. I also see Billy Wilder here so there worked some really famous people on this film. Director Gerhard Lamprecht is certainly not as famous as the other two but he was a successful filmmaker in his own right too. Also I cannot say I am familiar with anybody of the actors in here but that should not be too big of a surprise as the majority were child actors. At times this film felt like a German version of the Rascal gang that was extremely popular in the United States at the same time only that the kids in this German film here were older of course.Talking about the film itself I must say that I have not read Kstner's book so I cannot say how much they changed compared to the original literary work. I thought there were some good moments in this film. But unfortunately it simply was not enough not even for such a short film. The train scene early on was good and I also felt the actor who played the main antagonist Grundeis did a solid job but the kids all felt interchangeable and were not memorable at all and this also includes title character Emil. He was played by Rolf Wenkhaus an actor who also died less than 10 years later while executing Hitler's despicable orders. But back to the film. I myself found it fairly mediocre and it did not really get me involved at all. I see there are more versions out there from recent years and I cannot say this really old film did get me interested a lot in checking these out. But still I maybe will at some point. And I hope they deliver more convincingly than this 1931 movie. Not recommended.".

It's Fassbinder in gangster mode and has been called an homage to film noir or even a parody of film noir.  This isn't the case though.  The movie is just film noir done by Fassbinder.  There are little homages here and there the beginning and end could be seen as being inspired by Breathless taken to ridiculous extremes and there are lots of filmmakers names used as characters but Fassbinder isn't winking at the camera so much as just being himself which back then could be quite bizarre.  In fact this might be one of Fassbinder's most bizarre movies.The camera stands still characters occasionally deliver seemingly unrelated monologues unusual plot lines are treated nonchalantly Ricky's brother is in love with him? people about to be killed don't seem to be worried and the singlehandedly greatest song ever plays over and over again crooning so much tenderness is in my head so much loneliness in my bed.  To have this song play over scenes of a stonecold amoral hitman the title character casually driving his car are perversely hilarious.  Even better is when it plays in the end in one of the greatest endings I've ever seen you'll have to check it out.The recent release of this film on DVD should help bring it some attention as its now available for a pretty reasonable price from Wellspring.  If you're looking for one of Fassbinder's more mature professional socially poignant melodramas maybe this isn't the movie for you.  If you're interested in an extremely unique unclassifiable early Fassbinder by all means check this out.  Despite the occasional nods to past filmmakers it's surprising how unique Fassbinder was from the start.for those who are Jim Jarmusch fans it's apparent films like these must have inspired the detached humor in some of his more recent films.".

	schema:headline " an experiment in style and the mood of character more than a plotdriven movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The American Soldier has a story maybe even a plot but that's not why Rainer Werner Fassbinder made this movie I believe. It's more about an attack or subversion on the style of a movie in this case the filmnoir. The black and white makes the comparison a little obvious but it's also in the attitudes of the characters the costumes and clothing that distinguishes a character like Ricky. But it also owes as much to NewWave tactics like Godard and Melville Le Samourai and Alphaville come immediately to mind and to Fassbinder's own sense of alienation with the world as well as in his own films. It's sometimes hard to watch since his character carry the same weight of angst and dread that they barely really show to one another but it's still an intriguing trip.The story that is there actually reveals more about a German viewpoint than that of it being American though I'm sure its protagonist and its background is significant just for this reason. It's about a soldier back from Vietnam who is recruited by the government who act much in the way of a discreet crime organization to carry out killings of people who may or may not? be nefarious characters or just people whom Ricky doesn't know why he's killing. The implication is somewhat more satirical than actionmovie based though I'm reminded sadly of Wolverine earlier this year and movies like it that don't get the message that a killer keeps on killing if without the right sense of moral wellbeing or even selfworth.Fassbinder amps up some clichs for the filmnoir aesthetic by making it a pulpycrime story where a prostitute falls in love with Ricky even as she shouldn't or might just get in the way. He also casts his parts very well especially with Karl Scheydt as Ricky makes Glenn Ford look like a wimp and Elga Sorbas as Rosa the attractive but uncertain prostitute who falls for Ricky there's an engrossing scene where he calls up to ask for a girl to his apartment room she comes and undresses and then the two just lay in bed while a maid is in the room telling a somber story about a romance gone bad. All of the cinematography is at least interesting and at best represents a maturity in filmmaking for Fassbinder after his first couple of films Love is Colder Than Death Katzelmacher that were just a series of static shots.Some have brought up criticisms of its tedious nature or that it's just boring. It's hard to argue it since it's based on taste the same scene that could make on bored and frankly it's not a good movie to watch when tired at two in the morning could also make a Jim Jarmusch fan gripped to the chair one's sitting at. Characters in The American Soldier don't move too realistically  it's more like in Fassbinder's own The Merchant of Four Seasons people move and talk and look like they've come out of a shellshock or may still be in one. Even the cop characters or Ricky's mom and brother are in a slight daze as they speak and this is deliberate. It ends up making for a more intellectually satisfying experience than an emotional one I wasn't so much moved by the ending where we see a character's death one usually typical in a filmnoir of the 1940s in America as in badguygetshis by the end in the context of a poetic mourning but it did fascinate me.It's sometimes tough going and its rewards are for a real geek for black and white NewWave inspired crime films that have such gimmicks as a rock song that repeats in lieu of a usual orchestral sound and its not for someone looking for fast action and conventional thrills. It is in its dimensions arty and fine with it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The American Soldier has a story maybe even a plot but that's not why Rainer Werner Fassbinder made this movie I believe. It's more about an attack or subversion on the style of a movie in this case the filmnoir. The black and white makes the comparison a little obvious but it's also in the attitudes of the characters the costumes and clothing that distinguishes a character like Ricky. But it also owes as much to NewWave tactics like Godard and Melville Le Samourai and Alphaville come immediately to mind and to Fassbinder's own sense of alienation with the world as well as in his own films.

It happens to be exactly this girl who is sent to Ricky when he stays in a hotel and orders a girl. In the scene in the hotel we hear also the story of the housekeeper Emmy who married a much younger man from Northern Africa who killed her. This story has been filmed by Fassbinder with a different end a few years later under the title Ali Fear eats the soul. Just at the time of his arrival Ricky meets his old buddy Franz and they visit places where they had been together. Ricky also meets his mother and brother and in this scene we have on the one side a coldness between Ricky and his mother that cannot be increased and a latent homosexual love between Ricky a his slightly retarded brother on the other side.However after Ricky has done his duty for the detectives that engaged him they must get rid of him because otherwise they would have to admit their incapability to solve their problems on their own in front of their boss an ancient policechief who seems to be in the hand of his officers. The end scene in which Ricky and his buddy Franz lose their lives because of a simple accident I do not want to spoil here because the end of The American Soldier is an end of such a magnitude of splendor that you will hardly find in any other movie. However what I want to add is that the message of this movie goes way beyond that of Fassbinder's inclination towards American gangster movies from the 40ies People who know Fassbinder's work also know that he gave his movies strong political and sociological messages on their ways. I want my movies to go on in the heads of the audience after they have left the cinema Fassbinder once said. In this movie Germans engage an AmericanGerman with Vietnamexperience to do the dirty work in Europe and after he succeeds instead of paying him the promised sum they kill him. It seems that Fassbinder just used the decor of Film noir to characterize the years after World II in Germany since for a man like Fassbinder the liberation of Germany by the Allies was not an act of terrorism against the Nazi regime but a deed for which the American soldiers who cleaned the mess up in Germany have never been adequately rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Amerikanische Soldat 1970 is R.W. Fassbinder's least understood movie. Most people think  and this conviction can be found also in textbooks about Fassbinders as well as in reference works of film  that he just wanted to create a German Film Noir as a kind of reverence for his love for the respective American movies of the 50ies. Nothing can be less adequate! The American Soldier asked by a prostitute if he is a real Yank answers First there was Germany ... . Once there was a little boy ... He flew over the Pond ... . Scheisse!. I think the main problem with the story is that Fassbinder purposely does not portray The American Soldier as an American who has been called by the German police to abolish a bunch of criminals. Richard Murphy alias Richard Von Rezzori is a German. When Franz Walsch alias Fassbinder asks him during their car trip And how was it in Vietnam?  Richard's astonishing answer is Loud. In this little dialog there is all you need to understand this outstanding movie. Another crucial scene is when Richard visits his paternal house. As one sees not only he but also his mother and his brother are drinkers. When he rings the bell he tries to kiss his mother but she disgustedly turns away her head. His brother smashes a wineglass in his hand until he bleeds. After Richard has left he starts to cry and says Mama I still love him!. So who is the American Soldier? A German nobleman who became an American citizen in order to be legitimated to cleanup what had destroyed his soul in Germany? Vietnam as a legitimation to get rid of the burdens of his soul? But about such things one does not speak and so it was just loud down there. But is there not an additional point of criticism in Fassbinder's movie? Fact is It is the German police represented by three moronic officers and an antique president who hire the American Soldier in order to kill all those against which the police has too little evidence in order to arrest them. But in the end the killer also gets killed because otherwise the incapability of the police would become public! Can one not see in this other aspect of the story also the function of the real Americans who liberated Germany after World War II. and at the same time have been accused of intrusion and interference for what they have done? So Fassbinders's movie is far from being monolinear. What he copied is a little bit the Ambiente of some early gangster movies but even the structural main feature the play with light and shadow and the dark screens which have been so typical for Films Noirs are completely lacking in The American Soldier. One has rather the impression that three clowns of policemen just have watched a bit too many gangster movies that is all. With that it goes together that the most unimportant persons in the movie carry the names of famous real persons a stylistic effect that Fassbinder loved So the porter of the shabby hotel is Murnau the little girlfriend of one of the policerowdies is Rosa Von Praunheim. The pornsalesgirl is Magdalena Fuller. Last but not least Richard Von Rezzori bears the name of the German writer Gregor Von Rezzori whose wife Hanna AxmannRezzori was one of Fassbinder's early Maecenas and acted in Warum Luft Herr R. Amok and Rio Das Mortes. The score of this movie by Fassbinder and Peer Raben probably belongs to the best film music of all times.".

Ricky orders them in the same precise way he orders his Ballantineand with the same certainty of availability. He takes them literally dumps them mocks them uses them and if they get too close murders them. He has to drink whiskey before every sexual encounter to negate any emotion or doubt. Gay men suffer a similar scorn from the brute his contempt for the powerless underwritten by the world of organized violence that created and controls him. So much tenderness in my head so much emptiness in my bed is heard over and over during Ricky and his brother's final sexdeath scene.

The American Soldier concerns a haughty GermanAmerican soldier fresh from Vietnam who struts around killing people for reasons which are kept mostly obscure he's some kind of gangster or hitman. The police are after him though the police seem just as wicked. I didn't care much about what was going on  no compelling reason was ever given for me to care. However many elements of the film impressed me. Fassbinder's idiosyncratic sense of pace and mood pervades. The performances are pretty good. Fassbinder himself appears in a small role and as usual he delivers a remarkable performance. He has to be the best actordirector of all time. Peer Raben never seems to write a lot of music for Fassbinder's films. Instead he just writes one theme that is used several times throughout the given picture. They are always exceptional and his theme and also theme song which is the same tune with lyrics added is excellent here. And then there's this ending. Fassbinder has a talent for unique and notable endings and the end of this film is one of the weirdest and most remarkable I've ever seen. 710.".

Ordinarily a successful dramatic performance allows the viewer to forget that an actor is 'pretending' but that one is witnessing a real depiction of emotions and reactions. However Fassbinder strives for the converse of this process. He seems to aim for an almost militant lack of affectation and his actors strike stylized poses which only represent authentic emotions. It's almost like German Kabuki Theater. It would seem that this form of acting technique would lend itself very well to the genre of Gangster Noir but this film definitely missed the mark. The tale of three rogue police detectives who employ the skills of a heartless American Vietnam veteran is bogged down in an untidy avalanche of wacky details. Odd monologues pointless car trips enigmatic phone calls and arguably the weirdest final scene ever brought to film do not advance the storyline but only confuse and perplex the viewer. Fassbinder's more successful films created surreal hyperrealities but American SOLDIER only conveyed a feeling of disconnected opaqueness. Only for Die Hard Fassbinder Fans.".

It was amateurish throughoutwith a lousy score indifferent acting and dopey direction. It was VERY obvious that this was one of Fassbinder's first films because it has so many obvious flaws and looks more like a home movie. Let me give a few examples1. When the lead shoots one lady and the man with her to death she is very obviously breathing as he leaves the room. I could easily see this while watching it on a DVD on TV so I'm sure on a large screen it was even more apparent. Normally this flaw would have been spotted and the scene reshot. 2. The end of the movie is choreographed poorly and comes off very sloppily.3. The actors at times have trouble with their lines. Once again a director would NORMALLY reshoot the scenes.4. The suicide scene is perhaps one of the most poorly acted and pointless scenes I have ever witnesses. Most high school plays have greater realism.The film appears heavily influenced by JeanLuc Godard and in some ways looks like a knockoff of the movie Alphaville. This is a real shame as Alphaville is another terrible film that has been seen by some as great artwhile the average person would probably find the films amateurish and choppy.FYIthis is a VERY explicit film in places so parents beware.Also during one scene in the film one of the actresses tells a story. Apart from a few changes the story she told later was made by Fassbinder into ALI FEAR EATS THE SOUL. A very interesting touch indeed but not enough to save this film.".

Amok and the film I only want you to love me and see them not only as extremely polished well crafted and well conceived but almost flawless. Like most directors even those as mighty as Martin Scorcese some types of movies he is extremely GOOD at making and others he fails miserably. In essence Fastbinder is extremely GOOD at making mundane more or less boring films and one thing I've learned from this movie and his film gotter Der pest is that when it comes to crime dramas he fails in almost every way when there is too much action and simply cannot construct a movie with a coherent plot line.I don't agree with the term Art House as being a true genre but basically when you call a movie art house what you essentially mean to say is that events in the film make little or no rational sense which runs on similar lines to surrealist cinema. These genres are SUPPOSED to have incoherent plots and illogical situations which in a film utilising a standard approach would make the film complete trash. The problem is where do you draw the line between recognizing a movie as being creative and far out or recognizing it as a poorly crafted movie with lousy plot development plot holes sub par acting and flawed in general.Indeed there are WAYS to pull off a good surrealist or art house type movie without going too far and managing to achieve strong meaning however films like these do not do that. It seems as though the director throws in insane off the wall moments as childish distractions to a movie being overall led by dull acting and no real point moments such as the couple being shot while laughing hysterically. When the main character leaps up and kisses the maid who then falls into a deadpan trance. When the maid sits on the end of the bed and recants a meaningless story as the couple are making love. The moment where the main character almost french kisses his mother. The moment where he shoots blanks at a woman on the ground and worst of all the suicide where a woman kills herself with one stab wound to the STOMACH whereby she drops dead seconds later which is more or less impossible. All of these things are pointless having no other aim than cheap shock value and all of them compiled into one film is simply too much to handle. The problem is that the result is you simply cannot take anything in the film very seriously and therefore cannot really find any meaning or poignancy to the film whatsoever which is culminated in the ending where the man is rolling on the floor all about his dead brothers body who had just been shot. The only thing that passed through my mind was oh.. another silly little thing to end the film onThe general approach riddled with these ridiculous moments aside the plot is simply not very cohesive or well crafted. The entire film consists of the main character murdering people seemingly at random and for no reason while the police idly attempt to catch him. The film begins with the main character returning to the town and the police suddenly become aware of him apparently he is just that infamous which was given no background at all. Also the way he gets his tips from a random porn seller the first person who's help he seeks is very contrived. All of this culminates with the ending which is totally ludicrous the most ill conceived amateurish sting operation ever very badly directed and with an unrealistic finish. The worst aspect about this is that there has been no attention to the efforts of the police who are trying to catch him. They just suddenly show up at a train station conveniently waiting for him out of nowhere.Fastbinder doing crime drama simply does not work and I find it hard to believe how any scene in this half overdone half underdone film can resonate at all. The only thing to say about this film really is there's nothing going on here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der amerikanische Soldat or The American Soldier is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1970 so this one had its 45th anniversary last year. The writer and director here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder and like several of his earlier works this is a blackandwhite film. Also like some of his early works it is a relatively short movie as it runs for 80 minutes only and this already includes closing credits. The title character is played by Karl Scheydt who is probably a couple years after his death not really known to many anymore today but he actually appeared in several Fassbinder films. The filmmaker had a tendency of choosing his regular male actors in a way that each of them gets one film to shine in and this is Scheydt's. The rest of the cast here include many actors who regularly appeared in Fassbinder's films. If you weren't nice you could call it his posse. I will not mention the names as you can check these in the cast list yourself but Jan George for example is the older brother of the late Gtz George and he plays a pretty big role in here and also appears in other Fassbinder films which not too many people know.About the action here we have the story of a man who is an AmericanGerman contract killer and he is in Germany after the Vietnam War to fulfill some assignments. We see him kill people we see him meet his mother and brother again and we also see him hook up with a woman. It is a bit ironic that not this woman who was intended to bring him down is crucial in the end but his own mother when it comes to who helped the police the most in catching him eventually. All in all I must say that blackandwhite film noir is not perfect for Fassbinder as his later films relied a lot on the use of color and it was a vital instrument to the stories he told. But this is not supposed to mean he is not a good artist when it comes to essential filmmaking. I really liked the showdown at the end for example in this film but I really struggled with caring for everything that happened earlier in the film. And ultimately I must say that sitting through the first hour is not worth it even if the last 15 minutes are pretty good. That's why I give this one a thumbsdown but to end the review on a positive note I still want to mention the great song used by another Fassbinder regular here Gnther Kaufmann who does not act in here but is a scene stealer with his music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superb! Excellent! TwoThumbs Up! Gratifying! Captivating! Sumptuously Made!That's still less than half of what I want to say for this film. I saw this film once in February and completely fell in love with it. When it was shown in a cinema here again in October  I went to see it doubting if my enjoyment would lessen in the second viewing when it loses all its unpredictability. But I found that my love for it grows even stronger. And I don't mind seeing it over and over again. For me its running time seems like less than an hour. It makes time fly so quickly. Though a part of me think the film ends at the right point and at the right time another part of me still yearns to see more of these characters. Nathalie Richard and Marianne Denicourt shines so brightly in this movie. Though I had seen a few films of Richard and Denicourt it is this film that made me fall in love with them. From this film I can see that Richard is very talented and Denicourt is really alluring. I hope they will be very famous and I will have a chance to see many more of their works. Andre Marcon Roland is quite good too. As for Laurence Cote Ida and Bruno Todeschini though they might be talented their roles here are not of very pleasant cheerful or likeable characters and seem to require less range of expressive emotions than other characters. Bruno is a lot more gorgeous in Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train. The choreography in this movie is my most favourite of all time. I have never seen any choreography like this before. I also like one irony in this film Ninon wants to reveal a character's wrongdoing but his wrongdoing is in a way similar to her own. Songs here are very beautiful and I'm quite impressed by Enzo Enzo. I really like the shock therapy scene and an early scene in which Denicourt shows her unexpected strength is not only very comical but also unforgettable to me.I think I would have a great fun if I could live my life in Rivette's universe as Ninon Louise Celine or Julie. Though Celine and Julie Go Boating is still my most favourite film by Rivette I think Haut bas fragile deserves to be called one the 10 best films of the 1990's.".

Haut Bas Fragile is as elusive as anything Rivette has made that is to say as elusive as any movie ever made and as always one must be vigilant. For instance we are told that Louise  Mariane Denicourt looking like Audrey Tautou crossed with a supermodel  has just emerged from a fiveyear coma. But how could someone who just woke out of a coma know jujitsu? Those familiar with Rivette know that actors and roleplaying are his big theme. And in Haut Bas Fragile whenever people start to sing that's when they're lying to each other... Only Ninon's dance a metaphor for Rivette's directing style is fully in the moment and liberated from the fictions of both an imagined past  Ida an orphan searching for her birth parents  and an imagined future  Louise who only cares about money.  Keeping that in mind couldn't Louise be an actress HIRED by the crooked tycoon in order to retrieve the incriminating papers rather than his daughter like she says? The story they concoct together would be perfect because the man who has removed the papers from the aunt's house is the classic Rivettean artist and resurrected Round Table knight  he's even called Roland  who not only buys Louise's improbable story but helps her EMBELLISH it in order to as he thinks protect her. But Louise is one of the most monstrous characters in Rivette's films more so even than Walser from Secret Defense. Imagine Jean Seberg as Karl Rove's hitman and you'll get the idea of how treacherous this character is  poetic Nouvelle Vague muse on the outside hollow servant of capitalism on the inside.Haut Bas Fragile must be Rivette's most despairing film. It establishes the present moment as emotionally and aesthetically dead and seems to swoon over the beauty of the past  Louise's aunt's house the sets that Roland builds Anna Karina  before telling us that that's a lie too. As Karina says at one point when she catches Ida looking at pictures of her in all her nubile glory Don't look at those old things. Karina by the way is only the most blatant among a labyrinthine amount of crossconnections and references to other French films characters and reallife people. For instance the voice of Louise's father is played by Laszlo Szabo who not only was the Wizard of Ozlike Virgil from Rivette's L'Amour Par Terre but was the man who stole Karina away from BelmondoasGodard in Pierrot Le Fou! Along with the pointed subplot about stolen papers and cutthroat business practices in the 60's  gilded age of the New Wave  this can't help but make a fan of the era wonder... Does Rivette think that Godard has undeservedly eclipsed his reputation and has he been holding a torch for Karina all these years?  As Marie et Julien proves he definitely has a lost love deep in his past.  For all its devious brilliance I must say that this film is weaker than its equally dark followup and sister film Secret Defense. The pacing is surprisingly choppy there are dips in tension and involvement and the musical numbers are indifferently staged. Rivette must have thought that using amateur dancers and generic songs would give the movie a raw vitality missing from the more weddingcake MGM films of the 50's but that was a condescending mistake. Rivette may not realize that there is as much cynical social commentary in Gigi or The Band Wagon as there is in Haut Bas Fragile and that it is precisely the bigbudgets and elaborate routines that make those movies so subversive. Minnelli's resolutely fake backlots are taking on a surreality with time that may one day make Rivette's more studied real reality to quote Pola X seem... kind of unreal. Considering Rivette's ambiguous relation with the past though along with his persistent suggestion that it doesn't even exist maybe this was exactly the point.".

It's Rivette's most funny and most light film. The female characters and his look at Paris is even more wonderful than in his other movies. As in all of Rivette's film everything can happen and the film is indeed full of wonderful surprises. But mostly I admire Haut bas fragile for Rivette's sense of the possibilities of the cinema which has become a very rare thing in our days.".

It's like the whole movie is in slow motion and I guess it does not surprise anyone familiar with the work of this great director but this does not make the movie boring but rather magical during the movie we slowly move into a world where nothing happens as it would happen in real life a girl collects all her stuff in shoeboxes another cures herself from vertigo with a shock therapy by a card game but everything seems realistic. This is a trick that Rivette is very good at. In fact this is his form of surrealism that he started to develop at the seventies with Out 1 and Celine And Julie Go Boating. Achieving this thing by telling about mysteries and shooting his movies with the documentary style pioneered by the Nouvelle Vague and by the director his self he combines the best of Bunuel and Rohmer. Rivette has a fascination with several things Paris theater conspiracies and young women. In this work he tells us a story about three young women in Paris each of whom looking for herself. Two of these women solve a big mystery at by trying to put their lives in order while the third one is the typical for Rivette's movies female outsider. Rivette chooses summer to show us Paris with it's wonderful locations and so parks cafs and small quiet streets are the tool for him to give to the movie an atmosphere of the film which is colorful and joyful. This atmosphere is achieved also by the fact that almost all of the characters are young and by the several love stories that are told among everything else. One of the most beautiful movies ever.".

Bad acting awful music and dancing and the story line was boring. I don't know why so many people gave it such a good rating it baffles me. Other people's comments lead me to watch this awful movie. There are so many other good French movies why waste your time with this one? Where to begin with the horror the acting. The main character Louise looks like a bad Audrey Hepburn. In the beginning of the movie she has just come out of a coma and is said to be weak. Though that didn't stop her from fighting a guy who was attacking her bodyguard. Much of the story line seemed extremely fictional and confusing. One Instance of this is when her bodyguard somehow turns into her lover over night. Then there is Ida a girl who was adopted as a child and is now longing to know where she comes from. Ida's story is the most confusing because you're left wondering why the script writers put it in the movie. It is the shortest and has no significance in the movie. The last girl in the movie is Ninon a trouble maker who finally tries to do right with Louise. Let's just say I didn't like the way she broke out in abstract dance where ever she went. It was bad from the beginning till the end and from the script to the music.".

My reply was along the lines of 'If the scientific parts were omitted Moby Dick would be a shorter bad book' and that's how I often feel about Rivette who seems incapable of shooting anything less than three hours  nothing wrong with that witness Gone With The Wind  which is okay EXCEPT his ideas are usually worth no more than forty minutes. He exemplifies most of the things wrong with the New Wave the abrupt cutting in the middle of a scene characters appearing on the other side of town moments after walking out of frame insufficient 'back story' andor information. A typical example in this film. Roland confronts Ninon in her apartment and accuses her of stealing a set of documents which we have in fact seen her do. She tells him to close his eyes he obliges she retrieves the documents from where she had hidden them tells him to remain seated with his eyes closed and  wait for it  LEAVES the apartment goes across town and gives the papers to Louise after which they go to a night club and dance. In the next shot Ninon enters her apartment Where incredibly Roland is STILL sitting with his eyes closed in real time this would have to be several hours but Rivette shoots it in such a way as to give the impression of just a few minutes. Okay call this high Art if you will but Me I call it SLOPPY film making. The film is full of such sloppiness it's billed as a Musical yet the first number occurs more than an hour into the story and such music as there is is banal in the extreme. The plot or what passes for one is our old friend the three disparate lives who somehow contrive to interweave the three leading actresses are certainly competent or even slightly better than competent as are the males but there are too many dead ends like the faux suicide club which amounts to little more than a twenty minute selfcontained set piece inside a three hour movie and serves no discernible purpose. Ironically I thoroughly enjoyed Rivette's Va Savoir and there are certainly echoes of that movie here in the library scenes and the dormer window utilised by Jeanne Balibar in the latter. On balance this is one to be endured rather than enjoyed.".

What matters most to this movie is that it is moving fast as its title suggested. And Terminal Velocity does well as an action movie with its stunts and explosions if you compare it to others of the genre. Also it has a certain sense of humor because of the unusual situation that the pretty lady perfectly knows the espionage business while the hero just follows her footsteps and even has to ask her how he can fire a gun. It's not a Bond but Sheen and Kinski both have much less exciting films in their biography so most watchers won't be disappointed.".

Also it has a certain sense of humor because of the unusual situation that the pretty lady perfectly knows the espionage business while the hero just follows her footsteps and even has to ask her how he can fire a gun. It's not a Bond but Sheen and Kinski both have much less exciting films in their biography so most watchers won't be disappointed.";

Luckily it is.This movie is also the last good movie Sheen did up until Being John Malkovich. And now after Scary Movie 3 maybe in time he'll end up back in the big leagues.

Richard decides to do a little investigating  discovers that Chris is still alive  is an ex Russian KGB agent trying to stop another ex Russian KGB agent Ben Pinkwater James Gandolfini from stealing 600 million worth of hijacked Russian gold  together with Chris he decides to stop the bad guy's  clear his name...Directed by Deran Sarafian I actually thought Terminal Velocity was a decent  enjoyable little action flick. The script by executive producer David Twohy moves along like a rocket although after the intriguing set up when Chris fakes her own death it sort of settles back down into standard action film thriller territory. The film never seems to take itself seriously  is fairly light hearted with some amusing one liners coming from Sheen I loved the 'pack your bags we're going on a guilt trip' line he comes out with as Kinski tells him about the hardship Russians have! It's nothing terribly original it's clichd in the sense there are the hero's who eventually defeat the bad guy's  save the day but it's fun  provides a fair amount of entertainment if your looking for some light action.Director Sarafian does a decent job it's not particularly stylish but it's well made with some good action scenes. The skydiving stunts are particularly impressive although some seem a little far fetched especially the way Sheen rescue Kinski from a car that's been driven out the back of a plane. There are some neat enough explosions  fist fights as well.With a supposed budget of about 50000000 it tanked at the boxoffice making a paltry 16000000. The acting is alright with Sheen making a likable hero.Terminal Velocity turned out much better than I thought it would  I'm struggling to see why it bombed so badly when it was released anyway I liked it  thought it was entertaining fun.".

Films were made for enjoyment and to allow people to escape their ordinary hum drum lives. That's exactly what this film is. Totally implausible fun. But that's what makes it so good!

However an closer look at a video of the accident reveals a second plane where a body was thrown to impersonate Chris.  Brodie investigates and uncovers a plot to capture sensitive information and return it to Russia.This is a really fun film.  It's not meant to be a masterpiece or a deep political thriller.  It is meant to be a fun ride through exaggerated characters and silly set pieces.  The plot is almost pointless  it's just an excuse to hang the set pieces around.  However what you do get is Sheen overacting great action scenes  the best being Sheen skydiving after a car which has Kinsji locked in the trunk.  You understand?  it's meant to be big dumb fun.  Personally I think this is better than a lot of big summer films that have big special effects scenes and ridiculous plots but try to take themselves seriously.  This knows it's all a bit unlikely but enjoys itself anyway.Sheen is the key to the tongueincheek approach.  He doesn't play a character  he almost just plays himself!  Even when he's in action scenes he's smiling  because he's having fun! and it makes me enjoy it a lot more. Kinski almost has as much fun in her role but she has to carry a lot of the plot so she is more serious at time.  A preSopranos James Gandolfini is menacing in his small bad guy role and Melvin Van Peebles makes an appearance to show that it's not just his son that can do daft films.Overall it's silly dumb fun.  Sheen enjoys himself so why can't you?".

	schema:headline " Tribute to Israel's Military Genius and Fighting Heart";
	schema:reviewBody "The great fighting heart and spirit of the Israeli people was not developed by one man. It was embodied in the dream of every Jewish peasant who for two previous generations contributed even pennies to Theodore Herzl's Zionist organization. And for the holocaust survivors it represented their last chance for a place in the world that was truly their's. No longer to be a guest in everyone else's country.The heart and spirit were there when part Palestine became the state of Israel but the military leadership was provided by a man born like myself in Brooklyn New York. Colonel David Mickey Marcus was a West Point graduate who opted for a civilian career as a lawyer and dabbled in politics. His political allies at one time or other were Fiorello LaGuardia and Tom Dewey. He held various appointive positions in the LaGuardia administration in New York. When World War II broke out Marcus went back in the army and for the most part given his legal training worked in the Judge Advocate General's office but later did see combat with the Third Army under George Patton.Kirk Douglas plays Marcus and for him this must have been a role he relished given his background as the son of Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine. The film opens with James Donald representing the Haganah literally accosting Douglas in Macy's 1947 and explaining he's about the fiftieth person they've contacted to be a military adviser to the provisional government in Palestine. Douglas explains he hasn't been in Temple since his bar mitzvah and really doesn't consider himself much of a religious Jew or even a cultural one. By the end of the film he's developed pride in his religion and ethnicity and earnestly commits to the struggle.You might have expected Douglas's own Bryna Productions to have produced Cast a Giant Shadow but coproducing it with the Mirisch Brothers was Batjac Productions which was John Wayne's company. Wayne took a minor role in the production as General Mike Randolph who is clearly Patton. Made clear by the prominent two stars Wayne has on his helmet in flashbacks to World War II which later become three stars during the scene of a concentration camp liberation.Well Patton as we all know was killed in December 1945 in that jeep accident in occupied Germany. So obviously a decision was made to fictionalize Wayne's name in order to give him a bigger part as a man who encourages his former subordinate in his work.And if Wayne were fictionalized then some others had to be also. Yul Brynner as Asher was definitely Moshe Dayan who was winning the Six Day War when Cast a Giant Shadow came out. Luther Adler's character name was Jacob Zion and he was clearly David BenGurion. Michael Hordern has a brief part and is just listed as British Ambassador in the credits and that would have been Lord Halifax then.Also fictionalized was Marcus's fling with his female aide who is played by Senta Berger. She serves kind of like his Kay Summersby. Should never have been part of the film but maybe the producers decided a little sex was needed. Marcus's wife in America is played by Angie Dickinson.Even though Cast a Giant Shadow is based on a true story the film does suffer in comparison to the film made of Leon Uris's novel about the founding of Israel Exodus. Most of that novel did make it on the screen. It's characters were better developed in a much longer film that held the interest throughout.Cast a Giant Shadow also had its moments of silliness. There was a whole scene with Frank Sinatra as a mercenary pilot joining the new Israeli army dropping seltzer bottles on the enemy. Whatever possessed the powers that be to let that into the film?I will say that the battle scenes were well staged and the politics albeit one sided were clearly stated. Like Exodus in that way. One of the most moving scenes of the film was the announcement at the birth of Israel of the telegram from the American President Harry Truman announcing recognition of the new state accompanied with reverent singing of the Hatikvoh Israel's national anthem. That same scene was also in Exodus but both were done well.Of course the climax of the film is when Luther Adler makes the American visitor the commander over all the forces on the JerusalemNegev front. As he says the last man who held this title is found in the Old Testament of the Bible and his name was Joshua. That's the scene when Kirk Douglas finally realizes what his heritage truly is and it is moving.Despite it's flaws Cast a Giant Shadow is a wonderful tribute to the men and women who fought and still fight to maintain the State of Israel. Even though it does suffer in comparison to Exodus it has plenty of merit on its own.".

	schema:headline " Terrific story of Israel's 1st general in 2000 years";
	schema:reviewBody "Excellent cast intelligent script heartwarming scenes of loyalty determination rediscovered faith sobering scenes of the cost of freedom wow! I was completely engrossed watching this film the story of General David Mickey Marcus Kirk Douglas who in 1948 became the first Israeli general since Joshua of Biblical times. This film came out when I was 14 and I have somehow missed seeing it all these years. I had no idea what I was missing. What I don't understand is the grumbling and complaining about what a bad film this is. Huh? I loved it! Kirk Douglas John Wayne Yul Bryunner Senta Berger and Frank Sinatra were perfectly cast in their roles. The script covered the highlights of the War of Independence during the brief time time Marcus was involved and I don't know what more you could expect for a feature film. To tell the story of the war completely and thoroughly would take a miniseries of 20 hours or more. Yes the special effects look dated now but you can't fault something because it doesn't use technology that hadn't been invented yet. Also learning that Senta Berger's character was fictional and apparently only inserted to make a good story was a disappointment. However her character was a wonderful metaphor for Marcus' newly found love for Israel and rediscovery of his faith after living as a secular American Jew for his entire life. At one point Marcus says he hasn't been to temple since his bar mitzvah. Also I must say that I think the person who complained here on IMDb about John Wayne's reaction to seeing the Dachau concentration camp in the World War II flashback is completely off the mark. Wayne as Pattonesque American general Mike Randolph struggles to keep his emotions intact as he looks at the horror of the camp his troops have recently liberated. He orders his adjutant to give Marcus whatever he needs to tend to the Dachau survivors and turns away his back to the camera. He leans against a fence head down physically and emotionally overcome. What would you want him to do in such a situation? I suspect the objecting person just doesn't like John Wayne no matter what the film or what his role. His son Michael Wayne was coproducer with the film's director and screenwriter Mel Shavelson and Wayne's Batjac Productions is one of four production companies listed. Another reviewer here has cynically suggested most of the budget went to Wayne's salary and I say balderdash! I'm quite sure the Wayne family's interest and participation in this film was not merely financial. I'm equally sure they wanted to help tell this story of the Israeli struggle for freedom they thought the world should hear. Then and now for that matter.I want to thank the Showtime networks for airing this film in the USA on May 16 2009 which happened to be two days after the 61st anniversary of Israeli independence day. Nice touch and a terrific weekend to see this film.".

	schema:headline " A giant cast....a moderate shadow.";
	schema:reviewBody "A truly remarkable figure in military history is given an alternately dignified and silly tribute in this nicely appointed biographical film. Douglas plays a U.S. Colonel who is approached to advise the military operations of the scattered tribes and groups that are about to form Israel. To his wife Dickinson's dismay he leaves soon after the close of WWII and works to organize and stimulate the rather ragtag factions in place. In flashbacks his previous exploits in the war including his parachute jump into DDay and his dismantling of the concentration camp at Dachau are briefly shown. Once in Israel he works alongside present leader Brynner though they are occasionally at odds. He is assigned a curvy and attractive liaison in the form of Berger. The forging of Israel is a far more complicated and massive undertaking than seemingly possible and many lives are lost on both sides as a result. Finally Douglas is able to help make it all happen though ultimately he is unable to see the fruits of his labor. Douglas gives his typically solid squarejawed performance providing his character with guts bravado and foresight. Dickinson barely bothers to get dressed in her thankless clingy role. Most of the time she is in bed getting out of bed or about to go to bed and spends the bulk of her screen time fretting about the fact that Douglas isn't around enough. The story is set in the forties yet she is given a bouffant Mary Tyler Mooreish flip though they do stick a flower in it in one scene to capture the period detail! Berger is luminous and exceedingly appealing though she isn't given a chance to really show her bravery and heroism as other females in the Israeli army are. Given the circumstances it's easy to see why Douglas is tempted by this fictional? woman. The film features rather flashy supporting roles by three big names of the day. Sinatra shows up late in the game as a pilot who pitches in to help the cause. He tosses off a zinger or two before trying to fight armed Arab jets with seltzer water! Wayne billed as The General!! seems like he's only going to show up briefly and toss around his heft but he's actually in the film for quite a while and adds some dramatic weight to it. Brynner seems unduly subsidiary when one is used to seeing him as the King of Siam ordering everyone around and getting it done! However he does a nice job in his role. Topol is enjoyably hammy as an egotistical Arab sheik. The film is attractively shot and has some large scale action scenes along with some impressive crowd scenes no CGI here folks! It also features a very rousing and beautiful score by Elmer Bernstein. In truth the story should have focused more on the military and strategic accomplishments of its subject and less on his supposed melodramatic romantic entanglements. A sequence near the end involving the building of a road and the testing of it is a winner. The potential for it to be a deep and meaningful portrait are diffused somewhat by a script that calls for Douglas and others to make pithy clever comments in the heat of tragedy. It winds up being a soapy cartoonish sketch of a man who truly accomplished a great deal. Additionally SPOILER  the real Marcus was shot by a guard in part because he was draped in a blanket making him appear more like an Arab in the dark. Here he's wearing his regular uniform and carrying a rose! How threatening is that? It was a senseless change for him not to be wrapped in a blanket especially since he  in this version  had just come from a rendezvous with Berger.".

Here he's wearing his regular uniform and carrying a rose! How threatening is that? It was a senseless change for him not to be wrapped in a blanket especially since he  in this version  had just come from a rendezvous with Berger.";

I guess I'd hold the writers and the actors responsible  the direction is efficient and the score good.The script tells us things that most of us already know without adding much that we didn't. Thankfully it avoid extensive shots of the death camps. If anyone needs to be told about that he's hopelessly benighted anyway. That mass genocide was perhaps the most horrible expression of the baser impulses of human nature and like any transcendental event should be treated with caution not with an eye to the box office.Still the dialog is flat and ordinary. Giant closeups of faces telling us important things  For the first time I've realized I'm a Jew  doesn't really help. It's like being hit over the head by someone wielding a crowbar and yelling  GET IT? GET IT? Yes we get it. Stop already.Kirk Douglas isn't bad. In fact he's pretty good outdone only by Topol as an Arab sheyk  I course your Faddair. Cheese Topol is good. And so is his role. He plays The Sheik of Arabie on a Victrola and rolls his eyes with glee.John Wayne's performance is perfunctory and so is Frank Sinatra's but the latter's involvement is interesting. At one point in the film he protests Don't leave me alone  I'm antiSemitic. Far from being antiSemitic he was let's say proSemitic. Like a lot of recent immigrant families in the Northeast his had a keen eye for the strengths and weaknesses of ethnicity and Sinatra plumped for the strengths in Judaism. He envied and admired Jews for their family values and their solidarity and even learned to read a little Hebrew. A scene in which he spurts seltzer water at an attacking Arab fighter is beneath comment.Overall the film is not a success because it doesn't spell out in any detail exactly what Mickey Marcus actually DID for the Israelies. It won't do to have two minutes of Marcus telling them Attack! Attack! when ten times that amount is spent on an unconvincing adulterous affair with Senta Berger  not that having such an affair with such a magnificent woman would be a blot on anyone's escutcheon. I could never spell that word. It means shield. I guess it's worth watching once just to remind us of a part of history that some of us have not bothered to look into. As a film shrug.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was made in an era when just about every household had a television and Hollywood doesn't tolerate competition and needed to bring out its big guns . Those howitzers would be big name stars and epic storytelling . Unfortunately by this time this type of film would be dying out and a year later BONNIE AND CLYDE arrived on the scene which changed Hollywood film making with relatively unknown actors starring in smaller scale films that had a dubious morality to them so a film like CAST A GIANT SHADOW would have become relatively dated very quickly by the end of the decade On its own merits it isn't a bad film though it's certainly not a very good one either . The problem is that  Epic  is often a euphemism for  bloated   therefore we get to see the main protagonists war experience and family life . Why do we have to see all this ? one can speculate that the war sequences is an excuse to shoehorn John Wayne in to the film that'll appeal to all the manly men in the audience and the family life of the protagonist will get women flocking in to the cinema . It also has the unnecessary addition of Frank Sinatra which like Wayne seems to be included to give box office appeal It's not just the lack of brevity that's the flaw but the sometimes embellishment to the story that doesn't do it any favours . Some other commentators have gone in to detail so I won't dwell to much upon it but one noticeable aspect is that the Israelis in 1948 are portrayed to being total strangers to war which isn't in any way true . The British Army had a Jewish brigade which served in Italy during the war and were engaged in some very tough fighting in 1944 . Likewise Palmach and Haganah members would have had military experience fighting against Arabs in the Special Night Squads during the Arab revolts of 193839 and wouldn't be the inexperienced military virgins as seen here . Sadly the film doesn't make the point that the Irgun and Stern Gang were the purveyors of modern day terrorism that EOKA  the Provisional IRA and many other terrorist organisations modelled themselves upon until Al Quada took terrorism to new depths  but if you've got a Hollywood movie and it contains Brits as an occupying power then it's easy to turn a blind eye  but to be fair it points out it's better to be occupied by the British than the French That said the Brits aren't full blown villains and the American view of Israelis is I imagine not as black and white as it would be today regardless of your politics . In 1948 the American State Department was very suspicious about Israel since many of its inhabitants were from Eastern European countries and Eastern European equalled communist in American eyes with Zionist support for the country confined to a small American Jewish lobby . The film does touch upon the fact that the fledgling Jewish state obtained its weapons from the international black market rather than being supplied by America with America realising that the Arab lands contain an awful lot of oil so best not to annoy them . It should be remembered that the first arms supply from America to Israel didn't happen till 1965 and the often overstated influence America has over the Israeli state wouldn't have existed when this film was released In summary CAST A GIANT SHADOW is a relatively entertaining yarn but it's a melodramatic Hollywood movie using big names to make money for the studio . If you're interested in finding out the proper history of the creation of Israel it's a much better idea to read a book on the subject with the only problem trying to find a totally unbiased book on the subject".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film last year and I have to say that I wasn't really that impressed with the way it was made. Melville Shavelson had a good idea but it looked like there wasn't much effort put in this film. For example the action scenes in this movie were pretty bad. What was with Frank Sinatra dropping bottles of liquid on tanks just to make a lot of noise. John Wayne was good as The General and Yul Brynner also made an good performance as well as Kirk Douglas and Frank Sinatra. I didn't like that Wayne was so hard headed when he said God help them because that's all the help they'll get from us but I suppose everybody had their own personal say on things. The only thing I found really great about this movie was Elmer Bernstein's music score. This was one of Bernstein's overlooked scores and should be out on CD. Other than the score the rest of the film is pretty much average.".

The Palestinian majority and their right to self determination was ignored. Over the years Israel would acquire more land which it would dub disputed territory though international consensus and international law deems these territories illegally occupied and in breech of the Geneva convention and numerous UN resolutions. Zionist mythology likewise portrays itself as the victim of several key wars the Six Day War the 1973 war the Suez conflict the 1947 war when historical fact tends to point toward precisely the opposite.Bizarrely most of these films use the Holocaust as the sole justification for the creation of the State of Israel. But Zionism predates the Holocaust and really gained steam in the mid 1800s. Indeed even the six million number  the official number of Jews who died in WW2  has been around before WW2 the figure used in the 1800s and early 1900s to sanction various Zionist movements.The irony is Palestinians and Jews are virtually identical have the same paternal ancestors and the whole concept of Palestinians was cooked up and propagated by the Roman and British Empires to scatter and rename Jews for the purpose of strengthening their own rule and destroying cohesiveness in the region Philistines from whom the term Palestinian is derived were originally the enemies of ancient Israelites. A further irony is that many ancient Jews simply converted most were forced to Islam and thus eventually became Palestinians. Many Jewish customs themselves stem from an effort to assimilate to prevailing Muslim customs. And of course Palestine under the Ottoman empire was packed with Jews Christians Druze Gypsies and Muslims all living together.Some view Zionism as a religious movement Israel is becoming increasingly atheist others insist that tribes should be allowed to return to where they came though it is unlikely that persons living in the year 1948 have any kind of memory of or connection with life in 1200 BC Jerusalem. Today Israel is virtually an offshoot of the US military no longer a state with an army but an army with a state. A common view is that she is a tiny nation in the middle of aggressive Arab nations but today the truth is the opposite. The northern and north eastern rims of Africa are virtually controlled by the Western Empires along with Saudi Arabia Afghanistan and Pakistan further south and east. Today it is Syria and Iran who are surrounded by Western Power.Regardless Cast a Giant Shadow is a reductive film which does no justice to any position. Like Exodus it panders to American and Christian egos shocking romances between Christians and Jews etc and is designed to rehabilitate the Jew for Western audiences after decades of Western persecution. Hollywood did a similar thing with the Japanese following WW2.210  See Paradise Now Lemon Tree the masterful The Time That Remains Justine Shapiro's Promises and Yoav Shamir's Checkpoint.

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed Cast a Giant Shadow.Like so many films of its type it has the obligatory love angles that only slow the film down. Angie Dickinson and Senta Berger are much better actors than their silly parts allow them to be. When Dickinson's characters says to Douglas Don't hate me for loving you so much I wanted to scream. Oh wait I think I did scream. After that silliness I fastforwarded through the rest of the love scenes. As a result I have no idea what happened in the last scene between Douglas and Berger somehow I'll still be able to sleep at night.Another reviewer thinks the scene with John Wayne at the concentration camp is ridiculous and hard to believe. I actually thought it very believable and a remarkably directed and acted scene. Douglas's character has been there before. But Wayne as the general hasn't seen the camps firsthand and seems to think the stories have been exaggerated. Wayne and Douglas walk into the camp but the camera remains in a tight shot on them. So instead of showing us the scenes in the recently liberated camp the camera shows us Wayne and Douglas's reactions to what they're seeing. It's only a short scene but the few seconds of the look on Wayne's face register powerfully. It's subtle. He doesn't overplay it with a look of obvious horror disgust etc. Instead there's a sort of confused muffled pain in his eyes. John Wayne was a much better actor than he's usually given credit for. When Wayne turns to his right and goes over to lean on a fencepost with his head down trying to compose himself? trying not to puke? well that was a powerful moment for me. There was something about seeing that tall broadshouldered man have to walk away shut his eyes and hang his head. I forgot it was John Wayne for a few minutes and that's a big compliment to any star actor. I won't forget any part of that scene.I agree with another reviewer. Douglas' part has too many wisecracks. It gets old. Still there are some quite funny lines in this film and not only spoken by Douglas. My favorite is when Douglas is telling the weapons and manpowerstrapped Haganah commander and the others that they have to attack hit the enemy hard. And Yul Brynner deadpans With what? Noodle soup? Cast a Giant Shadow is not the greatest film ever made but it's an enjoyable one. Just fast forward through the romantic scenes and you'll be okay.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a decidedly onesided account of the events leading up to the partition of Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel. Except for Topol playing a sheik there is no consideration given to the Palestinian point of view. But that aside the film is poorly written but decently executed. The cast is stellar containing Kirk Douglas John Wayne Angie Dickinson Senta Berger and Yul Brynner. The story could be epic...the struggle of Israel alone and lacking weapons against most of the Arab world. But as I mentioned the writing is the film's weakest point. The dialog seems stilted in places. The writing just basically lacks the strength to keep the viewer interested. I also found the sound track quality on the DVD to be poor or perhaps it wasn't properly mixed. But some parts of the film particularly dialog are difficult to understand. If you crank the volume up enough you can understand the audio OK but then the music will blast you out of the room. The actual events featured tremendous amount of heroism on both sides actually a story that kept the world's attention riveted on PalestineIsrael for a long time and political wrangling that created the monster that is today's middle east. Yet most of that was left untold. Also unrealistic was the Arab artillery accuracy. It seems that nearly every shot was a direct hit on a moving truck. Nobody's that good. I enjoyed the film on a shallow action film level but was terribly disappointed that it didn't show the true events of the birth of Israel.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this dramatizes American involvement in two different wars overlapping in the film's structure even though they take place several years apart it is presented in a forward manner that is never confusing. Of course one of those wars is the second world war and the other one is what little involvement that the American military had in the attempt to create a Jewish state in Israel. At the center of this is Jewish American Kirk Douglas an army attorney with his own ways of viewing situations often to his detriment and on occasion to the bemused smirk of his superiors.With John Wayne as a two star general and Yul Brynnur as the Jewish leader fighting for the independent state there's sure star power. Angie Dickinson is pretty much in the background as Douglas's wife but has a few moments of greatly influencing her idealistic husband. Senta Berger plays an Italian Jew who teaches Douglas the ways of the Jewish Nationals who consider Douglas an American outsider.One poignant moment has Douglas showing Wayne around Dachau and observing Wayne becoming sick inside as he realizes the horrors. Future Tevye Topol plays a classic music loving Arab leader struggling for peace in his changing world. A walkon by Frank Sinatra as a pilot seems almost gratuitous. Michael Hordern appears briefly as a politician who tries to urge Douglas to convince the Jewish Israelis to proceed slowly giving the indication that America would only support the leaders who would aide them in getting oil.At a lengthy 140 minutes this manages to fly by pretty quickly with moments intense and poignant violent and peaceful traditional and modern. I really felt that I was getting a pretty authentic view of some of the situations that could have gone on taking account that this war for control has never really ended only getting more complex as new leaders and technologies have become involved. Indeed no matter how much money and power a country at war has the results are usually the same as those countries which don't.".

She was hospitalized but still raised money there. A movie about the ArabIsraeli war is 'duffus' without a character named Golda because no single leader did more for Israel achieving statehood than Golda Meir who was prime minister from 196772 and to whom I am not related and never had the pleasure of meeting. I did however stay at a Holiday Inn Express in Milwaukee one night.By the way the Arabs didn't attack until immediately after the statehood celebration not before as depicted. That's a small inconsistency amongst many glaring ones. Golda left to raise funds in the U.S. right after the scroll signing. She raised over 50 million which matched the sum of an earlier fundraising trip.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne's production company Batjac bankrolled this war movie about the rise of the state of Israel in 1948 when everybody thought that the Arabs would annihilate the Jews. Houseboat director Melville Shavelson inked and helmed this ambitious but muddled biography of World War II military hero Colonel David 'Mickey' Marcus Kirk Douglas of Spartacus who served as an adviser to Franklin Roosevelt. Marcus behaves likes an insubordinate S.O.B. when he ignores the orders of his superior officer and bails out over Normandy. He carries on a love  hate relationship with a twostar American general. After the war Marcus trades in his uniform for a lawyer's Homburg and an attache case but he is persuaded to act as an adviser to the fledging Israeli army. Yul Brynner Frank Sinatra Angie Dickinson and John Wayne costar in a war movie that has more soap opera than shooting. Mind you it is inspirational stuff especially when you consider the David versus Goliath predicament in which the Israelis found themselves. Shavelson's screenplay establishes the character of our protagonist as a man who would rather fight than love. The battle scenes are rather tame but the explosions are well done. Angie Dickinson plays the wife of Colonel Marcus while voluptuous Israeli freedom fighter Senta Berger cannot take her eyes off him after her own husband dies in the war. The prologue of the semifictionalized Cast A Giant Shadow struggles to reinforce the film's authenticity The major events in this film actually happened. Some of them are still happening. The major characters actually lived. Many of them are still living. Although it was not easy. Reportedly Douglas feuded with Shavelson throughout the production. Neither Wayne's production company nor Douglas' Bryna Productions scrimped on production values. Cast A Giant Shadow looks wellproduced with no end of extras trudging off to fight the war. Unfortunately Shavelson doesn't conjure up much momentum. When he does get things moving they inevitably bog down in long dialogue sessions. Nevertheless the film presents a realistic enough view of the problems that faced an army without any ranking officers soldiers who didn't know how to switch off the safety switches on their weapons. and an army that spoke in many different languages. Matters are not helped by a downbeat ending after the underdog Israelis construction a road out of solid stone to relieve the besieged town of Jersualem. The ending is a downer and Cast A Giant Shadow didn't cast a giant shadow at the box office. Composer Elmer Bernstein contributed one of his least memorable orchestral scores. Filmmaker Otto Preminger fared much better with his earlier epic Exodus that covered similar ground. The action was lensed on location in Israel and Rome. Douglas provides his customary bravado but all he really does is stand around and give orders. Shavelson's direction is barely competent and only one battle sequence when Sinatra flies over an Egyptian tank column tossing homemade bombs is memorable. Naturally John Wayne is cast as 'General Mike Randolph' but he appears to be a composite of General George Patton and other American generals. Future Fiddler on the Roof star Topol steals the show as an Arab sheik.".

	schema:headline " One Among Movie Kings of Adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "The Mayas one of the most mysterious and interesting civilizations that the world has ever seen have not been popular movie heroes in cinema history. Except for Mel Gibson who recently directed APOCALYPTO a stunning picture showing the twilight of the Mayan kingdom not many people know that there was also J. Lee Thompson before who made KINGS OF THE SUN. He directed it in the early 1960s and as a result the film is filled with its era with the style of the 1960s filmmaking. The reason why this movie is short of popularity is its highly limited access not many TVs broadcast it in most stores it is entirely skipped. Yet recently I had a chance to see KINGS OF THE SUN on Polish TV. And how did I feel about it? At first I said to my friend who gave it a viewing with me Nice little movie but after the second viewing I noticed something captivating in it I began to like it.It is so because of entire different reasons than in case of APOCALYPTO. I don't like the idea to compare these two movies because they are totally different. What KINGS OF THE SUN lacks APOCALYPTO has and vice versa including authenticity of language cinematography performances and music. The major reason why I was stunned by KINGS OF THE SUN is the presence of Yul Brynner. He is terrific as Black Eagle a heroic chief of the Indian tribe who at first is hostile towards the new invaders consequently he is to be sacrificed to the God of Waters and finally finds himself in the absolutely unexpected circumstances. Brynner had many roles that were great but whoever claims that it is one of his very best ones is right. The way he says to Balam Your woman is beautiful enthralled me. The moment he observes a peculiar new city from a high tree remained in my memory as exceptionally outstanding. The final sequence is supplied with emotions also thanks to him. I admit that other cast do fine jobs including George Chakiris as king Balam and Richard Basehart as priest Ah Min but Brynner absolutely rocks. While he was the king in THE KING AND I he is the king of KINGS OF THE SUN.The pure film factors like cinematography direction editing are quite fine here yet they are not top notch. Perhaps that is the reason why the movie has not become one of the top movies of the genre like other films of the time. But one thing is important to mention it is a pure adventure not an epic but the fictitious nice little story of love courage fight for independence coping with social problems building up a new life in a new place. The character of Balam is well developed he is the King for his people the one who says NO to the fanatical religion and the insane idea of human sacrifice. His final speech is pretty thought provoking What do gods really want of us? What sort of sacrifice? Yet nothing draws your attention to profoundity or history  all is there around adventure goal like in other films of the time including THE VIKINGS 1958 by Richard Fleischer or THE LONG SHIPS 1964 by Jack Cardiff. Pity that these two cultures the Vikings and the Mayas have not been put on screen more often in purely historical films while there are much more educational films about Rome Egypt or Greece. But that is a different story. KINGS OF THE SUN for entertainment's sake is really a rousing adventure.The last interesting aspect of the movie I'd like to mention is its musical score which is really memorable not very easy to tune but fits well to the scenes and the entire spirit of the movie. Music is affected by adventure fighting emotion... all that leaves an impact in the viewer. Consider for instance the rapid tunes interrupted by gentle ones when Ixchel Shirley Anne Field is trying to tame the Black Eagle. Another wonderful musical moment is when they sail on the sea the whole picture is stunning. It is so thanks to cinematography authentic locations including popular pyramid of Chichen Itza but music adds much as well.I have a fresh memory of this movie since I have seen it recently. The case with you may be different perhaps it has faded in your memory due to many years that have passed since you last saw it. Maybe it is the first time you have heard of this movie. But I give you my honest advice look for it because it is really worth seeing. Whether KINGS OF THE SUN is going to be released on DVD or not it is absolutely worth seeking out. Doesn't have the power of APOCALYPTO doesn't offer the authentic use of languages as well as native cast yet Brynner will leave you breathless and some other aspects will unexpectedly satisfy you. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "One major advance films have made since the classic era of the 1960s and before that is in realism of characters. You don't see white people playing Asians or blacks or Indians anymore. When you do see it in these old films it now looks ludicrous and takes away from the seriousness of the movie.Yul Brynner however is one guy who could get away with it. Here he plays MexicanIndian warrior Chief Black Eagle and he's believable. Whether it's his deep menacing voice or bald head with striking feature Yul was cool no matter role he played.I can't say the same for the rest of the cast. The costar George Chakaris as Balam the ninth as the same prettyboy hairstyle right out of the late '50searly '60s Richard Basehart Ah Min a Mayan priest has coloring on his face and wig you have to see to believe! Barry Morse Ah Zok will forever be typecast as Lt. Girard the man who harassed for years TV's The Fugitive. Meanwhile there is filmTVtough guy Leo Gordon as Hunac Kell and Shirley Anne Field as Ixchel. Field is beautiful and looks the part but a British accent in Mayan territory? However as the film goes on Field is more and more believable for some reason.Whatever there's always the story and a nice widescreen print now out on DVD which I was fortunate enough to obtain for rent. It was filmed in the Yucatan so the scenery is real  not some studio back lot.In the story Balam's Mayans get pushed out of their area by a warmongering neighbor led by Kell. There is nowhere to escape except by water over the Gulf of Mexico. This was no easy feat back in these early days. They make it start to build their new homes and civilization only to run into the Indians who already reside nearby. They are led by Chief Black Eagle and he's not too friendly.The rest of the film answers two big question 1  What will happen between the two groups? Will one annihilate the other or can they live in peace? 2  What if the old enemies  Hunac Kell's barbarians  show up? And......of course the big question who gets the girl?".

The setting in preColumbian America doesn't really do all that much to distinguish it from the biblical epics filmed in the same period and Yul Brynner's portrayal of an Indian chief is pretty much the same as his portrayal of an Egyptian pharaoh.Neither George Chakiris as the Maya king nor love interest Shirley Ann Field bear any resemblance at all to Mayans of course but nobody in 1963 would have expected they would. As a matter of fact Chakiris's hairdo was sufficiently reminiscent of Frankie Avalon's to distract me the whole way through. Still there's a nice score by the great Elmer Bernstein.Those who enjoy the genre will probably find some satisfaction in Kings of the Sun but certainly would be much happier with The Ten Commandments or Spartacus.".

	schema:headline " Tacky but fun preColumbian Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Writing in Wild West Movies Kim Newman draws attention to the lack of mainstream Hollywood product about America prior to Columbus .Indeed he identifies only two such movies The Norseman Lee Majors and this one .Newman is dismissive of its merits but while no masterpiece and indeed it has no pretensions to being the movie is fun in its own cheesy way . It describes the flight of the Mayans after military defeat at the hands of their Toltec enemiesand their settlement in what is now the Southwestern USA .They form an alliance with the Apaches headed by Yul Byrnner and together they unite to resist the pursuing Toltecs.This is despite the conflict between Brynner and the head of the Mayans played by George Chakiris over the favours of the Apache princess played by Shirley Ann Field . Brynner lends his considerable presence to the role of the Apache chieftain and easily overshadows Chakiris in the acting stakes while Field is ridiculously miscast .Some attempt is made to give the characters modern resonance by having Chakiris make a stand against human sacrifice but neither characterisation nor script is really the issue here This is movie dominated by action and spectacle .The battle scenes are well staged and the sets are magnificent with some striking location photography shot in Chicen Itza Mazatlan and Yucatan being a definite bonus Low marks for intellect but its fun movie making and while cheesy its also enjoyable".

	onyx:emotionText "Writing in Wild West Movies Kim Newman draws attention to the lack of mainstream Hollywood product about America prior to Columbus .Indeed he identifies only two such movies The Norseman Lee Majors and this one .Newman is dismissive of its merits but while no masterpiece and indeed it has no pretensions to being the movie is fun in its own cheesy way . It describes the flight of the Mayans after military defeat at the hands of their Toltec enemiesand their settlement in what is now the Southwestern USA .They form an alliance with the Apaches headed by Yul Byrnner and together they unite to resist the pursuing Toltecs.This is despite the conflict between Brynner and the head of the Mayans played by George Chakiris over the favours of the Apache princess played by Shirley Ann Field . Brynner lends his considerable presence to the role of the Apache chieftain and easily overshadows Chakiris in the acting stakes while Field is ridiculously miscast .Some attempt is made to give the characters modern resonance by having Chakiris make a stand against human sacrifice but neither characterisation nor script is really the issue here This is movie dominated by action and spectacle .The battle scenes are well staged and the sets are magnificent with some striking location photography shot in Chicen Itza Mazatlan and Yucatan being a definite bonus Low marks for intellect but its fun movie making and while cheesy its also enjoyable";

	schema:reviewBody "This delightfully corny film mixes genres. On one level it's a story about Indian conflicts in the days before Europeans arrived in America. That's pretty special in itself as there aren't many films exclusively about Indians. With one exception everyone in the cast is a real Indian. The exception of course is the lead partsall of which are played by nonIndians. Yul Brynner for example plays the chief of an unnamed Gulf Coast tribe. As you know he wasn't a real Indian he was Siamese. In this film he looks and walks very much like the king of Siam except that he doesn't wear a gold earring and never utters Is a puzzlement!The true star of the film however is George Chakiris whodespite his Greek nameis a Puerto Rican. I know that's true because he wears exactly the same hair style in this film that he had in WEST SIDE STORY made two years earlier. He must have used industrial strength hair spray Not only did his hairdo survive intact from WSS in KINGS OF THE SUN it is unscathed through a severalweeklong ocean voyage in an open boat.Speaking of hair styles check out the 'do on Richard Basehart. Apart from its gray color it looks like something Little Richard might have cooked up in one of his wilder moments.Getting back to genres ... this film also has aspects of the '50s biblical epicthe kind of film in which the good guys renounce killing appeal to a gentler god make heroic sacrifices and end up converting the bad guys to their new religion. KINGS OF THE SUN has all of that except that the new religion ain't Christianity it's something along the lines of Reformed Mayan Water God Worship. Now to the story.As chief of a section of Yucatan's Maya people at an unspecified but apparently remote time in the past Chakiris has a falling out with a more powerful chief and has to flee from Yucatan with his followers in boats. They head west across the Caribbean andafter several near mutiniesfinally reach land bordering the Gulf of Mexico apparently in Texas judging by the maps that flash across the screen.There the grateful refugees begin building a village complete with substantial adobebrick houses advanced crafts such as weaving and looms and glazed pottery and even a smallsized Maya pyramid. The amount of work they accomplish in a short time is phenomenalespecially considering that they get most of the work done before they think about such prosaic matters as planting crops or securing a freshwater supply. And where the find all their building materials and craft supplies so quickly is a mystery as there's little evidence that they ever go far from camp.Meanwhile Yul Brynner adorned only in loincloth and body oil is patrolling along the coast where he finds the newcomers' strange giant boats. He figures people who brought the boats must be in the vicinity so he goes back to his tribe by the way since when did Gulf Coast Indians live in tepees and hunt buffalo? to report his findings. He then goes back to find the boat people if I had been chief I would have delegated that job to several teams of scouts. This is a nice bit incidentally as it takes Brynner at least a week to find the new Maya village even though the immigrants erected the place near where they landed their boats and their pyramid can be seen from five miles away. So much for Indian scouting prowess. But then Brynner was Siamese not Indian.When Brynner finally meets some of the Maya he naturally comes face to face with King George himself. They duke it out Brynner with something like a tomahawk I think and Chakiris with a metal sword. Huh? Since when did the Maya have metal swords? Chakiris with help finally prevails. Brynner is captured and taken back to the Maya village where he is imprisoned in a room complete with barred windows! that looks big and comfortable enough to rate as a threestar hotel room in Texas at least.What follows is pretty predictable. Brynner eventually learns that he is being kept alive only to serve as a human sacrifice atop the new pyramid. Chakiris wants to end human sacrifices and proclaims Brynner free to go at the moment he is to be sacrificed. Of course the fact that Brynner looked capable of tossing everyone else off the top of the pyramid may have influenced Chakiris's decision. Brynner rejoins his people who suddenly appear poised to attack the village. He talks his people out of waging war and he and Chakiris pledge peace and friendship.The film then gets a bit warm and fuzzy and everyone discovers that it's possible for the buffalo man and farmer to be friends. Happily some dramatic tension is restored due to Brynner and Chakiris's rivalry over the film's only major babe and it looks like there will be a war after all. Doesn't happen though. The reason? King George's old Maya nemesis shows up in an armada though how the hell they could have found Chakiris's people across the Caribbean is one of the film's many mysteries. Now there really is a war but Brynner's people come to King George's aid and beat the bejeezus out of the invaders' forces.SPOILER!I hope it won't ruin the film for you if I reveal that Brynner is mortally wounded while fighting to protect Chakiris. After the battle ends he's carried to the top of the pyramid for a dramatic death scene which gives him a chance to tell Chakiris to marry the babe. Good ole Yul! Although he suffers a nasty wound that would leave even Hulk Hogan gasping for breath he still delivers his lines in a commanding baritone right up to the moment he checks out.".

Well back in those Hollywood days in the middle sixties audiences were not quite so demanding as now. So George Chakiris fresh from his West Side Story triumph and Yul Brynner known now from a number of hits are pitched against each other in a sixty's version of a martial arts film. Veteran character actors like Barry Morse Gerard of The Fugitive Brad Dexter Richard Basehart and Ford Rainey are seen sprinkled among the good guys and classic Villain Leo Gordon heads the bad guys. The beautiful Shirley Anne Field offers the feminine interest in a departure from her roles in grade B movies and adds to the pageantry of the film. And the usual cast of hundreds provides some nice texture and action to offbalance Brynner's hamming it up in the closeups. This is a fine old film that doesn't have legs that was entertaining in its time. It is available but be warned this film would be definitely grade B fare today.".

Enter Yul Brenner who could outking anybody that side of Sean Connery and the rest is history. Sure the storyline is laughable by todays standards but that only makes it more fun. My main point is as follows 1. WHERE IS THIS MOVIE? Has it decayed into dust? I have not seen this movie on television for 25 years. I cannot find it on VHS. 2. REMAKE THIS MOVIE This movie should be remade with the wandering tribe being the Egyptians who brought pyrimads and that cool game that predated basketball.

I lived in California at that time and there were few movies that we would leave the beach long enough to go to the theatre to see let alone see over and over. This was just one of those great movies that we could not get enough of. . or maybe it was George Chakiris!!";

However the villains are too stupid to be considered a threat and Brent Huff is an actor with all the talent of say Lou Ferrigno.";

But Mattei is no fool as he shamelessly rips off RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and ROMANCING THE STONE in this one. No joke Mattei lifts the drinking scene and truck chase nearly framebyframe from RAIDERS.Of course if you enjoy this type of stuff like I do than you are in for a treat. Brent Huff is no match for Reb Brown in the role of Michael Ransom but he does well enough. And your eyes are not betraying you when you see noted thespian Richard Harris in this as the commander. I guess he wanted to star in something that made ORCA look credible on his resume. Female lead Mary Stavin is quite attractive especially when she sneaks into the camp in a black wig. For some odd reason Mattei decided to give this film a soundtrack like THE STING which only enhances the comedy the unintentional stuff not the stuff they want you to laugh at.".

This time around he doesn't have the incomparable Reb Brown massive amounts of firepower and corresponding bodycount nor hysterical emoting and his various inspirations tend to be lighter Raiders of the Lost Ark Romancing the Stone Lethal Weapon as well as Rambo 2 and other jungle actioners so really the ultimate product was bound to be flawed and it is but it still pretty much rocks so its all good. Brent Huff takes over the Mike Ransom role and while he lacks the stately magnificence of Reb Brown does a solid job a smart rough and tumble tough guy who can come into his own when the going gets hard. Mary Stavin plays a bar owning partner and love interest of sorts bold brassy badass and not to mention beautiful she proves an ideal counterweight to the macho end of the scale. Italian schlock regulars Massimo Vanni and Ottaviano dell'Acqua Rats Night of Terror appear as well but the most plaudits go to the great Richard Harris. The cosmos only knows what strange wheels turned to put Richard Harris in a Bruno Mattei film but he gives it his all a turn of authority and dignity forged in total commitment he plays the material as if it were Oscar worthy and the effect his marvellous his scenes tremendously entertaining. The star power can't entirely distract from the fact that the film is a bit too light hearted and doesn't have quite enough action explosions wannabe gruelling violence or deranged tilts at pathos to be truly great there are certainly classy bits often involving useless ninjas but overall there's a slightly underpowered feel to things. Still I can't say as this isn't pretty solid entertainment. You'll laugh you'll roll your eyes you may in some small moments feel your pulse start to quicken but most importantly you'll likely won't feel bored. So worth a watch for fans of this sort of thing.".

Will Ransom pay the ransom for Jenkins? Find out today! While Strike Commando 2 has some good moments overall we prefer the first entry in this twopart series.

While it would have been a perfectly serviceable scream in its own right compared to the master Reb it falls short. But the main problem is that there are too many wacky musical stings which highlight some attempted comedy. Usually this comes in the form of the typical bickering between Brent Huff and Stavin who plays the stereotype nagging woman role. That is until they can learn to get along. Adding some loopy clarinets and silent moviestyle spedup fights detract from the intensity the movie should have.But there are plenty of positives to be found as well many highquality explosions are on show and of course the main victims of these blowups are huts. There is some funny dubbing and some unintentional laffs as well. Naturally there is the prerequisite torture scene and in this jungle many guard towers fall or poor unfortunate watchmen fall out of them. And lest we forget Richard Harris of Richard Harris fame whose presence here is inexplicable  but extremely welcome. Maybe the Academy Award voters held this against him and that's why he was a nominee but never a winner? Regardless this is Harris as fans want to see him and like a true professional he doesn't treat the material as inferior.

	schema:headline " interesting semidocumentary study of bank robbers in Milan predates the classic 70s Italian crime film cycle";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all my review is of the Englishdubbed version of this film released briefly in the US by Paramount. I have a feeling that some of the subtleties of the Italian original were lost especially in some of the initial scenes where Tomas Milian's character is being interviewed by a journalist. This film is quite in demand due to it being directed by the legendary Carlo Crazy Joe Lizzani and the action scenes are handled well as one would expect the scene where the robbers under the leadership of Gian Maria Volonte shoot at civilians to get Milian's police to stop chasing them was truly shocking but I would not put this in the top tier of Italian crime films although it should get some bonus points for predating the classic wave of 70s Italian crime films. Those expecting an overthetop Milian performance will be let down as he is given guest star billing and he is basically in the handsome leading man mold here puffing a cigarette through a cigarette holder and looking in charge but Volonte is the real star here as well as the young Ray Lovelock who does a great job as a teen with a taste for success who allows himself to be sucked into the world of crime. Margaret Lee's role is not major and those expecting a meaty role from this great seductress will also be let down. I see that this film received a number of awards upon its releaseit must have lost something in the dubbing as it's competent and has interesting elements but is nowhere near the level of something like say CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN or about two dozen others I could name. The completist should probably own this but I wouldn't spend a lot of time or money tracking down a copy.

	onyx:emotionText "First of all my review is of the Englishdubbed version of this film released briefly in the US by Paramount. I have a feeling that some of the subtleties of the Italian original were lost especially in some of the initial scenes where Tomas Milian's character is being interviewed by a journalist. This film is quite in demand due to it being directed by the legendary Carlo Crazy Joe Lizzani and the action scenes are handled well as one would expect the scene where the robbers under the leadership of Gian Maria Volonte shoot at civilians to get Milian's police to stop chasing them was truly shocking but I would not put this in the top tier of Italian crime films although it should get some bonus points for predating the classic wave of 70s Italian crime films. Those expecting an overthetop Milian performance will be let down as he is given guest star billing and he is basically in the handsome leading man mold here puffing a cigarette through a cigarette holder and looking in charge but Volonte is the real star here as well as the young Ray Lovelock who does a great job as a teen with a taste for success who allows himself to be sucked into the world of crime. Margaret Lee's role is not major and those expecting a meaty role from this great seductress will also be let down. I see that this film received a number of awards upon its releaseit must have lost something in the dubbing as it's competent and has interesting elements but is nowhere near the level of something like say CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN or about two dozen others I could name. The completist should probably own this but I wouldn't spend a lot of time or money tracking down a copy. Finally the ending is quite oddI rewound it three times to make sure I wasn't missing something. An American film would rarely end in such an ambiguous mannerthank goodness for Italians!!!";

The people you see been shot the man driving the truck the kid exiting the subway station were really killed the same way some months earlier in Milan's streets. The film narrates the robbery that took place in a Milan's bank in the fall of 1967 and was realized following the public shock that the whole story generated. That afternoon you could really see an high speed pursuit with the criminals intentionally shooting innocent people on the street to convince police to stop the chase. I really liked this movie for the ability of the director of depicting either the mere facts and the mentality of the bandits. Plus Gian Maria Volont is so good in portraying the rich criminal guy who robs banks to exit the mass. Some dialogs are in the Turin dialect a northern dialect hard to understand for those like me who come from another region of Italy. Very interesting the way the main characters call the Police la Madama the Lady again a northern expression.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an entertaining Italian crime drama from 1968 starring the excellent Gian Maria Volonte bad guy in A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More as the intelligent and increasingly hubristic leader of a gang of bankrobbers. The first ten minutes are pretty misleading making it appear like this is going to be a light even campy affair more in line with Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik! than the serious crime drama it turns out to be. But once the gang's driver is rescued from an angry mob and interrogated by Tomas Milian we get down to business. This overlooked little Italian gem does a number of firsts from what I can tell and anyone who knows better is free to correct me. First is the use of pop music throughout the film. It has instrumental tracks but the pop tunes are fairly ubiquitous in a way they were not in any other crime movie from that time or before. Secondly there is the realistic planning and casing for one of the robberies not the amusing fantasy plotting of the Italian Job Topkapi or Ocean's 11. Thirdly there is a full speed bullet flying car chase through the urban environment of Milan without any use of back screen sped up film or any other tricks still prevalent in Hollywood films from the period. It's all fast driving and editing. Last but definitely not least is the gritty cinema verite photography that is stamped all over later films like The French Connection and The Seven Ups. Having watched this it's pretty obvious to me that the young film school turks like William Friedkin and Martin Scorcese a selfadmitted Italian film fanatic and preservationist saw this movie when it was first released in the U.S. That makes Bandits In Milan a.k.a. The Violent Four a must see for film and 1970's crime drama buffs. I found it at Netflix but only for streaming which was unfortunate as I had to watch it on my laptop. Still glad I did.".

Hell it doesn't even start to have a plot until about twenty minutes in  that's how weirdly constructed this one is.You see we follow Detective Tomas Milian as he uses documentary techniques to replay crimes that have happened in the past. At least I think that's what he says. We also get to see extortion rackets gambling dens and the burning of an escort girl before a robbery goes wrong and several innocent bystanders get whacked for their troubles and this is where the story starts being coherent at all  but who is behind these awful killings?Turns out the gang have struck seventeen times before including three robberies in one day. This gang is led by smiling overconfident Gian Maria Volonte who gets very philosophical about things. He even has a cover story  he runs a legitimate business during the day with his other two gang members also attending as 'employees'. They also pick up a third member in the form of young Ray Lovelock who wants to escape his boring life. This is an odd take on the Eurocrime film so cop Tomas Milian is basically pushed into the background to interrogate one of the robbers while the real emotional core of the film sits with Volonte who loves his mamma and promises his wife the world while being charming to his secretary he gets her driving lessons and nurturing the criminal career of Lovelock all while laughing his head off about everything. We also spend a lot of time with character who have nothing to do with anything like prank callers and the escort girl from the start. The best part about the film is the big robbery as the gang do a lot of groundwork before the actual robbery itself and we are shown in great detail the lives of the innocent people just about to be caught up in a world of violence. In fact this bit is carried out so well that the rest of the film just kind of runs down to a halt. Strange.You can see how this would have been an influence on Quentin Tarantino  the plot is all over the place it's full of dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot and it's rather violent. Just throw in Samual L Jackson some funky music and a fixation on the 'n' word and your good to go! For a very similar film see Gangster's Law.".

	schema:headline " Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece Deserves Your Attention";
	schema:reviewBody "I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one however is a subtly observed family drama set in postWWII Japan and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's filmmaking style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi an elderly couple who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children daughter Shige and son Koichi in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly Tomi visits their kindly daughterinlaw Noriko the widow of second son Shoji while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko a schoolteacher who lives with them and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko have given up on their parents even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted trivialsounding storyline fraught with soap opera possibilities Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact some of the more critical events happen offcamera because Ozu's simple penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track explains this concept as narrative ellipses Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters no masochistic showboating and the dialogue is deceptively casual as even the most offhand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me not because there are manipulative plot developments even death which force me to feel for them.I just love the performances as they have a neorealism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother so when sadness does take over in her life it becomes all the more haunting. In particular she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura who is able to show respect pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents as she selfishly eats them herself or how she finagles Koichi to cofinance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in Tora! Tora! Tora! displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.But the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments for instance when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic or the touching goodbye to Kyoko or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The twodisc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc as well as the trailer. On the second disc there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983 twohour feature focused on Ozu's life and career and the second is a 40minute tribute from several international movie directors.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one however is a subtly observed family drama set in postWWII Japan and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's filmmaking style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi an elderly couple who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children daughter Shige and son Koichi in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly Tomi visits their kindly daughterinlaw Noriko the widow of second son Shoji while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko a schoolteacher who lives with them and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko have given up on their parents even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted trivialsounding storyline fraught with soap opera possibilities Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact some of the more critical events happen offcamera because Ozu's simple penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track explains this concept as narrative ellipses Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is commonly called one of the masterpieces of international film. Indeed a wellknown intro to film textbook uses it as a case study in notable filmmaking. But as more than one reviewer so far has pointed out 'Tokyo Story' is slow obscure and sometimes seemingly sterile. Understanding how a great classic could be seemingly soulless requires some study  of Japanese culture as others have pointed out of film technique and of ourselves. Fortunately that understanding more than fully repays itself as is true of any great piece of art.I should begin by warning the first time viewer that the film is not in any familiar style. Other reviewers have mentioned the camera the angles the acting the elision  I hardly need dwell on these. Those used to Hollywood films of almost any era will find 'Tokyo Story' odd and unsettling just because the style is so different. And of course the culture is radically different. In this forum one can hardly even begin to discuss the way that Japanese fathers discuss their children amongst themselves or the marriage culture of 1950s Japan. But I think the film is great even if one has no understanding of continuity editing or postwar Japan or a dozen other obscure topics. This is after all the central feature of great art Even those of us who do not fully understand still realize in some unspeakable way that we are in the presence of something great.The most common accusations leveled against this film oddly assert alternatively that it is a cold soulless exercise in technique or on the other hand that it is a soap opera with no real substance. I think neither of those is true. There can be no question that it is easily seen as cold. Nothing really happens by modern standards. It is merely a family that comes and goes and lives and dies. Of course to those who accuse it of being a soap opera that death is the foremost evidence of its manipulative guilt. But for those who have seen it recall the mother's stroke or where Keizo is told to look one last time  would a soap opera elide such a supremely emotional scenes?No 'Tokyo Story' is neither cold nor manipulative. Rather it slowly brings you into a family that while perhaps totally unlike your own is at its base just the same. Then it allows those things to happen that must someday happen to all of us  growing up moving away and that unspeakable inescapable end. It is not easy it is not obvious but it is not obscure either. After it all I can only tell you this If you have lived long enough to know how it feels to leave your parents and only realize far too late as it seems we all do the value of what you have left behind then 'Tokyo Story' will reward you perfectly. And these things  we all do these very things so 'Tokyo Story' is universal is Art.".

I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don't want anyone to know and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly without the usual post movie chatter  and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never ever witnessed that in a cinema.Since then i've watched it on DVD and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made  certainly the top 5 of any I've seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn't have the greatest script of any movie there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great but not the greatest ever seen and the technical qualities are just average. I've come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don't find myself comparing it to other movies instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait a Vermeer painting or my favourite short story 'The Dead' by James Joyce. It is simple unadorned and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I'm rapidly approaching pseuds corner but this is my genuine conclusion writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts.Of course there have been many great movies about families about growing old about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a '10' to.".

The Japanese are rather reserved and were even more reserved back in the early 1950's when this film is set. No embracing even of parents children siblings no dramatic histrionics even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.Consequently I can't really blame several reviewers here for calling this movie boring and slowpaced. But it is not at all slowpaced from a different cultural perspective. It just depends on what you're used to.If you do take the time to watch and try to understand it you'll find an engrossing analysis of the dynamic of a middleclass family the rift that grows up between generations and of the many excuses we find ourselves making to justify our neglect for others even those dearest to us. These themes are universal but are couched in a postwar Japanese idiom and so probably less accessible to the average Western viewer.I have wondered awhile about a speech at the end by Noriko the widowed daughterinlaw in which she denies that she's such a good person though her actions in the movie indicate otherwise. I'm still not sure I understand her motives in saying this. For the most part however this movie will not leave you puzzled but it may leave you a bit wiser and a bit more reluctant to make those excuses.".

Wow... that pretty much says it.Tokyo Story is defenitely one of the finest movies ever made. Easy. I don't care what anyone says slow or not this is one of Ozu's finest films. Very few movies have made my cry but I did indeed weep at this movie. All of the actingperformances are very believeable especially Hara's. The interesting knee level tatami cinematography suits the film perfectly. Even the music isimpeccable. What really gets me with Tokyo Story is how stunningly realistic it is. From the dialogue to the story everything feels like real life. No matter what language you speak what culture or country you hail from this element is universal.It's pretty much perfect... every character is fleshed out there are no plot holes left open... I can't find anything to complain about it! 50 years after its release and it's still very contemporary... damn.I give it  out of .".

The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s eating and sleeping mourning the war dead clothes and home furnishings spoiled kids a doctor's office a schoolroom life in Tokyo and small towns how family members talk to each other old men's drinking habits a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. There is none of that hey I'm making a moving movie crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics. He just lets the story unfold in a quiet natural way. It's not for folks who only like action movies. I put action in quotes because this movie is about the real action in lifeenjoying life sharing it with others facing the end of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ozu's Tokyo Story is a serene and contemplative look at the breakdown in the relationship between grown children and their elderly parents shortly after World War II. The film concerns itself with problems many of us must face the struggle to maintain a selffulfilling life independent of parental expectations the changes in relationships wrought by time and the inevitability of separation and loss. Ozu does not point the finger at either parents or children but like many of his films offers a thoughtful meditation on the transitory nature of life. As the film opens we see an empty street empty train tracks and an empty pier perhaps an early indicator of the sense of loss that pervades the film. An elderly father Shukishi Hirayama Chishu Ryu and his wife Tomi Chieko Higashiyama are preparing to travel by train to visit their children in Tokyo. When they arrive they are met with indifference by daughter Shige Haruko Sugimura their grandchildren Minoru Zen Murase and Isamu Mitsuhiro Mori and son Koichi So Yamamura a Tokyo pediatrician. When Koichi is called to visit a patient and Shige cannot leave her beauty salon the Harayamas postpone a sightseeing trip and start to complain that they expected the children would be living in more comfortable circumstances. Their widowed daughterinlaw Noriko Setsuko Hara however welcomes them warmly and gives them the experience of being appreciated. To give themselves some breathing room the children pool their resources and send their parents to Atami a health spa. Their visit however is cut short when the noise and crowds make going home seem like a better alternative. When they get back to Tokyo Shige tells them she has a meeting scheduled at her house and Tomi decides to spend the night with Noriko. Shukishi in a very humorous scene goes out drinking with old friends and shows up late at night at Shige's house completely drunk. When the elderly parents return to Onomichi the mother suddenly becomes very ill and the entire family including youngest son Keizo from Osaka must come and visit them. The moment of epiphany comes when the youngest daughter Kyoko Kyoko Kagawa asks Noriko whether or not life is disappointing. Her answer mirrors Ozu's concept of mono no aware that we cannot avoid the sadness of life but her beaming face tells us that things are just the way that they are and that it is perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. It's something about the characters the honesty the way everything hits home despite the cultural and timeperiod barriers.Tokyo Story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar Japan. Simply it boils down to this two aging parents played by Ryu Chishu and Higashiyama Chieko live far away from their children who are in a quickly modernizing Tokyo. The children in Tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustleandbustle of the city. The key character in this film though is Noriko Hara Setsuko the widow of one of the parents' sons who died in the war. Noriko turns out to be more active with her husband's parents than their own children are.The parents decide to make their first and possibly final trip to Tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. The only person that can make significant time for them however is Noriko the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! In one heartfelt scene the mother Tomi spends the night at Noriko's in which she begs her to remarry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. During this time the father Shukichi is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.Ozu Yasujiro is considered to be one of the world's greatest filmmakers and Tokyo Story is considered his masterpiece. There is no reason to deny this. Ozu's camera is often a topic of discussionit usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor tatami which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. It is usually always a calm camera and very rarely pans. His films are also often slowly paced and meditative choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. Ozu's direction of children has always been brilliant they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters though not here.Tokyo Story contains all of the elements that make Ozu's films popular with film students and cinephiles today. His calm observant camera his reallife nonembellished characters his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects his perfectly timed music among other things contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. Ozu's passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.Tokyo Story will not appeal to everybody especially today. The typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is old or black and white or find it boring. To the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story Tokyo Story is a rewarding experience. Tokyo Story along with Ozu's other films is a good example of film as an art. Aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera it is much less of the entertainment experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. There are no explosions violence chase scenes or over thetop characters here. This is Ozu. This is one of the greatest films ever made.".

Far from being in the pantheon of greatest films I found it to be a ploddingly dull movie that made some fairly obvious points about the weakening of the parentchild relationship as the parents settle into old age.The movie is definitely not without its fine points. The acting is generally excellent and the last half hour becomes increasingly interesting after the first brutally slowpaced opening hour and fortyfive minutes. It's entirely possible that if Site  Sound hadn't placed this film on such a high pedestal I might have enjoyed it more than I did. But then again if they hadn't have rated it so highly I might have never seen it at all.In the final analysis Tokyo Story is worth a look but if you're expecting to see one of the greatest films ever made be ready to be disappointed.".

Far from being in the pantheon of greatest films I found it to be a ploddingly dull movie that made some fairly obvious points about the weakening of the parentchild relationship as the parents settle into old age.The movie is definitely not without its fine points. The acting is generally excellent and the last half hour becomes increasingly interesting after the first brutally slowpaced opening hour and fortyfive minutes. It's entirely possible that if Site  Sound hadn't placed this film on such a high pedestal I might have enjoyed it more than I did. But then again if they hadn't have rated it so highly I might have never seen it at all.In the final analysis Tokyo Story is worth a look but if you're expecting to see one of the greatest films ever made be ready to be disappointed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Labelling something 'the best ever' or even a more moderated 'one of the best...' is surely asking for trouble? But in the case of TOKYO STORY it would be difficult to imagine the film causing any kind of trouble at all as this very measured courteous movie is such an inoffensive and charming offering. However it's not in my view anything remotely like 'the best ever'. It's a nice little film in it's way but I do wonder why on earth it has developed such a huge reputation? It's sad it's endearing it's sometimes rather beautiful and it's melancholic almost throughout but it's also very predictablenothing remotely unexpected happens one can see things being flagged up well in advance. It's very slow and made in a very tightly confined way which hasn't really influenced subsequent movies half as much as some people would like to think.So what makes it considered one of the best? It's not the story which is spare and not very entertaining in itselfalthough the character development is good. We do get to know the people involved even if many a motive seems to remain mysterious at the end. It's not the camera work which is rigidly static creating the impression of interlinked paintings through which the protagonists wander rather carefully. The familiar Ozu stylisations the low set camera the unfamiliar looks almost straighttocamera when speaking make it a slightly unsettling film to watch initially although one soon becomes used to them. Perhaps it's the location work which is appealingin a reserved and understated way? Japan in the mid 50s seems far more exotic and unfamiliar than it would today  but that's true of almost any developed country. Twenty first century England no longer resembles the country depicted in Ealing Comedies of the same era. And the acting is a conundrum. Cultural differences in speech patterns and body language make it hard to compare what we see here with what we are familiar with in the western world. Certainly the fatherfigure seems to move and speak in such a painfully slow and deliberate way except when drunk! that one really begins to wonder how naturalistic his acting is. Are we seeing something comparable to Brando's 'method' or to Olivier's Shakespearian style? I think one needs to be very familiar with Japanese language and culture to fully understand and appreciate that aspect. He's a nice old boy but he might well be a terrible actor. It's certainly not the music that makes this film special as it's neither evocative nor memorable so I'm at a loss. CITIZEN KANE which often shares this most elevated of critical pedestals with TOKYO STORY clearly has cast a muchlonger shadow over the development of cinema and while it's chockfull of innovative moments and methods TOKYO STORY seems rather a stylistic cul desac from which one can find very little in subsequent movies. It's not a bad movie but it is one which I'd fine it hard to sit through a second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tradition is the illusion of permanence.  Woody AllenYasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story finds an elderly Japanese couple visiting their adult children in Tokyo city. They intend to spend time with their offspring but the kids are too engulfed in their own lives to make much time for their mother and father.Having seemingly lost the ability to relate to their parents the selfabsorbed kids thus shuttle the couple off to a luxury spa and hotel all the while resenting their parents for the expense. Even the couple's grandchildren treat them with a great deal of scorn. The eldest grandson grows angry when he learns that he has to share his study with his grandparents and later throws a tantrum when the family cancels plans to visit a restaurant.Ignored by their family the elderly couple wander about Tokyo city visiting friends and soaking up the scenery. They receive more affection from strangers old friends and the wife of one of their dead sons than they do from blood relatives. The film ends with the family's frail mother predictably dying. Though her children take a few moments to mourn her loss stating that they regret not treating their mother better whilst she lived they promptly return to their old selves their dead mother quickly forgotten.So what we have here is a simple morality tale. Ozu is a traditionalist and the majority of his films view with bittersweet sadness how the traditional family unit has disintegrated in an increasingly urbanized postwar Japan. And yet while Ozu waxes nostalgically for some ideal familial bond his films are also about the inevitability of change. One need only look at the titles of Ozu's better known films Early Spring Late Spring Early Autumn and Late Autumn to see that he's attached to a very specific form of Japanese seasonality. In Tokyo Story he makes this point quite literally when he has one character state that all families unavoidably drift apart pulled in their own individual directions. The result is that Tokyo Story has an oddly counterproductive tone Ozu both acknowledging the inevitability of change and mourning the loss of some idealized good old days. Typical of Ozu the director's camera is always distant austere and motionless. He doesn't sledge hammer his points and maintains a very remote tone throughout. This has led to critics and fans applying buzzwords like unsentimental and restrained to Tokyo Story. But is the film really restrained or is Ozu's emotionally inert quietness fooling us into thinking we're watching something of depth and complexity?Consider for example a scene in which the daughter pokes fun at her mother's weight only for the mother to die at the end of the film. Instead of delving into the couple's relationship Ozu opts for simple button pushing forcing us into the easy position of hating the daughter and pitying the mother. Ozu's aloof style therefore disguises the shallowness of his material whilst also denying us the satisfaction of what is really shameless domestic melodrama.Like Dreyer Ozu thus has a tendency of packaging very sentimental and simplistic morality lessons in what can at times be a very challenging aesthetic. In other words Tokyo Story is more challenging stylistically than it is intellectually morally or emotionally. It is neither complex nor nuanced its solemn style completely at odds with what is really a very easy and agreeable lesson.Still it's not all black and white. If the sons and daughters don't have time for their parents its only because they are genuinely busy. Ozu even makes one son a hectic doctor in an attempt to absolve the boy of all guilt. Afterall how can we hate a kid for cancelling a diner date with his parents when he's absent only because he's out saving lives?The waters are muddied further when late in the film the father reveals that he is disappointed that his children are not more successful. It gradually becomes clear that he has relied on the success of his children to validate his own life. Throw in the fact that the mother is a bit of an airhead the father was once a drunk and that both parent's constantly put on a ridiculous facade of kindness and it's hard not to empathise with their offspring. The kid's may be dismissive of their parents but the parents we learn are equally dismissive of them.7.910  An influential film viewed as a masterpiece by many. Still peel back its uptight stoicism and Tokyo Story reveals itself to be a pretty condescending message movie. Much of Ozu's filmography is like this hiding sentimentality behind an austere aesthetic. Consider all the pavlovian heart attacks and wistfulness in End of Summer his sentimentalizing of the unemployed in Tokyo Chorus his fondness for abandoned kindly old parents Tokyo Story Late Spring the way he scorns and celebrates! modernisation Good Morning and mourns the way time rips all children away from the elderly Late Autumn. Worth one viewing.".

Its not only touching deep and well made but its also Japanese more than 50 years old blacknwhite sloooow and not popular with the masses because apparently these things count as positive. Don't get me wrong I have no problem with Japanese Kurosawa slow Stalker 2001 movies or movies that are confined to a few interior places 12 Angry Men. And I think this is a very good movie. It just doesn't have enough content other than its mood to hold up as well as some other old classics.Still I say give it a watch. But I warn you this is minimalist cinema.710".

I was told by my exJapanese teacher about 5 years ago back in secondary school that it was one of the most beautiful films ever made. I was only just getting into foreign cinema i.e. anything not from Hollywood really and wasn't sure what to expect and I wasn't willing to take the risk of being possibly bored to death with old classics. I read many reviews written by the random public from websites such as IMDB and I found too many unfavourable comments about it so I thought I'd give it a miss... how wrong was I to conform to other peoples' opinions!I'm going to contradict myself now immediately after implying that one shouldn't conform to other people because I am now going to say that it is a wonderful film and you should take my recommendation and watch it whenever you have a chance. Because of people like me there will always be people that harshly criticise this masterpiece of a film but because of these harsh words there will always be people like me who will praise it just a bit too much.Although in those last two paragraphs there was virtually nothing with regards to the theme and plot and acting of Tokyo Monogatari there isn't really a need to express the overall beauty of the film since it is a near perfect work of art from Yasujiro Ozu. His camera technique is so unique that one can immediately spot an Ozu film from a mile away. Tokyo Monogatari is that deals with family issues Ozu's theme in all of his films and how society messes things up so much that there is nothing that can be done to solve the problems. It leaves the viewer with a strange feeling of desperation to do something good for your parents. It may not be the most emotional and dramatic of films but it certainly provokes a flood of emotions for the viewer to dream about in hisher sleep.I would give this a definite 1010 and I would rate Ozu as one of the greatest directors of all time. Another two films I recommend by Ozu are FLOATING WEEDS and OHAYO.".

Because of people like me there will always be people that harshly criticise this masterpiece of a film but because of these harsh words there will always be people like me who will praise it just a bit too much.Although in those last two paragraphs there was virtually nothing with regards to the theme and plot and acting of Tokyo Monogatari there isn't really a need to express the overall beauty of the film since it is a near perfect work of art from Yasujiro Ozu. His camera technique is so unique that one can immediately spot an Ozu film from a mile away. Tokyo Monogatari is that deals with family issues Ozu's theme in all of his films and how society messes things up so much that there is nothing that can be done to solve the problems. It leaves the viewer with a strange feeling of desperation to do something good for your parents. It may not be the most emotional and dramatic of films but it certainly provokes a flood of emotions for the viewer to dream about in hisher sleep.I would give this a definite 1010 and I would rate Ozu as one of the greatest directors of all time. Another two films I recommend by Ozu are FLOATING WEEDS and OHAYO.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSUnfortunately I'm from the IfItDoesn'tMovePokeItWithAStick school of film criticism. No I'm just kidding. I like a lot of slowmoving movies. No Tokyo Story has problems up the wazoo. It's not that it's a bad movie either. I actually liked it marginally. 710 for sure. I do feel that it's vastly overrated  about as overrated as movies come. It's very often considered one of the ten best films ever made. Personally I don't think Yasujiro Ozu gives human existence enough credit. Life is never this uninteresting nor are people. I have lost family recently and I could relate stories about funerals that have such enormous depth that they would blow this thing away.I've heard so much about the amazing restraint of Ozu's style that I really just have to question it. I have seen one other Ozu film  Bakushu is its Japanese name I can't remember whether it's Late or Early Spring. It was boring too but interesting culturally. It really was stale with almost no movement whatsoever. Tokyo Story is clearly Ozu's most famous film and I have to say the style here is not restrained at all. There are only two tracking shots in the whole film  that's what people usually point to when they're looking for stylistic techniques to point out. One person I've talked to said In Tokyo Story there's only one tracking shot sic and it cuts like a knife. I'd say that the one he's talking about does add to the poignancy a little and so does the one he forgot. It didn't however affect me greatly. In fact only a couple of individual shots touched me at all. As for the rest of Ozu he does position his camera lower to the ground than probably any other director  a technique that isn't really very noticeable. Otherwise it's not too much different from Hollywood. In fact most Hollywood films of the era have limited or no tracking shots just based on their budgets. The editing patterns are almost identical to anything you'd find anywhere else except for this odd and annoying type of crosscutting that pops up whenever two people converse. I don't get that it's really choppy rather jarring for a movie that seems to want to be so realistic.And that's where I think this film's critical prominence lies in its realism. I don't understand it but whenever any film tries to be realistic or naturalistic critics and most film buffs develop a raging erection. I know what real life is like and I'd much rather see it exaggerated. To tell you the truth as I said above I don't think Ozu is presenting real life in Tokyo Story or Bakushu. Real life has much more drama than this film. This is doing the opposite of hyperbolizing it's minimizing real life. In real life when a family meets around the dinner table as the family does at the end of this film there're a million circumstances effecting the outcome of that meal. Not so in this film. Ozu reduces them to types the nice old couple the toobusy adults the selfish wife the compassionate widow etc. They do have character. I wouldn't want to undermine that too much. But in real life they'd be so much more complex and interesting. I suggest that you attend a relative stranger's Christmas dinner as a ghost if necessary. It would be infinitely more complex.I do have to give the film credit for the complex issues that it raises. Its main themes have to deal with the callousness of the adult generation and the disappointment in the elderly generation. It deals with these themes well whenever it gets around to dealing with them. A more brilliant writer would have had more with the grandchildren but Ozu is content to have just a bit of it at the beginning. But really what does he bring out in the film that you didn't know already? I have a feeling that the same people who love this movie are right at the moment as I write this 12192001 apprehensive about their parents or inlaws showing up for Christmas and will breathe a sigh of relief when they leave. And I bet those same people will watch this movie when they're older and say Hey my kids are just like those aholes!There are better movies about aging out there. Check out the Icelandic film Children of Nature about an old man whose family is so annoyed at his presence in their home that they quickly move him to a nursing home where he meets his high school sweetheart. They had been forced out of their homes in a more inhospitable part of the island years before and together they conspire to go back there and die. Tokyo Story fans will certainly hate it for the mere fact that it is well entertaining and fantastical. Another one I like a lot is by the Ozuenthusiast's greatest enemy  the dreaded Akira Kurosawa who often delivered amusing quips against Ozu when he was interviewed by the press he thought Ozu was a bore too. The film is Rhapsody in August and I can hear the laughter already from the Ozu sector. I promise you all that that film will become more beloved and important as the years go on. Right now it is in critical limbo for the silliest reason Richard Gere is in the movie for about 15 minute. And it's actually one of his best performances if you'd just give him a chance. That film is much better in dealing with the paradoxes of the three generations's relationships.".

	schema:reviewBody "some spoilersWhy would anyone want to write anything about a film released half a century ago? There are two most obvious reasons a the author has only recently seen it and b the film is timeless just as relevant today as when it was first released. In this case it is both.Over the last halfcentury Tokyo Story has found its way into the top ten list of numerous film critics. Much have been said about the reason why. What I'm trying to do here is just to make several observations about things in this film that particularly strike me.One is on the scene at the Tokyo train terminal when the old couple returns home after their visit in Tokyo. Most of us in today's world would have plenty of experience is saying farewell. Less of us would have experience in saying farewell to people whom we just may not see again. Still less of us only those who have been around long enough would have experience in saying farewell to people who expect that they may not see us again. Those of us in this last category would probably sense what I am referring to about the scene. The old women in a completely matterofcourse manner said to her children that now that they have had this reunion if anything happens afterwards they need not come to the small town where the old couple lives. So plainly delivered this line is one of the things that make Tokyo Story stand above other films with similar situations and similar dialogues.Another is a very haunting static image. Leading towards it is the part when the old couple's son a very busy medical doctor scraps the plan of a family outing. While the somewhat rebellious older grandson sulks the grandmother successfully coaxes the younger son to go outside to play in a somewhat desolate industrial area. The grandmother somewhat predictably asks the little guy what he wants to do when he grows up and equally predictably the question is beyond his grasp as he continues to pluck at the tall grasses. Then comes this last shot of the sequence a distant shot of old on the right side of the screen and the young on the left. Regardless of what message you get out of this shot the image is haunting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Podaa Podi is all about love at first sight and it's consequences. Firstly our hero STR looks nice and lazy to fit his role perfectly in this film. The film starts off with his amazing dance moves in the song Love Panlaama Venaama. Our heroine Varu also looks cute and pretty in this film. She plays the role of a dancer committed to her career without a care about the serious life. The story is really good although it should have been extended. The songs are also a plus point for the film. It's visually good and it looks rich with the UK picturesque. I don't get why is it highly underrated. Str's acting was amazing and so was Varu's. Ganesh plays a funny role in the film. The main characters have acted really well and this film deserves to be a Super Hit. Overall 7.510".

Every one and I mean everyone is a suspect as the cast gets whittled down by the killer leading to a heart pounding climax. Nice photography with a creepy opening scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Knight Moves is a film offor fruitcakes....a little too complicated to be called a Madeira but heavy enough to take away the hunger pangs.  It manages to convey the horror of death without any real murder sequences being shown and is rather  Hitchcockesque in places.The story centres around chess player Peter Sanderson Christophe Lambert and his possible involvement in a string of serial killings.  Due to his complete absorption  in the game he has already lost his wife and is now in danger of losing his daughter.  Although he is the prime suspect he becomes involved with a psychologist called in by the Police.  This role was picked up by Christophe's then wife Diane Lane who not only coped well with the character but also with a wellrehearsed bedroom scene.  A case of 'truth being stranger than fiction'?Like many of Christophe's films this one relies heavily on explaining the psychology of the killer even if it is only in laymen's terms but it does deal with complex issues of responsibility and duress.  The photography is a juxtaposition of European noir sur blanc and British thriller with a little American 'homegrown' logic thrown in for good effect. Tom Skerritt is disappointing as the chief of police a role that he plays woodenly.  He is upstaged by his sidekick Daniel Baldwin.  Jeremy is portrayed by Ferdinand Mayne an actor well known to filmgoing audiences with over 120 roles to his credit before his death in 1998.Although this film was not initially well received its continued presence on the 'Pick of the week' shelf at the video store proves that it may well become a 'cult' film.  It is often in the top100rentals slot in many countries and it seems to appeal to a diverse range of people.  While some of the supporting cast need acting lessons its camera work and well coordinated plot make this an original and enjoyable 'whodunnit'...and you really will be guessing to the end.".

	schema:headline " Hidden treasure everyone mildly interested in mysteryaction films should see it !";
	schema:reviewBody "During a big chess tournament a chain of brutal murders occurs. The victims are thoroughly young attractive females who are not related anyway . The murder is always executed in a ritual way and the killer leaves a message on the wall of the room written of course with blood . The police are puzzled since this clever psychopath is obviously not a freak worshiper of satanism or any other cult . Instead he seems to be a sadistic calculating killer who not only has an unspecified goal but is so hideous that he likes to show himself off and drag the police officers to a cat and mouse game  challenging them to find him . The chief suspect for the gory killings is Peter Sanderson Christopher Lambert a player in the tournament. Despite his young age  Sanderson is one of the most skillful and acclaimed professional chess players . Right after the first bloodbath  Sanderson starts receiving harassing phone calls from the killer who not only threatens his life but teases Sanderson to find his identity . Two detectives played by Tom Skerritt and Daniel Baldwin and 1 criminal psychologist Diane Lane cooperate with Sanderson in order to link the dots and trace the killer . It is quite possible that the insane butcher is an envious antagonist of Sanderson in chess from the past . But who can it be ? Sanderson has played numerous chess games and has faced many famous players . Surely a great amount has obviously injured egos because Sanderson won them but which one of them snapped ? . Unfortunately the threatening phone calls do not narrow the suspicions about his innocence . The police seem to believe that the deaths come as the result of the actions of Sanderson and a partner . What is the truth ?          This is one of the most atmospheric detective thrillers of the 90 s . Despite a noname director and a noname writer Knight Moves' proves that professional filmmaking can be achieved with the talented work of the proper technicians direction of photography  scenery setting etc and a well written intelligent script . The plot seems to be a combination of Seven 1995 and The Game 1997 . Seven is reminiscent not only scriptwise but the dark  rainy and dreary atmosphere is inherent in the directorial look . Well how do you know ! Knight Moves is actually a predecessor to these movies !  I believe David Fincher owes a great thank you to this film  Just because it doesnt have major star power doesnt mean it should be left unnoticed . Few people know the existence of this wonderful thriller and in my opinion it is not fair for this little gem to be forgotten or overlooked . It is probably Christopher Lambert s best movie and a setup for many other crime mysteries which followed in the decade . So if you like whodunits I can assure you that this is one of the best samples.           The cinematography is dark and moody and it helps giving an ominous air to the screen . The sets are perfect for the claustrophobic threatening tone even in scenes with large halls like where the tournament is being conducted . The music and sound effects are also successful and contribute quite nicely to the creepiness of the movie like the thunders during the storm. Aside from the great direction the basis of the film is a great screenplay with enough plot twists to keep the viewer hooked to the premise . All these surprises build up the tension  leading to a heart pumping final 20 minutes period and deliver a superb climax which you will remember for a long long time . There is a negative point though  Knight Moves belongs to a strange category of films which should be viewed only once and then left with fond memories . This means that your second viewing may come as a great disappointment since you already know what will come . Another minor flaw is that the killer s motive is clear from the very first scene . It is however difficult finding the adult now psychopath and the shrewdness of the director is that he manipulates us to forget the initial scene and concentrate on the twists and the red herrings that the screenwriter has staged for us . It is a truly fascinating modernization of the Hitchcockian tradition as we enter a tunnel only to be allowed' later to find the light that was always there.               The acting is for the most part passable . Lambert plays solidly and gives a legitimate hero as an everyday guy who gets caught in a paranoid game . He is not the gorgeous poster model or the beefed up tough man . Tom Skerritt plays one of the most wooden and mundane police officers I have ever seen in a film . He is always neutral and cool tempered without catchy gags or profanity . This may render his presence almost invisible  but I believe the realistic approach is achieved here  since most officers are quite indifferent and inert in reality . All they are willing to do is arrive at the scene AFTER the crime and take fingerprints . On the contrary Daniel Baldwin the most obscure of the clan is the younger and more aggressive detective and his performance is a pleasant surprise . He believes that Sanderson is actually himself the accomplice who wants to fool them out . He exhales so much anger against Lambert  s character that at many points the two of them nearly duke it out with their fists . It is quite original for a movie of this kind since the detectives usually form a harmonic alliance with the lead a la Copycat . Baldwin s and Lambert s stormy chemistry chips in the building of more tension and nerve . Diane Lane is the psychologist who halfway forms a predictable affair with Sanderson . She and Lambert were married at the time and it is funny to see their chemistry transferred on the celluloid . Further than the obligatory love interest Lane performs another difficult task . She manages to survive an underwritten role and she gives the best performance of the entire cast . For once again she proves herself a dynamic personality who captures the audience s attention. At short periods she temporarily becomes the lead herself ! Another exhibit for her pivotal screen presence is Judge Dredd' . Very few times indeed has Hollywood given us active female roles who are not decorative co  stars . The actor who plays the killer appears shortly a la Kevin Spacey in Seven or William McNamara in Copycat but is also quite good. The phone calls he makes with a special voice changer  make him sound like a distorted pervert and will certainly send chills down your spinal column . This is the most scary aspect of the film which pulls up the agony even more . The paranoid is a very sinister person and his chilling voice enhances the demonic threat which suspends above the heads of the leads and every other person who attends the tournament .               It is worth purchasing this exceptional mystery game . It is not simply a popcorn light movie just for the amusement of it . On the contrary Knight Moves' is a professionally constructed mind trap which has terrifically escalating suspense and an explosive finale . Rent it  see it preferably after midnight and don t forget to dim the lights . The final part of the movie will certainly leave you breathless . A small independent masterpiece Knight Moves' deserves far more recognition than it has got . If you like crime puzzles this is one of the best you can find.KNIGHT MOVES             8.5  10".

Very few times indeed has Hollywood given us active female roles who are not decorative co  stars . The actor who plays the killer appears shortly a la Kevin Spacey in Seven or William McNamara in Copycat but is also quite good. The phone calls he makes with a special voice changer  make him sound like a distorted pervert and will certainly send chills down your spinal column . This is the most scary aspect of the film which pulls up the agony even more . The paranoid is a very sinister person and his chilling voice enhances the demonic threat which suspends above the heads of the leads and every other person who attends the tournament .               It is worth purchasing this exceptional mystery game . It is not simply a popcorn light movie just for the amusement of it . On the contrary Knight Moves' is a professionally constructed mind trap which has terrifically escalating suspense and an explosive finale . Rent it  see it preferably after midnight and don t forget to dim the lights . The final part of the movie will certainly leave you breathless . A small independent masterpiece Knight Moves' deserves far more recognition than it has got . If you like crime puzzles this is one of the best you can find.KNIGHT MOVES             8.5  10";

	schema:reviewBody "On the advice of some the comments I read here on the IMDB site I picked up a 4.99 on sale wide screen DVD of this film. This film is an outstanding and extremely well written dark disturbing murder thriller. I was amazed not expecting it to be this good! It does remind me a lot of the early 1970's Dario Argento films with it's black gloved razor blade clutching killer oddball characters and film style. Set on an isolated island off the coast of British Columbia during a world chess championship the killer is murdering the locals leaving scrawled blood drenched clues above their beds as he murders by chess moves. Christopher Lambert is one of the eccentric chess players drawn into the mystery who mayor may nothimself be the culprit. The clues in this movie stand up for any mystery lover and it was fun to try to solve the riddles presented and figure out whodunit. This is definately Lambert's best film role as he delivers a feverish performance. Last 20 minutes you will be on the edge of your seat as the film rushes to it's chilling and VERY exciting finale. The final camera flash shot see the film then you will know what I am referring too and last line spoken was a brilliant way to end this really great mystery thriller. This film was only fairly received upon it's initial release and most people have never even heard of it. I recommend this movie very highly for those who like an intelligent mystery that relies on mood stylish directing and a well written script. 1010 this movie blew me away!".

	schema:headline " Excellent Suspense Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "A psychopath uses the game of chess as a blueprint for a series of brutal murders in this stylish 1992 film directed by Carl Schenkel. Cinematography sound effects scary music and sparse dialogue combine to create an atmosphere of terror suggestive of the giallos of Dario Argento.We see the killer's black gloved hands we see the flashlight shining in the darkened room of the next victim we hear the killer's breathing through a mask.  And in these scenes absence of dialogue amplifies the surreal menacing presence of the killer.Suspense scenes alternate with scenes of mundane normalcy which gives the viewer a chance to select the murderer from a pool of suspects whose behavior appear more or less normal.  But beware there are plenty of plot twists and false clues.  The whodunit element kept me guessing and unsure the film's suspense kept me fully engaged.Acting quality is average.  Diane Lane gives perhaps the most convincing performance of the bunch.  My main criticism is the screenplay.  In any murder mystery the viewer needs enough information to have a fair chance at solving the whodunit puzzle.  But in Knight Moves crucial details are left out.  Also several characters are poorly defined we know almost nothing about them.  Moreover in several key scenes the behavior of one of the main characters is not credible given the story's underlying premise.As a result it's going to be almost impossible for the viewer to identify the killer based solely on the plot.  A script rewrite with more emphasis on character development combined with the deletion of superfluous scenes would I think have made for a more satisfying whodunit puzzle.Even so I recommend Knight Moves as a most frightening and spinetingling suspense thriller.  For maximum effect try watching it alone in a mansion at night with the lights turned out during a thunderstorm.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Sanderson is a chess master in town for a major tournament. After visiting her and having sex with her Sanderson's casual lover is murdered and left in a strange pose. The police suspect him as the person who was with her moments before her death but things are confused when Sanderson is contacted by the killer wishing to play a game with him. The murders continue as Sanderson and the police try to outsmart the killer  however clues still indicate that Sanderson could still be a suspect himself.There are very few thrillers that would chose to set themselves in the world of grandmaster chess as the basis for their plot and even fewer that would manage to pull it off convincingly this film falls into the former but not the latter. The plot only really uses chess as the background so that it can make a rather tenuous link between that game and the game that is played between Sanderson and the killer. This basic plot is interesting enough even if it doesn't really stand out from the basic videothriller genre that the chess connection suggests it is better than. The chess connection doesn't really work as it doesn't actually fit in with the murders very well  feeling forced quite a lot certainly the whole chess championship is just a side issue and the film never manages to actually convince that this is a battle of wits in fact the police do most of the leg work and Peter only occasionally blurts out the odd 'Eureka in the bathtub' line.The solution is semiclever in that I realized that the film had tricked me from the first scene onwards but despite this fact the identity of the killer is as outoftheblue and you would expect it to be. The film is littered with minor characters who jump out of shadows appear at suspicious times or say menacing things under their breath all red herrings of course but most of them are not explained and it is obvious the writer never thought about whether or not they made sense in any context other than them being red herrings. Having said that the film is enjoyable but mainly as a genre film rather than anything clever or particularly inventive. The lack of a really clever cat'n'mouse game was a letdown for me because of the potential that the chess connection had suggested.The cast are a fairly average mix that contribute to the feeling that this is a genre film rather than anything particularly clever. Lambert has had a very mixed career and this is just another strange role that he doesn't play that well  certainly the words 'Lambert' and 'chess master' are words that words that don't seem to naturally appear together. Sticking with the clichs of both the genre and Lambert films we get the obligatory love scene twice! that have little relevance but gives the film the added selling point of breasts! Skerrit and Baldwin are better than the rest of the cast even with poor characters  the two of them control each scene they are in and make the film feel better than it is.Overall the title and background suggest a clever game of wits between a chess master and the killer but it doesn't manage to be anything more than an OK genre film. The twist is out of the blue as always but getting there is quite fun and the end result is a film that is enjoyable but quite unspectacular.".

Though it's a common serial killer story with some wellknown features like a murderer playing cats and dogs with the police a guy being involved into the crimes meeting a femme fatale and a series of ritual murders with hints to an incident in the past it's very thrilling and entertaining.The setting is very interesting being a small tourist island in the fall as a background for a deadly chess tournament. The murder scenes are not that gory but scary and breathtaking. The final showdown between Lambert and the villain is a rollercoaster ride with some nice twists and fight sequences. Watch out for this dark and fascinating serial killer movie.".

But rather than helping he chooses to open up the night stand by the bed and pulls out the chessboard that he had been deprived of and calmly helps himself to some milk and cookies before beginning a new game. The scene then shifts to twenty years later with a European Grandmaster named Peter Sanderson Christopher Lambert participating in a tournament when his lover is found in bed totally drained of blood with a sign above her body saying Remember. And because of his connection to this woman Peter Sanderson is a prime suspect. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie for the most part with both Christopher Lambert and Diane Lane as Kathy Sheppard performing in a fine manner. I especially liked the way in which the mystery was sustained up until the final moments. On the other hand the way some of the chess players were depicted as being mentally unstable was somewhat overdone. Neither did I care for the rather obvious allusions to Bobby Fischer in the introduction of Peter Sanderson. Even so I still enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

Of course Saw is a lot more elaborated and well produced than this but I won't deny this film has brought a nice idea to the genre. Unfortunetaly there is in fact a little of bad acting in this 90's hidden project nobody seems to be acting naturally in the character they've been given. Maybe a better director or casting director would have made something better about it. Knight Moves has eventually a good ending that makes you feel a little happy mainly because Sanderson doesn't turn out to be the monster that policemen were saying so I can state it's a regular thriller deserved to be seen. Just don't get mad with the occasional bad acting and the poor photography directing and you'll probably have a good time.".

The film almost plays like a precursor to Seven and the other serial killer teasing the police with riddles thrillers that followed.

It's a mate in 5 for black if played correctly by both sides correctly meaning that white plays to avoid mate as long as possible. The problem I see is that Lambert's coach suggests he can win with a mate in 5 and misses it. But Lambert is playing WHITE. His rook move to c2 is correct but only in the sense that's the best move to delay an already lost game. The coach seems to imply HE can win the game otherwise why say he missed it?

His rook move to c2 is correct but only in the sense that's the best move to delay an already lost game. The coach seems to imply HE can win the game otherwise why say he missed it? But he can't win his game is already lost.";

Jane was by far the most famous when she performed with their father in vaudeville but as they got older it was Blanche who became the finer actress which Jane still resents. Blanche is now confined to a wheelchair and Jane is firmly in control. As time goes by Jane exercises greater and greater control over her sister intercepting her letters and ensuring that few if anyone from the outside has any contact with her. As Jane slowly loses her mind she torments her sister going to ever greater extremes.";

All this in great part due to Feud Jessica Lange's performance as Joan Crawford is already for me in a pantheon of its own. There is not a moment in which the illusion falters and this is more true episode after episode. Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis is also superb but her character is the more educated stronger. A Yankee. So she provokes a very different kind of emotion. To all fans of the actresses and of Baby Jane you can't afford to miss Feud and please give it a couple of episodes to adjust but once you get to the third episode Mommie Dearest you'll be hooked in the greatest possible way.

Not to worry about income because when she became a teen her younger sister Blanche played by Joan Crawford then became the family breadwinner. But that came to an end when she was crippled in a car crash and it was widely believed that her sister had deliberately used the car as a weapon of jealousy.So these two with everything and yet nothing in common are bound to the family house and each other. Crawford a prisoner in her wheelchair and Davis a prisoner of her own fantasies as she retreats gradually into her childhood and glory days.Crawford is seeing how Davis is becoming more and more unhinged and decides to sell the family estate and get Davis into the 1962 equivalent of Happydale. But Davis gets wind of the plan and she makes Crawford a prisoner in her own home and eventually Davis just loses it totally.The wrap up of shooting must have been a day celebrated by Robert Aldrich on each anniversary the rest of his life. But he got himself a film that's as fascinating as a bloody 20 car pile up on the Interstate. Whatever Happened To Baby Jane got an Oscar for costume design for a black and white film and four other nominations.One of those nominations was for Best Actress a then record 10 of them for Bette Davis in the title role. Bette Davis was an actress who could make some mediocre films entertaining when she took the brakes off. Here the role called for the most outrageous kind of overacting and Bette made the most of it. Joan's more subdued role of the victim in this film good as she was didn't have a chance next to Bette's for recognition. Of course Crawford legendarily took a perverse pleasure in being the honorary acceptor for Anne Bancroft when she won the Oscar for Best Actress for The Miracle Worker in 1962. Truth be told Anne was the Best Actress that year.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is such a two woman film that the rest of the cast is just left in the dust. Another miracle occurred when Victor Buono received some recognition with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as the mother fixated pianist who plays along with Bette Davis when she decides to revive her career. Of course the strange noises and doings in that house eventually creep him out. Buono's scenes are all with Davis and with the scene stealing Marjorie Bennett who's kind of a mirror image of Baby Jane Hudson as Buono's inebriated mother. Just holding his own with these two I'm figuring the Academy figured Buono deserved some recognition.Bette and Joan both were destined to be trapped in mediocrity for the most part in roles well beneath their talents. Bette to her credit did escape with such things as an Agatha Christie mystery occasionally and The Whales Of August. But mostly she and Joan did horror flicks because of the impression that Whatever Happened To Baby Jane left on the minds of the moviegoing public. Both also got unceremoniously dissed by their daughters in memoirs Bette not having the decency to die before B.D. Hyman's book came out.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane as repulsively fascinating as it is is a testament to two screen legends and the stamina of director Robert Aldrich who got them to share the screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? might seem dated but it is still an extremely riveting watch. I literally could not look away as soon as the movie started I couldn't stop until it had finished. Not a lot of movies can do that to me. The acting is extremely good Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are just so good as the main focus of the movie. The chilling score is suits the movie and the camerawork reminds me a lot of Hitchcock.The story focuses on two sisters Blanche Hudson Joan Crawford who was crippled in an accident awhile ago and Baby Jane Hudson Bette Davis. Jane used to be a big child star she even had a doll brand after her. Now though she is no longer recognised while her sister has recently become very famous. They live in an old mansion with Blanche confined to her room upstairs while Jane gets madder and more cruel by the day.Bette Davis gives the star performance here some may call it overacting but it is far from. She really makes Jane as mad cruel and sad as possible. Joan Crawford is equally good in a very different role. She is much more timid then Jane and quite scared. The supporting cast are all good as well especially Victor Buono as Victor Flagg an odd pianist that befriends Jane. The black and white really are used to full effect they make the mansion look extra creepy. Robert Aldrich's direction is fine.To today's modern audience this may seem boring as it does not have any action. Most of the movie is dialogue but I do urge those who haven't seen it to do so as it is a truly excellent movie.A solid 55!".

I literally could not look away as soon as the movie started I couldn't stop until it had finished. Not a lot of movies can do that to me. The acting is extremely good Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are just so good as the main focus of the movie. The chilling score is suits the movie and the camerawork reminds me a lot of Hitchcock.The story focuses on two sisters Blanche Hudson Joan Crawford who was crippled in an accident awhile ago and Baby Jane Hudson Bette Davis.

And she should have won it!  There was a lot of 'history' between Miss Davis and Miss Crawford going way back to the 1940s when Crawford was let go from MGM and went to work at WB where Bette Davis was Queen of the lot.  The stories behind the making of the film are as interesting as the movie with Miss Crawford demanding the set be kept at a breezy 55 but preservative degrees causing all kinds of problems with Miss Davis's bronchitis.  One only wonders how much 'acting' was involved as Miss Davis tortures Miss Crawford emotionally and later physically.  Miss Crawford suffers grandly and has her mandatory telephone scene big eyes tremulous with fear.  She is great but it is a Bette Davis tourdeforce and she wipes every other actor off the screen.  Full 10 of 10 for this one and recommended to everyone who wants to see what the great actresses of the 1930s and 1940s could and would still do albeit in minorA productions as the requests for their services dwindled but wanted to keep on working.".

An interesting story a well delivered screenplay and an accurate musical score also rise the film high.But the main credit of the picture is casting together to real big names in Hollywood's history not at their peak then but always reliable and attractive to see. Bette Davis Jane takes the most interesting character as the former child star that couldn't make it as an adult in show business so she has gone insane and keeps behaving as the spoiled child he was. She looks grotesque and ridiculous in her child outfits hairdo and heavy make up. Davis is outstanding in her role and looks really mean when she tortures both mentally and physically her sister Blanche delicate and reasonable. Joan Crawford plays Blanche and very well too a former big star whose career ended after a strange car accident that put her on a wheel chair for life.In the end things are not completely as they seem but the final twist is not what makes this film an extremely good one it's the strange relationship between the sisters that requires of that final twist to understand Blanche's tolerant conduct towards her sister.The movie is perhaps a little too long and it would probably have been even better with a 10 minutes cut.

	schema:headline " Sibling Rivalry Between Hollywood's Leading Ladies  At A Macabre Level.";
	schema:reviewBody "What Ever Happened To Baby Jane is a tense horror film yet it seems almost comical at the same time. The story is about Baby Jane Hudson a former child Vaudeville star who has now grown older and been shyed away from the spotlight and attention that she so dearly loved. Baby Jane has a sister Blanche who is now crippled and restrained to a wheelchair. But before becoming immobile Blanche was once a movie queen herself and she incidentally pushed her sister out of the spotlight which ignited extreme jealousy from Baby Jane. Now Baby Jane spends most of her time in a crumbling Hollywood mansion taking care of her sister. She plays mean and dirty tricks on her even going as far as to preparing Blanche a dead rat on her lunch platter and brutally beating her when she tries to phone for help keeping Blanche contained within the walls of their home. Baby Jane lives in a world of false hope thinking that she may be able to reprise her childhood career putting on makeup and keeping her curly hair intact. But Baby Jane's continued jealousy burns on as Blanche's popular films are rerun on television and her violent twisted and abusive side begins to come forth.The entire film surrounds the two sisters as they fight back and forth doing horrible things to each other. It's like a grownup case of sibling rivalry between two of Hollywood's leading women that turns out to be very well crafted and interesting to watch. Both Davis and Crawford Hollywood legends give top quality performances and bring depth and dimension to the characters of Baby Jane and Blanche. Granted there is no shock value in this film anymore because it has become so dated but it is still worth the while to watch because of how interesting it is to watch both actresses interact with one another. Davis plays the mad Jane with perfect mannerisms and eerie hysterical expressions as she torments her sister costumed in ghostly white caked makeup and golden curls in her hair.It is kind of ironic because it has been speculated that Davis and Crawford really despised each other behind camera they were both major award winners with legendary status in cinema practically rivals themselves which could have played into the way they treated each other in the film... or maybe not? I'd say it was very likely though. To sum it up this review What Ever Happened To Baby Jane is a dated but exceptionallycrafted thriller. Modern day audiences will not be frightened but the film itself was very very well done. 910.".

Granted there is no shock value in this film anymore because it has become so dated but it is still worth the while to watch because of how interesting it is to watch both actresses interact with one another. Davis plays the mad Jane with perfect mannerisms and eerie hysterical expressions as she torments her sister costumed in ghostly white caked makeup and golden curls in her hair.It is kind of ironic because it has been speculated that Davis and Crawford really despised each other behind camera they were both major award winners with legendary status in cinema practically rivals themselves which could have played into the way they treated each other in the film... or maybe not? I'd say it was very likely though. To sum it up this review What Ever Happened To Baby Jane is a dated but exceptionallycrafted thriller. Modern day audiences will not be frightened but the film itself was very very well done. 910.";

I wouldn't really say this is a straight horror movie like Psycho or The Birds as it unfolds itself like a riveting drama of two sisters instead. The acting is phenomenal though at least from our two lead characters and the way they play off each other is just fantastic. This one takes a while to get going but once it does you are in for a highoctane creepy thrill ride. Recommended to fans of older horrorsuspense type movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is there a more surreal image in cinema than the sight of Bette Davis dragging Joan Crawford across the floor by her arm? And this right after using Ms. Crawford for a soccer ball in a truly chilling scene. This movie is unlike so many classics you're likely to run across not quite a horror film but creepy enough to straddle that genre with a peculiar fit. I'm sorry now I waited so long to watch it.Davis and Crawford share about equal screen time and it would be hard to score one's performance over the other. But without question Davis is pure hag in this one a bitch on wheels who takes glee in tormenting her sister due to the reversal in their career fortunes. The film will keep you off balance wondering why Blanche Hudson Crawford seems to continually make excuses for Baby Jane's Davis rude behavior especially when as a child she sets up the viewer for revenge with a remark she makes to their mother  You bet I won't forget. It's not till the end of the story that Blanche makes her confession but by then you've placed all your sympathies with her.As for creepy you would think a dead bird in the lunch tray is tops in macabre but only until Jane outdoes herself with a rat from the cellar. There's something about dead birds in film that arouses a primal gut level response. It was used as a device in 1944's The Curse of the Cat People and more recently in the German film The White Ribbon 2009. Maybe it's just me but the imagery is truly frightening and enough it seems to send one's victim over the edge. It certainly did here.What drove this viewer over the edge though was the adult Jane Hudson's version of 'I've Written a Letter to Daddy'! It was barely tolerable when the youthful Baby Jane sang it on stage but Davis's performance was fingernails on chalkboard. That scene might just be worth waiting the entire picture for notwithstanding the violent confrontation between Davis and Crawford near the finale.But the best is the twist ending that you never see coming as Blanche Hudson makes her dying confession on the beach. While the entire time the picture has you sucked in about what a hate filled woman Baby Jane has become it's not until Blanche sets the record straight about the accident that ended her career. You have to wonder who was the more bitter woman as Blanche tells Jane  You weren't ugly then. I made you that way.".

No one young and alive at that time knew who they were nor did they have an interest in their all but dead careers. New stars were on the rise sensibilities were changing movies were starting to rely less on star power and taking risks with lesser known actors who did not convey the typical Hollywood image. New directors were also the hot ticket and had little time or patience to deal with the vitriolic antics of temperamental females who threw their ego around like they would do with a small object in the heat of an argument. It was the start of the end of the American innocence.And innocence lost is what seems to be the central theme of Robert Aldrich's Gothic horror movie WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? The story of two sisters living in complete isolation from the rest of the world hating each other every from dusk 'til dawn and harboring a deadly secret that could kill them is not the kind of material anyone would associate the two lead actresses with but by then their choices in scripts were precious few both had begun to take baby steps in television  considered by many actors to be a step down in their careers  and both needed the work to pay the bills. When Crawford got her hands on the book she decided to turn it into a movie because it would give her a chance to work with the actress she admired the most even when such admiration was rebuffed with brutal aggression and had turned into hatred.Enlisting Robert Aldrich who had directed her in AUTUMN LEAVES and with whom Crawford had had an affair with and securing Davis in the role of the more dominant sister cinema history was made when for the first time audiences got to see both actresses essay not only their character counterparts but relive their extreme morbid antipathy against each other. Reports of tension on the set flew like wildfire for the first time since Miriam Hopkins Bette Davis was up against the only other female whom she did not particularly like. Crawford knew she would have to compete in many other ways  salary and dressing room included  to make her experience with the strongerwilled Davis bearable. But... Crawford must have known what she was getting into when you express such admiration for someone who does not respond back and force yourself into a project with that person anything can happen.Despite the belief of a feud both actresses expressed getting along quite well together. Of course Davis added that had they worked for three months instead of three weeks the result would have been much different. It is interesting however to see how they play against each other scene by scene Davis overacts to almost impossible degrees and without knowing makes Crawford come off better. It was like seeing Mildred Rogers meeting Mildred Pierce for a perverse faceoff and it is also interesting to see that the wig Davis wears bears a resemblance to the way she wore her hair in OF HUMAN BONDAGE to some degree the same way the resemblance to Crawford as Blanche to her anterior character is striking.As a movie WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a lesser sister film to SUNSET BLVD. but also a precursor to Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's MISERY with the genders reversed. It did pave the way for a subgenre within the horror genre featuring older women in exaggerated Gothic stories of murder and mayhem and on that alone it does deserve that accolade. It also became something of a distant relation to the works of David Lynch in its willingness to depict an inherent weirdness within the sadomasochistic codependent relationship between the sisters. At times a little exploitative at times gripping and at times flat out funny WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? was yet another triumph in both Crawford's and Davis' careers with an Oscar nomination for Davis an Oscar snub for Crawford and increased tension between the two women. Both were slated to appear in a followup movie that became HUSH HUSH... SWEET CHARLOTTE in 1964 but because of medical reasons Crawford had to bow out leaving Davis' old friend Olivia deHaviland to step in. Neither actress would ever work together again. Crawford's career would come to an end not 8 years later in 1970 following a string of grade F horror movies a shortened version of what has become Karen Black's career whereas Davis would successfully alternate the remainder of the Sixties and all throughout the Seventies and Eighties between OK horror movies TV dramas where she would get Emmy nominations and even a pilot for a series costarring friend Anne Baxter. As it is this remains a blueprint for actors who have been known to despise each other working together and making their mutual animosity the stuff of high camp and egotistical overacting.".

As it is this remains a blueprint for actors who have been known to despise each other working together and making their mutual animosity the stuff of high camp and egotistical overacting.";

	schema:reviewBody "I recently viewed this film with a friend who had never seen it before. Much to my surprise we had to turn it off early because this friend actually found Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? boring.   I'll admit that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a dated piece of work. By today's standards there is no shock value.  The actresses are not well known by the younger crowds out there.  There is a lot of dialogue and very little action. It simply doesn't fit in with today's expectations of horror and suspense.  So why does it hold up as a great film at least by my standards and by the standards of so many others?To truly appreciate this film it would be necessary to understand the background.  What actually contributed to the making of this film is what I find truly fascinating.  The story itself is about two elderly sisters.  One Baby Jane played by Bette Davis was a child star in the early part of the century.  She was hugely popular on the vaudeville circuit. Backstage she was a spoiled brat. Later on in life the other sister Blanche played by Joan Crawford became a popular Hollywood movie star overshadowing her now 'hasbeen' sister.  A supposed car accident leaves Blanche crippled during the height of her popularity and a crazed Jane is left to care for her.In their later life Blanche is confined to her bedroom and Jane still donning the make up and curls from her childhood runs the house.  Jane still believes she can resurect her career but is tormented by her sisters continued popularity as her films are rerun on television.There are some fabulous lines throughout the movie that have become legendary.  Blanche says You couldn't do this to me if I wasn't in this wheel chair.'  Jane quips But ya are Blanche but ya are.Davis plays Jane to the hilt looking hysterically eerie as she tortures Crawford's stoic Blanche.  My kid sister saw this film after seeing Mommie Dearest and aptly stated that this was just dessert for a woman who beat her children so badly.  I think my sister was most impressed when Davis kicks Joan in the stomach.  Take that Mommie Dearest!Back to my original point I believe that in order to truly appreciate this story one must appreciate the behindthescenes legend that truly is the essence of this film.  Davis and Crawford were and are two of the most formidable actresses in Hollywood.  Between them there are hundreds of films three Oscars and countless tidbits of gossip.  Both had to claw and chew their way to the top and had to fight harder to stay there.  They both had stormy relationships and bitter feuds with studio bosses and directors. And both have a legion of fans that have survived long after they did.  And of course lets not forget the fact that they may have despised each other. There is a fantastic book called Bette and Joan I can't recall the author's name that I recommend any novice viewer read prior to viewing this film. In it the lives of these two remarkable women are described in gossipy detail.  A lot of time is spent detailing the making of this film. At the time Joan was pushing her husbands company Pepsi.  It was rumored perhaps by Bette that her Pepsi bottles were half filled with vodka.  Bette also complains vehemently about the size of Joan's fake cleavage and how they got in the way of some of those scenes.  It's even suggested that some of those beatings that Joan took from Bette were real.  With all of this background one might soon appreciate as I did the importance of this film in documenting the lives of these two prominent women.  I don't think we'll ever come so close to true Hollywood Babylon as we will with this brilliant work.".

Of course Goldie's Molly McGrath meets the obvious resentments from high school boys that you would expect finding out their new coach is a woman but she does eventually win them over even at the risk of losing custody of her two daughters to her uptight exhusband James Keach. Nothing new or inventive here but Goldie lights up the screen presenting a smart yet flawed character trying to live her dream. Nipsey Russell has one of the best roles of his career as the principal of the school that hires her and there are some very funny moments provided by the members of the team especially Woody Harrelson Nick Corri and in a starmaking turn a very young Wesley Snipes. Bruce McGill scores as a sexist coach from the opposing school Prescott and Jan Hooks has some cute moments as GOldie's exhusband's new girlfriend. I love the scene where Goldie outruns the boys on the team and calls them pussies and the rap song over the closing credits is hysterically funny.

Goldie's team kidnaps the rival school's mascot a goat.  When principal Nipsey Russell invades the locker room and asks You all wouldn't happen to know what happen to the Cougar's goat would you? The goat hidden in a locker starts to baaaaah which prompts Goldie to simultaneously reply Naaaaah!    See?  Hysterical!Fans of Jan Hooks like me will love her turn here as the uppitty stickupthebutt wife of Goldie's ex.  Fans of Woody Harrelson should note that a brief cameo is made here by his bare butt.  Fans of Swoosie Kurtz should contemplate bathing with downed powerlines.  Just kiddin' she's good too.TEN!  1 point for the fat guy 1 point for flatulence 1 point for LL Cool J's lamest rap ever. The rest of the points go to Goldie.  Goldie rocks.Love your pussies";

It is really a funny cute movie.First let me say I am not a fan of football movies however I have enjoyed movies such as THE LONGEST YARD NORTH DALLAS FORTY and AGAINST ALL ODDS to name a few where an interesting story and characters add life to an otherwise sports film. Yes the football scenes are fun to watch but what makes the movie truly watchable is the feeling Goldie adds to her character like in PRIVATE BENJAMIN plus the developing struggle between her exhusband concerning her new career and raising of her children. Its predictable in many ways but hey it was nice to watch a movie that made me feel happy for a change rather than depressed or confused as so many contemporary movies seem to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1980's there wasn't a bigger female comedy star than Goldie Hawn. She excelled at playing the 'fish out of water' character in films like 'Private Benjamin' 'Protocol' and 'Overboard.' 'Wildcats' has the same formula those films had only instead of the Army Washington DC or abject poverty Goldie finds herself coaching football.Here Goldie plays Molly a divorced mother of two who has always dreamed of coaching a football team. But throughout her coaching career all she's been allowed to do was coach female track and field. When Molly gets the opportunity to take a head coaching job in an inner city school she jumps at the chance. When she arrives at the school she is faced by a disorganized and disrespectful team of players. They don't want her as their coach but she sticks to her guns and she fights to gain their respect and obedience.Of all the comedies that Goldie has starred in this isn't one of her best. She's still great in this but the film is overlong bogged down by a buzz killing custody storyline with her schmuck exhusband Keach and her two kids. There's also a lot of unfunny 'fart humor' on display but thankfully not from Goldie's character.But when the film is good it's good. Besides the custody storyline things move at a brisk fun pace. It's fun to watch Goldie work to get the team to see eye to eye with her or hunt down the truant quarterback in the ghetto and almost get herself caught up in a robbery or hide a rival teams goat mascot in the locker room.This isn't really heavy stuff here but it is a fun 80's comedy with a great star doing what she does best. So if you're a fan of Goldie Hawn and 80's comedies check this out.".

Her mission in getting her team in shape to end their winning games drought is captivating as is the supporting subplot of her homelife when she tries to retain custody of her two daughters from her uptight exhusband Frank James Keech.The plot is a bit predictable but Goldie Hawn provides enough drama wit and humor to keep the movie engaging as does the football players. I enjoy the scenes where Molly tries to gain their respect and where she outruns the boys in a track race giving them a taste of their own medicine. The relationship between Molly and her daughters were pretty uplifting and she shows that balancing life between family and a career is entirely capable. A great feelgood sports comedy.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is what I'm talking' about back in the day the sizzling mid 80's when films were loud bad mad rude and crazy...and lets not forget about the adult flicks too huh...zing!. This was a firm favourite when I was a kid back then I only ever saw the cut TV version though still worked even though it was cut.A seriously young and fit looking Goldie Hawn wants to coach football. She was brought up on the game by her father she knows the game inside out from him and she knows it. But women don't do these things you can't have a girl coach a team of young laddish lads. Never the less she is given the opportunity to do just that for a gritty rundown urban innercity school. Will she succeed in her new role or crack and quit?.No this certainly isn't a sports drama this is a badass comedy the America football version of 'Major League' if you will although Major League copied the idea I'm sure. The whole premise is cheesy and clichd by today's standards but back in the day this type of thing was reasonably fresh. The plot is totally run of the mill don't go expecting anything new here like I said its 'Major League' for football that's all you need to know. The underdogs are a bunch of uneducated dropouts who care more about goofing off and getting up to no good. Hawn comes along to coach they reject her and try to get rid of her she wins them over she proves she can coach the players respect her and follow her they start winning games the team becomes a force to be reckoned with they reach the championship against the toughest team coached by Hawn's rival...annnd they win. Simple effective basic formula used by virtually every sports flick ever. Most of the team are unknowns to me but I'm sure many fans will know this film was the debut for both Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes. Snipes of course was also in 'Major League' and kinda plays the same character really its almost like the beginnings for 'Willie Mayes Hayes'. But the film doesn't revolve around those guys there is a whole team of young actors that all make this film work in a surprisingly funny way. There are some great characters here. 'Cerulo' is a real Travolta lookin' greaser with that urban Noo Yawk accent 'Marvel' is standoffish and strong but gets turned around 'Bird' is the truant criminal who is also the schools best player and Tab Thacker is the fat guy because you always gotta have a fat guy. Much kudos to Nipsey Russell as the likable principle.What sets this film apart is the brilliant all round casting of the team and...well everybody really. Even characters like the nasty rival football team coach played by Bruce McGill Hawn's kids James Keach as Hawn's estranged husband etc...they are all cheesy but well portrayed. Another element that became obvious to me was the racial divide thing. Hawn's character keeps getting pushed to coach at a posh all girls school on the rich side of town by her husband he clearly doesn't enjoy her being around all these ruffians. Also most of the other rival teams appear to mainly white guys and of course everybody on Hawn's side of town is generally white. Then you have everybody on the bad side of town where this urban school is there are rundown buildings everywhere trash lying around burnt out cars etc...and everybody seems to be black or hispanic. How could a pretty blonde white girl from the right side of town control a group of foul mouthed aggressive alcohol drinking blackhispanic youths from the wrong side of the the tracks?. There aren't any verbal references to this of course but the visuals sure as hell shove it down your throat. An amusing play on this are the Wildcat cheerleaders who are a ragtag team of about four or five black girls and the odd white girl. Funny thing is these girls are basically the ugly girls from school a bit too tubby a bit too skinny kinda nerdy and dressed like shabby trashy street hookers. Not the kind of street hookers that would tempt you. Clearly done for laughs as the cheerleaders are not the type of girls you would want doing this plus they are a simple representation of the school and the area.That might sound really controversial it certainly stands out if you ask me after a recent rewatch something I never really picked up on as a kid. But I'm guessing that was the point of the plot the aim of the game the snobs looking down their noses at the dirty poor folk. Luckily the film is so damn enjoyable you can overlook it I hope. The only real let down for me is the rather limp finish after they win the championship kinda just drops off a bit really shame.The film is a cookie cutter product not for its time though you've seen it before you've seen all the characters all the teams all the ups and downs yadda yadda yadda. Its not overly rude and its not outrageously funny its just a very rebellious cheeky feel good flick with some really good fun cheesy characters. Add to that a cracking soundtrack which accompanies some great training montages and there you have it a good time stereotypical fast food 80's football flick. 910".

	schema:headline " Decent Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Wildcats 1986  12 out of 4 Goldie Hawn plays a woman's track coach whose dream in life is to coach a football team. When her high school passes over her for being a woman she gets a job at another school but the bad news is that it's in the ghetto and none of the players respect her. The toughest part is going to be breaking through to the players and then getting them to play her way. This film seems to have been a hit when released but it doesn't hold up overly well today. I think the biggest problem is the screenplay that at times seems to forget we're watching a comedy because it dives into a subplot with Hawn's exhusband and this eats up so much of the running time that the film loses focus on trying to make us laughs. What laughs the film does try to get comes from various toilet humor which includes one player who likes to fart and another Wesley Snipes who just wants to have a piece of Hawn. The screenplay is also quite predictable as everything we see here was borrowed from previous sport films and you just know Hawn is going to get a chance at revenge in the final game in the film. What does work with the movie are the performances with Hawn giving it her all as her energy level is certainly on high and one can't help but smile seeing her going up against this opposite crowd. The supporting cast is also pretty good as we get early performances by Snipes and Woody Harrelson as well as nice work from Nipsey Russell James Keach Bruce McGill and Ann Doran in what would turn out to be her final film role she started way back in 1922. There's no question that this movie is mildly entertaining from start to finish but at the same time I couldn't help but be somewhat disappointed because we weren't given more laughs as the side story was just too much and kept going on and on. Even the surprising nude scene by Hawn seemed out of place as did quite a bit here. Still the attractive cast makes this one worth at least a rental.".

It's really more of a light drama about a woman who wants to be a football coach but isn't taken seriously by all those male chauvinists out there. So she gets her shot to coach but it's at an inner city school where the kids are mean to her. Not realistically mean of course. She isn't verbally and physically assaulted as would happen in reality. No they're mean to her by not taking her seriously or calling her 'coach.' The horrors this poor woman has to endure. Also in a tired subplot the exhusband is trying to take her kids away. Anyway it's likable fluff I guess notable mainly for being the film debuts of Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes. Goldie is rootable as ever. My main problem with it is that it's not funny in the least. There's not even much of an attempt to be funny just a few scenes where Goldie Hawn falls down. Lame.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldie Hawn the petite saucereyed actress was ideal casting in this movie. She is Molly McGrath a divorced mother of two girls who is a girls track coach but longs to be a football coach. Nobody thinks she can pull that off and she is ridiculed by the sexist football coach played by perennial slime ball Bruce McGill of Animal House fame of that high school's football team. Therefore when she gets a chance to go to another school to coach football she grabs it even though the players are less than refined and practically stink at the game.If you ask if this is a formula you are right. The underdog movie has been an American staple since the beginning of movie history. First the coach and the players must face humiliating defeat then gradually get better and then of course win the big game. All of this happens in this movie but there is also a rather unnecessary subplot involving a custody battle. It seems that Molly's exhusband James Keach thinks that she is neglecting the kids mainly because he stumbled into a party given by Molly to the football players after a victory and to top it off the oldest daughter gets drunk. Then we get a court hearing where all of the players who have found respect for their coach show up to defend her and one of them makes a pass at the judge to grease the wheels even further.All that happens in this movie is rather predictable. The only thing that is worth noticing is that Woody Harrelson Wesley Snipes and Mykelti Williamson made one of their first appearances here before Harrelson became famous as Woody Boyd and before he and Snipes were made a team in several films. Mykelti Williamson also became well known first in Midnight Caller and then as the shrimp connoisseur Bubba in Forrest Gump. There is also a small role for SNL'er and 3rd Rock from the Sun star Jan Hooks as the uptight new wife of Goldie's ex. This doesn't make Wildcats anything more than it is and Goldie's career has continued in this vein with one bright spot now and again Death becomes her had its moments.As for the director Michael Ritchie he was one of the greats. He made the original Bad News Bears and the hilarious Fletch but sadly he is no longer with us. This film ranks just below average mainly because he did so much better at other times.".

Nothing very memorable save your money.25 stars.";

I'm not talking about Cast Away meets the moon This film explores loneliness much deeper than that and with much more emotion as well. Luckily for us there are no pieces of sports equipment on which the lead dotes but instead we're blessed with a monotonous talking robotvoiced by Kevin Spacey reminiscent of Hal from 2001 notoriety.I advise that people go see this film not only to support Duncan the director and Sam but also to explore to possibilities of space and the humanity of loneliness.Don't go in expecting to find what I have discussed but go in expecting to find something inside yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon.The movie stars Sam Rockwell as a lunar astronaut also named Sam stationed alone on the Moon for three years. He isn't entirely alone because the AI computer GERTY Kevin Spacey is constantly following him. Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth. As Sam begins his last two weeks stationed in the mining facility his mind begins to break down and he soon realizes he just might not be able to make it back.It is quite obvious that the main intention of Moon was to pay respect to the older science fiction movies like Alien and 2001 A Space Odyssey and it is a great homage to the genre indeed. GERTY is possibly one of my favorite AI computers ever in a movie because it constantly shows its mood through a series of different smiley faces and has Kevin Spacey's voice. The overall story of Moon is pretty good and it definitely tugs a bit on your emotions because the main character Sam is so real and relatable. It is a bit more of an art film but I have found that the mixture of art and SciFi is a brilliant combination.The absolute key ingredient to making Moon was finding a capable actor because it is essentially a one man show and they picked a winner with Sam Rockwell. Rockwell gives one of his best performances to date and while it might be a little early to predict I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for his role. The other great thing about this picture is the special effects. Since the budget was so low this could have been a disaster but the shots of the Moon Rovers and Harvesters were astonishingly realistic and a typical movie goer would think this had at least a 40 million dollar budget. It is amazing how much more was accomplished with this tiny budget compared to the 200 million dollars poured into Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.Overall Moon is a complete film. It isn't groundbreaking but it accomplished everything it set out to be which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. I found myself leaving the theater with a great feeling of satisfaction that I have only received from a couple movies this year so far.910".

Directed by Duncan Jones Moon stars Sam  Rockwell one of our generation's most powerful actors.  The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here.  While Moon is a modernday science fiction film set in the future it  pays homage to recent classics like Blade Runner and Alien. Viewers  will be dazzled  fans of the genre will nod in approval.  Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean  energy here on earth. Private enterprise in the form of a corporation sends astronauts on a threeyear work stint to carry out  this ongoing mission. Sam Bell Rockwell is the latest to undertake  this task with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the  base's operations  think HAL with a heart. Of course things are not  what they seem and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising  events unfold.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie  stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and  slow tracking shots only using handheld when necessary. Nicolas  Gaster's editing is sure and steady emphasizing the slow pace of Sam  Bell's multiyear work assignment. Remember those preCGI days when  special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can  still be done  and be believable. Moon is evocative of the scifi  greats whose visuals were done incamera i.e. on set as opposed to  being created by computers in postproduction. Sam Bell's unearthly  home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage.  Nathan Parker's screenplay Jones wrote the story but handed over  screen writing duties to Parker makes the most of Sam Rockwell's  considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role as  well and rarely has the actor been better watch Snow Angels  though. He doesn't just carry the film  Moon is almost a oneman  show and Rockwell conducts a master class.  Moon is a classic down and dirty literally science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective entertaining and satisfying cinematic experience.".

Moon is a classic down and dirty literally science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective entertaining and satisfying cinematic experience.";

MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep scifi story that while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voiceover is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space without which the movie would not be as effective. I don't want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a scifi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay here's the basic plot without the twistspoilerPlace The moon. Time A future not long from now 2030ish I think. Sam Bell astronaut is working on a lunar base of some sort. He is the only person on the entire base only assisted by an allknowing robot called GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey. He has been stationed on the base for almost 3 years his contract nearing an end and with his flight back to earth scheduled only 14 days away he can't wait to get back home to see his wife and daughter again. However suddenly one of the automated moonvehicles harvesting rocksamples or whatever goes awry and he goes outside of the base to investigate it... but then something unexpected happens and he has to change his perspective on everything.End of basic plot summary.Bell is played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell whom you probably know from Charlie's Angels The Green Mile Confessions of a Dangerous Mind Matchstick Men or the equally brilliant scifi movies Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Galaxy Quest. This is probably his biggest part in a movie EVER and I doubt if he will ever get a role as big as this again not because he's not capable or worthy of it but because it was a HUGE performance. If you're a fan of Rockwell or perhaps of Kevin Spacey's voice then you will not be disappointed as they're both great in Moon. For scifi lovers this movie is really a blast. It takes some inspiration from such classics like 2001 A Space Odyssey Outland Silent Running Alien and others but still manages to be unique and original something which has become increasingly rare in the recent bigbudgetmassive special effectsquick fixtradition of Hollywood nowadays. Moon achieved something great for a budget of approximately 5 million dollars which is ridiculously low by regular moviestandards where a feature film usually would cost ten times that amount.As for the theme of the movie the subjects of alienation solitude dehumanization and disbelief are risen among others which often leads to some of the best movies in my opinion as is the case here too.All in all this movie definitely ranks among my personal top20 alltime scifi favorites and I will presume it will be placed equally high on most scifi aficionado's lists. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones and clearly one of the 5 best scifi movies made in the last 10 years. Already looking forward to his next feature film which allegedly is also going to be a scifi movie although with a much bigger budget.Final rating 9.510  a nearly flawless movie.".

On my visit to the local independent movie theater I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that.But the movie proved to be much more. It wasn't just the cinematography few captivating shots of the moon surface or the great acting performance. It was as if the movie took a while to ponder over philosophical questions that science and technology raise something that every science fiction ought to do.This work won't be unworthy of a comparison with Kubrick's space odyssey  only that it is probably not as visually stimulating as the latter. It does make good use of classical music like Kubrick's. I found the movie to be a bit more accessible than Tarkovsky's Solaris in that it is much more fluid and entertaining Solaris was 3 hr long  executed very slow albeit with a similar idea. Like Solaris the protagonist's recollections of the life on earth eventually result in some mental instability but the movie stays away from getting into long philosophical debates on human experience or our place on earth.In general do expect a lot more than space travel in this movie. To cite an example the isolation of Sam made him more attached to memories of his life on earth. I don't recall many other movies that have expressed it so well that in isolation nothing really means anything. Kudos to the director! Such existentialist reflections aside there are many instances when the movie makes a statement about unethical corporate practices evasive HR responses  almost to the extent 'Michael Clayton' did. I think that makes it more worthwhile to watch. Still despite all that it avoids taking any stances on controversies that bother all of us in modern times. It puts us through the fears of the unknown catastrophes of distrust and what arises from distrust and isolation and all of that.Still somehow the movie isn't really as dark as the script might make it sound. There is isolation mistrust schemes confusion curiosities and despair but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence  that was the idea I carried back from the movie theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by David Bowie's 38yearold son formerly known as Zowie with a screenplay by Nathan Parker 'Moon' is a curious and thoughtprovoking scifi story about a man working for an energy company mining Helium3 on the far side of the moon who discovers just as his threeyear contract is ending that he may not be going home. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself his character's name is Sam too Sam Bell. Events are set in a traditional space station with a capacious softly lit layout featuring the obligatory humanvoiced and omnipresent computer  mobile not so big a sort of clunky R2D2  creepily accommodating and voiced by an almosthuman Kevin Spacey. It's a robot I guess and its name is GERTY. There are nice lunar landscapes outside where Sam sometimes rides around in a puffedup Hummerstyle Land Rover to explore or look over the machinery extracting Helium3. Instead of the now alltoousual and increasingly irrelevant CGI there's more the feel of a giant mockup in everything we see which provides a better kind of background for what is essentially a Kafkaesque head trip. The interior isn't all modernistic chill. There's also a funky armchair reminiscent of the final sequence of '2001' and cozy junk even a college pennant on the wall around Sam's bunk sort of like a frat boy's quarters. Sam Rockwell's own appearance his skin far from perfect and his expression a bit wacko suggests an ordinary guy just a worker which is what he is not some Astronaut.'Moon' explores the paranoia we feel about a possible future increasingly dominated by evil pervasive corporations  not Big Brother but Big Corp. It also gets at something hauntingly explored in the movie Jones's dad Bowie played an alien in in way back when Nicholas Roeg's 'The Man Who Fell to Earth' the terrible loneliness of being out in space away from one's own kind. Sam works on the moon all by himself and some kind of radio blockage keeps him from being in direct electronic contact with people including his wife. There's also another aspect of space travel where distances destroy human chronology a distorted and confused sense of time troubles Sam when he tries to figure out what's been going on with his little family back on earth. It seems like it all happened a longer time ago than he knew. Or did it maybe happen to somebody else? Such questions may arise from time to time in other space movies but the filmmakers are usually too preoccupied with stuff like conflicts among the crew threats from hostile invaders or technical meltdowns to go into the full awful anomie megaaloneness and paranoid delusion lengthy sojourns in space are likely to induce. 'Moon' however has no other crew members or invaders or technical problems. Everything seems to be operating according to plan only it's beginning to seem Sam didn't know what the whole plan was insofar as his future is concerned. When he's out checking on something not far from the module the vehicle gets into some kind of accident and when he wakes up things start to go strangely wrong. This is where the fullon head trip begins and we and Sam start trying to figure out what's going on. That's all I can tell you because it's essential that the mystery unfold on its own.'Moon' doesn't dazzle but gives pleasure in its lowkeyed conviction. It even made me think of Shane Carruth's 2004 virtually nobudget cult timetravel movie 'Primer' because even with relatively elaborate sets and effects it still focuses on ideas rather than razzledazzle  on what Sam is going through rather than what the filmmakers were up to.Hence the key work is done by Rockwell. Sam Bell is exhausted and lonely after three years alone on the moon with only GERTY for company and Rockwell must go through a series of reawakenings and breakdowns after he hallucinates and has that accident in the vehicle and then becomes increasingly confused angry and frantic about what's going on. I'm not sure Jones or Parker make the most of the situation they set up but Rockwell's quick reactions and mood shifts hold our attention very well. As we know from 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' 'Joshua' and 'Snow Angels' Rockwell does great mental breakdowns. This time he does rapid physical deterioration equally well. In a sense all the most important special effects come out of the actor's bag of tricks. But that's not to forget the satisfying simplicity of the lunar landscape design sculpted by cinematographer Gary Shaw and production designer Tony Noble or to overlook Clint Mansell's evocative musical soundscape. And when Sam confronts other versions of himself needless to say the CGI folks were needed to pull it off within single frames.Low keyed and a little slow 'Moon' isn't for everyone and may seem tailored primarily for scifi buffs. But its disturbing exploration of identity goes back to a child's fundamental philosophical speculations Why am I here? Who am I? How do I know I'm me?".

	schema:reviewBody "Moon is ostensibly a oneman show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a threeyear contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure the desire to return to his wife and daughter whom he has never seen in real life yet strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an Xacto knife and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley facecomplete with changing expressionsof Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries and they reply back to him but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long.Cabin fever has definitely set in as Sam begins to zone out and manifest a woman first sitting down in his chair and then out on the moon's surface while he is out for a routine check. Both instances cause him to forget what he was doing causing great personal harm and injury. When the real trouble occurs however is the momentas seen in the trailerhe brings back a body from the surface that appears for all intents and purposes to be him. This is the point where talking about Moon gets a little difficult so as to not ruin the mystery that should be unsolved when you sit down to watch the film.

Not only is he on screen for the entire run time about 80 of it is playing opposite a computer or himself. The pressures being put upon his shoulders the fear of what may be happening about his very own existence weigh down his emotional strength and it shows.

While the trailer is not necessarily misleading it posits a question that is answered early on as being the main crux of the entire film. That possibility of more than one Sam Bell or of a man who's hold of reality has been broken may be what you went into the film expecting to see. Well you will just see it sooner than expected and as a lead into the real story of survival identity and the idea of home.

	onyx:emotionText "Moon is ostensibly a oneman show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a threeyear contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure the desire to return to his wife and daughter whom he has never seen in real life yet strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an Xacto knife and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley facecomplete with changing expressionsof Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries and they reply back to him but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long.Cabin fever has definitely set in as Sam begins to zone out and manifest a woman first sitting down in his chair and then out on the moon's surface while he is out for a routine check. Both instances cause him to forget what he was doing causing great personal harm and injury. When the real trouble occurs however is the momentas seen in the trailerhe brings back a body from the surface that appears for all intents and purposes to be him. This is the point where talking about Moon gets a little difficult so as to not ruin the mystery that should be unsolved when you sit down to watch the film. The trailer portrays a story that seems to beg the question of whether the second Sam is truly there or only in his imagination as he slowly goes insane. I won't divulge the answer but instead say that it gets solved fairly quickly.

	schema:reviewBody "Moon is a philosophical film at heart examining a variety of complex subjects and dilemmas with a precise and perfect manner mirroring the voice of its robot servant Gerty and the emptiness of the base itself. This is both the source of its beauty and a few problems.Spoiler Alert Although the beginning of the film gives us the usual stark view of the astronaut alone common in all welldone space movies and in this case especially derivative of the original Solaris it is in Sam's discovery that the film really takes flight and becomes something exciting and new. Sam Rockwell gives a stunning performance playing multiple versions of Sam Bell with great care and delicacy making each clone new and yet the same totally different from the often unintentionally comedic performances a role like that can manifest.But the subtlety of Rockwell's performance when combined with the starkness and quiet of the base can make the film feel mechanical to the unprepared viewer. Rockwell doesn't force his audience to feel for him. It's something that occurs only when you take time out from the screen to examine just how lonely terrifying and unfair Sam's experience is. You have to explore Sam's plight on your own. It is up to you to unravel the multitude of layers and depths swimming beneath the surface of this intricate story or take them at face value an aspect of the film that can potentially leave many viewers understandably unsatisfied and unmoved.One of the emotional surprises in the film does come from Sam's interaction with Gerty the robot his only companion. Gerty is the best on screen portrayal of a robot friend to date. He takes great care of Sam not because he feels for Sam but because that is logically the best thing for him to do and yet he does his job well. He is neither sinister or abnormally compliant his emoticon face lending the film an at times eerie and other times emotive component that feels more realistic and effective then his counterparts like HAL or Robbie the Robot.I loved the film was compelled as I watched it and unable to easily leave it behind once I left the theater. But I also didn't leave with a strong emotional response despite my understanding of the broad horrors of that Sam was facing. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not maybe it depends on which version of me was watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The SciFi department is a very hard market to break. Hence why greatness always seems to come from that genre......because normally when they are made it usually takes millions of dollars to cover the special effects and what not......so the process of choosing the right script is somewhat limited but they always leave their mark. However this one is changing that pace.....in a rhealm of big budget Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica flicks this movie chooses to take the independent route. By only spending 3 million for its budget and using old school techniques for its special effects.....can a movie like this thrive in todays market? Well you know how i mentioned that the script selection for a SciFi movie isa very tough market to break......and how the script better be incredible if it is going to make it anywhere........well this movie is just that. This movie was just plain brilliant. For those of you who have no idea what this film is about allow me to shed some light on the subject.........In the future our main character Sam Rockwell is living on a one man space station on the moon whose should purpose it to retrieve and send precious resources from the moon back to the earth.....in this process he becomes very lonely and begins to uncover a horrible truth. The movie is directed and told in such a brilliant fashion......they never try to WOW you with its special effects which are very moderate but pass with flying colors. Its script and method of storytelling are probably the best part. Instead of answering all of your questions all at once they sort of draw them out and make you claw and scratch for the truth......but the thing that i like the most is how they approach everything.........they take a route that lets you know that you have seen all the other SciFi classics and addresses all of your concerns of what may happen or what is going to......and then just carries on like its hidding this secret from you.....almost like the movie knows what your thinking but chooses not to correct you right away.......brilliantly told and shown in an even better light......and with Clint Mansell directing the musical scoreRequiem for a Dream The Fountain......my god how could you not be pulled in. Now the part that i am excited to talk about the most is the acting......because i really have not had anything to rave about so far this year.......but Sam Rockwell is hands down the best actor so far this year. He has already proved himself to me with The Green Mile FrostNixon and Choke......but he knocked this one out of the park. It was a difficult script to pull off for an actor and he did it with leaps and bounds.......job well done. I will be very upset if he is not at least nominated this year. Bottom Line.......well Star Trek gave you the actionentertainment portion of your SciFi.......whereas this one gives you its underbelly. This is easily one of the best SciFi movies i have seen in a long time and that is saying a lot coming from me. There was not one thing wrong with this movie......maybe the end was a little sketchy but it was still not enough to destroy this brilliant film. I urge all of you to go to your local independent movie theatre and watch this movie........you will regret it if you don't.......easily one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.".

Here is Duncan Jones' homage to the great era of Scifi from of the 60s to the 80s.In Duncan Jones' vision of the future the world's energy needs are solved by mining the moon for helium3 which can be used for nuclear fusion. Living on the dark side of the moon is Sam Bell Sam Rockwell who is coming to the end of a 3 year contract. He has lived in isolation with only GERTY Kevin Spacey a robot who is programmed to serve him. His only contact from the outside world is video messages from his wife Dominique McElligott and the company. When one of the mining machines suffers some damage Sam goes out to fix it. However after seeing images he crashes and wakes up after in the infirmary. GERTY tells Sam he is under orders no to let out the base and he has to trick the robot before being allowed out. In the open spaces of the moon Sam finds another version of himself. Both falls quickly into conflict both arguing they are the real Sam and the other is a clone. But both also know something wider and darker is happening and they need to solve it before a rescue team arrive.Duncan Jones offers a strong and ambitious debut as a feature director. Scifi is not a genre that indie directors attempt and Jones does a wonderful job with a 5 Million budget. He shows that Scifi can be meaningful and doesn't resource to action and explosions to keep the audience's interest. It is thoughtful with themes of identity isolation and the future of mankind. Jones keeps the mystery going and makes the audience exercise their mind whilst watching.Sam Rockwell has a tough job acting by himself but he is a talented actor and does a excellently. He is allowed to show his range and can show a lot in his facial expressions. Kevin Spacey who is just a voice in this film offers a good impression of HAL 9000.Clint Mansell who composed an fantastic score for Requiem for a Dream has shown his musical talent again which a subtle haunting score.Jones is an old fashion director using models rather then CGI. It is refreshing to see in a modern film is a lot more effective then CGI would have been on such a low budget. It reminds of films such as the original Star War films.Moon pays homage and has similarities to classic Scifi such as Alien Blade Runner Sunshine 2001 A Space Odyssey a must see and 2010 the Year We Made Contact a boring dud.Duncan Jones has a fine future ahead of him.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most important issue we may face in the future is whether rapid advances in science and technology will change human beings into disposable resources utilitarian subjects manipulated by indifferent centers of corporate power. Moon the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones son of the pop singer David Bowie tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet  Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless actionadventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001.Filmed on soundstages in England and set in an unspecified future time Moon opens with a mock commercial by the Japanese corporation Lunar Industries. The Corporation has developed a technique to use the rocks on the moon to produce Helium3 a substance that can fulfill mankind's most pressing energy needs. Their mining facility on the far side of the moon is manned only by Sam Bell Sam Rockwell and a Hallike robot named Gerty voice of Kevin Spacey who communications emotions through a smiley face display while reflecting company programming. Lonely and emotionally at loose ends Sam is nearing the end of a threeyear stint and is looking forward to return home in two weeks to see his wife Dominique McElligott and young daughter with whom he is only able to communicate via video recording since direct communication is temporarily out of service.When hallucinations of his lovely wife standing before him cause Sam to crash his Lunar Rover the film takes a strange turn and never looks back. Sam wakes up in the infirmary and begins his recovery process under strict orders from Gerty not to go outside of the base. Astoundingly Sam sees a younger version of himself who claims to have arrived to serve the same threeyear contract that Sam began many years ago. Raising issues about the nature of identity and the perversion of human life by scientific and corporate power run amok the film becomes a desperate struggle against the clock to reclaim one's humanity before a socalled rescue operation arrives to set things in order.Moon is not preachy nor does it treat the corporation as the villain incarnate. Without special effects or bombastic battle scenes this lowbudget film simply presents the possibility of what could happen if human consciousness does not keep pace with advances in genetic engineering. As such it is brilliantly executed fascinating and involving and contains an outstanding double role performance by Indie star Sam Rockwell who is completely convincing as the confused and lonely astronaut who plays ping pong with himself. Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker have combined the intelligence of Solaris with the chilling power of Alien to produce a work that challenges us to reconnect with our souls.".

Moon the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones son of the pop singer David Bowie tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet  Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless actionadventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001.Filmed on soundstages in England and set in an unspecified future time Moon opens with a mock commercial by the Japanese corporation Lunar Industries.

I know the film didn't have a big cinema push well certainly not in the UK and was only out to piggy back the anniversary of the lunar landings but I really hope it gets some more exposure.Sam deserves recognition for his talent as does the writer and director.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting and worthy film but ultimately unsatisfying. I love scifi films especially budget indies and I would like to rate the film higher but unfortunately it wasn't for me.As a reasonably obsessed scifi fan I found the film to be a little pedestrian. I have seen many of the setups and payoffs before. For example as a setup for the fact that Sam Bell is a clones the newly cloned Sam asks for sunglasses. This is a common clone setup. New clones wear sunglasses due to the sensitivity of the eyes being used for the first time. As a setup I found it a little common. There are other examples of recognizable setups running throughout the film. I was hoping for bit more ingenuity in the story and better pay offs.Most applauded the reasonableness of the science fiction. Cloning and AI on the dark side of the moon is clearly more reasonable than Dunes Guild navigators that fold spacetime by consuming vast amounts of a drug called Spice that gives them prescience to see across galaxies and into the future. I have no problem with science and magic. They are not mutually exclusive. As Arthur C.Clarke says any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.When I saw the trailer I was hoping for a Philip K.Dick style existential meltdown. Reality collapsing under the weight of it's pretension. Multiple realities layered on top of each other viciously competing for validation as they unfold into a desolate future. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. Moon is not that kind of thing. I don't want to bemoan the film to much. It was excellently acted. The production is very strong. The best use of doppelganger actors I ever seen with the exception of Dead Ringers. The CGI was very strong and painted a vivid picture of the moon. The robot AI voiced by Kevin Spacey is very well portrayed. For all it's supposed Hard SciFi I still feel it wasn't really hard scifi. Why didn't the AI have a face. It was a very sophisticated AI with great reasoning skills and somewhat of a personality of it's own. If the engineers can do this and synthesize flawless human speech why could they not give it a face instead of about 6 or 7 emoticons.The cloning seemed fishy as well. I can't understand they would not just clone a more drone like character that was happy to serve the company. Why and how would they even attempt to embed the memories personalities and traits of another human into a clone I don't know. Good film left me cold. People say it was an adult film. I disagree it was a film for stunted adults lacking imagination and a basic sense of cosmic wonder. Watch Herzogs The Wild Blue Yonder a film for real adults.Didn't want to be that negative. My opinion is more a counter balance to the positive reviews. I can understand the positive reviews. For the audience that gave it 10 stars you do not see a film like this too often. A real science fiction story. I just hate reality I prefer to follow the SunRa myth ".

Now that is saying something for me! I feel that this is a classic movie. It attempts to touch man's identity how we determine our worth. Are we what we do? Are we what we join? Are we our family? Are we illegal immigrants if we work on the Moon and then return to Earth? I didn't expect a science related movie to touch on existential subject matter. This movie will make you think about your family. It will make you think about how you put together your identity. No it isn't merely a movie with crash bang action and explosions on the Moon. This isn't an action movie. It's a movie for thinkers..This movie is edited tightly. There is only one scene where there is some happiness. I suppose you could compare it to a movie about a lonely soldier in WWII who only has a few days to go before the end of his war time assignment. But because it is sci fi and realistic you have more to consider The subject of human cloning comes up. The issue of where is home? ...is another matter to contend with. And even more you must think about a business establishment's loyalty to its workers as an issue. I haven't given you the answers here so that you will see the movie.

It takes a while to make its point and relies on our identification with a character who is portrayed with confused acting. The last time Sam Rockwell was in space was in Galaxy Quest. There he was a scream here he is a yawn. Moon I suppose works in small chunks but the big picture feels dull and not very enriching.Sam Bell for three years has been running an energy station on the moon. The energy harvested there supplies an environmentally friendly Earth in the near future. Sam's only companion is the station's computer Gerty a more mobile version of HAL 9000 with a smiley face. One daynight Sam is investigating a wrecked harvesting machine and inside he discovers a body.... another Sam. What does this mean? Is Sam 1 going crazy from being on the moon for too long? Is Sam 2 a clone? Is Sam 1 a clone? Are there any more bodies out there? and whose side is Gerty gonna take?Moon probably sounded good as a pitch considering all the questions that come up once you block out the plot. Unfortunately the movie never really comes alive. The ending is the most exiting part but ten minutes of solidity doesn't necessary warrant a time investment in eighty minutes of ponderous direction. Moon is tricky to recommend.".

Second it only stars one guySam Rockwell. Along with the voice of the computer Kevin Spacey and BRIEF glimpses at others through memories or over phone calls this IS the entire cast! Third and most importantly the film really kept me guessing throughout and is thoroughly original! The film is the first fulllength film of Duncan Jonesthe son of David Bowie Bowie's real name by the way is David Jones. While he's only made one film since Source Code I cannot imagine him not getting many more opportunities because his skills are so evident in Moona film he not only directed but he came up with the story as well! This guy is something.The film is set in the near future. To supply the Earth's energy needs NASA is mining Helium3 from the Moon. On this moon base is Sam Bell Sam Rockwella guy who seems to be losing his mind. It's probably because he's been alone for nearly three years. What is obvious is that something is amissand he is either hallucinating or there is another version of him on the base as well! Yes following an accident he awakens to see another Sam Bell.At this point in the film I KNEW exactly what was coming next. Well I was 100 wrong!!! The film really took my by surprise and the dark turn really caught me off guardand I really really like that in a movie. However I don't want to spoil it. See the film yourself and see a wonderful example of a film that is highly original intelligent and cheaply made! A truly unique filmand one that is available now on Netflix. And like Gravity it's a space film with a tiny cast that thoroughly kept my interest.By the way my only complaint about this film and it's minor is that the movie is rated R. You do see Rockwell's butt and I wish that scene was chopped outnot because I am a prude but because a lot of teens won't be able to see the film due to it's rating and some adults might avoid it as well. As a parent I would certainly let my daughters see the movieit's really something special.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Lewis Thomas Paul Walker buys a car to pick up wouldbe girlfriend Venna Leelee Sobieski from college in Colorado he learns that his brother Fuller Steve Zahn was jailed on a misdemeanor charge in Salt Lake City. So he decides to pick up his brother first. During a pit stop Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke around with truckers going so far as posing as a woman and setting up a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy the trucker seeks revenge.For the most part Joy Ride is an enjoyable horrorthriller. It is loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in the scenario as it's relatively realistic. The horror is formed from everyday situations where just a couple bad decisions can lead one into the sights of a madman.However I had to subtract two points for something I very rarely subtract points forstupid decisions on the part of protagonists. Of course some people think that horror films are primarily based on characters making stupid decisions but in my view of the genre even if such actions are clichd filmmakers generally justify such decisions at least in the context of the film. Too often in Joy Ride writers Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams along with director John Dahl make little attempt at justification. Why don't they just turn the CB off? Why don't they just ignore the villain? Why don't they call the police? Why don't they stay in places that are more populated like the truckstop? Why do they keep trusting the villain? While there are some cursory answers to a few of these questions taken together you keep wondering In the film's world how can someone so stupid be in college? One possible answer is suggested by the Joy Ride DVD. It contains a 29minute alternate ending that thankfully has a bit of commentary from both the director and the writer. The alternate ending is just is good as the theatrical version in my opinion and tries to put a slightly more logical spin on the film. Our heroes do end up at a police station with some police cooperation. However it was apparently felt that this alternate actually the original ending didn't work and didn't maintain tension. Abrams felt that involving the police more directly in the plot removed too much of the focus from our heroes. Dahl also states that he thought there was too much character development in the original ending. I beg to differ on all of those points. Although the revised ending has many positive aspects not found in the originalespecially a Rube Goldberglike scenario involving maximum immediate risk and creating maximum tension the original ending may have worked better overall in my opinion.But Joy Ride is good enough overall to transcend stupid decisions on the part of the characters. If seen as a sequence of hightension scenarios where logical plot connectors are only secondary to creating thrilling rides Joy Ride almost deserves an A a 9 in my rating system. There isn't a scenario in the film that's not smart and inventive in some way. The three principlesWalker Zahn and Sobieskigive good performances and the villain is masterfully done by Matthew Kimbrough who provided the body Ted Levine who provided the bizarre creepy voice and Dahl who wisely shows glimpses of him but only glimpses. The villain is almost supernatural in his cleverness strength and obsession. It's just too bad that we haven't had a sequel yet.".

Paul Walker 'The Skulls' is very effective as your average joe college kid and Steve Zahn 'Out Of Sight' is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic often better than the movies he appears in and he is in fine form here. The chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired. Leelee Sobieski 'Eyes Wide Shut' has yet to make much of an impact on me and there's very little to change that here. She is passable but little more than eye candy as Walker's potential love interest. The real star of the movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail 'The Silence Of The Lambs' Ted Levine. Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel' but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh and exiting spin on familiar material. 'Roadkill' won't change your life but it is a genuinely exciting and effective thriller a real rarity in Hollywood these days. Hitchcock it ain't but it's a very entertaining popcorn movie with plenty of thrills and twists. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Scary Road Thriller Somewhat Reminiscent of The Hitcher.";
	schema:reviewBody "Joy Ride is an extremely entertaining roadset horrorthriller that was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis Paul Walker a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a wouldbegirlfriend Venna Leelee Sobieski in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother Fuller Steve Zahn has been arrested in Salt Lake City so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car the two take off to pick up Venna but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of Rusty Nail excellently voiced by Ted Levine on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank he attacks the brothers with his large semi but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him  he'll stop at nothing to get it and he's looking for more than an apology.Reminiscent of The Hitcher in quite a few ways but also a much different film Joy Ride was a surprise for me. I was expecting something along the lines of your typical teenagehorror fare and I was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heartpounding little thriller of a film. To start off the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichs. The characters in this film are smart and the audience is rooting for them the entire way through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences one of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield among others and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so and from there it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker who hasn't accomplished anything too amazing but manages to lead the film well and play his character believably.

	onyx:emotionText "Joy Ride is an extremely entertaining roadset horrorthriller that was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis Paul Walker a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a wouldbegirlfriend Venna Leelee Sobieski in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother Fuller Steve Zahn has been arrested in Salt Lake City so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car the two take off to pick up Venna but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of Rusty Nail excellently voiced by Ted Levine on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank he attacks the brothers with his large semi but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him  he'll stop at nothing to get it and he's looking for more than an apology.Reminiscent of The Hitcher in quite a few ways but also a much different film Joy Ride was a surprise for me. I was expecting something along the lines of your typical teenagehorror fare and I was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heartpounding little thriller of a film. To start off the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichs. The characters in this film are smart and the audience is rooting for them the entire way through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences one of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield among others and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so and from there it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker who hasn't accomplished anything too amazing but manages to lead the film well and play his character believably. Steve Zahn in his quirky and funny older brother and plays the part suitably. Leelee Sobieski plays the intuitive girlnextdoor friend who ends up along for the ride and she also gives a worthy performance.

They pass the time by taunting a trucker on their CB radio. Of course the trucker turns out to be a psycho who terrorizes them until they finally think they've appeased him by offering him their abject apologies.

	schema:headline " A Lot of Riding But Little Joy . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Joy Ride is like racing with The Blair Witch Project. Director John Dahl of Unforgettable 1996 and Rounders 1998 conjures up several convincing but unsavory clammyfisted suspense scenes in this lowbudget neonoir catandmouse road rage thriller but he cheats audiences over the long run. First he affords us only fleeting glimpses of the villain. Never do we clearly see what this homicidal hellion looks like any more than we saw the Blair Witch herself. Of course when the DVD version comes out we'll freezeframe that splitsecond shot of this mother trucker for clarity but until then the only prominent feature is a greasy fat paw of a fist. Second Dahl does little to make the Clay Tarver  Jeffrey Abrams screenplay appear remotely plausible. Not only does the anonymous but omniscient villain in Joy Ride manage to stay well ahead of our protagonists but also he accomplishes some pretty outrageous feats. Third since our heroes cannot vanquish evil Dahl deprives us of the emotional catharsis that closure would have provided. Instead the openandunresolved ending perfect for a sequel robs Joy Ride of memorable dramatic impact. Fourth for a movie about a deranged dastard the corpses are too far and few between in number. Only two people out of everybody else in the entire film die. BOO! Sadly my high hopes for this persuasively acted but uneven suspenser grew out of previously impressive Dahl directoral outings such as the edgy Red Rock West 1993 with Nicholas Cage and the mischievous femme fatale opus The Last Seduction 1994 with sexy Linda Fiorentino.Essentially freshman scribe Clay Tarver and Jeffrey Abrams of Armageddon and Forever Young have penned a shallow but provocative screenplay long on suspense but short on payoff. They borrow elements from Steven Spielberg's 1971 telefilm Duel the 1997 Jonathan Mostow nailbiter Breakdown with Kurt Russell and the grisly yet gripping 1986 Robert Harmon stalker saga The Hitcher costarring Rutger Hauer  C. Thomas Howell. Watch any of those movies and you'll be far ahead of this formulaic fare. Each movie exerts an influence on Joy Ride but Dahl cannot sustain this tightly coiled thriller despite its topgrade technical qualities. Even his clever homage to Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest with a nighttime cornfield scene doesn't compensate for the routine storyline. Basically a psychotic trucker effectively voiced by Matthew Kimbrough with neither a shred of humor nor decency harasses brothers Lewis Thomas Paul Walker of Skulls and Fuller Thomas Steve Zahn of Out of Sight to the point of trying to butcher them. After our misguided protagonists play a juvenile prank with their citizen's band radio on a creepy hormoneaddled trucker 'Rusty Nail' as the trucker calls himself goes insanely berserk.Whoa let's back up momentarily. Initially Lewis had an airline ticket for his flight home as his freshman year winds down at the University of California at Berkley As the action gears up Lewis is chatting longdistance with an old hometown friend Venna Leelee Sobrieki of The Glass House who has just broken up with her boyfriend at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She explains how she'd like to decompress and gradually make her way home. Wouldn't it be fantastic she muses aloud if Lewis could pick her up in his car. She doesn't think Lewis owns a car. Indeed our hero doesn't until she puts the idea in his brain. Lewis lies and assures her he has a car and they make plans for him to pick her up. Out goes Lewis to cash in his airline ticket and buy a used car so Venna and he can take the slow way home to New Jersey like the heroes did in Jeepers Creepers. Before he embarks on his road trip Lewis learns from his mom that the Salt Lake City Police have arrested his irresponsible older brother Fuller on a DUI charge. Somebody must bail him out and his father refuses to do anything about him. Along the way to Boulder Lewis impulsively makes a Uturn that gets him a ticket then wheels into Salt Lake City long enough to secure Fuller's release. The last thing Lewis imagined is Fuller would choose to accompany Venna and him on the entire trip. Clearly Fuller must have forgotten the clich Two's A Group Three's A Crowd. Director John Dahl botches what otherwise might have ranked as a topflight horror feature. Again he never reveals the villain charts an improbable chronicle of events drums up an unbelievable ending has a low body count and lets evil escape punishment. The sad thing about Joy Ride' and so many movies today is the technical qualities are superb. The acting is firstrate. Steve Zahn and Pat Walker make believable brothers especially in their sibling rivalry scenes. Meanwhile Zahn brings incredible nuance to his character. Rednecks take a beating in the script and Dahl depicts them as Neanderthal types who lack sexual savoir faire. Unfortunately neither Dahl nor his scenarists bring any psychological insight into Rusty Nail's character. When Lewis addresses Rusty Nail in his Candy Cane voice Rusty hesitates when Candy asks him what he would do after she unbuttoned her blouse. The guys get a great laugh out of Rusty's sexual repressive personality. Later they pay for their arrogance when Rusty Nail forces them to enter a truck stop buttnaked to order six cheeseburgers. The expression on the elderly waitress's face when she asks if they want fries to go with it is hilarious. Joy Ride gets a lot of mileage out of suspense but director John Dahl turns it into road kill.".

Watch as we understand completely how any amount of force can be brought to bear.Watch how the surprise ending is a surprise only because it completes the cycle the debt is paid everything is washed clean newly corrected and balanced life goes on.LeeLee was effective in Eyes Wide Shut' where she played a rather simple role. Here little is demanded but she delivers less. She's off my list.";

	schema:reviewBody "Joyride is far from dull yet not as gripping as it sets out to be due to certain goofs in the plot.  Sometimes the movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a slick suspensethriller or a slasher flick.  It's the film's unevenness that bogs it down.  Steve Zahn is good as usual adding some fine comic relief.  Paul Walker is still not a great actor but he's better than he was in The Fast and the Furious I wanted to make sure he gets banned from movies forever after that performance.  And Leelee Sobieski shows off her talent as an upandcoming young actress sometimes to the point where I feel she's too good for this movie!  Joyride kept my interest with the exception of a few overlong chase sequences but it left me wanting more. And there were some scenes that just begged for uninintentional laughter. SPOILERS AHEAD   For example that scene where the guys stop at the gas station.  The tall bearded guy with long hair stereotypical creepy scary movie villain walks into the store carrying a tire thumper like a baseball bat.  The guys run into the car and try to make a quick getaway.  The creepy guy gets into his truck and chases after them. When they finally stop the guy steps up to the window and hands Paul Walker the credit card that he dropped at the store.  What the hell was that??? You're telling me a guy finds a credit card and he's gonna be such a good samaritan that he's gonna engage himself in a highspeed chase driving a truck I might add just to give this poor guy his credit card? Joyride could've been a lot worse but it could've been a lot better. John Dahl who directed the callously underrated Rounders makes great use of lighting but his slick direction can't overshadow the goofy script. My score  6 out of 10".

That less than 30 second bit of business is flawless.The Ugly In the summary I am referring to Plot Holes. There are so many logical inconsistencies throughout that I stopped feeling any real tension. One character consistently has access to information names travel plans room numbers that simply is not available... which would be fine in a film about supernatural events. This is not a supernatural film. The film has that slick smooth Hollywood feel that the independent film community cannot afford and when the Indies use the cheap digital cameras there is a grittiness a sense of real urgency. The cinematography was simply too pretty to work in a film of this type.Overall 510. Not really a complete loss. Worthy of a sit through with plenty of popcorn or a higher score for folks that want to watch an action based horror film with friendsfamilyetc that really don't normally care for that kind of thing but not powerful enough to warrant full attention from a fan of the genre.".

The ending itself in the final cut is OK but when you consider the fact that they reshot the entire ending more than 20 minutes which is a big chunk of the film then this clearly makes the ending seem even more lackluster and unimpressive than it is right now. The alternativeoriginal ending is available for all to see on the DVD which is almost as boring or unimpressive as the one in the final cut.I've never seen such a massive reshoot for a film. The last third of the film was completely changed which tells me they had no idea what to do with the story and the characters the good guys and the bad guy. It's truly mind boggling when you consider that with all the people involved in a movie no one could come up with a better conclusion to the story they meticulously set up during the first hour.Anyway at least the first half is good even if it's predictable and implausible the killer knows a lot about the two pranksters....

The killer seems to be everywhere but no one can see him driving his EIGHT  TEEN WHEELER while he is stalking them. Yeah sure.The first half hour of the movie is just padding involving the jailbound loser brother nothing happens at all.

Then when the killer finally reappears there's just a lot more running around chases car crashed bad jokes completely implausible set ups etc.A lot of running around but though nothing happens.The killer painting instructions on a SERIES of highway signs yeah now that's believable too. How did the killer know which way these little pricks were going to be driving?The killer retrieving the CB radio after they throw it out the window onto the highway and putting it in there car without them noticing that's not too unbelievable either.The killer driving his 18 wheeler following them to a college and kidnapping their girlfriend's roommate almost makes the last two statements believable.Then after all that running around the killer turns out to be NOBODY. That's right the killer's identity is never revealed. The filmmakers think that if they set it up for a sequel nobody will mind that the movie makes absolutely no sense that everything will just be explained in the sequel.

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Derry star fullback at his college is sprinting along a country road when he sees Glory Billings in the hands of three thugs. Jack rescues the girl and escorts her to her home where he meets her foster brother Edgar Billings and his father Leonard Billings. The elder Billings assumes that the men were trying to get Glory's bracelet which when combined with a matching bracelet shows the location of a great underground oil lake Glory's father had found. Jack's father has earlier been sent to prison and Jack learns that Billings is responsible. Glory is lured to the tenement district by Meeney and his gang of cutthroats. The Meeney gang tries to kill Jack with an exploding football substituted during the big game but their trick is exposed. Jack learns that a miner named Jordan living in Wyoming knows the truth about how his father was framed and has been blackmailing Billings. Meeney has Jack shanghaied and put on a steamer where Jack holds the crew at bay using explosives he finds in the hold. Having escaped Jack needs funds to make the trip west so he enters a boxing match against Battling Barrows with a 200 purse going to winner. He wins the bout and heads west after learning that Glory and Billings are also headed for Wyoming. McManus Meeney's Indian henchman trap Glory and her maid Molly on the observation platform in an attempt to steal the bracelet and when Jack attempts a rescue McManus hurls him from the train. Glory and Molly have been captured by the gang and taken to the only hotel in St. Cristianna where Jack has found work as a waiter. They escape but are later captured by a gang of Mexican bandits. The bandit leader is the fiendish Royce Rivers who forces himself on Glory but through trickery she frees Jack and they escape together. Jack is arrested on a trumped up charge and Rivers who has obtained a letter proving Jack's father's innocence agrees to free Jack and give him the letter in exchange for Glory's bracelet. Jack is released and finds Jordan who is forced to write a letter testifying to the innocence of Jack's father. Jack escapes with the letter but it is unsigned and Jack needs money to hire a writing expert to document that it is in Jordan's hand. He again enters a prize fight with a local boxer and wins the funds to begin a legal battle to free his father. Glory and Molly have been hiding at a ranch in the foothills but are discovered by Edgar who kidnaps Glory. The butler who has been helping Glory out of trouble whenever he can reveals himself to be Kent partner of Glory's father and part owner of the oil claim owned by Glory. Before he can prove his claim Billings steals the bracelets and learns that the oil lake lies under the property of Jim Collins. Before he can purchase the land Jack reaches Collins and gets an option to buy the property. Jordan's testimony is authenticated Jack's father is freed and Billings and Rivers are arrested.The star of the serial is surrounded by a coterie of players of ability and note who fit without a wrinkle into the characterization of the...story. There are improbabilities in the plot such as are found in the majority of screen serials but the picture is well directed and thoroughly interesting. Moving Picture World".

The film concerns a genteel British governess who with a son of her own journeys from England to 19th century Siam now Thailand to instruct the king's many children in the ways of the West... Upon her arrival in 1862 the uptight widow immediately clashes with the powerful ruler over his refusal to give her 'a brick residence' of her own outside the walls of the palace as had been promised... As the film progresses and in a world where women had basically no rights the 'very difficult' governess learns to temper her outrage at the Siamese court and its treatment of women.. And while she was admiring the king's personality and brilliant mind she quickly discovered that the major challenge facing her is much more in the education of the volatile king than of his cute family... Despite his openmindedness about other cultures the proud bald king was besieged by both colonial powers and Siamese traditionalists... At least in private he consults Anna on how to handle the threats against Siam from England Burma and France... He turns a deaf ear to her complaints about having to live in the royal palace and fascinated by science and geography.. he gives 'a puzzlement' the proper mixture of arrogance wonder and confusion...In this historical account of conflicting cultures and sexual mores we watch two people of very different backgrounds drawing apart and then together culminating in that most moving and triumphant of moments when they dance together for the first time... The image of Anna is swept 'high up' by the king as they whirl across the palace floor... His bare feet seductively touching lightly the edge of her satin gown... When the king tells Anna that something is not correct with the way they are dancing and extends his right hand to place it around her waist it's the climax of a romantic love that never ignites...This goodhearted story enriched by some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most enduring tunes permits the meeting of two polar cultures explored with wit and humor... It permits us also to enter into the complex mind of a stubborn king stern and imperious whose words and whims become the law of Siam... But the king is graceful comic and virile... And into the feelings of an intelligent woman equallystubborn intrigued and deeply irritated by a man that quickly found she was also instructing him in the niceties of dancing and dining...Brynner is irresistible and seductive a towering figure as the king...

I went out into the theatre lobby and looked at the ornate program which listed Mrs. Anna as Deborah Kerr.What an impression this woman has had on my life over the years from the retelling of the classic tale of the British woman who comes to Siam to teach the king's children.  It is superb not only musically but from a story standpoint holds up as the best of the Rodgers  Hammerstein musicals. It is essentially a women's lib story which makes it as relevant today as it was fifty years ago when it premiered on Broadway.The fiery but compassionate Mrs. Anna who is at first turned off by the king and then charmed by him and who little by little changes him from a neardespot to a man who can grow.The subplots are fanciful but lovely and in the ballet of Uncle Tom as performed by Tuptim draw a direct analogy to the unpleasant lives endured by Siamese slaves in particular women. It does so with majesty and intelligence no less so than Arthur Miller did in The Crucible contrasting the Salem Witch Trials with the awful McCarthy political witchhunts on Capitol Hill.It is an extraordinary achievement and it is shocking that it did not even make the top 100 AFI films a year ago.  It is continually fresh and alive and every time there is a festival or rerelease it does well.  Indeed a few years ago it was shown on a huge screen at The Hollywood Bowl with orchestral accompaniment and it was a smash again.My only regret is that Deborah Kerr six times nominated for an Oscar was not gifted with an Academy Award along with her costar Yul Brynner.It is a film that should be seen for generations to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "The King and I has been my favorite RodgersHammerstein show for many years. I love the score and the only real criticism I have of this film version is that it did not contain the entire score from the Broadway show. It also did not contain the magical performance of Gertrude Lawrence in her final role. But that was beyond the scope of 20th Century Fox and Darryl Zanuck.The versions of The King and I that we usually see performed give emphasis to the role of the King. As Gertrude Lawrence was dying in 1952 she made a deathbed request that the billing on the show be changed and that Yul Brynner be given top billing instead of whatever female would be replacing Lawrence as Anna Leonowens. That was done and it has remained so ever since.The role of King Mongkut of Siam became like Dracula was for Bela Lugosi a part that no matter what else he did Yul Brynner couldn't escape from. The air of authority he establishes as the King holds you and binds you to every move he makes in the part. I'm told that as good as this screen version is to see him on stage was the real deal. The critical acclaim he got from the Broadway run no doubt led to him winning an Oscar as Best Actor for 1956.Standing in for Gertrude Lawrence quite ably is Deborah Kerr who got one of her several nominations for Best Actress for this film. Unfortunately her voice is dubbed by that well known vocal standin Marni Nixon as is Rita Moreno as Tuptim and Carlos Rivas as Lun Tha the second romantic leads. The part does call more for an actress than a singer. Gertrude Lawrence was the very best of both.So many popular standards come from this score more than any other score Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II wrote. From philosophical tunes like Getting to Know You and I Whistle a Happy Tune and such romantic ballads as Hello Young Lovers We Kiss in a Shadow Something Wonderful and Shall We Dance will be done forever. Somewhere now on planet earth there is some theatrical company doing the King and I and performing these great songs. You can't also forget those that didn't make the cut here like I Have Dreamed and My Lord and Master.The most interesting song that Dick and Oscar wrote is the solo for the King A Puzzlement. It's very similar to the Soliliquy in Carousel where the song explains all the character motivations of Billy Bigelow. King Mongkut a very real historic figure who wanted very much to move his country into the modern era but his entire upbringing fights against his desire. A Puzzlement is a wonderful number that goes into the problems of governing and not just for monarchies. Listen to Hammerstein's lyrics they are very much relevant today.I visited Thailand in 1999 and learned a great deal about the country in those two days. King Mongkut's descendants rule today as constitutional and beloved monarchs. In fact this film which probably did more to encourage tourism to Thailand than anything else is banned in that country. Because it shows the king in what the Thais feel as an irreverent light. It is indeed a puzzlement.The film has preserved forever one of the great Broadway shows of all time forevermore. Reason enough to see it and whistle its happy tunes.".

Somewhere now on planet earth there is some theatrical company doing the King and I and performing these great songs. You can't also forget those that didn't make the cut here like I Have Dreamed and My Lord and Master.The most interesting song that Dick and Oscar wrote is the solo for the King A Puzzlement. It's very similar to the Soliliquy in Carousel where the song explains all the character motivations of Billy Bigelow. King Mongkut a very real historic figure who wanted very much to move his country into the modern era but his entire upbringing fights against his desire. A Puzzlement is a wonderful number that goes into the problems of governing and not just for monarchies. Listen to Hammerstein's lyrics they are very much relevant today.I visited Thailand in 1999 and learned a great deal about the country in those two days. King Mongkut's descendants rule today as constitutional and beloved monarchs. In fact this film which probably did more to encourage tourism to Thailand than anything else is banned in that country. Because it shows the king in what the Thais feel as an irreverent light. It is indeed a puzzlement.The film has preserved forever one of the great Broadway shows of all time forevermore. Reason enough to see it and whistle its happy tunes.";

It's one of the bestwritten songs of all time and could only have been written by someone who truly understood love!The simple charm and joyful exuberance of Getting to Know You the unforgettable Hello Young Lovers which is a message of hope and encouragement to all those who love under difficult circumstances Whistle a Happy Tune which helps when we are frightened and alone and all the other songs have become famous.Yul Brynner who had been a relatively unknown bitpart actor with hair shaved his head and gave a towering performance for the part then spent the rest of his life basking in the glory of that one role! Deborah Kerr who had given so many exquisite performances in so many films also rose to the occasion in this one. Rita Moreno who was a pinup girl as well as one of the world's greatest actresses is beautiful as the runaway slave.It's a film that everyone must see at least once especially now that they've put out a restored version.

	schema:headline " A musical classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Known best as a musical version of 1946 FOX film Anna and the King of Siam starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison The King and I often takes a back seat to The Sound of Music. Whilst the latter is both my favourite all time movie and musical The King and I is only second to it. Most of this is due in part to the wonderful performances of Deborah Kerr Yul Brynner and a delightful supporting cast. Musical characters have been immortalised by few in the time musicals were fashionable. A few would be Julie Andrews' Maria Gene Kelly's character from Singin' in the Rain Judy Garland's Dorothy and James Cagney's George M. Cohan from the biopic Yankee Doodle Dandy. Brynner in his best and most defining role has forever left his mark on the King arrogantly fierce so simple so desperate so true. Although not a singer and well known to be dubbed by Marni Nixon the 'ghost' favourite of Hollywood musicals Deborah Kerr gives another beautiful and loved performance as the English governess with son Louis travels to 1860s Siam to be tutor to the Royal children. Her performance demanded character command and charm and Kerr managed to successfully combine all three in a memorable performance. But it is the Rodgers and Hammerstein score that tops it all off. The element of the screenplay in the FOX movie adaptions was not always the strongest. Tentative and urging was Something Wonderful. I Whistle a Happy Tune bright calming and inspirational. Getting to Know You sets the mood of happiness Hello Young Lovers keeps a note of optimism and the rich lush score of the overture and throughout the film make it memorable. But it is Shall We Dance? a joyful song that I believe to be the best of the lot. Although it is melodiously challenged because of Gertrude Lawrence's low voice range it is still one of the best of the duo's scores. Cinemascope used first in the first of the Rodgers and Hammerstein movies of the year Carousel provided opportunities to open up moments in the picture. On a widescreen print only then can the real grandeur splendour and colour of the enormous sets and opulence of the movie itself can be fully appreciated.Despite my love for the musical since viewing both Anna and the King of Siam and the new Jodie Foster Chow YunFat movie Anna and the King the flaws in what was previously believed to be an accurate and true account of Anna Leonowens story have unfortunately ruined the musical both in Anna's life and the depiction of the Siamese court. The nonmusical versions have been obviously more historically accurate and the comparison of the three different FOX versions have all been noticably scripted to the fit the time of release. But I have not yet allowed that to get in the way of enjoying a great musical. With Anna and the King as my favourite movie of 1999 of the moment I hope it won't spoil things further. Rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't. If you do you'll love this. Personally I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell Bill Robinson Ruby Keeler James Cagney Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off.This film is a caseinpoint. The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. By then the story didn't have much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she starred in that I liked including this one where the goody twoshoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam. I which she had!. However divorcing myself from likesanddislikes there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked The Sound Of Music a decade later. There are similarities in the RH musicals. Thus if you liked the Julie Andrews flick you should like this too. This is a Lavish production with yes a capital L. This is the kind of bigproduction musicals you rarely saw after that generation. You also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Yul Brynner is King Mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He isn't progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher Kerr as Anna Leonowens will set him straight. Secularprogressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his morebarkthanbite character. Justifiably he is the big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism. Even in The Magnificent Seven Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience.In summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it. I'll leave it at that.".

Brynner in particular brings an athleticism and intensity to his role which won him an academy award. The two share an unusual chemistry. The film is dated but remains entertaining and ranks among the best musicals of the fifties. The music is very enjoyable with several catchy tunes which are well choreographed. I specially liked A Puzzlement and Shall We Dance. Some parts are a bit corny but the film is still well worth watching.Overall 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner give spirited performances in 'The King and I' a musical adaptation of Margaret Landon's book. Brynner in particular brings an athleticism and intensity to his role which won him an academy award. The two share an unusual chemistry. The film is dated but remains entertaining and ranks among the best musicals of the fifties. The music is very enjoyable with several catchy tunes which are well choreographed. I specially liked A Puzzlement and Shall We Dance. Some parts are a bit corny but the film is still well worth watching.Overall 810";

Lang's direction crawls along Lehman's script is surprisingly weak and the main character  Kerr's Anna  is too priggish and tiresome to be very much fun.  Where's Julie Andrews' Maria when you need her?  Most disappointing of all are the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein which are mostly unmemorable.  Only Getting to Know You and Shall We Dance standout much.  The subplot romance between the two Latinos Rita Moreno and Carlos Rivas playing Asian lovers is achingly unoriginal and uninteresting.  The film is also condescending in its view of the little Asian people.  And what are we to make of Anna's son?  He appears at the beginning then disappears throughout most of the film  which isn't a bad thing  only to reappear at the very end.  Finally the tearjerk ending seems rushed unclear and disappointing. One wants to be moved by the King's unexpected death because Brynner makes us like him so much during the film but it all goes by so quickly that we just don't care.The film does contain one of the most surreal Hollywood sequences of alltime up there with Marlene Dietrich singing in an ape costume in Blonde Venus The Jerome Robbins choreographed dance of The Small House of Uncle Tom.  Here we have a latina actress playing a Burmese girl narrating a play based on a novel about blacks in the southern U.S. written by a white woman from Connecticut and the Thai dancers strut their stuff to Western music that sounds vaguely Asian and there's some blackface and a statue of Buddha and amazingly cool costumes and the whole thing takes place at a lavish dinner given by the Siamese king trying to act civilized in front of the wealthy Europeans living in Bangkok and it's all quite bizarre and postmodern in its own way... but Jerome Robbins wins out giving us the most interesting part of the film.All in all if you want a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical stick with the Sound of Music.I do want one of those cool jackets Yul Brynner wears though.".

Rather considerately the film assuages our contemporary PC tiptoeing by allowing us to piggyback on the apprehension of our journeying protagonist Anna.

And enjoy we do as the narrative  a comfortingly familiar first etching of the Mary PoppinsSound of Music mould to follow  rolls out the players the unbearably adorable children and their monolithic mentors Anna and the King. Proceedings are a bit sluggish but for the next third our chief task is getting to know them getting to know all about them as they warble a roster of iconic heartwarming tunes. And slowgoing or not doing so is an utter delight. The King and I is governed not so much by plot as a clearly honed rhetorical question how to reconcile the past and future through education there's also a 'forbidden love' subplot but this isn't interesting so much as a MacGuffin to further fan the fires of the central conflict. Anna is obstinately bound by a pedagogical and moral tradition imported from England whereas the King in attempting to rule proactively while also subtly stirred by closeted romance weds Western science and theology to Siamese social norms and power dynamics resulting in a schizophrenic sense of national identity. But director Walter Lang unearths more of a richness and tender yearning from the theme than simply 'Grease Royalty Style' making the Classical Hollywood conservatism of the film's conclusion 'punishing' the King for his 'sins' with a bout of deusexmachina existential depressionsorryillness a jarring disingenuous dud. Etcetera et hmm. But enough of that shall we dance? As with many classical musicals The King and I's story is second only to the lavishness amidst which it unfolds. And as a snapshot of the era where production values alone captured in sumptuous colour and CinemaScope naturally were enough to lure audiences away from their televisions to the cinema it's still hard to stifle oohs and ahhs at the sheer gorgeousness of the miseenscne with sets props and costumes Deborah Kerr's hoop skirts alone are so capacious they could only be shown in CinemaScope bursting with vivacious colour and aesthetic intricacy. Even the tangential Russian doll of wince that is a white actor in yellowface narrating a Thai adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin!! of all things plays as a rapturously beautiful dance piece a Hamletlike the play's the thing! style political subtextladen interlude replete with jawdropping costumes and choreography. And if such an absurd cluster of cringeworthy elements can still conflate to create something beautiful the film must surely achieve some level of incredulous masterpiece for simply existing as more than the sum of its parts. Still the film would be nothing without its two unforgettably commanding performances pumping it full of heart and humanity. Deborah Kerr whose singing is seamlessly dubbed by the vocally flawless Marni Nixon is an earnest firebrand of a lead and plays Anna's uncompromising zeal quiet tragedy and coy interpersonal and political machinations to an energetically irresistible hilt. Thanks to her unwavering conviction the film now over 60 years old remains as feminist as it is racially unwieldy take notes My Fair Lady !. Nonetheless there's no question the film belongs to Yul Brynner. Imperious and formidable as he is nimble jubilant and slyly playful Brynner is so overwhelmingly charismatic that qualms about his dubiously inappropriate casting are quickly swept aside in favour of his magnetic presence and bold physicality his ferociously furrowed brow or cheekily dropping to his belly immortalizing more power than any Oscarbaiting soliloquy. A more grotesquely Hollywood production would cave to convention and requite their subtly stirring romance but leaving their simmering tantalizing tension unrequited is scintillating movie magic. Shall we dance? No  we shall swoon.The King and I remains that difficult paradox of an indisputable classic that remains hard to reconcile as a 21st century watch moreover it's overlong and verges on plodding even for its time. Nonetheless the power vibrancy and voluminous charm inherent are infectious making the film a hugely worthwhile guilty cheat for even the most steadfast pundits of PC purity.

	schema:headline " Brynner's masterful performance is the film's high point";
	schema:reviewBody "The wonderful performance of Yul Brynner is definitely the high point of this film adaption of Rodgers and Hammerstein's play. The production is very impressive with a fully fleshed out technicolor Siam practically bursting out of the screen. Deborah Kerr's costumes alone are just about worth the price of admission. The only thing bringing the film down somewhat is the fact that the film occasionally feels patronizing towards Asian culture and the sometimes deliberately infantile lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein excellent in some places as far as characterization but in other places again seeming to reinforce the film's patronizing attitude towards its characters and audience?.Brynner's performance ranks among the very best in the history of musical film. It's important that we do not see him sing or dance right away and in fact he waits until some of the film's final scenes to actually bust out on the dance floor. When he and Kerr go into Shall We Dance? and he is practically sprinting around the dance floor barefoot I'm sure many in the audience literally drop their jaws. In general we can say that Brynner's performance managed to capture both the menace dignity and authority of the King while at the same time he was able to wring buckets of humor from the premise of the King's attitudes about women and society in general without compromising that dignity. That alone is a great achievement but Brynner also manages to give the character great warmth and charm making him a very appealing character to the audience and almost making us feel that his many transgressions are just minor details in his overall makeup. Simply astounding work.Kerr is decent actually quite good through most of the film until it comes to the point where she has to be completely angry at the King because he would not let one of his wives escape with her lover. Then it seems like the work she's done to give this character equal dignity and almost equal authority with Brynner's King seems to collapse and we're left with the impression that she's a bit silly especially as she tells the Prime Minister Carlos Rivas I wish I had never come to Siam! and runs off crying. We have the same problem here dramatically speaking though to a lesser extent that we have in South Pacific when Nellie decides she can't love the frenchman because he has native children. This doesn't have those racial problems but it's equally unconvincing really as a dramatic stimulus making us feel that the primary character has somehow failed to learn what we the audience have learned just through watching them go through their travails! I also feel that the ending in general was a bit rushed. We have Anna going off in a pout crying and then in the very next scene not only is she leaving Siam but we hear the King of Siam is dying. All very abrupt and feels a bit forced as if the King had to go onto his deathbed just to wrap the film up.As far as the humor in the King's character although I admire the way Brynner was able to pull off all these elements there were times when I personally felt uncomfortable to laugh at the King... something I did not feel when I saw this film as a young child in the early 80s. I guess you can say I'm more racially conscious but it seemed to me that they were at times encouraging the audience to laugh at the King and even at his court simply because of how backward they were. For instance here we have a King who seems to have a good command of English but who mispronounces a word or skips a word in the sentence if it will make the crowd in America laugh. Not that I think the King should have spoken like an English professor but I'm convinced that there were moments where I and most modern audiences would cringe where the film's and play's creators would have wanted us to laugh.I didn't want these comments to pass without giving notice and praise to the Little House of Uncle Thomas vignette designed by Jerome Robbins I presume and which also shows some really amazing camera work. The effects here are very cinematic but it's done in such a way that you can believe that the things you're seeing could actually have been done in the 1860s when the film was set. Really excellent work on that portion of the film.Hammerstein's lyrics do not in my opinion rise to the level of Rodgers' music. The patter songs that Brynner does like A Puzzlement are wonderful but there are just too many songs on here that feel like an imposition of warm family vibes on the story. That's Hammerstein's MO create supremely dramatic situations and surround them with songs that wouldn't be out of place in a nursery school. Things like Hello Young Lovers Getting to Know You and I Whistle a Happy Tune make this musicals fan wish for the days of Rodgers and Hart when Rodgers' music could be funny without being so darn clean and family friendly. Something Wonderful is a technically superb song that is completely unmemorable an example of where Rodgers tried to imitate Kern's style to suit Hammerstein's ambitions. But the duo do make it up to us somewhat with the superb Shall We Dance and Rodgers' solo contributions like March of the Siamese Children.All in all this is a very solid musical entertainment. Because of Brynner's performance it is a true classic for all the ages. There is enough good here overall to outweigh the bad. This is one that people will be talking about many years after we are all gone. But it's not a perfect film.".

	onyx:emotionText "The wonderful performance of Yul Brynner is definitely the high point of this film adaption of Rodgers and Hammerstein's play. The production is very impressive with a fully fleshed out technicolor Siam practically bursting out of the screen. Deborah Kerr's costumes alone are just about worth the price of admission. The only thing bringing the film down somewhat is the fact that the film occasionally feels patronizing towards Asian culture and the sometimes deliberately infantile lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein excellent in some places as far as characterization but in other places again seeming to reinforce the film's patronizing attitude towards its characters and audience?.Brynner's performance ranks among the very best in the history of musical film. It's important that we do not see him sing or dance right away and in fact he waits until some of the film's final scenes to actually bust out on the dance floor. When he and Kerr go into Shall We Dance? and he is practically sprinting around the dance floor barefoot I'm sure many in the audience literally drop their jaws. In general we can say that Brynner's performance managed to capture both the menace dignity and authority of the King while at the same time he was able to wring buckets of humor from the premise of the King's attitudes about women and society in general without compromising that dignity. That alone is a great achievement but Brynner also manages to give the character great warmth and charm making him a very appealing character to the audience and almost making us feel that his many transgressions are just minor details in his overall makeup. Simply astounding work.Kerr is decent actually quite good through most of the film until it comes to the point where she has to be completely angry at the King because he would not let one of his wives escape with her lover. Then it seems like the work she's done to give this character equal dignity and almost equal authority with Brynner's King seems to collapse and we're left with the impression that she's a bit silly especially as she tells the Prime Minister Carlos Rivas I wish I had never come to Siam! and runs off crying. We have the same problem here dramatically speaking though to a lesser extent that we have in South Pacific when Nellie decides she can't love the frenchman because he has native children.

	schema:reviewBody "THE KING AND I has a remarkably convoluted history. Anna Leonowens 18311915 was indeed a real person who did indeed teach in the royal court of Siam. She did not allow fact to get in the way of a good story while her memoirs were extremely popular they were also fictionalized. They became further so in 1944 when novelist Margaret Langdon retold the story in the novel ANNA AND THE KING a play and film the latter with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison soon followed and proved popular as well. According to theatre lore actress Gertrude Lawrence one of the great talents of her era encountered the material and recommended it to Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein with the thought that she herself might play Anna in a musical version.Opening on Broadway in 1951 with Lawrence in the lead it proved a tremendous success. Sadly Lawrence did not live to recreate the role for the screen she died of cancer during the New York run. After much indecision and not a little argument the role fell to Deborah Kerra memorable actressbut one whose singing voice was hardly up to the role. In consequence the songs were voiced by the ubiquitous Marnie Nixon a performer who specialized in this work throughout the 1950s and 1960s.As a film THE KING AND I belongs to a period during which Hollywood tended to approach musicals from a theatrical rather than a cinematic point of view there is no pretense that we are any where but on a sound stage and the camera itself seldom moves creating an effect that is very much like that a performance given on a proscenium stage. It is a style which has not aged wellbut THE KING AND I is the exception that proves the rule with outrageously colorful sets brilliant costuming memorable music and remarkable performances it remains as enchanting as it was when it first debuted in 1956.It is also distinctly of its era in terms of casting. Voice aside Deborah Kerr was a natural choice for the role of Anna she too was a cultured Englishwoman. But although minor roles were generally played by people of Asian origin none of the leads and few of the major supporting roles were. Yul Brennar was of Russian origin Rita Moreno was Puerto Rican and like Kerr her singing voice would be dubbed Martin Benson Kralahome was English Carlos Rivera Lun Thai was MexicanAmerican and so on. Such would be quite unthinkable today but there is no getting around the fact that all these performers give performances which are not only credible but often extraordinarywith Brennar and Moreno cases in point.Regardless of who what why and how the end result is enchanting from start to finish the sort of musical that is stamped as a special event from start to finish. Everything glitters the music is among the best created by Rogers and Hammerstein the largerthanlife performances are spoton. The story itself is both endearing and touchingand as is often the case with Rogers and Hammerstein makes an oblique statement against racial prejudice. While it may not be good history the story so annoys the Thailand government that it is banned from that nation in all its many incarnations it is delightful entertainment... and in my opinion at least the best of the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals both on the stage and on the screen.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:text "    William Shakespeare's tale of tragedy of murder and revenge in the royal halls of medieval Denmark. Claudius brother to the King conniving with the Queen poisons the monarch and seizes the throne taking the widowed Gertrude for his bride. Hamlet son of the murdered King mournful of his father's death and mother's hasty marriage is confronted by the ghost of the late King who reveals the manner of his murder. Seeking revenge Hamlet recreates the monstrous deed in a play with the help of some traveling actors to torment the conscience of the evil Claudius. In a visit with his mother Hamlet expresses his anger and disappointment concerning her swiftly untimed marriage. Thinking a concealed spy in his mother's chamber to be the lurking Claudius he mistakenly kills the meddling counselor Polonius father of Ophelia and Laertes. Claudius on the pretext that Hamlet will be endangered by his subjects for the murder of Polonius sends the prince to England.";

	schema:headline " Memorable Acting by Olivier in Somewhat SlowPaced Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "This adaptation of Hamlet by Laurence Olivier he both starred and directed is a brooding somewhat slowmoving but also memorable version of Shakespeare's great play.  Olivier's personal performance as the Danish prince is by far the strongest aspect of the picture.Hamlet is one of the most complex and fascinating characters ever created and no two great actors ever play him quite the same way.  Olivier portrays him primarily as a man who could not make up his mind and his fine and often subtle acting brings to his role a deep understanding of his character's inner struggles and dilemmas both moral and practical.  He renders Hamlet's most famous lines in a distinctive way that reveal the many possible paths in Hamlet's future.  It is a performance not to be forgotten.If Olivier the actor is masterful Olivier the director is good but not perfect.  A great deal of Shakespeare's text was eliminated getting the running time down to 2 12 hours but even so there are times when the movie seems rather slowmoving especially in the first hour or so.  Most of the cuts involve interactions with the minor characters and some of the original play's minor roles are cut completely out of the film.  The result is to concentrate the emphasis even further on Hamlet himself and on his pessimistic meditations.  While this enables Olivier's fine acting to become even more prominent it does eliminate some very interesting portions of the story whose absence will be regretted by those viewers who love the play.Olivier does add some good touches though.  He emphasizes the somber tone with numerous tracking shots of the castle's gloomy corridors and staircases.  The filming of the famous sequence of events at the end is very good and is much livelier than the rest.While this is probably not the very best interpretation of the play Hamlet it is as good an interpretation of the character Hamlet as you will ever see.  For that reason alone it is must viewing for any fan of Shakespeare or of Olivier.".

	schema:headline " That Legendary Melancholy Dane";
	schema:reviewBody "With this film Sir Laurence Olivier set the standard as to how Shakespeare should be done on screen. His direction of his handpicked cast was flawless and his own straightforward interpretation of Hamlet is the one everyone else's is measured by.It was a straightforward interpretation because Shakespeare himself in the introduction says that Hamlet's tragedy is one in which his problem is that he couldn't make up his mind. Olivier opts for that and doesn't try to give any deeper meaning to Hamlet's indecision.For those who've never read the play or have seen it or studied in school Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark. He's Hamlet Junior. His father Hamlet Senior was the king and the king has died. But at the beginning of the play Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father and the father tells him he was murdered by his brother Claudius. Claudius took the title and married Hamlet's mother Gertrude. All this was done while Hamlet was away at school in Wittemberg.The ghost wants his son to revenge him understandable enough. But the story is Hamlet deciding one thing and then another moderating his course. His actions have everyone believing he's lost his mind. In the end it's tragedy all around.I've always thought that the key thing to remember is that Hamlet is the only one who heard the ghost. Some other palace personnel told him about some apparition making an appearance on one of the battlements of Elsinore Castle but Hamlet's the only one who's been told the tale. Therefore he's the only one who heard the story and he can't prove anything. The device of spirits visiting Shakespearean protagonists is one the Bard used with great effect. Here in MacBeth in Julius Caesar all of those visits meant someone was meeting their doom. But in Hamlet the ghost makes his appearance at the beginning of the play. Maybe if the ghost had revealed himself to Horatio to Polonius the Queen even Hamlet's duty would have been clear.In the supporting cast I liked Eileen Herlie as the Queen Jean Simmons as Ophelia Felix Aylmer as Polonius and most of all Terrence Morgan as Laertes. Laertes is an important character here. He's the son of the chief counselor in the court Polonius and brother of Ophelia who has a yen for Hamlet. In the beginning of the play Laertes takes off for France. Later towards the end he finds out the tragedy Hamlet has wrought upon both his father and his sister and Laertes has no trouble making up his mind what he's going to do. Quite a contrast to Hamlet's behavior.The film is moodily photographed in black and white. Olivier wanted to use color but J. Arthur Rank wouldn't spring for it. So he made due with black and white and the lights and shadows of Elsinore castle as shown almost make this version a kind of Shakespeare noir.I don't think subsequent versions with Nicol Williamson and Mel Gibson hold a candle to this one.".

Olivier's interpretation however is very dark. Very deliberate. He shies away from the humor completely and instead takes a slow purposeful tack. To that it might not appeal to some. In such a long play and movie the humor is sorta needed to jostle you a bit and break the overall bleakness of the tragedy. You don't catch a break here I'm afraid.

	schema:reviewBody "For years I've considered the classical soviet screenversion of Hamlet directed by Kozintsev 1964 as the best adaptation of the play. I still think it's a masterpiece however now it fills the second place in my preferences and the first one belongs to Lord Laurence Olivier. To begin with I was astonished to find out that scenery costumes and makeup in Kozintsev's film clearly resemble those from Olivier's version. No doubts our producer knew and appreciated earlier English movie and deliberately copied the settings. Well I don't blame him he used it successfully but the lack of originality is somehow disappointing.  The scenery is really wonderful cold gloomy dark gothic haunting and even more impressive for being blackandwhite. And then LORD LAURENCE OLIVIER IS THE BEST SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR EVER. No one else can make the 16th century Bard's text sound modern natural alive expressive exciting clear and full of hidden before meaning. Indeed soviet actors pronounce the text fantastically well but in Russian I mean in translation by talented Russian poet Pasternak. And recently I've become interested in reading and watching Shakespeare in original. And here Olivier is an unparalleled performer. He portraits his hero wonderfully. His Hamlet is dignified and noble reserved and mistrustful emotional and ruthless when he knows it is justified and deeply frustrated for he is disappointed in everyone except the foreigner Horatio. He is willing to act and yet waits to understand what's happening better. However events take an unexpected course and lead to the final tragedy. At the beginning Hamlet is called a man who couldn't make up his mind'. Well I would choose other words a man who changed his mind too often' but it wasn't his fault  so were circumstances. And Olivier presents these changes very vividly and truthfully. He makes To be or not to be' an unusually powerful scene showing Hamlet just a man who sees so much evil all around that he nearly commits suicide. He is stopped only by sudden understanding that death is unremediable and too frightening  natural thought for any sensible man brave as he is. Such simple variant pleases me better than more sophisticated ones. Somebody may disagree with Olivier's conception of the character but everyone has to admit that while Larry acts he creates complete convincing living image of his hero and very sympathetic by the way. I also would like to mention Jean Simmons. She seems to be severely misjudged by most reviewers.  Simmons is an excellent Ophelia  a simple naive young girl merely a child affectionate lighthearted playful flirting and exceptionally sensitive. An absolutely charming scene is that of Laertes' departure. Polonius makes his solemn speech and Ophelia all the time mischievously distracts attention of her brother. I like all Olivier's films for such amusing trifles. Gertrude is well chosen too quite believable. Eileen Herlie clear shows that at the end Gertrude understands her husband's wicked game and takes the poison consciously. However Claudius is not impressive enough to my mind.  To see a perfect thrilling Shakespearean villain you have to watch Kozintsev's film. Of course the play is noticeably cut. I confess I miss Hamlet's passionate soliloquy Is not this monstrous that this player here' and also Rosencrantz and Guildenstern they are important for Hamlet faces the treachery of friends in their part. On the other hand more complete versions are rather overlong. I am not sure that Branagh's four hours movie gains anything from using the full text. This film is dynamic and worth seeing not only for the sake of Lord Laurence's outstanding performance but because it is extraordinary interesting version of the familiar play.".

It seems that Olivier's father voiced by John Gielgud still roams the Earth as a spirit that walks around aimlessly unable to find Heaven or Hell Purgatory for the most part. Gielgud makes it clear that his brother Basil Sydney was the culprit in his death and Olivier becomes enraged. The fact that Sydney has become king by marrying the titled character's mother Eileen Herlie just makes the tension build. Herlie and Olivier's relationship pushes the envelope hard on a typical motherson bond there are incestuous tones abound here. Oscarnominee Jean Simmons appears to be Olivier's one true love but after a terrible tragedy she falls down a path of mental anguish. It appears that the only logical conclusion for Shakespeare's famed character is to have that famous sword fight dual with Simmons' brother Terence Morgan. Of course you know that not everything is the way it seems right? Hamlet was a surprising success in 1948. Produced in Britain and strictly a British project for all intensive purposes the film became a runaway hit with most all audiences and critics becoming the year's Best Picture Oscar winner. Shakespeare's plays have never really warranted excellence on the silver screen but this adaptation also by Olivier is about as close as we have seen thus far. The movie runs nearly three hours and I was about to fall asleep after the first 60 minutes the film is almost dragging to a crawl by that point but after the setup the movie soars very high. Lots of data that is somewhat confusing hogs up a little too much time when the pacing could have been much crisper. Olivier's spin on the timeless classic is truly uncanny nonetheless. His direction he was Oscarnominated in the category and vision are something to behold. The production values are strong and I ended up enjoying the movie for what it is and what it ultimately wanted to be. Olivier became the first of only two people presently to direct himself to an Oscar victory Roberto Benigni duplicated the feat with 1998's Life Is Beautiful. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

Stanley Holloway is good as the Gravedigger but somehow he doesn't nail the part the way Billy Crystal did in the 1996 version. Finally Peter Cushing is odd as Osric. The rest of the cast is either stiff or completely uninteresting.However other than some weak performances Olivier does a superb job directing everything.

	schema:reviewBody "Any film based on Shakespeare is worth seeing because the scaffolding is so rich that even a failure is interesting. And in the case of Hamlets we have several to compare. Here we have the celebrated Olivier Hamlet much celebrated.I see a few very strong elements with some blots and I suppose these have both become amplified with the passage of 50 years.First the blots Every actor but Olivier is of lesser caliber. I suspect that some of this is what he had to work with and some apparent clumsiness results from the then standard rendering of the Bard's works as speechifying. The women especially Ophelia are dreadful absolutely dreadful  Ophelia's only present because she screwed the boss. The score was so heavy so dated and so hard to ignore it almost made me turn away regardless of the balancing strengths. Hamlet's text presents problems. The best choice in my opinion is to keep it all as Branagh has. But the standard wisdom is that audiences won't sit through 4 hours no matter how engaging. Then the question is what to cut. One often keeps the wellknown speeches and cuts into the plot about ideas. So here we lose Fortinbras Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern together with some rather lovely related language and notions. Too bad because there is a development in the logic of metaphor in the later longer version of the play and this is totally lost here. Olivier insists on including the notion of Oedipus and Gertrude absolutely not supported by the text and only inferred if you don't understand that Hamlet's initial distress is because his succession has been interrupted not that his access to his Mother has been interrupted. Worse Olivier not only believes Hamlet is a 'man that couldn't make up his mind' but tells us so at the beginning! Does he not get it? Does he not understand the complexities of reason? This is not a play about doubt but about reasoning.Now the gems Even though Olivier gets the character wrong and has cut some good lines he has a natural talent for living well in the language. Even though he's coming from the wrong place and overly postures his rendering of the lines comes from a rare genius. Worth experiencing despite the surrounding distractions. The costumes are too lush for my tastes but they fit the set. And my what a set it is. Except for the cheesy painted sky this castle is pretty wonderful lots of colonnaded corridors mezzanines stairs aligned archways. Olivier may be trying to top archrival Orson Wells but I think he has done very well in using the building to frame the action in a way that is fully cinematic transcending the stage. The only effect that jarred was the thricedone long pullback when Claudius conspires with Laertes.The film is in Black and White. Olivier had no choice of course but it is a happy accident. Allows the photography to be more artistic better lit more abstract just as the mood of the play would have it.Bottom line This is worth seeing to discuss but the Branagh version is more true and has many fewer distracting blots.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece in spite of its significant cuts to the play";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the three Shakespearean plays adapted for the screen by Laurence Olivier this is the one with which I am the most familiar. It's been quite some time since I've read it or seen it performed but I would guess that Olivier cut a good third if not more of the play for this film version. Most significantly he entirely cut out the major characters of Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Fortinbras as well as quite a few minor ones. In spite of this however the story retains its general thrust  if not all the specifics  and the film is still magnificent as Olivier once again utterly excels as both an actor and a director. This was the first British or nonAmerican film to win the Best Picture Actor and Olivier became the first actor to win the Best Actor Oscar for a film that he directed himself. The only other person to accomplish this feat was Roberto Benigni in La vita  bella 49 years later. Although Olivier was nominated for twelve Oscars nine for Best Actor one for Best Supporting Actor and two for Best Picture this film was the only one for which he won any Academy Award.As the melancholy Dane Olivier is absolutely wonderful. While the cuts to Henry V meant that the title character was shown in a very positive light he did not hesitate  as either actor or director  here to emphasise his character's less desirable qualities such as his egotistical behaviour and his utter callousness when it comes to unintentionally killing Polonius. And yet Olivier's performance also draws attention to the character's psychological vulnerability after the murder of his father thus eliciting sympathy. His lust for revenge has cut him off from his emotions something which is also seen in his brutal rejection of Ophelia. Olivier also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father in the film and does a fantastic job in that role too.Speaking of Ophelia the 18yearold Jean Simmons is excellent playing the role with a remarkable level of subtlety for someone of her age and comparatively limited acting experience. In spite of playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude Eileen Herlie was almost eleven years younger than Olivier. While she unsurprisingly looks much younger than him her very strong performance and great voice meant that I forgot this rather odd age gap existed almost as soon as she opened her mouth. Felix Aylmer who played the Archbishop of Canterbury in Henry V has a far larger role in this film as Polonius and was certainly up to the task. He's just fantastic. Basil Sydney isn't as strong as I would have liked as Claudius but he is still very good. However I don't think that there is anyone in the film who gives a bad performance. Olivier had such a great eye for casting that it's a shame that he directed a mere five films. I wish that an artist  not usually a word that I use when referring to actors  of his calibre had been more prolific behind the camera. Aside from those actors that I have already mentioned I would like to single out Esmond Knight who unfortunately has a far smaller role than in Henry V John Laurie Terence Morgan Anthony Quayle and Stanley Holloway. In his first British film Peter Cushing  one of my favourite actors who like Olivier played Van Helsing years later  is good in the small supporting role of the foppish Osric but his performance isn't on the same level as most of his later ones. I have to say that I have never paid so much attention to the extras in a film as in this one! This is because three actors who became very well known in later years made uncredited appearances in the film Christopher Lee Desmond Llewelyn and Patrick Macnee. In only his third film Lee makes two blink and you'll miss them appearances just before the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. In the first instance he appears behind his future best friend and frequent on screen nemesis Peter Cushing in what was their first of 24 films together. Llewelyn was far easier to spot as he appears quite prominently in the background of several scenes. He actually has slightly more screen time than the credited Patrick Troughton who portrays the small but pivotal role of the Player King but doesn't have any lines. While I was on a constant lookout for Lee and Macnee the film's only two surviving cast members I didn't manage to spot the future John Steed. Acting aside the film looks fantastic. In contrast to the vibrant Technicolor of Henry V the film was shot in black and white. Apparently this was done more for financial than artistic reasons but the black and white cinematography adds to the sense of foreboding. The use of deep focus  probably inspired by Citizen Kane  is superlative. As with Orson Welles Olivier demonstrated that he was a master of not one but two crafts in a single film. Incidentally Olivier had hoped to make Macbeth after Henry V but the fact that Welles was working on his own version put paid to that idea. Macbeth has always been my favourite Shakespearean play so the fact that Olivier never got to make his version of it for the big screen is hugely disappointing particularly since it was considered one of his best roles  and that's really saying something  and it would have starred his then wife Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth.Overall the film is a masterpiece in spite of the fact that it cuts significant portions of the play. One of my Top 30 to 35 films of all time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of the three Shakespearean plays adapted for the screen by Laurence Olivier this is the one with which I am the most familiar. It's been quite some time since I've read it or seen it performed but I would guess that Olivier cut a good third if not more of the play for this film version. Most significantly he entirely cut out the major characters of Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Fortinbras as well as quite a few minor ones. In spite of this however the story retains its general thrust  if not all the specifics  and the film is still magnificent as Olivier once again utterly excels as both an actor and a director. This was the first British or nonAmerican film to win the Best Picture Actor and Olivier became the first actor to win the Best Actor Oscar for a film that he directed himself. The only other person to accomplish this feat was Roberto Benigni in La vita  bella 49 years later. Although Olivier was nominated for twelve Oscars nine for Best Actor one for Best Supporting Actor and two for Best Picture this film was the only one for which he won any Academy Award.As the melancholy Dane Olivier is absolutely wonderful. While the cuts to Henry V meant that the title character was shown in a very positive light he did not hesitate  as either actor or director  here to emphasise his character's less desirable qualities such as his egotistical behaviour and his utter callousness when it comes to unintentionally killing Polonius. And yet Olivier's performance also draws attention to the character's psychological vulnerability after the murder of his father thus eliciting sympathy. His lust for revenge has cut him off from his emotions something which is also seen in his brutal rejection of Ophelia. Olivier also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father in the film and does a fantastic job in that role too.Speaking of Ophelia the 18yearold Jean Simmons is excellent playing the role with a remarkable level of subtlety for someone of her age and comparatively limited acting experience. In spite of playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude Eileen Herlie was almost eleven years younger than Olivier. While she unsurprisingly looks much younger than him her very strong performance and great voice meant that I forgot this rather odd age gap existed almost as soon as she opened her mouth. Felix Aylmer who played the Archbishop of Canterbury in Henry V has a far larger role in this film as Polonius and was certainly up to the task. He's just fantastic. Basil Sydney isn't as strong as I would have liked as Claudius but he is still very good. However I don't think that there is anyone in the film who gives a bad performance. Olivier had such a great eye for casting that it's a shame that he directed a mere five films. I wish that an artist  not usually a word that I use when referring to actors  of his calibre had been more prolific behind the camera. Aside from those actors that I have already mentioned I would like to single out Esmond Knight who unfortunately has a far smaller role than in Henry V John Laurie Terence Morgan Anthony Quayle and Stanley Holloway. In his first British film Peter Cushing  one of my favourite actors who like Olivier played Van Helsing years later  is good in the small supporting role of the foppish Osric but his performance isn't on the same level as most of his later ones. I have to say that I have never paid so much attention to the extras in a film as in this one! This is because three actors who became very well known in later years made uncredited appearances in the film Christopher Lee Desmond Llewelyn and Patrick Macnee. In only his third film Lee makes two blink and you'll miss them appearances just before the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. In the first instance he appears behind his future best friend and frequent on screen nemesis Peter Cushing in what was their first of 24 films together. Llewelyn was far easier to spot as he appears quite prominently in the background of several scenes. He actually has slightly more screen time than the credited Patrick Troughton who portrays the small but pivotal role of the Player King but doesn't have any lines. While I was on a constant lookout for Lee and Macnee the film's only two surviving cast members I didn't manage to spot the future John Steed. Acting aside the film looks fantastic.

	schema:reviewBody "The writings of William Shakespheare are always accredited as being the greatest literary works in the history of western civilization. The film Hamlet won the academy award for best picture in 1948 suffice it to say that an accolade such as this merely scratches the surface on the brilliance of this Shakesphearian production!! So many famous quotes of Shakespheare's are from Hamlet Sweets to the sweet The dog will have his day There is something rotten in the state of Denmark Neither a borrower nor a lender be Get thee to a nunnery Sometimes Sister  These are some famous quotes from Hamlet. This literary masterpiece contains a list of world renowned soliloquies as well. Too too this flesh shall melt And of course To be or not to be These are some of the quotes and soliloquies. There are so many I have just rattled off a few!! When an actor or actress takes on a Shakesphearian endeavor it becomes an acutely sensitizing challenge for them which represents an artistic epitome in their careers!! Shakespheare evokes an absolute height in human creativity and the succinct polarization of both genders in Hamlet establishes a necessary storyline cohesiveness which is pertinent to all of the main characters in the movie. While a film like Hamlet is viewed as lofty in its disposition the actuality of Shakespheare's work is that such an idealism is very disconcerting! More often than not the esoteric philosophies which are so eloquently manifested from the romanticist characters in Shakespheare's works are usually vitiated with an emphatic desperation!! These Promethian philosophies are invariably preempted by the visceral components of perseverance. Shakespheare has always had a penchant for his characters to be provoked into agitated responses. Hamlet is an example of such emotions King Lear and Merchant of Venice are also such examples of these intense displays of rancor!! I have seen this version Hamlet many times. Sir Lawrence Olivier does a remarkable job at directing this film He also plays the role of Hamlet. Olivier won for best actor in 1948 with this role!! Olivier is a Shakesphearian aficionado who has the ability to carry off a successfully cunning articulation of Hamlet by astutely depicting its fatalistic irony!! The solemn imagery in Hamlet is extremely poignant!! Shakespheare had such a profound prescience with human emotions that he has manufactured an eternal impact on man's conception of what intellectually spellbinding literature should be!! I do like the 1948 performance better than the 1996 version with Glen Close and Mel Gibsonthe gripping enmity in the 1948 movie seemed more believable!! The fact that Hamlet won for best picture in 1948 is a very insignificant modicum of this movie's formidable allure!! Such an embodiment of pejorative candor which is illustrated in Hamlet became an enticing attribute to the film in which the movie viewer could easily appreciate!! The myriad of belligerent proclivities demonstrated by the part of Hamlet encompasses a mindset which nurtured an extremely tumultuous cerebral unrest!! This is the principle reason that Olivier's rendition of Hamlet is so incredibly stunning!!The cinematography is sensational in this film and the acting from virtually everyone with this presentation of Hamlet is paramount!! See this film!! It will elevate your intellectual awareness of Shakespheare and hopefully it will also enlighten your perspective of this great masterful work of Shakespheare's which became an academy award winning major motion picture!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the Presentational approach and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the Representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and sound.The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.Time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye Olivier's highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet Olivier made a declaiming selfimportant bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane  an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Olivier's tendency to enunciate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny Instead you must acquire and beget a tempurrance that may give it... Smoothness! Instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in Olivier's pupils give us that impression.Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet putting in a good essay at the Queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41 she was 26. The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given Olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! Sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed Hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn.

The latter focuses on the horrific actions to which greed drives people much like how Hamlet looks at vindictiveness. Neither offers a rosy view of humanity.The cold Gothic sets frame the story perfectly. Elsinore's dreary look does as much to emphasize the characters' futile existence as any of the actors do. I should note that I've never seen a stage production of Hamlet so I'm not the best person to offer a comparison to a live version. I understand that Olivier cut much of the story to condense the movie so that he could emphasize the psychological aspect. Even so he turned out a masterpiece becoming the first person to direct himself to an acting Oscar and giving us the first Best Picture winner not from the US. As for whether it was the year's best movie I'd rank it as equal to Treasure of the Sierra Madre with both offering devastating focuses on the human condition. Definitely see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are very few names that inspire people to become actors. Not movie stars but actors. Among them are Marlon Brando Bette Davis Katharine Hepburn and Sir Laurence Olivier. Having already some familiarity with the works of William Shakespeare by no means am I an expert but I know some things I judged it was time to see how Olivier himself treated one of the Bard's most famous works.Well the first impression I got from watching this movie is that it is quite obviously a labor of love. Olivier was an avid practitioner of Shakespeare and this movie is his tribute. And one thing I can say about this version of Hamlet is that it appears to be a more faithful interpretation rather than an adaptation with whole scenes taken out for the sake of time continuity andor to keep the audience's attention. While ambitious the results are mixed.First let's cover what I did like about the movie. On the top of that list is Jean Simmons as Ophelia. Her performance was nearly flawless as Hamlet's girlfriend who loses her mind after her father's death. Another surprise I spotted was character actor Stanley Holloway Liza's father in My Fair Lady as the gravedigger in the Alas poor Yorick scene. And the swordfight finale was well choreographed.Now for what I felt was lacking. Many of the actors in this movie particularly Basil Sydney who played King Claudius appeared wooden. Even Olivier himself looked like he had succumbed to mediocre performance at times. A lot of the lines sounded like they were phoned in and Polonius Felix Aylmer sounded too much like he was dispassionately reading from Poor Richard's Almanac while dispensing his wisdom to his children Ophelia and Laertes Terence Morgan.As Hamlet himself said The play's the thing but this is a play put on film. With that there is an inherent problem with its presentation Sometimes it doesn't translate well. While I am sure that on stage this was phenomenal on screen it is hitandmiss. But like I said it was a labor of love and it does mark two firsts in Oscar history The first movie directed by its star and the first independent film to win Best Picture.For purists and those who study Shakespeare this presentation is the one to watch. It's a nofrills cameraeye view of the play utilizing a single set. But this is not just another movie to watch for the sake of watching it. It has been said that true art has flaws and by that very definition Olivier's Hamlet is art warts and all.".

And the swordfight finale was well choreographed.Now for what I felt was lacking. Many of the actors in this movie particularly Basil Sydney who played King Claudius appeared wooden. Even Olivier himself looked like he had succumbed to mediocre performance at times. A lot of the lines sounded like they were phoned in and Polonius Felix Aylmer sounded too much like he was dispassionately reading from Poor Richard's Almanac while dispensing his wisdom to his children Ophelia and Laertes Terence Morgan.As Hamlet himself said The play's the thing but this is a play put on film. With that there is an inherent problem with its presentation Sometimes it doesn't translate well. While I am sure that on stage this was phenomenal on screen it is hitandmiss. But like I said it was a labor of love and it does mark two firsts in Oscar history The first movie directed by its star and the first independent film to win Best Picture.For purists and those who study Shakespeare this presentation is the one to watch. It's a nofrills cameraeye view of the play utilizing a single set. But this is not just another movie to watch for the sake of watching it. It has been said that true art has flaws and by that very definition Olivier's Hamlet is art warts and all.";

And I suppose at the time the staging and set might have seemed unique ?. But it just came across to me as VERY stagey and far too dependent on clouds of dry ice smoke for atmosphere.The setting also suffers from an odd combination of not enough people many scenes where nobody else seems to inhabit this big castle except Hamlet followed by too many people rooms suddenly fill up out of nowhere with hangerson and courtiers. The castle is just WAY too big and full of odd useless spaces that were probably meant to give you a sense of Hamlet's confusion and isolation but instead had me thinking about how big the soundstage must have been to build all these sets and what a pain it must have been to film and the tracking shots as the actors moved around. And the matched set of 6 trumpeters appearing out of nowhere to play elaborate fanfares every time the King walks by felt like something out of a Warner Bros. cartoon. I kept expecting them to turn sideways and be playing cards.The age thing? The fact that Olivier was 41 is not the problem. It's the fact that with the heavy theatrical makeup and bad blond dye jobwig he looks 52. Part of what Hamlet is about is the problem of being a young adult confronting big issues for the first time in your life. In this version you keep wondering why this middleaged man can't get it together.As for Olivier's talents  well he certainly does have the technical ability to speak Shakespeare in a way that generally makes sense of the words  but good phrasing is NOT the same thing as being able to ACT it well.In all there was not one aspect of this film that made me think it was worth watching it. It gets a 3 from me only on the strength of it being Shakespeare's text or at least some of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great mysteries of the 20th century is how Laurence Olivier gained his reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearian actors.  There is not a single Olivier version of a Shakespeare play that holds up today.  His Henry V is a piece of wartime propaganda though memorable as such.  His Othello is very nearly embarrassing though no worse than the Fishburne version it compares poorly to Welles's.  But his Hamlet is his most egregious error.The problem with Olivier is never in the acting itself but in the way he decides to play the character at the outset.  Once he decides to play Hamlet as a man who can't make up his mind his decisions make sense but what on earth made him interpret the character that way?Consider  Hamlet sees an apparition claiming to be his father who asks him to take revenge on his uncle and mother's new husband and king all three of which give him reason to expect Hamlet's loyalty. He then goes about trying to establish the truth of this charge before acting on it. When he does act the result is tragic.  Five deaths result and that is not counting the earlier deaths of Ophelia and Polonius who is killed the first time Hamlet strikes too precipitously.  It looks to me as if Hamlet is justified in delaying his actions as long as possible yet Olivier implies that a normal man would have come in from the battlements run up to his uncle's room and slit his throat immediately.  Put yourself in Hamlet's position  would you automatically trust a spirit that told you to commit murder just because it bore some resemblance to your father?  Or would you question its identity not to mention your own sanity?What Olivier seems not to understand is that Hamlet is fundamentally a man of action though a man of action who is aware that his actions have consequences. He is divided determined to act destructive when he does act and simultaneously disconnected from his actions.  Freud no doubt stole his concept of ego id and superego from the play just as he stole his misnamed Oedipus complex  it is really the Hamlet complex  from the same source.  Whenever I see the Olivier version I feel compelled to run out and watch the Zeffirelli version immediately Mel Gibson's fiery Hamlet though not perfect is a wonderful antidote to Oliver's ultimately anemic prince.As for the rest of the cast Jean Simmons Olivier's wife is adequate but the others are almost uniformly forgettable.  Certainly no one approaches the quality of Derek Jacobi as Claudius in Branagh's version.The production values are as with most British Shakespeare adaptations distressingly stagy.  The RSC Royal Shakespeare Company types are usually better actors than filmmakers.   It has taken people like Zeffirelli and Branagh yes he's British trained but considered quite radical to embrace the cinematic possibilities of Shakespeare instead of being bound by the conventions of theatre.None of this makes Olivier's Hamlet a film to avoid at all costs.  The writing is at the heart of most movies and you can't go wrong with the Bard.  But given the choice see the Branagh or the ZeffirelliGibson or even Nicol Williamson's version similarly stagy but at least with Anthony Hopkins as Claudius and a strange but interesting performance by Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia.One sidenote  If you want to use Olivier's title it is properly Lord Laurence not Sir.  He is the only actor of recent vintage maybe ever? to receive the higher honor.  Of course he always said Just call me Larry dear boy.".

	schema:reviewBody "It can't get better than Hamlet. Maybe the mostquoted English piece of all time Hamlet is a delicate piece that needs to be done right. In his 1948 black and white Best Picturewinning Hamlet Olivier delivered an adaptation that hung close to the letter and spirit of the original source but didn't dare to fly free. It certainly grasped the mood Shakespeare wanted but it doesn't take filming freedoms where the text allowed. Certainly he achieved the most freedom from the stage through the cinematography most noticeably the unique camera movements imitating the sound of a heartbeat that plays when the dead king's ghost is observed in anyway in the story.Hamlet feels more like a filmed version of the play rather than an adaptation. But at that it is amazing. The dark presence and tragic undertones grow through Olivier's Oscarwinning lead performance and Jean Simmons's crazed Ophelia. As the narrator states in the beginning of film This is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind. In the play and film Hamlet is visited by his father's the former king of Denmark ghost stating that his uncle now the king had murdered him. However Hamlet is unsure what action to follow for if he murders his uncle it would be repaying evil with evil. Unfortunately a mistake causes Hamlet to be exiled to England but he doesn't give up there and the story builds up to a climatic ending.Like the play itself Hamlet offers many questions but doesn't give any straightforward answers. The questions dive deep and along with Shakespeare's old English younger viewers might not understand. As with the play an undercurrent topic of incest plays out mostly through Hamlet's complaints against his uncle taking his father's widow as his wife. Furthermore the ending is dramatic and sad  with a lot of dead people.Olivier who has the skill to drop any obscure line of Shakespeare in a beat manages to work a scarcely worthy adaptation of the play despite having to cut many monologues and soliloquies in order to run under 160 minutes. One of the weak points of the film is Olivier's recitation of the famous soliloquy To be or not to be. To my disappointment Olivier rushes through it with melancholy and something short of fake that it doesn't have much dramatic and emotional impact. The play did not have any rule or details that restricted it from emotional freedom especially as a film. Olivier seems to restrict himself to rules that Shakespeare didn't put or intend. But otherwise Olivier's Hamlet is extraordinary in its own right. He portrays it in the way Shakespeare might have imagined it  the nonextravagant set pieces simply choreographed and bloodless duels and few select locations for different scenes. For the sources and educational material Olivier's Hamlet is worth watching but only for the artistic value of the spirit and letter of Shakespeare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Screen adaptations of Shakespeare have constantly changed in line with cinema. In the late 40s and early 50s the era of film noir the most prominent Shakespearean films were the tragedies  Macbeth 1948 and Othello 1952 by Orson Welles and Julius Caesar 1953 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and this version of Hamlet perhaps the darkest of them all by the man who made Shakespeare cinematic Laurence Olivier.Despite being centuries old the plot of Hamlet sounds like the archetypal film noir  treachery revenge ironic tragedy ambiguous morality and most importantly of all a central character who repeatedly suffers through his own lack of willpower and for whom there is no hope of a happy ending. The lines of Shakespeare's play were themselves to inspire a few noir screenwriters. Most notably Leave her to heaven is both a line spoken by the king's ghost in reference to the queen and the title of a noir made in 1946. Also the king's final plea to remember me are echoed by the last words of Cloris Leachman in Kiss Me Deadly  probably a deliberate reference by writer Mickey Spillane. However Olivier in return borrows the style of film noir for this extremely bleak and psychological adaptation. He places great emphasis on Hamlet's indecisiveness and inner turmoil. The cinematography is also in the noir fashion of the day  in fact this has to be literally one of the blackest films ever made the only light coming through pinpricks in vast swathes of black.As well as noir Olivier borrows stylistically from the horror genre. The scenes in which the king's ghost appear are exceptionally eerie. Throughout there is an atmosphere of quiet unease which occasionally give way to bursts of hysteria  such as when the king breaks down during the player's performance shouting get me some light! The style here is reminiscent of Powell and Pressburgers' Black Narcissus 1947 which itself was notable for being a drama played like a horror. This touch was itself influential on later Shakespeare adaptations  Welles' Othello and Kurosawa's Throne of Blood based on Macbeth both contain elements of horror.Olivier's Hamlet is also a product of 1940s British cinema when Powell and Pressburger's creed of total cinema reined supreme. With Henry V in 1944 Olivier had shown how Shakespeare could be shorn of staginess without watering down the quality of the original material. Here again he uses contemporary technique and his own individual style to show the story in a cinematic form. A notable example are Hamlet's soliloquies spoken by voice over to show them for what they are supposed to be  an internal monologue. He even has the odd line or two spoken allowed and yet within a month! to give it added weight. Olivier's use of space is exceptional  his camera prowls around a labyrinthine castle set with such a bizarre geometry it's almost like being inside an MC Escher drawing. Often what with the lighting the walls of each room disappear completely making the spaces seam even more cavernous and isolating.As he did with his Henry V Olivier blends a commanding stagelike performance with moments of more cinematic restraint. He is hypnotic here  surely no stage Hamlet ever looked quite so much like a man out of his mind. The rest of the cast is fantastic  it reads like a who's who of great British film stars of the day. One notable omission is Ralph Richardson though he would get his moment in Olivier's Richard III 1955.Aside from its quality and influence Hamlet made history at the Oscars. It was the first nonUS feature to win Best Picture the first time a Best Actor winner had directed themselves as well as being the first and to date only Shakespeare adaptation to win Best Picture. In spite of all this it tends to be somewhat overlooked today. Olivier's three Shakespeare adaptations are leaders in the field and deserve more attention.".

Olivier's use of space is exceptional  his camera prowls around a labyrinthine castle set with such a bizarre geometry it's almost like being inside an MC Escher drawing. Often what with the lighting the walls of each room disappear completely making the spaces seam even more cavernous and isolating.As he did with his Henry V Olivier blends a commanding stagelike performance with moments of more cinematic restraint. He is hypnotic here  surely no stage Hamlet ever looked quite so much like a man out of his mind. The rest of the cast is fantastic  it reads like a who's who of great British film stars of the day. One notable omission is Ralph Richardson though he would get his moment in Olivier's Richard III 1955.Aside from its quality and influence Hamlet made history at the Oscars. It was the first nonUS feature to win Best Picture the first time a Best Actor winner had directed themselves as well as being the first and to date only Shakespeare adaptation to win Best Picture. In spite of all this it tends to be somewhat overlooked today. Olivier's three Shakespeare adaptations are leaders in the field and deserve more attention.";

	schema:reviewBody "And none the worse for it since every Bond film needs a fresh spin on the same old formula. Roger Moore's first outing as JB is in equal measures comical and actionpacked. You'll never get bored. But it's definitely the weirdest Bond ever with loads of utterly bizarre moments.It begins with M turning up at JB's house in the early hours while he's pumping some Italian agent for information don't you just love his initialled dressing gown. Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from QBranch including a very useful watch. Q himself or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name doesn't make any appearance in this one.Standing out like a Muslim in an airport almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big's payroll. And they've got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him. The funny thing about Moore is that he's very proper and British and doesn't think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh. His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny.The action then moves to Lousiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot. There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do many times over Solitaire Mister Big's Tarot card reader.I'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hookhanded maniac called TeeHee a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away. When will they learn?Despite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond at 46 Moore does look younger than Connery. And while Sean was gruff and Scottish Moore is perpetually calm and refined even in the face of danger fingers being choppedoff snake in the bath being eaten by gatorssharks. Everything that the British once thought they were. He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked. While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise Moore has always been my favorite. And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual wimpy as hell Walther PPK.And as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney you gotta love that theme song! Exciting and iconic at the same time. And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever. MI6 Harlem Pimps Paul McCartney Gators Heroin Voodoo Snakes Sharks Clairvoyance Rednecks Afros Fake Afros Fillet of Soul Human Scarifice Scarecrows and a smallheaded man in a TopHat who lost a fight with chickens. Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane?".

	schema:headline " A new era for James Bond and a fairly effective and enjoyable opening film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Live and Let Die ushers in Roger Moore as the new James Bond. Prior to this movie Bond had been played most often by Sean Connery with the one exception being George Lazenby's shortlived stint in 1969 On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Moore is very different to Connery and Lazenby. He plays Bond as a more relaxed charming humorous character. Over the years many people have said that the Moore incarnation of Bond lacks the brutality of Connery's and the hard masculinity but actually Moore is not the kind of actor to do Bond in that manner. He's merely playing to his own strengths and creating a Bond that is akin to his acting style. I feel that Roger makes a perfectly likable 007 admittedly different to the character of the novels but still a rousing screen hero.The story has James Bond sent to solve the killing of three British agents. One was killed in New York one in New Orleans and the third on a voodoopractising Caribbean island. Bond's starts his mission in New York where he runs across a nasty black gangster named Mr Big and his gorgeous tarotreading accomplice Solitaire Jane Seymour. Bond heads down to the Caribbean where he connects Mr Big with a drugsmuggling bigshot named Dr Kananga. Then it's off to New Orleans where Bond discovers that Kananga's master plan is to provide huge amounts of free heroin to the junkies of the world creating a massive drugreliant population and setting himself up as a supplier with a worldwide monopoly on the drug trade.The title song sung by Paul McCartney and Wings is one of the best of the series a lively and powerful tune which fits the style and period of the film perfectly. Yaphet Kotto is a decent bad guy his death scene at the end is both funny and memorable Seymour is superb as the Bond girl probably the best of the bunch apart from Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me. There are good set pieces as we have grown to expect from the Bond series most notably a spectacular boat chase around the Louisiana bayous a scene involving a bunch of hungry crocodiles and a slick sequence featuring Bond's escape from corrupt island police aboard a slow and lumbering double decker bus. The film has some negatives but not too many. The character of Baron Samedi doesn't fit in the film check out that ludicrous closing shot which seems to be hinting that Samedi is somehow immortal and Clifton James's brash southern cop is an immature and irritating character who might just as well have been left out of the final cut. On the whole this is a good start to the Moore era though. One point of interest Live and Let Die also features a scene in Bond's house at the very start..... only once before have we seen where Bond lives and that was at the start of Dr No.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was Roger Moore channeling Austin Powers in 1973? There's a scene in this his first goround as 007 where Bond is tied up and his arm is cut to draw blood and attract some hungry sharks swimming below. Moore twitches his eyebrow and asks Perhaps we can try something in a simpler vein.Those sharks don't need any frickin' laser beams on their heads to get you to smell the Austin. Moore gets a lot of blame for turning the Bond movies into weaklyplotted farces ignoring that the series had been moving in that direction since Goldfinger and that the previous installment Sean Connery's final EON bow Diamonds Are Forever was every bit as goofy. Also Moore could deliver a more serious Bond when the script allowed and two of the finest Bonds ever The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only were his.But there's no getting around this Live And Let Die is a dumb movie. The gadgets are silly the villain's scheme is illdefined the storyline is frenetic and unengaging the action is plodding and overlong. Moore starts out not quite know how to play Bond here while the movie requires him to play the fool sauntering through Harlem in a doublebreasted suit like the Prince of Wales waiting for some natives to show him around.But this film makes me smile in part because I'm young enough to remember what it was all about when it came out. If this was Bond for the cheap seats it at least delivered the goods with some vivid supporting characters a knockout visual style amazing title music from Paul McCartney and most importantly for Moore's future in the series dropdead quips. My favorite is when the nasty Tee Hee twists his pistol muzzle out of shape with a metal pincer arm then giggles when he hands it back Funny how the least little thing amuses him.Julius Harris is menacing but charming as Tee Hee mostly mute except when he sticks Bond in a gator pond and suggests the best way to disarm the beasts is to try and pull out their teeth. Chief villain Yaphet Kotto has his moments too but with odd shifts of character. In the beginning he's stonecold Ron O'Neal in Superfly and at the end he's plummy Charles Gray in Diamonds Are Forever. Jane Seymour is Bond's love interest and why she goes off with him is another of those things best not thought about long.There are two great characters in this movie though bigger than just about anything seen in a Bond movie before who kind of work in tandem in overhauling any objections about this film being too cartoony. Clifton James is redneck sheriff J.W. Pepper who throws off one madman line after another while Bond is off on one of his long silly chase scenes. James mugs through every scene he's in rolling his tongue around playing off everyone and everything and delivering every hackneyed Southern stereotype to such righteous perfection it's enough to make cotton sprout out of his ears. Bond purists who whine should just take their vodka martinis shaken not stirred and let the rest of us enjoy the craziness. The series is supposed to be fun if you want serious espionage go watch Smiley's People. I grant you Pepper shouldn't have returned in the next Bond film that was a mistake.The other great outsized character is Geoffrey Holder as perhaps the most mysterious figure in the whole series Baron Samedi. Is he supernatural? Is he just crazy from the heat? He's certainly different a guy who sides with the bad guys without quite being one of them. The alwayseerie quality of his appearances either dancing in a big hotel production number or quietly sitting in a cemetery playing a flute make you question whether there ain't something to that voodoo after all.It's silly bashing Pepper but praising Samedi they are both equally so unreal in a way that's in tune with the rest of the movie. The best thing to do is enjoy the different kinds of fun on offer. Frankly not having these guys around might push this film on the bad side of Spinal Tap's fine line between stupid and clever the side where A View To A Kill and Moonraker are on.But Live And Let Die is a winner. It's a fun movie that brings me back to younger days when my heart was an open book. It's a nice transitional film for the series in that Moore managed a mostly smooth entrance to the role of Bond. And it has one of the best final shots in movie history. That's all I'll say there you know it if you saw it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Live and Let Die is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Tom Mankiewicz from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore Yaphet Koto Jane Seymour David Hedison Julius W Harris Gloria Hendry Earl Jolly Brown Clifton James and Geoffrey Holder. Music is scored by George Martin and cinematography by Ted Moore.Bond 8 and 007 is assigned to investigate the recent murders of MI6 agents in New Orleans San Monique and New York. Suspicion falls on San Monique ruler Dr Kananga a man who has definite links to Harlem crime lord Mr Big. As 007 digs deeper he uncovers a plot to corner the world's heroin market but halting such a plan is hindered by the presence of voodoo in his midst.Connery was gone for good this time no amount of cash would entice him to don the tuxedo for a legitimate Bond movie again....... This meant that producers Broccoli  Saltzman would be showcasing the third actor to play James Bond in a four year period! After the fall out of the casting of Lazenby in OHMSS it was agreed that a established actor was needed this time around. Timothy Dalton was mooted as he was for OHMSS he was never offered the role though until 1986 but it came down to just two actors Roger Moore  Michael Billington. Billington would screen test for the role of 007 a few times in his life but never landed the coveted role as a sweetener he got to play a minor character in 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me. So Roger Moore it was someone the producers knew quite well and who was well in vogue after starring in The Persuaders and The Saint. He also was honoured to play the role wanted it badly and accepted the fanaticism that went with it.Moore's take on Bond the man was a world away from Connery and rightly so but Live and Let Die is not far removed from Connery's last outing Diamonds Are Forever. In truth it's a weak script with Mankiewicz probably under orders from above to play to Moore's strengths and keep the overt humour and cartoon escapades as a selling point. The decision to pitch Bond into a world of voodoo is a good one and it was not as some believe an attempt to grasp the tails of the Blacksploitation market that had made waves in the early 70s. It's a better film than Diamonds Are forever without doubt. The villains are memorably played though Kananga's Koto demise is indicative of the daftness that would blight many Bond movies from here on in and in Hamilton's hands the action especially an adrenalin pumping speedboat chase is quality entertainment. Top blunderbuss theme tune too from Paul McCartney  Wings. While Felix Leiter is back on good charming form in the hands of Hedison a real life friend of Moore and it shows.Problems elsewhere though stop this from being a great Bond movie. Much of the film is made up of scenes that are played purely for smiles rather than for dramatic purpose. In short a Bond movie has stopped taking itself seriously. The introduction of Sheriff Pepper James is pointless the beautiful Seymour shows promise but then becomes one of those Bond girls who is a liability to 007 outside of the bedroom and the film is padded out with scenes that offer nothing important to the story. Hendry's Rosie Carver is a dope and poorly written though it gave Bond his first interracial dalliance something that the producers were nervous about behind the scenes. While there's no Q! And George Martin's score is very hit and miss.A new actor playing Bond and many failings in the picture could Bond still succeed? Yes indeed! Moore in spite of not getting good page to work from and getting stick from the critics put his own stamp on the role by looking smooth having an excellent vocal delivery and being someone the girls wanted to bed and the boys wanted to be. The box office sang to the tune of over 160 million over 40 million more than Diamonds Are Forever. The tagline ran More Action More Excitement More Adventure though not entirely accurate there was indeed an abundance of fun play and gadgets are us Felix Lighter priceless. Bond was set to continue coining it in for the foreseeable future but the dye had been cast and Bond ran the risk of becoming purely a cartoon caricature..... 710".

While investigating Bond falls foul of both despite gaining the affections of Kananga's beautiful mistress Solitaire.Roger Moore's first Bond is one of his best.  The film wisely steps away from those regular bad guys the Russians and gets a new feel by actually having nonwhite main characters.  The plot is pretty good and doesn't have the usual take over the world' feel to it.  There is plenty of silly stuff of course but the stunts are quite good and Bond has a new line in eyebrow raised' humour.Moore will never be the best Bond but he did make the role his own  adding an element of selfdeprecating humour to the role.  Yaphet Kotto is a good actor and makes a good bad guy.  Jane Seymour isn't convincing as the mystic property of Kananga  she really should have been played by a black actress and it shows a lack of bravery on the side of the producers that they went with a white face as the lead Bond girl.  Julius Harris is good as Tee Hee and Clifton James adds some comedy value as J.W. Pepper.Overall this is one of Moore's best Bond movies and certainly stands out from previous films with numerous Russian baddies.  Also the theme music is a really fun song from Wings.".

While the background voodoo theme is suitably bizarre the main McGuffin about drugs smuggling is rather underwhelming for a Bond movie. Yaphet Kotto is a potentially strong baddie but has too little to do amid the familiar carnage and boat chases. And the introduction of the series' first outrightly comic character in Sheriff JW Pepper presaged the selfdefeating lapse into selfspoofing the films would increasingly take.Nor does a heavyhanded score by Beatles producer George Martin help. Unlike regular Bond composer John Barry's music Martin's is ponderous overlaid onto the action rather than organic to it.Still Paul McCartney's blistering titlesong really jolts Bond into the 70s. And Live and Let Die does have one of the best jokes in the entire series in the opening sequence when a CIA agent watching a New Orleans jazz funeral innocently asks a nondescript fellow bystander Who's funeral is it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Updating Ian Fleming's most controversial novel Live And Let Die the producers writer Tom Mankiewicz and director Guy Hamilton choose to embrace the action packed comical Bond film as seen in the previous Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. Unlike that film which turned out to be a very mixed bag it works here.Roger Moore's debut as Bond sets up the tone of the films to come. Roger is more comic than Connery or Lazenby and in his later films is stuck with very bad one liners. But here Bond's one liners are mostly well written and while Roger is mostly comedic when a serious moment comes Roger for the most part can play well. Roger makes his own Bond and steps out of Connery's shadow so well that it is extremely hard to make a comparison. On the down side the more comedic 007 doesn't help the film in the realism department and that hurts the film quiet a bit.In the casting of Solitaire Jane Seymour fits Ian Fleming's description of the character to perfection. Not only does Seymour look the part she also plays the part well. Given that in both the novel and the film Solitaire is a poorly defined character who Bond saves at every possible chance Jane Seymour plays the role with believability that is rarely matched by an any other Bond girl. While some of the lines are clich the tarot card and ESP abilities of Solitaire give Seymour a chance to show off her considerable talents that have only improved over the years since this film.In Doctor Kananga we get the first African American villain in a Bond film. Yaphet Kotto brings considerable menace to the character that is turned on and off as Kananga is both a public figure and then as drug lord Mister Big. It must be noted the well done plot twist of Mister Big being Kananga though it doesn't make a lot of sense. Two things ruin an otherwise memorable character his death. His death is completely absurd and doesn't even seem realistic.The supporting cast is mainly African American actors and actresses playing villains. That fact brings out the fact that while this a 007 adventure it is also jumping on the blaxplotation bandwagon of the early 1970's and serves to date the film. Those actors are underwritten and way too often used for comic relief. Rosie Carver is another example. She is an interesting character who is underwritten to the extreme and we come off not caring that she is dead.While on the subject of the supporting cast it should be note that David Hedison makes a great Felix Lieter. The bad memory of Norman Burton's Lieter as this Bond and Lieter share a very believable friendship. It is only a shame that the character doesn't appear again for 14 years as he could have added a lot to the Moore films. If there is one outstanding example of a bad character in this film it has to be Sheriff J.W. Pepper. This type of character is out of place in a Bond film and one almost wonder's what everyone was thinking when this character was added. Most if Pepper's lines are cringe worthy though the scene at the end of the boat chase where Pepper confronts Bond is the film's best comedic moment.The film can be best viewed as a chase film. The film is really a bunch of chases that the plot revolves around. While this is usually the kiss of death for any film look at 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies for example it works here. The chases are well done and despite thirty plus years of other action films are exciting. The tension in the film is primarily found in these chases and fights that test's the abilities of 007. While humor fills these chases which ruined many chase sequences in Diamonds Are Forever it works here. If there is anything to complain about these chases it is the occasional lack of music. This is no more apparent than in the film's best chase the boat chase.The boat chase is the film's lengthiest sequence and with good reason. The boat chase takes us across the buoy and showcases some amazing stunt work. The chase is occasionally hampered down by appearances by J.W. Pepper and his merry band of idiot cops. The chase is one of the better sequences to appear in the series and has truly stood the test time.The music for the film marks a milestone in the Bond films. This was the first time ever John Barry didn't compose any music for the film. George Martin a long time Beetles producer was hired to the score and he created the best nonBarry Bond score until David Arnold's score for Tomorrow Never Dies 24 years later. The score has a great feel to it and doesn't feel dated at all. Martin is however guilty for leaving some of the action unscored. The boat chase is for the large part unscored but when the music comes on the excitement. Martin does a very good take on the James Bond Theme and the film's score is built around an excellent main title song. The song is an unabashed rock song but it fits very well with Maurice Binder's title sequence.With a good main cast a shaky supporting cast good action sequences an excellent tile song and a wonderful score by George Martin Live And Let Die saved James Bond. Though when it is viewed in context with the rest of the series it comes off as above average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Moore who was always more of a clown in a tuxedo than a believable secret agent despite the occasional good moment kicks off his run as James Bond in Live and Let Die which has him fighting against a heroin smuggling operation. Live and Let Die is a slightly above average and overall a good Bond flick. This time it feels smaller scale and slightly less over the top although it has the action comedy tone which would define the Roger Moore era. Ludicrous yet rooted in the real world and centred on a very real issue rather than world domination or diamond lasers LALD manages to get the tone right. I have never liked Roger Moore as Bond although he's not completely awful here. He would get really terrible in some later films though. There are 3 main action sequences The film has a fairly quiet first half which is pretty effective before the finale and all 3 of these are solid and entertaining. The finale is a let down although it does have That immortal one liner.The villain is fairly dull and the film is arguably the most sexist Bond movie of them all. Anyone who has watched even only a few of these films will know that is truly saying something. LALD does feel dated at times and doesn't always feel like a Bond film although that doesn't let the film down particularly. The novel was better and it's strange some elements from the book were left out. LALD suffers also from over length and pacing issues but overall even if it doesn't match the book it's a good Bond film and a very watchable one. It's better on a second viewing as the lack of action in the first hour is surprising the first time you watch it. This stands as the third best of the Roger Moore era behind For Your Eyes Only and The Spy Who Loved Me. There's still a hint of Ian Fleming in the movie unlike the other Roger Moore Bond films with the exception of For Your Eyes Only. To conclude this is a good time and an entertaining Bond film although not one of the more memorable outings in the franchise.710".

With the further benefit of hindsight in having seen most of what followed and preceded Live and Let Die I think we're all able to deduce that the film was indeed a stark change to usual proceedings here is the Bond film that featured a scene whereby people fell backwards into coffins full of snakes here is the Bond film whereby we are plunged during the pre credits sequence no less into ritualistic killings accompanied by blaring trumpet scores. Here is the Bond film wherein people tear away parts of their face manage to survive having sections of their scalps blown off by well placed Magnum rounds and have the ability to see into the future. Even the immediate trainset ending to the piece is a full blown antiBondian antimainstream slice of ambiguous open ended film making designed to force a complete revaluation on where we now stand in terms of whether things are as wrapped up as they seem.Moore's bow as James Bond begins with him in the company of a young woman whilst located in what is a rare instance within his actual house. It doesn't take long for this constant burning sense of urgency the film has to establish itself when there is a visitor at the front door in the form of his boss M Lee along with ally Moneypenny Maxwell  the pair of them paying him this visit ridiculously early in the morning. Where previous instances of debriefing or mission assigning have taken part during the compared to this far more relaxed even leisurely locale of M's office during normalised hours this is here and now and in Bond's house such is the importance. The reasoning behind this pushing of the panic button lies with the separate events propping up the pre credits sequence whereby three separate deaths at three separate and somewhat disparate locations took place. The first a British representative at the United Nations building on account of a mysterious Black hand obtaining access to a place one would think is rather tight with security sets the scene for a then road side assassination causing the entire street and mock funeralparade to begin cheering before things are rounded off with an extravagant ritual involving a hapless White individual at the mercy of a deadly snake bite precipitated by an array of Black cultists.Bond's task begins in New York City where he investigates along with the help of the C.I.A. a powerful political figure known as Kananga Kotto whose remorseless expression filled the frame in the United Nations building during the opening. There is a quite brilliant moment in a public bar ruthless if only for the choreography of the sequence whereby Bond swaggers in expecting to dominate proceedings although ends up facing down the barrel of a gun in a completely new zone populated by the very people he's there to foil. The process of placing him there to begin with having him offer the waiter a bribe for information having the wall seat at which he is positioned do what it does and then have the waiter swipe the money from his hands before turning around and taking a sip out of the very drink Bond ordered for himself is a sharp rapid and cutting series of instances reiterating how much control these people have over their domain.Things progress to the Caribbean the nation of Jamaica doubling up for a fictional island country of similar geographical locale named San Monique a strange place an eerie and seemingly backwater zone populated by these very specific individuals who move and dance and perform in a very unique and very uncanny way. Knocking around is the tarot reader Solitaire Seymour a girl whose own plight of independence and ascent into womanhood is just as interesting as Bond's investigative strand as she begins to clash with Kananga's established patriarchy. It is first established how her mother once worked for the same man doing the same thing and that she lost her abilities something that is later revealed to be more broadly linked to the of a finding a man and falling for them. The use of the word Solitaire to double up for Jane Seymour's character's name traditionally speaking a card game one plays alone infers degrees of individuality or being by one's self. Bond's entrance into her life does well to spawn a character driven process that pushes Solitaire away from being the pretty supporting female and into someone deciding not to be tied down to loyalty to a tyrant.Certainly Live and Let Die was always a stranger and less conformative Bond entry which still somehow managed to find a way to wedge in all the codes and conventions synonymous with it. Indeed Bond is torn from the world of espionage or the warring with the Soviets and instead placed into a domain that sees him go up against the illegal drug trade. These are sociopolitical ideas not necessarily revisited nor previously explored under Sean Connery until Timothy Dalton's two outings whereby he battled the Latin American drug trade under a familiar guise of the revenge framework in 1989's License to Kill and according to some academics found time to conform to an antiAids repertoire in 1987's The Living Daylights when someoralot was made of the fact the usual interests Bond has in arrays of beautiful women was more muted. Things feel different in Live and Let Die and yet it is all at once pleasingly familiar in that way Bond films should be.".

I have always liked Moore's Bond and For Your Eyes Only can be used as a 007 film that shuts up his critics who consider him a failure as the elusive secret agent.Yaphet Kotto is in fine form as Ambassador of a Caribbean island of San Monique with a major heroine operation extending to both American cities New York and New Orleans. Kotto's Kananga has eyesgunmenspies everywhere his advanced network has quite the tentacles so Bond will certainly have his hands full. While I cringe at the Voodoo culture exhibited on display as the cultural stereotypes are exploited to their maximum there are characters who make the most of their roles such as clawhanded Julius Harris as Tee Hee Geoffrey Holder and that devious smile as dangerous Voodoo Priest Baron Samedi and the seemingly a sweetheart agent in the Caribbean Gloria Hendry who turns out to be working both sides out of fear of what Kananga will do to her. Others show up such as Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea's David Hedison as Bond's New York American CIA contact Clifton James in an illadvised tobaccochewing hick sheriff JW Pepper always spouting Boy! to everyone he finds egregious  and the incredibly beautiful Jane Seymore as Kananga's tarot card reader clairvoyant Solitaire who becomes Moore's Bond girl.The action sequences include an extended motor boat chase that seems to go on forever played for humorous effect such as when it flies across roads causing wrecks by those chasing him leading one boat into a rich man's pool another into Pepper's cop car and a third through a wedding reception! Bond's ingenious if totally ludicrous escape from encroaching crocs and Bond's use of a Cessna plane to avoid Kananga's boys killing him. A funeral procession in New Orleans cleverly is used by Kananga to rid himself of spies guarding his headquarters Bond puts a magnetic watch to good use on several occasions when in hairy situations and how a gas pellet is used to pop Kananga has to be seen to be believed. That double decker bus and hand glider establish the kitchen sink rule that the filmmakers wanted Moore's Bond to use every form of transportation possible in his first outing as 007.".

Others show up such as Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea's David Hedison as Bond's New York American CIA contact Clifton James in an illadvised tobaccochewing hick sheriff JW Pepper always spouting Boy! to everyone he finds egregious  and the incredibly beautiful Jane Seymore as Kananga's tarot card reader clairvoyant Solitaire who becomes Moore's Bond girl.The action sequences include an extended motor boat chase that seems to go on forever played for humorous effect such as when it flies across roads causing wrecks by those chasing him leading one boat into a rich man's pool another into Pepper's cop car and a third through a wedding reception! Bond's ingenious if totally ludicrous escape from encroaching crocs and Bond's use of a Cessna plane to avoid Kananga's boys killing him. A funeral procession in New Orleans cleverly is used by Kananga to rid himself of spies guarding his headquarters Bond puts a magnetic watch to good use on several occasions when in hairy situations and how a gas pellet is used to pop Kananga has to be seen to be believed. That double decker bus and hand glider establish the kitchen sink rule that the filmmakers wanted Moore's Bond to use every form of transportation possible in his first outing as 007.";

	schema:reviewBody "Live and Let Die 1973 is the eighth James Bond movie in the official series. It takes its name from the second Ian Fleming book but aside of that has relatively little to do with the book. It is directed by Guy Hamilton his third Bond movie and stars for the first time Roger Moore as the secret agent. The opening theme is by Paul McCartney.Three different secret agents are killed and James Bond is sent to New York to investigate. Bond becomes convinced that Dr. Kananga primeminister of small Caribbean island is involved in the killings. Bond follows Kananga to his island where he finds that Kananga uses an old voodoo cult to keep the superstitious locals from finding his heroin fields. Bond also meets Solitaire a young priestess working for Kananga.Live and Let Die used to be one of my favorite Bond films as a kid and it's a good start for the Roger Moore era. It's got plenty of action starting with Bond trying not to get killed in Harlem then trying not to get eaten by alligators and having a nearly epic boat chase scene. Looking this film now years later however does make me realize that it is a bit longer than would really be needed. Still it's a pretty entertaining movie and not as silly as the previous Diamonds Are Forever.Roger Moore's take on Bond is one of those things that people seem to either hate or love. Some people complain that Moore made Bond too comical too humorous even a joke. While it's true that Moore does bring more humor to the character than any other actor I've seen he's by no means bad. Moore's Bond is still charming witty and always ready to take action.In other roles we have young Jane Seymour as the priestess Solitaire a potentially interesting but ultimately rather forgettable Bond girl and Yaphet Kotto seems to be having fun playing the villain Kananga. Clifton James has a funny little role as the redneck sheriff who thinks of Bond as the enemy of humanity number one.All in all Live and Let Die is not a bad Bond movie it just doesn't reach its full potential either. It's still a good watch and a fine opening for the Roger Moore era. Above average.".

I appreciate the way Jane is stacked as well as the stacked deck that goes with her.The plot in this one is a little different as it is the one Bond that deals with the occult Tarot Cards  Voodoo. It is one of the first Bonds more centered with the revenge of losing an agent  illegal drugs  less centered on saving the world as a plot device. David Hedison from Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea is the latest Felix Lightner of the CIA. The stunts are very well done as veteran Guy Hamilton is in charge of the directing. Moore's sense of humor is gotten into the script. This film tells you right away this is not you Sean Connery type of Bond. The action does get a little comic strip in the Crockodile escape sequence.This film features all the regulars from M's Bernard Lee Moneypenny  of course Q. Overall this pilot proves that Moore can do Bond quite nicely. The stunts other than the comic one have plenty of good action. While this is not Connery not Goldfinger it proves to be a fun trip  for Moore's fans a great pilot for him.".

In this film James Bond goes to New York to investigate the mysterious deaths of some British agents. He feels there is a connection between a big time Harlem gangster named Mr. Big and Kananga the mysterious owner of a small island who is trying to sell self produced heroin. As he gets deeper into the case he discovers that Kananga and Big might be more closely connected than he originally thought. This is a pretty good installment to the Bond series.After Diamonds are Forever the James Bond series needed a serious boost so it could be a serious spy series again. Though this movie isn't as good as the early Connery films it's certainly better than the last two in the series. For the most part it sticks close to the Ian Fleming novel though there are a few differences mostly in the beginning and the end. The last film was more like a dumbed down action movie than a James Bond movie and I was glad to see that they fixed that with this film by putting James Bond on a serious case. One thing that bothered me though was the dialogue. The writers kind of overloaded on the jokes and one liners which made almost every line out of Bond's mouth corny.The acting isn't bad. Roger Moore gives his best performance as James Bond in this movie and though he's nowhere near Connery he's miles above Lazenby. David Hedison plays an average Felix Leiter. Jane Seymour was an alright Bond girl and Yaphat Kotto wasn't too bad of a villain.Overall this movie had room for improvement but it wasn't bad for the most part.710".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to theme songs in James Bond movie no one ever comes close than rock legend Paul McCartney and Wings'' classic Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger gets honourable mention then Tina Turner's Goldeneye comes third. Another milestone about Live and Let Die is that there are more black people in this film than any of the other 23 installments of the series.It seems quite upsetting that Mr. Bond Roger Moore's debut was labeled as a honky or a cracker especially since the setting was in Harlem New York. It seems strange he would be ostracized that way but I guess the world was different in the 1970's compared to our more image conscious ways of our modern times. The ideology might have been the results of blacks coming out on their own in the movie industry at the time and were being treated as more serious performers in movies and avoiding and usurping any clichs that they have fallen victim to over the years.Roger Moore debuts as Sean Connery's replacement as the dashing assassin 007 which he would continue for seven more installments ending with A View to a Kill.Granted Moore lacks the charisma that Sean Connery possessed in his six outings as Bond but he still manages to play the part better than most of his successors especially Daniel Craig. He had potential to be at the same level as Connery if only he wasn't trying too hard to be a carbon copy of Adam West' in the campy Batman series in the 1960's.The plot juxtaposes between a deviant drug lord along with mystifying voodoo as the locations take us from Harlem to San Monique to New Orleans to capture Mr. Big Yaphet Kotto. Solitaire Jane Seymour is a Tarot card reader. No it's time for Bond to stack her deck and get the opportunity to poke her Get it? Gotta love that tongueandcheek humour. She loses her powers to tell the future after she lost her virginity to the Lothario assassin you think she should have learned by now? We knew it was bound to happen.Live and Let Die is entertaining in two main factors. The first being that it plays out like a good oldfashioned action packed thriller. The main downfall about Live and Let Die was the abominable boat chase between Bond and a bigoted redneck named Sheriff Pepper who happens to have a brother who ironically is a Sargeant. See the connection?. Pepper was brought on for some comic relief who's mission is to catch Bond and his pursuers. The other entertaining factor is the very dated humour provided which is also sad because this Bond movie did not age very well as we are treated to jive talking thick sideburned blaxploitated antagonists although it may seem clichd but very nostalgic to say the least.".

While Moore would eventually leave his own stamp on the part he is much too stiff and tentative here. He does not resemble Sean Connery in looks or mannerisms. Bond is way too nice to his adversaries often conversing with them as if they are his good friends. Sean Connery's Bond would never say thank you after being roughed up and shoved out a door. This problem stains the entire movie and led me to question Bond's good judgment. Moore would get better but he is caught in a weak plot involving drug smuggling and the voodoo nonsense of Baron Saturday.The air of absurdity materializes as early as the pretitle sequence where a British agent watches a funeral procession that turns out being his own. This is one of three rather ludicrous killings that melt into Paul McCartney's famous title song. Unfortunately the best theme in the series is the high point of the movie. Any hope that will improvement will come thoroughly dashed within fifteen minutes.Bond starts an investigation of the three aforementioned murders all connected to Dr. Kananga Yaphet Kotto the prime minister of a small island nation. Bond's mission takes him to Harlem where he discovers a link between Kananga and criminal mobster Mr. Big both later revealed to be the same person. Aiding KanangaMr. Big is a lusciously beautiful tarot card reader named Solitaire Jane Seymour and a vast organization of stereotyped cronies.Live and Let Die is a flop in nearly every way. In addition to Moore's poor rendition of Bond the action is lackluster the characters are irritating the soundtrack is terrible the style is incongruous and the film is racist. All the black people use fractured blackspeak and are either drug dealers or mob enforcers. Adam Tommy Lane orders some lazy henchmen to chase Bond saying The man who gets him stays alive! Now MOVE YOU MOTHERS! Later he encounters hick Sheriff J.W. Pepper Clifton James and risks his organization's entire plot by not shooting him.Pepper is also an annoying negative stereotype who undermines the film's best scene. Writer Tom Mankiewicz says he included Pepper so he could make fun of all groups equally. Since when are the Bond films about making fun of people? I bet Albert Broccoli would have shuddered if he heard during the making of From Russia with Love that the series would one day come to this.Finally the movie's climax is poorly written and executed. Bond carelessly leaves one of his weapons lying around for anyone to find leaving him defenseless. It is the second time that he essentially allows himself to be captured. Maybe Mankiewicz and director Guy Hamilton were just looking for an excuse to create a brawl. Moore was never particularly good at brawls.Despite its myriad of flaws Live and Let Die has three positives. The most obvious one is Solitaire Kananga's radiant mistress and the film's best character. Solitaire is intentionally vulnerable and Seymour understands that well. As for the eye candy Solitaire is arguably the most physically attractive Bond girl.The other two positives are Kananga and his aide TeeHee Julius W. Harris. Not surprisingly they are the only two nonstereotyped blacks. Kotto plays Kananga as an intelligent wellexpressed man who is in complete control of his emotions. Only Max Zorin is a more effective Moore era villain. Bond and TeeHee's train fight at the end is one of the few jewels of Moore's time although it does not approach the original in From Russia with Love. The idea of a bad guy trying to kill Bond after the victory is won occurred in five of the eight films by this point and lost its appeal.As far as 007 adventures go Live and Let Die is one of the worst despite its three good characters. Moore would improve and but it would take until 1977 to undo the damage from the film and its successor.".

	schema:headline " Moore's 1st 007 film  Uneven Pacing but Great Characters...";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was my first exposure to nonBrosnan 007 and while I wouldn't say it's a GREAT movie I still found enough about it that I enjoyed to rank it with some of my favorite Bond films. The film Roger Moore's first performance in the signature role has James Bond investigating the mysterious deaths of three MI6 agents that appear linked to Kananga a diplomat from the island nation of San Monique. The film is unique in that it is the only 007 film to include elements of the occult and supernatural. Oddly enough though there are a lot of aspects of this movie that I love I still find it hard to claim it as one of the best of the series.Let me start by saying that I thought Roger Moore was a great choice to replace Sean Connery. At this point I've seen nearly all of the 007 films and I thought Moore while he did put his own spin on the character was a fine replacement. Moore was able to add a bit more humor to the role and I thought it was a welcome addition. As a whole this movie has a great cast and some of my favorite characters from the Bond canon. Jane Seymour did a fine job as Solitaire her performance was nothing extraordinary though it WAS one of her first leading roles...give the girl a break but she was easily one of the most beautiful if not THE most beautiful women to ever pair with James Bond. In this film my favorite performances came from the villains. Yaphet Kotto does a great job as Kananga making him appear dangerous without ever going overthetop or campy and Julius Harris as Tee Hee the henchman with the mechanical hookarm was a real highlight. I'm not sure why but Tee Hee's scene introducing Bond to the crocodile farm is one of my favorite moments from the movie. Despite his role as a villain and desire to off the hero the dude's got a natural charisma. For me though the best character in the film had to be that of Baron Samedi a fantastic job by Geoffrey Holder the voodoo god of cemeteries and closest Bond's ever come to encountering something supernatural. I WISH he had been given a larger role in the film it's a shame the filmmakers weren't able to work the character into a future storyline.On the flip side of the character choices I really think the film could've done without Sheriff J.W. Pepper. The character a mildly amusing performance from Clifton James feels completely out of place and tacked on for whatever reason. Aside from the lame choice of comic relief the film did have one other major flaw for me...there were a lot of points where it felt as if the whole thing slowed to a near stop. 007's main visit to San Monique drags on a bit once he joins with Solitaire and the boat chase seriously could've been cut in half and still had the same effect. While I was impressed by some of the stunts in the sequence I think nearly 10 minutes is a bit of overkill for a boat chase. Otherwise it was a fun film with some great scenes i.e. the crocodile farm or Bond's visit to Harlem. Sure the special effects are very much dated and some spots are downright awful by modern standards i.e. Kananga's last moments but it isn't enough to detract from the film. Regardless this movie is easily a mustwatch for any 007 fan as it contains some great characters and it proves that Moore had what it took to become the new Bond.".

The other actors also accomplished what they needed to in their individual roles here. This installment in the franchise still of course had the women both in the opening sequence and later on in the actual film as every other one does I liked how in this one they still had the girls but there wasn't any nudity or long sex scenes like in a few of the newer ones. I also loved the theme song in the opening sequence. The action scenes were cool fun and high octane which was nice to see. The acting was spot on like in all the other bond installments. If you're a true bond lover then this one is most definitely for you. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Moore takes on duties as James Bond for the first time in this strange and unconventional 007 outing. This one can be tossed into the mediocre bin of Bond adventures and there are so many reasons for this that it's difficult knowing where to begin. The story is rather confusing for a start. It seems that a British representative at the United Nations in New York has been killed along with another one in New Orleans and one more on the island of San Monique so this takes Bond on an investigation into New York City including uptown Harlem. There he first runs afoul of a black crime boss operating as the pimplike Mr. Big and then journeys onward to the voodoo island of San Monique where he squares off with an African leader named Kananga Yaphet Kotto. Kananga's woman and Tarot Card consultant is the beautiful young Solitaire Jane Seymour and his righthook man is Tee Hee Julius Harris who lost one of his hands to the crocodiles and sports a deadly metal hook in its place. Somehow the usual plot line of drug trafficking also figures into all of this don't ask me how.With the dawn of the 1970s we first got to see the change into a more comic book direction for the Bond franchise with the previous film DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER but LIVE AND LET DIE really takes it to a whole new level. This film plays more like an early seventies blaxpoitation pic where you'd expect to see Pam Grier or Shaft arrive into any next scene. Black characters recite such stereotypical lines as man for twenty bucks I'd take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout! said gleefully by a taxi driver when 007 offers him a twenty to follow another car and keep your hands up Honkey! when Bond is approached at gunpoint. Not that any of this in itself is a bad thing for the times because I do dig these types of films man it's just that James Bond himself seems so uncomfortably out of place in such an untypical environment. This is made even more obvious when having newcomer Moore in the role for such a storyline as he is much more refined and gentlemanly not nearly as dangerous and streetsmart as Sean Connery or even George Lazenby were. Roger would get better as his tenure in the series would progress but here he has some big shoes to fill and is just finding his footing. To his credit Moore sensibly didn't try to imitate Connery but his own brand of Bond would require a few films to perfect. One thing Roger was excellent at was giving little comical quips and oneliners and here he delivers a few good ones butterhook he nonchalantly throws Tee Hee's way while the henchman fumbles trying to take Bond's watch off his wrist.One of the best sequences in the movie is when Bond is left standing on a small island in the center of a group of hungry crocodiles and alligators. Unfortunately another sequence involving speed boat chases goes on much too long and does not have the desired effect of enthralling us. Kananga's ultimate fate in the end comes off as utterly ridiculous and laughinducing in the way it's handled even if the idea itself was inspired. The worst offense of all though has to be the addition of a really stupid and annoying backwards southern sheriff named J.W. Pepper who is an embarrassing disgrace to this series as a comedic foil and who was incomprehensibly brought back for next year's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN! I wonder if he was the inspiration for Jackie Gleason's character in SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT?The best thing about LIVE AND LET DIE turns out to be the classic title song by Paul McCartney. Too bad it wasn't used to accompany a better Bond film. Former Beatles producer George Martin takes on the score but it's not a very good one. The constant reuse of the Live and Let Die instrumental theme becomes grating after awhile. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "Now Wes Craven may not talk about this one too much but you know what? I bet he's more proud of this film than most of his films. You know why? He went back to his original roots of storytelling as such how he made Last House On The Left. The film is an exploitation film but you would never guess it by the stylish way he fits it into the urban setting and the wretched display of the villains. You know what? This film tops the last few films he's ever done. I think so because he uses the old school style of scares and yes this film delivers some real moments. It has a very light sense of adventure and humor but it's all for not without the scares. What would you do if you were a 13 year old boy tapped in a big strange house which is a death trap for all burglars and juveniles? Not only that but the owners who live their are not only your landlords but also total psychotics! Well with a few paths within the house walkways in the walls and trap doors in the oven and heater you might have a chance at living. Brandon Adams A.J. Langer Wendie Robie and Everett McGill are great and work well together. I hope Universal releases a special edition DVD of this one soon. We need it.".

Not only that but the owners who live their are not only your landlords but also total psychotics! Well with a few paths within the house walkways in the walls and trap doors in the oven and heater you might have a chance at living. Brandon Adams A.J. Langer Wendie Robie and Everett McGill are great and work well together. I hope Universal releases a special edition DVD of this one soon. We need it.";

Don't damage the face says Mother and leaves Father to punish Alice for being a bad girl. That's it I'm hooked to the screen. First time I saw this movie I missed the beginning but it works well without it. Actually you can skip the background story with the financial problems and society issues and stick to the horror  and it's comical side. I specially liked the kid called Roach who had his tongue cut out for bad words. Alice was also great a shy little girl that tries to be nice for Mommy and not soil her pretty dress though she feeds the basement people and guides Fool around when the time comes. When you watch a doll being pulled away from you on a string you must follow it... Find a candle in the darkness. You know you must get out but the door is locked. The only way out is upwards.There is a lot of nice visual stuff like the old bathroom or running inside the walls and the light drifting in from bullet holes. Mother and Father live in a fantasy where children are supposed to be pretty and behave. Now a few decades ago that was reality but they are pulling it over the edge by mutilating their children and locking them in the basement if they're naughty. I recall that the kids weren't really theirs but kidnapped from around the area. Many people writing down the plot have misunderstood it somehow. It is quite poor but in this case it's not supposed to be a main attraction. I bet the writer came up with the idea of a sick mother and burglary in order to get money for medical treatment only after inventing the main idea about the house and the brother and sister living together as a couple herding a bunch of insane children. Well they must have some reason to get Fool into the house so why not...".

	schema:headline " Probably Craven's strangest movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The People Under The Stairs is a delightfully oddball horror flick that centers on a young boy nicknamed Fool who lives in a dilapidating apartment in the innercity ghetto with his family and dying mother. The greedy landlords of the apartment complex plan on kicking Fool and his family out so he and a family friend Leroy Ving Rhames hatch a plan to break into the landlords' spooky large house which was formerly a funeral home to steal a coin collection supposedly hidden somewhere in there. But they get more than they bargained for when they discover the man and woman living there kidnap young children and lock them inside the cellar. What ensues is a bizarre battle between Fool and the landlords as he tries to save all of the abused deformed people who have been locked inside all their life.The People Under The Stairs is one wild trip and I say that because it really truly is. Written and directed by horror legend Wes Craven I'd have to say that this his strangest film and I think most would agree. The entire script is quite offthewall and very strange but I admire that quality about it. The story is actually pretty unique I can confidently say I've never seen a film like this before. While the storyline may be a little hard to sink your teeth into if you set aside logic and just watch the movie for what it is it is quite a neat little horror movie. For one it has a surreal atmosphere that adds to its overall quirkiness and it has a certain effect that I've never really experienced before. It's a bizarre movie to say the least but I think that might be why I enjoyed it so much. The characters are twisted and the dark musky setting in the old house is a perfect place for the story to unfold. Plus there is also some dark comedy to be found here as well. In fact at times this movie seems like more of a seriously twisted black comedy but I'd say it's a cross between both of these genres.Brandon Adams leads the cast as a thirteen year old boy who is caught up in the battle with the psychotic landlords and is surprisingly good especially considering his age. A.J. Langer plays Alice the only child in the house that isn't neglected and locked away and is also good. The actors playing the motherwoman and dadman are excellent in their bizarre and overthetop roles and Ving Rhames is decent with what screen time he has. There are some excellent sequences in this movie as well mostly the chase scenes within the walls and labyrinth of passageways and whatnot inside the house. I'd like to point out the special effects as well which were very well done as was the makeup on the deformed formerchildren of the landlords who looked very disgusting. As for the ending it is also overthetop and a bit silly but the entire movie is really so this goes along with the flow of the movie well. The film itself as a whole seems to have some sort of deeper meaning behind all of the psychotic and twisted elements  as for me I have my ideas of what it may be trying to say but I think it can be interpreted different ways. But it does seem to be trying to send some sort of message whatever that may be.Overall The People Under The Stairs is an immensely entertaining but very bizarre and offbeat little horror flick. It isn't perfect and it is a little out there but if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy a twisted almost fairytalelike horror movie this can be a fun experience. But make sure you don't take it too literally because it is a very strange movie. All things considered though I dug it. 710.".

But I'm glad I did.The movie is both funny and creepy and personally I couldn't stop watching. It was quite interesting.Story is simple but actually quite complex at the same time if that makes any sense. 3 burglars 2 gangsters and a kid from the slums break into the house of the landlords of a big apartment building and become trapped inside and face the horrors that await them.The best performance was definitely Brandon Quintin Adams as Fool the 13 year old boy who breaks into the house with the 2 other criminals Leroy an early but great performance by Ving Rhames and Spenser Jeremy Roberts. Everett McGill and Wendy Robie played a good insane couple Daddy and Mommy. And Sean Whalen was really good as Roach the main child from the basement who lives in the walls.With a good mix of comedy horror and great characters traps atmosphere People Under the Stairs should be part of any Horro lover's collection.910.".

Between A Nightmare on Elm Street  Scream Craven's directorial output was erratic to say the least although he continued to make worthwhile films like The Serpent and the Rainbow 1988 for every giant sized turkey like Vampire in Brooklyn 1995 there was a The People Under the Stairs which convinced the public  the studios to stick with him. I actually think The People Under the Stairs is easily amongst Craven's best work I think it's a terrific film that is only let down by some silly slapstick comedy that doesn't work the chimney scene at the end comes to mind  a really cheesy ending in which all the poor people of the neighbourhood make a stand against the evil landlords. There is much to enjoy here the film moves along like a rocket it certainly isn't boring or dull the film has a jet black sense of humour running through it with some amusing oneliners  some funny scenes there's plenty of chases horror  downright weirdness the man running around the house wearing full bondage gear with a shotgun is a memorably oddball image. The People Under the Stairs is also quite different to anything I have ever seen before I can't think of another film like it. Maybe that's why some people don't like it we all spend so much time saying how films are so unoriginal but when something fresh  different like The People Under the Stairs comes along it is still attacked for being to weird or unrealistic or offbeat. I love it's unpredictability  that there's nothing else quite like it out there there aren't many films you can say that about.Director Craven does a decent job here although the house seems bigger on the inside than the outside would suggest there's plenty of tension chases near misses  lots of long winding claustrophobic corridors to keep the action tight  taught. I love the couple who own the hose their names are never revealed but talk about the odd couple! They are just plain crazy yet have real personality in fact all of the character's are well written. There's a very gory scene when someone is gutted  their sliced open body is seen several times other than that there's some blood splatter  a severed hand.With a supposed budget of about 6000000 the film has good production values  is well made with decent special effects. The acting is good the kid is surprisingly not annoying while Everett McGill  Wendy Robie as the two psycho house owners put in suitably eccentric performances.The People Under the Stairs is one of Craven's best films it's not perfect but it tries hard to be different  it has a good story which mixes dark humour  horror to great effect. The sequel The People Under the Stairs 2 2008 sees the return of a now grown up Alice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Wes Craven The People Under the Stairs is a fun and energetic if a bit dated horror flick that stars Brandon Quintin Adams of The Mighty Ducks fame as a Fool a streetsmart and spunky 13 yearold kid living in the ghetto. When his mother falls ill and the evil landlord hits them with an eviction notice he hatches a plan with a family friend Ving Rhames to break into the landlord's house and rob him of his riches. Unfortunately Fool finds himself trapped in the house which turns out to be a fortress and uncovers a disturbing discovery about the inhabitants lurking in the basement.Full of stunning visuals slapstick humor and colorful performances by its cast The People Under the Stairs is perhaps the best 80's movie made in the 90's. Yeah that's right this movie looks and feels like something that belongs in the eighties from the outfits the characters wear to the oddball hiphop song that closes out the movie. It helps though that Craven is in top form with delivering some truly nightmarish visuals aided by one great big setpiece in the house that the film spends ninetyfive percent of its runtime within.Adams is a rarity in that he is a kid in a horror movie that isn't annoying. Quite the opposite Fool is likable and real enough that you can't help but cheer him along as he gives the landlord some payback by throwing a brick at him  Home Alone 2 style  and by suckerpunching his vicious guarddog when it gets too close. The film is more fun than it is scary with plenty of witty oneliners awkward moments and situational humor. Horror fans will recognize Kelly Jo Minter of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child fame in a supporting role and will get a kick out of the funhouse trip that The People Under the Stairs ultimately is. Despite looking even more dated than it should it's a film that still holds up as simply a good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although a pretty long way from being perfect The People Under the Stairs is definitely one of Wes Craven's best accomplishments mainly thanks to a couple of really inventive ideas and original gimmicks. Craven's concept oddly works as some kind of adult fairytale in which a heroic youngster from a poor ghetto neighborhood battles against the evil step parents and at stake is the liberation of abused children and  of course  a treasure of extremely valuable golden coins. One day before his family's eviction by the malicious landlords young Fool agrees to assist a duo of burglars when they break into their reputedly cursed mansion. Entering is easy enough but Leroy Spencer and young Fool are soon trapped in a macabre place full of death traps where the demented owners hide more than just one dark secret. Mommy is an atypical religionfreak daddy enjoys wearing SM outfits whilst blowing holes in the walls with a shotgun and aggressive petRottweilers aim straight for the throat! Pretty soon Fool loses his companions and teams up with the repressed locked away daughter and a strange being that lives between the walls. Where to begin with his lacking but overall satisfying horroraction adventure? The appealing title for starters is very misleading as it suggests that danger especially lurks in the basement. There are indeed people under the stairs but they're the last persons young Fool should be afraid of since they're just victims as well. Mom  dad initially form a mysterious and genuinely petrifying pair of villains but as soon as their background is revealed the film gets all the more silly and comical instead of scary. There's plenty of exciting action and violence as the grim mansion turns out to be deadly labyrinth with secret doors and passages even in the kitchen cupboards. The amount of gory effects and on screen slaughter is rather low and this in combination with the youthful stars leads to believe Wes Craven somehow intended to create a childfriendly horror film. Kids who loved the sight of naughty men getting kicked in the crotch or assaulted with bricks like in Home Alone will certainly like the action in The People under the Stairs. The last twenty minutes after when Fool escaped the wrath of mum  dad but returns to help his new friends is dire and contains no more memorable moments. Brandon Adams is a likable child actor which is quite an accomplishment to itself but the true stars naturally are the deranged villains. Wendy Robie and Everett McGill can go over the top as much as they please it only improves the film. As stated above this is one of the best films in Wes Craven's uneven career as a director. He started out magnificently in the 70's with true classics on his repertoire like Last House on the Left and The Hills have Eyes. His early 80's efforts are still very good as well with Nightmare on Elm Street and the sadly underrated Deadly Blessing but near the second half of the decade Craven started to deliver lackluster and unsatisfying horror stuff like Deadly Friend Shocker and Serpent  the Rainbow. The People Under The Stairs was his last worthwhile film before going mainstream with nonsense like Scream Vampire in Brooklyn and Cursed.".

They are told to leave their crummy apartment dwelling which is so scummy rats would have a hard time adjusting. They are merely just another case in a whole line of unfortunate renters evicted from their homes by sicko brother and sister landlordsEverett McGill  Wendy Robiewho have kidnapped malesthey have been stuck inside an isolated room in the basement so long they look like ghoulssearching for the perfect son. They also have a female who they abuse named AliceAJ Langerwho they call daughter but she is just like those boys down stairs..her existence is in a room constantly being patronized by mommy zealot constantly referring to others' certified trips to hell not even giving a second thought to the nightmares she has caused in her..and brother's..violent wake. Fool is coerced by thuggish thief LeroyVing Rhamesto steal gold hidden in the landlords' home and once inside they become trapped. Leroy is soon dispatched in grisly fashion while poor Fool must find ways of escape using different little halls inside the home introduced to him by RoachSean Whalen one of the aforementioned abducted males who has adopted a form of transportation as means of getting food from Alice upstairs. If there is a place to scurry the tonguelesscut out by the landlordsRoach can find it. Fool learns a lot from Roach who soon becomes victims of McGill's shotgun blastinghe carries the blaster everywhere he goes. It's up to Fool to put an end to the crazies once and for all. Fool also wishes to help out the poor souls trapped underneath the stairs and Alice. As expected Fool will run into pratfalls from time to time because the pair have booby traps and other devices all throughout the house and keep the windows locked  sealed off.This film is absolutely birdbrained. Wes Craven wishes to expose the rich and how they treat the lower class who work under them struggling to make ends meet but how can his message really be heard underneath so much silly chaos. And Everett McGill must have been part of the program that made Lee Majors the 6 Million Dollar Man because I've never seen a man get hit over the head with so much and continue as if nothing happened. I mean Fool hits him over the head with a metal toilet top a flower vase  a fireplace poker. Robie is throttled in the knee with the poker and stabbed yet continues. Who are these people and how strong can they actually be? There are disturbing layers I don't even wish to think about only hinted at such as skulls and skeletons dangling about in the room housing the unfortunates and at one point McGill is dressed to the nines in SM leather suit. There's a scene where the dog lunges right into Fool yet he's able to defend himself against a massive monstrous pit bull! And at one point Fool blows up McGill with dynamite for Petesake and his body remains undamaged! Logic and credibility never have a chance to survive in such a film as this.".

They are told to leave their crummy apartment dwelling which is so scummy rats would have a hard time adjusting. They are merely just another case in a whole line of unfortunate renters evicted from their homes by sicko brother and sister landlordsEverett McGill  Wendy Robiewho have kidnapped malesthey have been stuck inside an isolated room in the basement so long they look like ghoulssearching for the perfect son. They also have a female who they abuse named AliceAJ Langerwho they call daughter but she is just like those boys down stairs..her existence is in a room constantly being patronized by mommy zealot constantly referring to others' certified trips to hell not even giving a second thought to the nightmares she has caused in her..and brother's..violent wake. Fool is coerced by thuggish thief LeroyVing Rhamesto steal gold hidden in the landlords' home and once inside they become trapped. Leroy is soon dispatched in grisly fashion while poor Fool must find ways of escape using different little halls inside the home introduced to him by RoachSean Whalen one of the aforementioned abducted males who has adopted a form of transportation as means of getting food from Alice upstairs. If there is a place to scurry the tonguelesscut out by the landlordsRoach can find it. Fool learns a lot from Roach who soon becomes victims of McGill's shotgun blastinghe carries the blaster everywhere he goes. It's up to Fool to put an end to the crazies once and for all. Fool also wishes to help out the poor souls trapped underneath the stairs and Alice. As expected Fool will run into pratfalls from time to time because the pair have booby traps and other devices all throughout the house and keep the windows locked  sealed off.This film is absolutely birdbrained. Wes Craven wishes to expose the rich and how they treat the lower class who work under them struggling to make ends meet but how can his message really be heard underneath so much silly chaos. And Everett McGill must have been part of the program that made Lee Majors the 6 Million Dollar Man because I've never seen a man get hit over the head with so much and continue as if nothing happened. I mean Fool hits him over the head with a metal toilet top a flower vase  a fireplace poker. Robie is throttled in the knee with the poker and stabbed yet continues. Who are these people and how strong can they actually be? There are disturbing layers I don't even wish to think about only hinted at such as skulls and skeletons dangling about in the room housing the unfortunates and at one point McGill is dressed to the nines in SM leather suit. There's a scene where the dog lunges right into Fool yet he's able to defend himself against a massive monstrous pit bull! And at one point Fool blows up McGill with dynamite for Petesake and his body remains undamaged! Logic and credibility never have a chance to survive in such a film as this.";

Even their daughter puts in a good turn and is well cast. Unfortunately the 'whatchatalkinboutwillis' jive talking kid is less fun to watch. What follows is mildly diverting but the repetitive crawling around in the attic and basement scenes quickly get boring. The people under the stairs themselves are freakish and alarming until you actually see them in full daylight when they look so unconvincing that you wish they'd stayed under the stairs and retained an element of menace. It's hard to sympathies with 'fool' the main character who is after all a little robber personally I was cheering for the dog. Excellent casting except for fool and initially tense atmosphere gives way to an overly long film with very little substance and a silly ending. Not bad though certainly worth watching.".

The premise itself is potentially very interesting but Craven doesn't seem to know where to go with it and the characters are all flat and one dimensional. 'Twin Peaks' loonies Everett McGill and Wendy Robie are well cast but the lame material doesn't give much to work with apart from some unimaginative and hammy mugging. Ving Rhames in his pre'Pulp Fiction' days appears in the supporting cast as does cult favourite Sean Whalen 'The Cable Guy' and veteran character actor Bill Cobbs 'Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead'.

They come to a secluded neighborhood to rob folk's blind and hearing a story surrounding a man Everett McGill and his sister Wendy Robie who live in a heavily secured house. While trying to rob the house a strange noise emanates from inside the walls. They find a deadly secret but become trapped inside. Hiding Fool comes face to face with a normal woman young Alice. A.J. Langer One of his family members is killed. Trying to hide he incites the wrath of the man and is whisked away to safety by the other people. He gets captured and left to rot with the stairpeople but they see his kindness and help him escape infuriating the man. Fool comes back for Alice. They escape back into the walls and manage to get to the roof of the house. The man and woman track them to the roof where Fool gets away. Fool gets back to his house and tells to get his story believed. Police investigate but find nothing and leave. When they leave Fool sneaks back into the house and tries to kill them himself. After surviving an ambush he finds Alice hanging from the chimney. They get loose and try to get the other stairpeople free. Fool is found and the stairpeople try to hide him from the man while the woman finds the neighborhood coming after them to get their money back. Alice manages to stop her while Fool finds the hidden stash of money. The woman comes back to kill Alice but is stopped by the stairpeople who want to bring her down into the basement. Alice ends up finally killing her as Fool gets the money back into the community and stopping the man.  The Good News The People Under the Stairs' has that certain feeling to it that makes you want to see it again to know what it was that made you feel that way. The film has a certain charm to it that provides the viewer that those involved had a good time it the film. I have to applaud McGill whose gives a delightfully overthetop performance to his character that makes you want to stand up and root for his demise. The two characters McGill and Robie give you the impression as such monsters that the real ones in the film the kidnapped children don't seem as threatening. I don't know if it was intentional or not but kudos Craven. For a youngster Adams pulls off the incredible in that he gives a good performance. He has an innocence to him that shows off his apparent sinful nature of a sneak and thief. The house is also cleverly designed and is actually scarier than some haunted house movies. It has hidden booby traps deadly secrets in its walls and its dark never ending corridors have a real spooky nature towards them. Craven also develops some suspense in the beginning with the strange noises coming from inside the walls. It comes before you know what they actually are and then gives several big payoffs at the end. It was also good seeing a younger Ving Rhames in this movie as Fool's father. He has always been a favorite actor of mine and here in a somewhat smaller role he still has the great acting chops that he has today.The Bad News There was mainly one small part I'm going to complain on here. It's the outfits McGill wears towards the end a pseudoSM outfit decked out in leather and diamond studs. What was he doing wearing that? If it means what I think it means then I have to say eww! That's your sister man. True I do love my sister but that's caring the thing too far. Beyond that weird outfit I have no complaints towards this film. It has a builtin limitation about where it's going and it delivers every step of the way.The Final Verdict This is one of the films where you have to develop a taste for. Like French food it's good if you can actually develop a taste for it. It's not a film for everyone to enjoy. Craven fans should check this one out as it demonstrates why he is the modern master of horror.Rated R Graphic Language Graphic Violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 1005 am showing on opening day. It looked funny like 'Shaun of the Dead' and seemed to have its own interesting take which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie R's emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But let's face it the majority of leads in films are attractive so that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire but they don't force feed the point of the film instead they make it very subtle which is nice.It wasn't a laughoutloud comedy but I don't know that I necessarily thought it would be when I saw the trailer. It definitely had more emotional depth than I thought it would which gave me a much fonder attachment to the film than if it had simply been made for laughs. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. The directing writing and pretty much everything in the film was well done. I have no complaints. It delivered what it said it would and exceeded my expectations which is rare these days in entertainment.".

It looked funny like 'Shaun of the Dead' and seemed to have its own interesting take which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie R's emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve.

	schema:headline " More original than you might think";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally the great zombie romance? Well maybe not but it's the closest I've seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie who starts to get feelings for a girl who's alive. Through a set of circumstances he rescues her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words but weirdly in his head he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn't impressed by it but at least it was slowbuilding somewhat charming avoiding most of the disgusting stuff and you kind of rooted for them by the end.Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can evolve our hero or devolve bonies zombies who shed their outer skins looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons. Speaking of bonies I thought they looked amazing creepy even but their movements were stiff and made them look computergenerated. Also who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate through visions. It's not even the only way they can change although the other way though nice seemed a bit farfetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic hopeful even vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There's something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think however the execution wasn't flawless.Sure overall I found the movie had charms but for me the laughs were few and far between like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it's supposed to be one of those but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more teeth to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo  Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn't follow their own internal rules. We're told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly yet not long after we see zombies running. It's like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also bonies for some reason move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also I know it's a short movie but zombies evolve too quickly especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good not exceptional but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he's a nice smart freak quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions but able to be slowly healed by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude not fitting in and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.Zombie makeup was rather minimal and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive in a gothlike way mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept but it could have been done much much worse. So I liked the movie I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It's very minimally bloody and the most gory part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie and even that's not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn't leave me cold and the more I dwell on it the warmer my feelings for it get.Rating 7 out of 10 Good".

	schema:reviewBody "'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better  there's depth to the characters a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen  the film entertains you from start to finish.Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this it must have been difficult to do this role  especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.Overall this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary  particularly towards the end. However the film is really nice funny and even heartwarming sometimes.".

R's friend M played hilariously by Rob Corddry steals the show with funny scene after funny scene.With Warm Bodies you get a mix of comedy romance and zombiehorror. It's a fresh spin on all three and it was truly a fun time at the theater.

Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to connect yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie's comedy. He manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the bromance if you will and I didn't even catch his part in aiding the Shakespearian nod. Yes this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare while also lightheartedly setting out themes for what defines a person as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be going to see it again.

The movie's pace is well done and the  movie itself is well directed by the director of the 2011 drama 5050  Jonathan Levin. He also wrote the screenplay which he based on a 2010  novel of the same name Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion.  The acting in the movie is glamorous from both the humans and the  zombies and I did enjoy the makeup effect on the lead as he starts to  morph from a zombie to a human. The movies use of humor is well timed  and arranged as it is clever when you feel it is getting a little too  serious out of nowhere jumps a comic line that lightens the mood. The  other thing that you will enjoy is the Romeo and Juliet references that  the director made sure were present and obvious as the lead characters  name is R which I believe R for Romeo and his love interest is named  Julie which I believe is in reference to Juliet.  The thing that attracted me to this movie in the first place was the  new idea of how the movie is viewed from the zombie's point of view we  also get to hear his thoughts as he goes through life being an undead.  Set in a post apocalypse era Warm Bodies is more about open  mindedness the ability to accept that others can change. The movie is  more of a romantic drama than it is about humans going all Resident  Evil on Zombies.  The plot is about an unusual zombie named R Nicholas Hoult who  developed human emotions and craved for more. The humans during this  post apocalypse era lived a barricade life away from zombies who have  practically taking over the world. Part of the human settlement went  out to get some supplies during that time they ambushed by zombies  there R saw Julie Teresa Palmer and fell for her.  He then saved her from the others and made her stay with him during  which more emotional attachment developed between the two till she had  to go back to her people. But something new started among the zombies  that one act by R caused a revolution.  The movies score jumped out at me as being bad though that is from my  view. The movie is cool and the humor is really well timed and this is  a movie that I can comfortably advise that you should see.".

There is nothing too offensive or gory in this  the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a fullon zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Warm Bodies is a comedic romantic actionfilled zombie flick. Being a zombie movie people do get chased attacked eaten by zombies but since it is PG13 it's not too graphic. Fun surprise zombies aren't the only creatures stalking humans in this movie.This movie opens with a wonderfully fun and clever introduction to the zombie apocalypse as well as the main zombie character named R. Nicholas Hoult's R is funny loyal curious likable protective charming. Definitely not a typical zombie. There are many scenes where our zombie friend goes about his daily life accompanied by hilarious and clever voice overs. It's interesting how he questions everything thinks constantly longs to connect. This opportunity arises when he meets Julie sparking a sortof Romeo and Juliet type of relationship. Julie is a resistance fighter whose dad John Malcovich leads the humans. She is strong and brave yet vulnerable and sweet. The chemistry between R and Julie is undeniable. I can honestly say that I cared what happened to them.All the actors did a fantastic job. John Malkovich is great as always. Dave Franco's character was quite tragic. Analeigh Tipton is wonderful as Jule's best friend providing some funny lines and support though it would have been nice to have more of her. A shoutout to Rob Corddry is required as he has some of the best lines and is just fantastic as a fellow zombie. Definitely would be on my crew during the zombie apocalypseI absolutely recommend Warm Bodies. It's fun fastpaced clever looks great has interesting characters action some scares romance. Maybe see with a date or by yourself or a group of friends up to you.".

	schema:headline " Make way for a teenage zombie that is sure to be the best surprise to kick off the new year.";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's something you don't see every day A romantic comedy involving zombies. Thus Warm Bodies a fresh fastpaced sensational and truly original delight that is sure to knock your socks off from beginning to end. Start with the premise After an plague has caused people to turn into zombies the real humans including General Grigio John Malkovich separate themselves from the braineating zombies by building up a wall in order to keep them away. Along the way we get to meet one of those zombies. Meet R the charming British heartthrob Nicholas Hoult. He doesn't quite like this life knowing that he has to eat brains in order to survive and to live off the memories of the humans he's killed. He's looking for someone to connect to which is really explained through his facial expressions and inner monologues. Then it's love at first bite when he's finally connecting to Julie Australian beauty Teresa Palmer daughter of General Grigio. When he sees her after she shoots most of his friends he decides to protect her and to keep her safe. Yes this zombie is in love. Protecting her in his abandoned airplane filled with vinyl records a record player and other resourceful things R finally gets to realize that something was missing in him all along leaving his heart beating to realize that he loves her. That's when R his friend M a wonderful Rob Corddry and the other zombies are starting to change. That's all good until the CG skeletal creatures known as Bonies will do anything to prevent that from happening which leads off into the film's fantastical climax. Warm Bodies directed by Jonathan Levine of the delightful comedydrama 5050 and the incredibly wicked The Wackness who also adapted the film from Isaac Marion's bestselling book for young adults combines a mixture of 5 different genres comedy horror romance drama even a little bit of scifi that makes the film more smarter and even more better than The Twilight Saga. Take that Jacob Black. What also makes it work is the inspired casting of Nicholas Hoult from About a Boy Xmen First Class and the upcoming Jack the Giant Slayer. As R he literally dives deep into the emotions as well as having terrific comic timing through his expressions and his inner monologues by using a spoton American accent. He also develops great chemistry with Teresa Palmer known as the buttkicking alien Six in I Am Number Four who as Julie has a tough and fearless personality as well as a emotional side to her. The supporting cast is also incredible including Analeigh Tipton who is hilarious as Julie's friend Nora Dave Franco James's little brother from last year's 21 Jump Street who gets a brief amount of screen time but really sticks it out as Julie's exboyfriend Perry who in order not to spoil this gets called for a dinner date that includes brains on the menu and the great John Malkovich excels as a man who believes that the zombies are nothing more than just flesheating corpses looking forward to get shot in the head but doesn't believe that his only daughter is in love with one. I know what you're thinking this is just another zombie movie. But Warm Bodies is certainly different than that. It revives the zombie genre by bringing something original to the screen. For those who love the TV series The Walking Dead and the other zombie comedies Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead not to mention George A. Romero ...of the Dead series you actually will get a taste of what the zombie world is like through the eyes of one. And maybe like R's your heart will warm up too. This is the best surprise so far this year. Note Warm Bodies is pretty tame but pushing the envelope for a PG13 film involving zombies who eats brains and Bonies who consumes hearts. Those are hardly seen but there are people who shoot zombies in the head with guns. That works in order to keep it very organic.".

What I discovered was an inconsistent bland badly acted attempted romancemovie with ridiculous not in the good way dialogues.In short We meet a zombie R who has incredibly coherent thought processes for a zombie yet chooses to eat brains for sustenance. If this garish action is really necessary we never truly find out after all he doesn't eat for a week after meeting Julie the bland berating love interest badly played by Teresa Palmer but the movie dismisses this rather vital part of information with the following mindblowing dialogue.Julie Do you have to eat brains? R YesSeriously. The movie then goes on about how R is changing yet the characters seem to ignore this fact  no one seems taken aback in the least that zombies suddenly can talk even though it's been established that such a thing is impossible. Hell the fact that they run seems very implausible to me seeing as how the entire intro sequence is dedicated to R telling us how he shuffles around all day and when he goes out to feed he literally says this is going to take a while but I digress.This is figuratively literally the tip of the iceberg and just to illustrate this point this is the way the movie handles the love interest losing her initial boyfriend whom the movie then tries to turn into a douche bag by making him act like one in a dream sequence so we wouldn't be so creeped out when she makes out with the zombie who ate his brains.R eats boyfriend's brain. R rescues Julie by smearing what appears to be poop on her  I guess it was supposed to be blood through some unexplained process several times. Julie NEVER mentions her exboyfriend. Suddenly in a throwaway line she explains that it's not that she's not sad  it's just that she prepared for this. Yeah that's how emotions work.There are still loads of things to point out for instance how rotting zombies become superhuman monsters once they totally flip out and become 'skellies' but I hope my point has gotten across. The only reason I give this movie more than 110 is the way Analeigh Tipton says 'Sup?' to the zombie R when he successfully wins Julie back after having explained to her that he ate her boyfriend's brain but has now walked a couple of miles so it should be okay.".

There is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the toptoo gory.I didn't think this plot could work a zombie and a human forming a relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen friendship he forms with Julie Teresa Palmer is really touching. OK it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we are left with a great ending.I think this film will really surprise a few people it is definitely worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also funny a winner for me.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Why? Dear lord why is this movie rated over seven? Are the humanity seriously that retarded? Can people no longer separate good from bad? These are just some of the questions I am left with after watching this.First of all this movie should have been a parody not a romantic comedy! The movie had been easier to accept if it was in a different genre. For example like Shaun of the Dead. In that case I would totally accept the zombiehuman love thing going on NOT. Although there is humor in Warm Bodies and it's clearly a movie that wants to be taken seriously I do not buy the over all story!Secondly I get really embarrassed over how this socalled dialogue through the film is written. Moaning yes and groaning not safe is totally not necessary. This could have been solved less awkward by letting the character show how he feelsthinks through something else for example music since they already have made a big scene about this which I personally don't think evolved as good as it could.Furthermore I think the movie is wrong in terms of how zombies actually are. Zombies are as they're in ALL the other movies and books on this subject  dead creatures. They do not live they do not think and they certainty do not feel! But most of all THEY DO NOT SPEAK! They react only by instincts and that instinct tells them to eat your face of.I get the fact that this is a movie where the zombie boy gets feelings so I will not criticize that further on. But why didn't they just give him these human attributes along with him growing a heart? Why let him moan through phrases that would even get the heavy addicts uncomfortable?I think a lot of this could have been solved to the better if the genre of this movie was a parody as I stated previously. It would certainty be more fun to watch and maybe I would actually laugh of the horrible scenes that was made to be funny and not feel the urge to scratch out my eyes and ears..Warm Bodies is in fact a movie about a zombie who falls in love with his dinner. If that's not awkward enough  A postapocalyptic Romeo and Juliet story is! Yes I see the reference. I AM NOT BLIND! yet but I could be if I see this movie again The world's most famous lovers will always be used as inspiration for love stories I understand that but really WHY? WHY couldn't this have been done with a little more sophistic or finesse? Do the producers even have a brain or did the zombies eat it?Do not watch this BRAIN DEAD move if you have a beating heart. If you want to see something dead become a real boy I recommend Pinocchio".

If that same carcass is murmuring dialogue you should sense something is wrong and when a love interest gets introduced in the same 15 minutes with the mushy closeups...its OK at that point to begin asking for your refund.It breaks a lot of conventions but in a really cringeworthy manner. Zombieland was a perfect blueprint for modern undead humor without completely tarnishing the genre and style that our horror based creations originate from why deviate? More importantly why encourage an impressionable movie goer like myself into going to see it when YOU KNOW I WON'T LIKE IT.I expected better out of my critics my peers and my internet sources. Roadhouse? I'm game. Turkish Star Wars? Let me at it. Where was the campiness that I loved so much in Braindead or even in the fairly recent Drag Me to Hell? Nowhere to be found here but I sure do get a Breakfast Club esque makeover scene. Thanks? Nah no thanks.Would you let a zombie watch you undress and sleep on your floor? I know this is make believe but GEEZ ITS A ZOMBIE THAT EATS BRAINS. The least you could do is introduce an element of danger that doesn't come from something...that ZOMBIES ARE AFRAID OF?? This is the most disappointing  worst zombie movie since Night of the Comet. There always needs to be new ideas that are tried out to genre movies but Warm Bodies is just not the right way to go about it. If you are a fan of good romance comedy action or horror then you will be guaranteed to be rubbed the wrong way and let down. Save your money save your time.".

That seems to have been the whole concept here and a story was worked out. The idea itself is a good one not unlike the Tucker and Dale movie from last year and perhaps long due. Horror effective horror has been all about placing us closer to the nature of the horrific experience it's why as early as the 1960's monsters were dragged from swamps and castles and moved next door to Bates motel.And what better placement than making us the monster?So they could have this as a black comedy and I'd be a happy viewer. We'd see all those situations we know from zombie movies but from behind the zombie mist of dumb instincts looking out at human instincts in a way that drove home the absurdity and dumbness drawing the same parallels that Romero did in his time. We are in Romero's timeline anyway Land of the Dead.But for reasons that strike me as more shrewd than creative they decided this should be a romantic movie. The idea here is to have the zombie narrator as one of the target audience a teenager baffled at the 'deadness' of modern life a music geek and awkward with the girl he loves stuttering every time. Clever so far. Where it completely loses me as a viewer is that the decision was made and this had to have been part of a shrewd business plan that there is currently no better mode to rope more of that teenage audience than Twilight. The franchise has come and gone but the ripples are still being felt especially in a film like this.What the Twilight influence means is that there is the angle of forbidden love forbidden because of social constructs. They found a mopey Kristen Stewart lookalike to be the sullen heroine. There is a more elaborate mythos introducing zombies which are more evil than 'regular' ones. And it all has to culminate with an 'epic' battle and redemptive aftermath. Worst of all and this is why I rate the film so low is that mopey wistful tone that probably passes as introspection in highschool corridors. There's even the inane visual bit the equivalent of sparkly vampires with the hearts of 'awakened' zombies beating red!You'll know the filmmaker is a dull mind if you observe the scene it's a small moment but very indicative where 'good' zombies have decided to make a stand rousing Scorpions music kicks in the soundtrack instead of giving us say a flat comedic sideshot where zombies simply limp along into the frame one by one he has them coolly walk towards the camera... in slow motion! Which defeats their actual stumbling in slow motion all so we can have a useless Reservoir Dogs effect.".

The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character affording calm matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation.

The intro was pretty nicely done and I expected it to not be as dire and gory as say The Walking Dead or Dawn of the Dead. I also didn't mind the idea that R serves as the narrator even though as a character he can't talk initially. Then the humans come into play. The group R first encounters is pretty much your everyslashermoviecollegeroadtrip. There are no signs of any kind of training to fight against zombies or act as a group yes like playing Left4Dead with 12yos. I was willing to accept the fact that R would fall for Julie that's the premise of the movie after all. Then however it starts going downhill.... rapidly. R is housing as of now I will start counting face palm in brackets so this is 1 in an abandoned airplane. He is opening the door 2 and keeps Julie there. His love interest in her is somewhat developed but still hard to believe. He slowly learns to speak again yet when he and Julie encounter other Zombies M completely out of nothing can talk at the same level as R can 3. What follows is the typical drama of them getting to know each other better and her leaving him when he tells her he killed her boyfriend. On a side not here. Julie is maybe the worst female character I have seen in a movie for years. Now I'm a guy but every feminist must have been going through the roof seeing her. R is constantly saying he will protect her she cannot take care of herself and instead of properly mourning over her dead boyfriend she befriends R but then again tries to run away from him and what not. Horrible character. Anyhow R is going to meet her in the human complex by this time all of the regular zombies have magically stopped eating humansbrains 4. R easily gets into the human complex and meets with Julie yeah build a concrete wall that is 20m high but conveniently oversee a gap 5 and don't smell the dead guy in the rotting clothes 6. A group of bonies attacks the human complex looking for R and Julie what motivates them is however completely unclear same as what led them there 7. R and Julie escape from them and eventually leap into a pool with R serving as a kind of cover for Julie. They get back up and R gets shot in the chest. Now I don't know what you'd do if the water around you is turning red with the blood of a loved one  Julie however starts screaming happily and enthusiastically that R can bleed 8. Then the zombies befriend the humans come back to live and blah blah blah 9 ad infinitum.The movie as a whole has no real suspense. There is little to no violence involved either. R is an interesting character that however gets struck by plot holes Julie is anything but a character nothing makes her sympathetic. The other characters are also pretty one dimensional.Well that's all I can say. Don't waste your money going to the movies to see this. It is pretty much this year's Prometheus  great trailer shitty movie. I was very disappointed".

	schema:reviewBody "I really really wanted to like this movie. I liked the idea of the perspective shift the trailer narration presents R as an interesting misfit a little too alive to be a zombie and much too dead to be anything else. I love a good horrorcomedy and what better to poke fun at then undead romance? The storyline centers around a near future where the unspecified virus breaks loose and the remaining humans build a fortress to keep out the zombies. It adds its own twist that zombies while some stay conscious like the hero R others simply give up hope and become the 'Bonies' a skeletal group of who are merciless and bloodthirsty you know like a zombie. So in that I guess I was thinking there was a good set up for some more psychological conflict especially if it's supposed to be based off of Romeo and Juliet where people do you know actually die.I don't know why I was expecting so much. I was already expecting zombies but none of them have so much as a missing hand or a vacant eye socket. It's the equivalent of the glittering vampire unmutilated zombies who are pale blue eyed and stare longingly. Of all the plot holes you could drive a convertible through that one bothered me the most. To be fair I think one of the little kid zombies was missing teeth.I would give you a synopsis of this movie but there doesn't seem to be a point. It's pretty typical boy meets girl falls in love overcomes differences. As for being a comedy the plot is too straight forward for anything besides a few cheap laughs. It takes itself too seriously to poke fun at things like Julie's controlling father or how awkward zombie kisses could be and not seriously enough to give any kind of emotional depth to the characters. The relationship between Julie and R reminded me much more of Tarzan and Jane than Romeo and Juliet.I suppose if you're looking for a fun date movie with the all the appeal of the word zombie and none of the gore horror or anything relevant to the title and you're still in high school this movie has appeal. Maybe if you read the book you'll have some appreciation that I didn't. If you have to do your own laundry or have ever had a relationship with any real emotional substance Warm Bodies will at best leave you feeling a bit tepid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scream is the best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's and it is my all time personal favorite film in the horror genre. I love this film I always did and I love to death! It was really the first movie that introduced me in to horror genre slasher films. It was directed from my favorite horror master Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It is a horror mystery like was Friday the 13th and April Fool's Day. Scream deserve legendary status. The movie spawned three sequels and the TV series that I did like. Neve Campbell David Arquette and Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan work for me. It is about a high school teenage student in the fictional town of Woodsboro California who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface who kills teens and who uses his obsession with scary movies. The first one is the best in the series and it is still one of the best horror films of all time. Wes Craven borrowed and used Halloween Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street mostly scenes for this movie. It mentions a lot of cult classic horror movies and till it's day it is still praised by fans. I enjoy this film I always do. This is my movie and my personal opinion! Scream follows the teenage girl Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell who becomes targeted by a psychotic killer dressed in a ghostface mask who uses his obsession with scary movies. David Arquette plays police deputy Dewey Riley who helps protect Sidney and Courtney Cox plays tabloid reporter Gale Weathers. This is one of Craven's best along with A Nightmare on Elm Street that redefined the genre and Ghostface has become another popular slasher since. What's Your Favorite Scary Movie? Ghostface is one of the most popular and really scary character. The mask is so scary before new year on Halloween day I saw the mask putted on a front seat in the car and i was so scared I thought it was the killer waiting on me but it was only a mask but a scary one. The Story begins after two high school students are murdered by the serial killer. Sidney Prescott becomes next victim of intelligent serial killer Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shure that serial killer is the same person who murdered Sidney's mother one year ago and now he's terrorizing Sidney her self. Deputy Sheriff Dewey wants to investigate the murders by himself but attractive Gale seduced and confused him so it's up to Sidney to find the killer before he kills again to find the truth she will must kill. I love also the characters Matthew Lillard as Stu Macher Rose McGowan as Tatum Riley and Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks. Great story and great soundtracks. I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best I watch with my mom as a teen good times. I love the script the dialogues in this movie I love Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker in here.1010 Scream deserves a legendary status it is my personal favorite horror slasher film from Wes Craven in the franchise. I have the whole collection on Bluray discs and I have the first three movies on VHS tapes. I love this film to death I love it!".

	schema:headline " Hate To Admit It But It's Great";
	schema:reviewBody "There's more than a few reasons to hate Scream' the main reason would be that the film singlehandedly resurrected the teenslasher genre a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of Scream' witless horror crap like I Know What You Did Last Summer' and Urban Legend' got greenlighted half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of Scream' is very simple a masked knifewielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch in case you don't already know it though is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like I'm going outside for a cigarette I'll be right back.'  such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples and best characters of this is Randy Jamie Kennedy the filmobsessed nut of the film who actually goes so far as to muse what real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows exposed for what they really are . . . and then some of them get used anyway because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away while others are embraced.  Scream' really turned the horrorslasher film genre on its ear becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's selfawareness allowed to move in brandnew directions . . . and suddenly scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film  as director of slasher classics like Nightmare On Elm Street' he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then much like Scream's' script chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nailbiting thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good  Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney Courtney Cox is pretty good as tarttongued reporter Gail Weathers Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley the sadsack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway the good ones are all about suspense terror and gore.  And in Scream' Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is Scream' spawned dozens of imitators and by spawning imitators all the new avenues opened up by Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still purely on its own merit it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's Halloween' without question but Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade  A".

	onyx:emotionText "There's more than a few reasons to hate Scream' the main reason would be that the film singlehandedly resurrected the teenslasher genre a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of Scream' witless horror crap like I Know What You Did Last Summer' and Urban Legend' got greenlighted half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of Scream' is very simple a masked knifewielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch in case you don't already know it though is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like I'm going outside for a cigarette I'll be right back.'  such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples and best characters of this is Randy Jamie Kennedy the filmobsessed nut of the film who actually goes so far as to muse what real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows exposed for what they really are . . . and then some of them get used anyway because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away while others are embraced.  Scream' really turned the horrorslasher film genre on its ear becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's selfawareness allowed to move in brandnew directions . . . and suddenly scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film  as director of slasher classics like Nightmare On Elm Street' he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then much like Scream's' script chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nailbiting thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good  Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney Courtney Cox is pretty good as tarttongued reporter Gail Weathers Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley the sadsack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway the good ones are all about suspense terror and gore.  And in Scream' Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is Scream' spawned dozens of imitators and by spawning imitators all the new avenues opened up by Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still purely on its own merit it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's Halloween' without question but Scream' actually runs a close second.

However it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and reinvented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own but rather a succession of bland ripoffs not to mention a very successful spoof Scary Movie Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street' set out to do it again. This time along with Kevin Williamson who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek created a new kind of horror  one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.What made Scream so successful is that it was never patronising and displayed a strong sense of ironic selfawareness. It took every horror clich in the book and turned them upside down. For the kids that had seen too many movies there was now a movie for them. The characters did not follow the clichs but in fact talked about them and talked about what would happen if they were in a movie. This sense of irony may seem tired now but when Scream came out it was new and exciting. There was rarely a need to scream 'don't go upstairs' or suchlike in Scream because the characters themselves were saying that! The idea of the killer being amongst the students adds a fresh dimension to the film as fear gives way to paranoia at not being able to trust anyone. The subversions of the accepted horror clichs in particular in the opening ten minutes I'm not going to give anything away for those who have not seen it also contribute to making Scream a truly shocking movie. It was this sense of innovation that made Scream such a breath of fresh air for the horror genre and it is only a shame that Craven's genius has been ripped off so many times that his work has dated far too quickly. Craven and Williamson have also created a new horror star  but it was not a particular character but just a costume with an iconic mask. The Scream mask has become just as symbolic perhaps even more so than that of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees.For any serious horror movie fans Scream is essential viewing if only to witness the film that started it all. The 'movie within a movie' idea was terrific and would be taken even further in the sequel. The frequent references to classic horror movies and reversals of accepted horror clichs especially in the opening ten minutes are also fun to watch out for. There is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend  a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask the oneliners and the unique selfawareness when it comes to horror clichs make Scream a true original  accept no imitations.".

I like THE SIXTH SENSE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and SCREAM for the same reason they are more original than the default horror flick.Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell is still mourning the death of her mother who died nearly one year ago. She seems very distant even from her best friend Tatum Riley Rose McGowan and her boyfriend Billy Loomis Skeet Ulrich. She and most everyone else thought that the killer was already behind bars. But when people close to Sidney start to get killed Sidney realizes the the killer is still at large. Deputy Dewey Riley David Arquette is there to protect Sidney and reporter Gale Weathers Courteney Cox is there to get the scoop.I think the plot of this movie is very interesting and fun. The best part of it is that the killer does his murders in the style of horror movies. The rules of horror movies are often referred to and horror movies are even spoofed fairly often as well.The actors do a very good job. Neve Campbell is excellent as the primary targetvictim and main character of this movie. David Arquette does a fair job as the inexperienced cop but not as good as in the sequel and Courtney Cox does a great job as the bitch reporter. Drew Barrymore did very good in her very brief part as Casey Becker. Jamie Kennedy does an OK job as Randy Meeks the movie expert but again not as good as in the sequel. Roger Jackson is the best possible choice for the phone voice and Henry Winkler had a great cameo.The character development in this movie is good. You'll probably often yell Look behind you moron or Get out of the room idiot at your TV which this movie is probably going for. Sidney is the most interesting character with Dewey and and Gale at a close second.I was surprised that I found Scream 2 to be even better than Scream was. But both are really good. Go out and buy them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Making a brilliant original horror film is pretty hard these days since practically everything has already been told and more than once. Using that premise director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.Take the opening sequence for example a young girl Drew Barrymore is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally this would be a huge clich only this time the killer decides to play a little game horror film quiz naturally with his victim. In fact the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions those who haven't seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit as it spoils said movie's ending. That scene is both very scary the murder is quite graphic and disturbing and at the same time funny it tests the characters' and the audience's knowledge of the horror genre and the rest of the film continues in the same vein after the first killing the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same but who could it be? Sidney's distant father? Her mother's lover Liev Schreiber? Or some random guy with no motive at all?Fortunately it is not the last category this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn't the payoff that makes Scream interesting it's how Craven and Williamson get to it by outlining the genre's conventions some of which were actually invented by the director himself and using them in a clever if selfreferential way. The point of the movie is the more you know of this kind of films pay attention to the rules stated by geeky film buff Randy the more chances you have to survive although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies. The injokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream's success with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven's unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger's outfit not to mention priceless lines like Movies don't create psychos movies make psychos more creative!.In other words Scream is a smart effective horror film which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching even if the two sequels especially Scream 3 don't really match the original's intelligence and forgive the expression originality.".

	schema:reviewBody "SCREAM 1996 12Starring Neve Campbell David Arquette Courteney Cox Matthew Lillard Rose McGowan Skeet Ulrich Liev Schreiber Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler Director Wes Craven   Running time 111 minutes   Rated R for strong grizzly violence and gore language and some sexualityBy Blake FrenchScream is the mother of all teen slasher films. From the opening sequence to the somewhat silly closing cliffhanger it is one of the scariest productions of the past several years. Now about the opening sequence it features a penetrating Drew Barrymore receiving prank phone calls from a man with a deep mysterious voice who becomes more and more conversationally aggressive as they talk. What's your namebecause I want to know who I'm looking at. After building up some very effective momentum the scene has a heartstopping climatic payoff that isn't only  pointless gore but terrifying suspense. It is moments like these that make Scream one of the best movies of 1996. Scream centers on a high school girl named Sidney Prescott a modestly productive young woman who spends much of her time alone and with her boyfriend Billy. She is approaching the anniversary of her mother's murder whose killer has been convicted and sentenced to death. Sydney's school is in the process of mourning the brutal murder of two fellow classmates and the pupils aren't exactly sympathetic.One night Sidney is home alone and receives a phone call similar to the one in the opening scene. Sidney is tormented in that call and after an exchange of a few unfriendly words attacked by a dark individual wearing a white ghost mask. She fights him off however and lives another day much in regard to the mysterious appearance of her boyfriend and a young squeamish cop named Dewy. The presentation of Sidney's life is not onedimensional. The overlook on her schooling experiences classmates relatives friends and teachers are all believable. Strongly supporting the character are the details and subcharacters. It is nearly impossible to watch Scream without making a list of assumed suspects to the numerous killings that take place. Here is my prediction list of murderer suspects not telling who if anyone is the correct guess Dewy the young police officer who suspiciously shows up at nearly every crime scene and has somewhat of a psycho personality. Sidney's boyfriend Billy who is actually sent to prison for a short period of time after being accused as a prime suspect. He also appears at a crime site unexpectedly. Sidney's  father whom has motive for murder and is nowhere to be found locally. A crazy video store clerk who is obsessed with scary movies and who I forget the details of. Another element that makes Scream so great is the content of the murders. The victims aren't just helpless plot puppets waiting to die like a mannequin but real people who want to live. Each puts up a good fight in defending themselves and several nearly escape the killer. The characters who die are often unexpected members of the main castmaking this production unpredictable. The performances are electrifying in Wes Craven's highly acclaimed horror film. The actors act with dramatic intensity and the characters are perfectly cast. Each character is explored with suspicion and due to Craven's direction the villain's identity remains a mystery until the lazy finale. I am an experienced filmgoer and I thought that I had the killer picked out at mid point in the film. But I was so wrongthe film had me fooled all along and that is not an easy thing to do. I had no clue of who the killer actually was. Scream contains so many twists are turns that by the end of the movie I couldn't have correctly predicated the killer's identity if my life depended on it. Brought to you by Dimension Films.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the 1990s the Slasher genre was becoming stale filled with clichs countless sequels and very predictable and uninventive. Likely two men was able to play on this Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.In the small town of Woodsboro two teenagers Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls are shockingly murdered a year after a woman was raped and murdered in the town centre. Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil with the media reporting on it but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer known as Ghostface soon targets another Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell the daughter of a victim who luckily escapes. But Ghostface is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichs. It is a selfaware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a postmodern selfaware horror with a comic edge it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly smart decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum Rose McGowan was tough nononsense girl who could have easily been the clichd slut role but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy Jamie Kennedy and Stuart Matthew Lillard offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brothersister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thrillera social piece.Overall Scream is certainly a worthy horror film no manner what generation of horror fan you are.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like Halloween Resurrection and Urban Legends Final Cut but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along I'm all over it. As soon as Scream starts with its tremendous opening you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. Scream ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever! Wes Craven's known for his Nightmare on Elm St. The Hills Have Eyes and such. All have been OK but I think Wes has really found his place in the teen slasher genre. He makes it fun and original with the help of the excellent writers who are actually really clever at creating irony plus funny lines and characters.The thing that holds a slasher together is its characters and Scream has really memorable characters. Courtney Cox is a delight as the originally annoying TV presenter that eventually turns into someone who we actually really like. David Arquette is also really funny as Deputy Dewey the policeman. In fact the whole cast is brilliantly fun including Matthew Lillard who is suitably hammy as the friend of the group.Aside from the memorable characters and sharp wit Scream is also really exciting and suspenseful. There's even a chase scene that lasts a good 15 minutes. A rarity where nowadays its a quick 2 second chase in the woods. The cinematography and camera movements are also really interesting. The camera sometimes has this dreamlike quality to it that suits the film really well. Scream never gets dull it's tense and exciting right up to the shocking end twist that really fulfills your expectations.Scream grasps you by the throat from the minute it starts and doesn't let go. It's memorable and really exciting fun. If you're a fan of slashers like me then Scream should be at the top of your list. The sequels are quite good as well especially the incredible latest instalment Scream 4 that is probably on par with this incredible original. Horror fans should also really appreciate the references to classic horror films throughout the film. Don't answer the phone don't open the door just go onto ebay and click buy it now!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wes Craven proves he's a master of horror and innovation with Scream over 10 years since his last smash A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven had been a legend for 3 decades but with this he made possibly his best known film reinventing a dead genre for better and worse making horror films profitable again. More importantly it gave horror fans something to cheer about a smart funny sexy but above all scary film.Scream's intro has already gone down in movie history as the benchmark of a shocking and effective way to start a film. Take an established actress and eventually butcher her to set the tone. The phone knife shocks inevitability of death blood helplessness and a love of scary movies. Craven turns what we expect on its head and we know we are in for something special. We are introduced to Sydney Prescott a teenager whose mother was murdered a year ago trying to get on with her life coping with school boyfriend the court case involving Cotton who has been charged with her mother's murder and intrusion from journalists. She has become strong through this ordeal but is still vulnerable. Her boyfriend Billy wants sex but won't push her as she is still a virgin. The news of the new murder comes as a shock to the whole town. Journalists flock in including Gail Weathers who had accused Sydney of lies. In school the news spreads and the cops question the students. Sydney's tight group of friends try to work out who it was believing everyone's a suspect. Her friends are Tatum feisty strong whose boyfriend is like her and Randy movie nerd who secretly loves Sydney. When Sydney is attacked it seems the killer is after her. Her father is supposedly out of town and cannot be found a curfew is ordered and all the kids have a party. Soon the killer attacks but who is it? This is clearly one of the best horror movies of the decade not just an excuse for gore but clever on many levels and selfreferential. It is more than that being one of the best looks at teenage life in the last few years. The characters are extremely well drawn taking stereotypes but changing them against our expectations enhanced by some brilliant performances. Every cast member performs well with special mention to Randy Arquette and Lillard. Cox is good but Campbell is excellent going through a myriad of emotions proving that her character does not have to be stupid like most would typically be.Craven is in control feeding us clues as to the identity of the killer but ensuring that by the end we are surprised. Gore is used wonderfully the scares and jokes are many but it is the story of Sydney which makes it a classic. She is strong willed smart and we go through every emotion with her aided by Neve's performance. We feel for her but know we cannot help. The film is shot beautifully the scenery stunning an idyllic place to live but with dark secrets. We get many closeups of each character's face Leone style and we are hurt when one is killed but become suspicious of each one. The script is sharp with many references to horror movies which the fan will try to recognise.Thematically we return to Elm Street territory. We must fight for ourselves in the world and while our friends are the most important people in our lives they may not be around forever and we must be able to cope with their loss. Parents are either not around don't care don't understand or are to blame. Sydney's mum seems to be the catalyst for the deaths the only authority figure to gain respect is Dewey who isn't much older than the teens. The opening scene as Casey crawls towards her nearby parents with the killer behind her highlights this that the older generation will not always be able to keep us safe. The Headmaster played by Henry Winkler hates kids but he cannot organise or gain respect from them either.We are never certain of Gail's intentions another point to do with the media's involvement in society today. Death has become trivialised the victims just a ploy for ratings or power for those who tell the stories. Our thoughts on violence on violent movies are challenged Craven a veteran of criticism over use of violence. In the end it's up to us as individuals. The film shows that places we believed to be safeour homes and schools have become dangerous places today too that we are not safe anywhere. In a group or by yourself we are still vulnerable. The scene in the school toilets emphasises this point and is another beautiful scene. However the film teaches us that rather than being overcome by fear by the fact that we are not always safe we should fight.The death scenes and scary parts are memorable. My favourites Sydney on her porch staring over the hills and the scene with Sydney Billy and Gus's Don't Fear the Reaper playing in the background. It gives a perfect glimpse of what it is like to be in love at that age and together with Campbell's beauty makes an odd atmosphere especially when viewed again having watched the other 2 films. We become intimate with Sydney wishing we could save her from her pain.With the combination of genres subverted a brilliant script and score some excellent acting good scares and jokes Scream paved the way for a new breed of horror films none of which like Halloween and Elm Street have matched it. We should be thankful for Craven as he has provided the world with another film which should be watched and talked about as much as those felt to be the best movies of all time. This is certainly one of the best of our time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series Scream 4. Now for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.We open with a mysterious voice calling up a girl called Casey who is home alone about to watch a scary movie. She tries to blow him off but he is persistent and eventually begins to creep her out. Things don't end too well for Casey or her boyfriend Steve after a masked assailant has finished with them. We then switch to another girl Sidney her mother had been murdered almost a year ago and her father is about to leave on a business trip. All the talk the next day at school is about the murder and on returning home Sidney receives a call from a man with a mysterious voice. She isn't so easily scared but still she is attacked by the same masked assailant. Having fought him off her boyfriend Billy turns up just before Deputy Dewey. Having found a cell phone on him Dewey arrests Billy and Sidney goes to stay the night with Dewey's sister Tatum. As time goes by the bodies begin to mount up and this attracts the media particularly ambitious reporter Gale Weathers. It's only a matter of time before Sidney is to be the next on the list and anyway there's a score to settle and an awful lot of suspects.This made a refreshing change for me a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time has all the scares and shocks of a more serious one. I liked it! Decent performances all round Neve Campbell did a good job as Sidney as did Skeet Ulrich as Billy. Also of note were Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Also nice cameos from Drew Barrymore as Casey Wes Craven very briefly appeared as Fred the Janitor and Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry.There is a great soundtrack too including an interesting acoustic rendition of 'Don't Fear the Reaper' when Sidney and Billy are first seen on screen together very nicely done. I suspect unfortunately that the other films in the series may not live up to this rather good beginning but we shall see If you haven't seen it it's definitely worth a viewing even if you're not really a fan of teen horrors like me Final verdict Recommended.My Score 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I've gone back and forth in my feelings about Scream both times I've seen it almost 20 years ago when it opened and just now There are times when its metaparody butstillscary approach to teen slasher films works quite well especially the ending which manages to be funny scary over the top and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be. It's also a hard film to criticize because the answer to almost every complaint e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s can always be 'but that's the whole point it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich for example brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is more muddy than it needs to be. Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive and a little more obvious in it's humor that's not what you walk away remembering.".

Not only was the timing for the film perfect but Kevin Williamson's simple yet brilliant script and an almost perfect cast help hail this movie as one of the best horror movies of the 1990's. Neve Campbell as the film's sexually repressed or 'final girl' character if you will rivals that of the original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. David Arquette as Dewey Riley steals the spotlight every scene he's in Courtney Cox proves her acting talent by playing a stuck up malevolent news reporter whose passion and slight hint of selflessness makes her character hard to not love while Jamie Kennedy helps channel the audience's thoughts and concerns to everyone on screen. Even minor characters such as Matthew Lillard Rose McGowan Skeet Ulrich and even Henry Winkler all have memorable roles. Drew Barrymore's opening scene although perhaps a little overthetop is both memorable and nostalgic to horror movie lore. This strongly meta influenced film is one of the few to get the concept right and the laugh to scare ratio is perfect. The final act is a wild ride that should make everyone shudder at how plausible it would be for someone to put on a Halloween costume and start butchering inebriated teenagers.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty much a guarantee that if you grew up with fairy tales you would certainly know the story of Jack and The Beanstalk. I know I have when I was a kid this story was everywhere. I saw it played out by Mickey Mouse in the Fun and Fancy Free by Snoopy in The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show and by Bugs Bunny in Jack Wabbit and The Beanstalk. The tale is a timeless child's fantasy story and for that alone this movie mostly succeeds.After the opening credits the film opens with an introduction of our two main characters Jack played by Nicholas Hoult fresh off his role in last month's Warm Bodies and princess Isabelle played by Elanor Tomlinson. Just like in the original fairy tale Jack is a poor farm hand who is tricked into trading valuable livestock in this movie it's a horse rather than a cow for supposed magic beans. Princess Isabelle however is pretty much the textbook definition of a Disney princess. Her mother is dead her father is an overprotective king who wants her to marry someone she doesn't like she's tired of her boring life in the palace and dreams of adventure. When I first came across this character I immediately planned on chastising her as extremely clichd in this review. However once I began watching this in the context of a kids movie I found this to be much more tolerable. Though in a 2013released film it still feels kind of dated.Those expecting another Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters will be disappointed. This movie is pretty familyfriendly overall and has a light hearted attitude throughout. Despite this film's hefty body count the characters consistently joke around and get themselves into shenanigans. It could very well be irritating to those expecting a more mature fantasy based on the rating and advertising as it does admittedly feel too silly at times. However as a family film the combination of violence and silliness makes it somewhat a fusion of the family films of the 80's and 90's respectively.The rest of the characters are decently developed including the sinister Lord Roderick played by Stanley Tucci and the noble knight Elmont played by Ewan McGreggor. No character was given that much development which I actually didn't really mind. I knew enough about each character and in a fastpaced fairy tale like this keeping the plot moving and interesting were the most important aspects.The giants were pretty interesting too. In a way they reminded me of the trolls in last year's The Hobbit an Unexpected Journey as they are excessively gross uncivilized and hightempered. I'm certain that kids will get a laugh out of their flatulent boogereating ways. I was initially concerned that this film would just portray them as unstoppable villains with no personality. Instead the film fleshes them out a bit and gives them a motive for their actions. I certainly wouldn't mind a prequel film giving more meat to their hatred for mankind.The cast gives their all especially Nicholas Hoult. Here he brings to Jack the same charm and timidity he gave to R in Warm Bodies. I feel that he he has the capability and likability to carry a movie as the lead role and I look forward to his future endeavors next year.Jack The Giant Slayer will reasonably divide critics and audiences but if I had kids I would have no problem taking them to see this. It's a fun little adventure that kids and openminded adults will get a kick out of.".

The King sends a rescue party of his knights and the princess's evil fianc to rescue the princess and the evil prince uses the magical crown in an attempt to seize the power of the giants to take over the kingdom. It was refreshing to find a non ironic non meta straightforward telling of this story with some elements of charm and humor. The 3D is fairly unspectacular although there are great sequences such as the collapse of the vine which causes catastrophic damage below. The body count for a family film is quite high surpassing some of the later Harry Potter movies. It is also notable that there are virtually no females in either the giants' or human's realm. The cast is fine and Nicholas Hoult makes a fine Jack and brings more life and personality to the role than he did earlier this year with Warm Bodies.Most elements of the film work quite well and it has the potential to work alongside dark family fare like The Never Ending Story or The Dark Crystal.".

All the nerds out there complaining about the CGI and poor quality of the giants go get a girlfriend watch some sports and stop being such a geek. Special effects and CGI are fine in this movie again this is a movie about a fairy tale so imagination should be something needed for a film about flesh hungry giants that live in the sky. Most of us know the ending to this movie without watching it but the extra story line added in to extend the movie are entertaining and do not spoil the film or change the classic story we all know. I recommend this movie but please watch it with an open mind and remember that your watching a film of a child fantasy story. I give this film a 9....more of a 78 but I threw it an extra point or two just cause all the dorks who are highly critical of such non sense regarding a film about a kids bed time story ha ha.".

This beanstalk leads too a legendary land in the clouds where the promised giants off the title roam. Sounds familiar? That's because it is. But its been delved into further with more characters some extra imagination and many action set pieces thrown in to make it a damn good feature length family movie.Its not perfect.

Jack and the beanstalk was a suitable fairytale to be adapted on the big screen. It had giants heights and monstrous plants. The whole theater was laughing nonstop and below are the reasons why. 1. The parallels between Jack and Isabel the most clichd name for a girl btw. Remember Twilight? when they were young children and then grownups.it showed that people who come from different backgrounds can be similar and that they didn't just end up together because they went through some adventures they were fated from the beginning. 2. I like the tiein from every random scene. Etc when Jack was giving a pompous speech and everyone kneeled down and he said there's someone behind me right? it wasn't just some random thing but it was repeated later to show how Jack had grown from a commoner to a prince. 3. The action! The movie isn't afraid to be gory and scary what with human torture murder the last stand and giants. 4. They purposely made the bad guys ugly and stupid easy to hate. Especially the sidekick who died such an ironic death. 5. I like how Jack was portrayed as a brave and smart guy. He didn't just trade a horse for 5 beanshe was supposed to exchange the beans for 10 copper coins! He figured out how to kill giant in an ingenious way. Also he is nice to everyone and handsome to boot. 6. And I love how the movie ends up being related to the modern world shows how smart is film is. It doesn't need to be in a fantasy because it makes sense and is realistic! Just don't go in with low expectations you will be pleasantly surprised!".

Of all the actors McGregor charmed me the most in a calmly confident role as head of the king's Guardians. Hoult and McGregor battle the giants in the clouds and then engage in round two when the giants come to earth. Tucci is good as always in this case playing the villain. The special effects are well done but not overdone as is so often the case nowadays. The story is pretty much told straight without a lot of fluff although the running time of about two hours was probably more than it needed to be.

	schema:reviewBody "In the kingdom of Cloister in Albion there is a legend about giants that came from the realm of Gantua between Earth and Heaven using a large beam stalk and were defeated by King Eric that was wearing a magic crown. The eighteen yearold daydreamer farmer Jack Nicholas Hoult has been fascinated by this tale since he was a boy. When he goes to the market to sell his uncle's horse and cart to buy material to repair the farmhouse roof he defends the honor of Princess Isabelle Eleanor Tomlinson who is also fan of the legend and is secretly in town and Jack has a crush on her. Then he stumbles with a monk that has stolen magic beams from the evil Roderick Stanley Tucci who is engaged with Isabelle and he offers the beams to Jack to have his horse and escape from the soldiers that are chasing him. When Jack shows the beams to his uncle he throws them on the floor angry with the naivety of his nephew. Meanwhile Isabelle flees from the castle to have her own adventure but she finds a storm and seeks shelter coincidently at Jack's farmhouse. But one of the beams is watered and a huge beam stalk grows taking Jack's house with the princess trapped inside. When King Brahmwell Ian McShane arrives in Jack's land with his knights he sends a team of the princess's guardians to seek out Isabelle. Jack volunteers to go with them led by the knights Elmont Ewan McGregor Crawe Eddie Marsan and Bald Mingus Johnston. Roderick and his rightarm Wicke Ewen Bremner cut the rope and most of the knights falls from the sky and dies. Soon they find the land of Gantua and learn that the giants are not legend. Will they succeed to rescue Princess Isabelle? And what are the evil intentions of Roderick and Wicke? Jack the Giant Slayer is a great family entertainment with a funny and full of action story. The special effects are topnotch and as usual professional critics pretentious intellectuals and imbeciles do not like this type of movie but they insist on watching it to write bad reviews. Bryan Singer again makes a great movie and the only but would be Nicholas Hoult in the role of an eighteen yearold teenager. The character could be a little older in the story. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Jack  O Caador de Gigantes Jack  The Giants Hunter".

And so it is with disappointment I must pause for a moment to sigh. Heavily.Adapted from the fairy tale the origin of which is uncertain Brian Singer's film takes liberties with the most commonly known version of Jack and the Beanstalk including with the classic rhyme that we all know begins Fefifofum! I smell the blood of an Englishman Not in this version! In this version Jack lives with his uncle Christopher Fairbank who sends him off to market to sell the cart. Jack prefers instead to watch Warwick Davies in a pantomime of yes Jack and the Beanstalk then gallantly save a beautiful girl who happens to be the princess before emerging to discover the cart has been stolen. He promptly sells the horse for a handful of beans that grow in to a beanstalk that reaches a mythical land of giants. And so it goes on.Do you remember when The Usual Suspects arrived and we thought Bryan Singer had the potential to be a great director? Well he's forgotten how to do what he once did. In 2008's Valkyrie a story that history tells us ends badly Singer placed us on the edge of our seats leaving us hoping desperately that the history books were wrong. It was thrilling. Jack the Giant Slayer isn't.Yes much of it looks pretty. The giants in closeup at least look fine some of the CGI is impressive just don't look at the fire too closely the scenery is attractive the beanstalk grows well there are some humorous moments like the pig in blankets gag and some of the characters are enjoyable to watch. But this is a film only for undemanding children who have yet to learn how magical cinema can be.The preamble and prologue are painful and manage to be twee patronising and tedious simultaneously. Much of the potential humour is lost by poor delivery incorrectly emphasized overegged or just ineptly spouted and poor scripting and a lack of attention to detail further damage the experience. What the hell happens to the uncle? He just disappears never to be seen again. How is it that the crown fits tightly to Roderick's Stanley Tucci head then fits easily around two of General Fallon's Bill Nighy fingers and then slots onto a human head again? Have a look at the diameter of his fingers compared to human heads. How did Singer miss that? More than that there is zero chemistry between Jack Nicholas Hoult and Isabelle Eleanor Tomlinson and even worse Hoult couldn't be bothered to turn up to the shoot and sent his cardboard cutout instead. How did nobody notice that he really can't act in this? What happened to the Hoult who showed promise in About a Boy and Skins? Trust me he is emphatically not a reason to sit through two hours of Jack the Giant Slayer.The Ewans McGregor and Bremner both have fun hamming it up and wearing comedy hairstyles and Bill Nighy gives a good vocal performance as principal baddie without his trademark snortlaugh. Jack the Giant Slayer generally passes the time but it does a Cutthroat Island on us promises much excitement but delivers little whimpers and the odd smile.Eddie Marsan is given barely 10 lines before he is dispatched elsewhere. Ian McShane as King Brahmwell looks uncomfortable delivering stilted cheesy dialogue. As for Isabelle why bother? She serves only to make Jack look heroic though he fails anyway and her part in this story does little for the viewer other than to imply that the four writers behind this don't actually like writing for women. If you need more evidence guess how many of the giants are female. None! Watch Jack the Giant Slayer because you need to get the kids out of the house but keep your expectations low and prove that you're a good parent in a few months by taking them to see Iron Man 3.Surely that has to be better For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.".

	schema:headline " A Golden AgeStyled Throwback to the Era of Errol Flynn";
	schema:reviewBody "If you even have a passing knowledge of the Jack and the Beanstalk fairy tale then you know the story of Jack the Giant Slayer. Where director Bryan Singer's film finds its footing and stands on its own is that it doesn't try to reimagine the fairy tale as something darker or more twisted but rather makes the film like a Golden Age Errol Flynn adventure film such as The Adventures of Robin Hood. Jack the Giant Slayer is a very simple film in that you know who the heroes and the villains are from the first time you see them it's not looking to overcomplicate the fairy tale or create surprise. The film utilizes the archetypal characters from the Hero's Journey just as the original Star Wars did and from the first moments you see farm boy Jack and princess Isabelle you know their motivations and you're already in love with them. Nicholas Hoult and Eleanor Tomlinson have very good chemistry as Jack and Isabelle but the performance I loved the most was Ewan McGregor doing his best Errol Flynn impression as swashbuckler Elmont the knight. Rounding out the cast is Stanley Tucci as bad guy Roderick and he's the type of mustache twirling bad guy you remember from all those great adventure flicks of your youth.What really sells this film as a throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood is that the film never takes itself too seriously and always remains lighthearted and adventurous with jokes even in some of the more serious moments where Singer and company could have made it darker. Then there's the spot on musical score by John Ottman who channels the best of Old Hollywood's goto adventure film composer Max Steiner with a recurring theme that is memorable and heroic. However what really separates this film from being like those Errol Flynn swashbucklers is the sheer scope of the story.A film like this could not have been made in the Golden Age of Hollywood and I would argue that this film could have not even been made ten years ago in live action at least. To effectively pull this concept off the film required tons of special effects to work and while some of the CGI work isn't always photorealistic and a little cartoonish all of the giants are created through motion capture performance technology and without it this film could not have been realized. It's this ginormous scale that makes the film modern and not simply a throwback to a bygone era of moviemaking. Though to assume that Jack the Giant Slayer is so simple that it doesn't actually have anything to say would also be wrong.The true brilliance of Jack the Giant Slayer is the thematic idea that ties the entire story together of how stories are told and how stories change over time and become myth or are taken out of context to where people often forget that something they read in a book actually occurred and is the truth. I found this commentary hitting very close to home. Whether it's history myth or a religious tome many people nowadays seem to not ever think twice about the stories that exist in our society and refuse to believe and Jack the Giant Slayer has me genuinely thinking about the truths so often ignored in those stories.I give Jack the Giant Slayer a 9 out of 10!".

It does add in a slimy rotter Stanley Tucci having enormous fun with Duston Hoffman's old teeth from Hook and a rather anonymous princess with a much less anonymous dad in the form of Ian McShane and a host of expeditioners up the beanstalk all of who are available for slaughter and not always in the order you expected either. Nicholas Hoult is a personable Jack and Bill Nighy as the Giant General gives his Davy Jones voice from Pirates another outing albeit with an Ulster overcoat replacing the kilt.The special effects are terrific the 3D less so like so many 3D movies there are some shots which have a Wow! element but the 3D is hardly noticeable through much of the movie.Some of the violence is such that I would not recommend this for small children.

The theater we went to didn't have the special glasses that Avatar did so the quality wasn't as good but the story was just as enjoyable.While Jack and the Princess acted well I frankly did not think that neither of them looked good enough. It always makes it tough for me to watch a princess that is frankly not pretty.In my opinion the movie is worth the cost of watching in the theater in 3D.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this at a special screening and since I'm wring reviews more often I thought it'd be perfect to share my thoughts on this one. 'Jack the Giant Slayer' is basically just a retelling of Jack and the Giant Beanstalk with some twists. Think of it kind of like the recent Kristin Stewart film 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. Except maybe this one is geared more towards the gentlemen of the crowd where the former was the opposite. This film is as epic as 'Lord of the Rings' and if you like that kind of thing you should enjoy this one.I won't give away anything about the plot but you should already know the idea of what it is. There is not just one giant in this film there are many and there are plenty of action sequences to keep you engrossed. Nicholas Hoult plays the lead and he holds the role well. He can also be seen in 'Warm Bodies'. Bryan Singer directs and we all know he's responsible for 'XMen'. Lets just say the apple doesn't fall far from the beanstalk! I will for sure see this epic fantasy adventure again.If you've ever played the classic PlayStation One game 'Legend of Dragoon' you'll notice a little resemblance in the war between humans and giants gigantos in that game. Like I said in my last review sit back and enjoy the ride because thats what it's meant to be not a deep thinking film.If you think Bryan Singer is incapable of making anything decent after 'Superman Returns' think again because you don't know jack!".

It is a refreshing tale to see him rising through the ranks and valiantly serve his country. The interweaving story telling scenes in the beginning annoyed me a little because I thought it was a bit too forced. Overall I like Jack the Giant Slayer because of the poignant ending.".

With a lot of classic children stories being redone this was a pleasant surprise with just enough references to the original story to tie things in nicely.It was not overly violent and not not filled with blood and gore which makes it acceptable to all but the youngest crowds.There was just enough comedy in the film to make it fun to watch without being overdone and silly. The interaction between the giant with the two heads was clever.The CGI of the giants was very good and a pleasure to watch. The acting was pretty good with the characters that you are supposed to love and hate done right.Elwin the head of the kings guard was grateful for Jack's heroics and did not give any sort of lectures telling Jack his place which I have seen in too many movies.Isabelle was a princess and remained one. She did not grab the sword and do all the heroic feats as you see in too many movies. She was not cowardly but allowed the hero to be a hero.Jack he was the hero of the movie but humble he knows the laws of the land. Saving the princess he does not have any wild ideas that they are going to be together.Roderick you know from the start he is the villain and gives a passable performance as someone who are not supposed to like and cheer against. Though his crony Wicke I did not like at all.King Brahmwell he was a good king and does what he thinks is right even though he might not like the outcome.Overall it is a fun movie to watch. The acting is good characters for the most part are believable. Do not expect any academy awards but if you are looking for some good escapism it is worth seeing.".

It was more a mushy Lois and Clarke story than a good Superman movie pushing the franchise further down to depths.Another addition to his disgrace is this year's Jack The Giant Slayer.

This time though the wheel of misfortune landed on a modern day retelling of Jack  The Beanstalk. I used to love the tale of Jack the beanstalk the golden goose and but of course the giant. The illustrations from the huge fairytale book still afresh in my head. It was as simple as that and exactly why it retains the title of one of the best fairy tales ever. What we've got here with Jack The Giant Slayer is a mangled mess of a fairytale. Jack The Giant Slayer is unnecessarily filled with one dimensional characters a convoluted plot about the war going on between humans and giants and unconvincing CG Giantsloads of em. Despite having some major AAA actors like Ian McShane Stanley Tucci Eddie Marsan everybody among the cast felt like they were forced to act. Even the ever wonderful Ewan McGregor was not at his best here. And please don't get me started on Nicholas Hoult as Jack. I was like WTF when I'd seen him in Xmen First Class. If there ever was a male Kristen Stewart counterpart that'd be him. I say he's better off playing the zombie in Warm Bodies.The only saving graces are the bewitchingly gorgeous Eleanor Tomlinson as Princess Isabelle who'd if not by acting charms will steal the scene via pleasing your eyes and a better mocapped Bill Nighy as the giant General Fallon he at least brought some life to the otherwise lifeless CG giant. In spite of being PG13 its ridden with very dark visuals. PS Mr Bryan If you are still going for a gorefest you better don't chop off the juicy partslike when a giant is shown biting the head off a guy though quickly snipped so as not to show gore. Now that I've seen this along with Bryan's recent attempts at TV's Mockingbird Lane my thoughts regarding XMen Days of the Future Past remains perilously skeptic.".

I think that's the target audience at least.It would make my job a lot easier just to list all the faults such as terrible editing plot holes big enough for the giants to crawl through cheap 3D soso acting bland dialogue and most of all atrocious and sometimes laughoutloud special effects. But in reality it wasn't allaround as bad as it could've been.This is thanks to the efforts of the secondary roles such as Ewan McGregor's standout performance as Elmont and Ian McShane's King Brahmwell. Even though that last one wasn't great at least he did decent. Also every once in a while the cinematography was good. Not often enough but enjoyable for what few minutes they showed.Pretty bland and mostly boring farmer Jack Nicolas Hoult likes adventure because he tells us and also naturally likes Princess Isabelle Eleanor Tomlinson. She too favors adventure or so she tells us. Well they get their wish when they inadvertently become taken up up and away a magical beanstalk to what looks like just more Earth only higher. Except of course giants reside up there and they ain't nice.Enter in basic storytelling  again great for youngerthanpreteens and get ready for a giant battle. Not really but I thought I would throw that pun in there.As mentioned the editing and script left a lot to be finished had they released this later in the year. For example when the brave knights scale the beanstalk and see the house the princess might be still in the scene abruptly changes to the men actually stating she wasn't in there. I guess we're to assume they checked it which actually might have been a cool scene to see. Much like the beanstalk that should've been in most of the background shots but despite everyone always being near it it's rarely shown. Forgotten almost.Oh and I haven't even got to the bad bad CGI used for the giants and their juvenile behaviors that might please an even younger crowd than the one intended. Anyone above six most likely rolled their eyes even unintentionally. In addition to rolling my own eyes I did shake my head more than a few times while laughing at the movie in other scenes.Going back to my original point I really thought this would be great for young kids but damn some people die some horrible ways. Again mostly offscreen but they told us exactly how they were slaughtered. Pity. Now I can't recommend this to any age audience.Please no sequel. That's my final thought.".

The return of Ruby and Bobby was also a good idea. I loved watching Ruby seek redemption by saving the others and Bobby has a small but smart part. It's nice to actually see a character that is smart and stays behind.Michael Berryman returning as Pluto had it's pros and cons. I loved seeing his conflict with the dog Beast but I also hated how in the original he was very menacing and creepy here he is comic relief.

Really! If you don't keep saying Gee this movie is crap compared to the original I mean it's not a great movie but it's not unwatchable. Some things are pretty annoying andor stupid... like...When the girl finally admits to being the excannibal sister Ruby and that it was Bobby's family that was in the incident THEY DON'T CARE! GEE I was hoping they would at least react! PED ME OFF! That ruined some of the movie for me... The characters just don'tttt care.The characters most of them P ME OFF also. All they do is walk around saying Yeahhh right there's nothing to worry about hahaha. The 'there's nothing to worry about' attitude Gets old.Hardly anyone finds out when someone has been killed. That's part of the fun of horror movies for the people to find out someones dead go tell the others and freak out!The ending was ridiculus. So the guy came up with that ingenius plot? Wow... he must be next in line for the Pulitzer! Brilliant.But it is just a movie.... Keep telling yourself that....That's about it now with all that said there dosent seem to be any good things about it... Annoying... Sometimes stupid but never really boring... Not the worst choice for a boring day. Plus there's not as many flashbacks as some people would lead you to believe...510".

Really! If you don't keep saying Gee this movie is crap compared to the original I mean it's not a great movie but it's not unwatchable. Some things are pretty annoying andor stupid... like...When the girl finally admits to being the excannibal sister Ruby and that it was Bobby's family that was in the incident THEY DON'T CARE! GEE I was hoping they would at least react! PED ME OFF! That ruined some of the movie for me... The characters just don'tttt care.The characters most of them P ME OFF also. All they do is walk around saying Yeahhh right there's nothing to worry about hahaha. The 'there's nothing to worry about' attitude Gets old.Hardly anyone finds out when someone has been killed. That's part of the fun of horror movies for the people to find out someones dead go tell the others and freak out!The ending was ridiculus. So the guy came up with that ingenius plot? Wow... he must be next in line for the Pulitzer! Brilliant.But it is just a movie.... Keep telling yourself that....That's about it now with all that said there dosent seem to be any good things about it... Annoying... Sometimes stupid but never really boring... Not the worst choice for a boring day. Plus there's not as many flashbacks as some people would lead you to believe...510";

I think we're all familiar with the first one.  If you're not then you shouldn't be viewing it.  Any reality or spontaneity is also gone.  You know who is going to die right away.  The cast is decent though.  Michael Berryman Robert Houston and Janus Blythe all return.  Kevin Blair from Friday the 13th Part 7 and Peter Frechette from The Kindred play motocros bikers while Nicholas Worth plays the voice of the Reaper.  And can anyone tell me where the Reaper was hiding in the first film?  If you didn't enjoy the first Hills Have Eyes you aint gonna like this one.

In fact I would rate this one even below the director's other 80s stinkers Shocker and The People Under the Stairs.  The best scenes in this are the long flashbacks from the first movie and there are several of them  the damn dog even has one! Unfortunately in between the flashbacks we also get the new' story about a bunch of dirt bikers stranded in the desert when their bus runs out of gas.  Once again they are attacked and killed off by the two remaining members of the savage cannibalistic clan from the first film John Bloom as Reaper and Michael Berryman returning as the scarylooking but wimpy Pluto who gets his ass kicked by dogs and chics throughout the movie.  Robert Houston also returns as Bobby in a brief opening cameo and Janus Blythe returns as the newly reformed and now civilized Ruby when she reveals to everyone that she was raised by a desertdwelling family of killer cannibals no one seems to care!  Absolutely nothing works this time around.  The characterizations and motivations are dumb there are gaping plot holes there is no suspense no blood no guts  in short none of the hyperrealistic savagery fear and helplessness that made the first one so good.  The blind heroine of this movie Tamara Stafford is so perceptive that she can hear things when no one else can and can sense when a person is afraid but she doesn't even know when someone's smoking a cigarette right next to her!  I heard that this movie underwent a lot of prerelease cutting before it came out and that's why it turned out so badly  personally I think this is a load of bunk.  Even movies that are cut up left and right before release should give some indication of whether they could be potentially good or not and this one gives no such signs of any potential whatsoever.Lowlight  The fiery demise of Reaper  the hero concocts a ridiculous trap for him involving a gasoline tank the school bus a ring of fire and a cable connected to a motor that will pull him between Reaper's legs and through the flames to safety.  It's useless to try explaining it  you have to see it to believe it but I wouldn't advise it.".

Pugh Jane Colleen Riley and Sue Penny Johnson and get lost on a side road. Searching an abandoned house Pluto Michael Berryman and Reaper John Bloom attacks them and begins systematically killing them one by one. Gathering every ounce of strength they have as a group they fight back against the murderous pair.The Good News As one of the most maligned films in the genre this wasn't expected to be all that good. The fact that its mostly just a carbon copy of the first isn't really that damaging as it allows for a constant stream of action scenes throughout the film. The dirtbike and ensuing foot chase through the mountains through various caverns is a wonderful action sequence. The large amount of suspense played out in the cavern sequence in the end was a great highlight as the novel idea of having the main character in that sequence being blind was able to make some new ideas out of a clichd experience. It's quite nice to see something that had been taken through all of the possible explorations but then to add a great new gimmick that actually adds some suspense to the proceedings. It's quite nervewracking to see them wander through the situations unaware of what's out there and there's no way for it to change. The fact that it changes styles over the first one and becomes more of a stalkandslash film is a nice change of pace and adds a little more to the film. Overall this wasn't as bas as some say.The Bad News Even though it wasn't all that bad there's still a couple things wrong. The plot is a virtual retread of the first one and the situation to get them involved with the group is a stepbystep repeat of before. It really doesn't try anything new here and instead goes mainly for new traps and more characters. That doesn't really make it all that different from the first one. The fact that it's so maligned is based mostly around that and it's cheese factor which doesn't bode too well for most movies. This one tries to rise against it with a couple of great moments but the fact that it's so cheesy and clichd is the major source of complaint. I didn't have too many problems with this one.The Final Verdict Far better than it's reputation will give it but don't compare it to the original and it might be interesting. Take it on it's own merits and you might find yourself enjoying it a lot more than you would.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and a very brief mild sex scene".

Searching an abandoned house Pluto Michael Berryman and Reaper John Bloom attacks them and begins systematically killing them one by one. Gathering every ounce of strength they have as a group they fight back against the murderous pair.The Good News As one of the most maligned films in the genre this wasn't expected to be all that good. The fact that its mostly just a carbon copy of the first isn't really that damaging as it allows for a constant stream of action scenes throughout the film. The dirtbike and ensuing foot chase through the mountains through various caverns is a wonderful action sequence. The large amount of suspense played out in the cavern sequence in the end was a great highlight as the novel idea of having the main character in that sequence being blind was able to make some new ideas out of a clichd experience. It's quite nice to see something that had been taken through all of the possible explorations but then to add a great new gimmick that actually adds some suspense to the proceedings. It's quite nervewracking to see them wander through the situations unaware of what's out there and there's no way for it to change. The fact that it changes styles over the first one and becomes more of a stalkandslash film is a nice change of pace and adds a little more to the film. Overall this wasn't as bas as some say.The Bad News Even though it wasn't all that bad there's still a couple things wrong. The plot is a virtual retread of the first one and the situation to get them involved with the group is a stepbystep repeat of before. It really doesn't try anything new here and instead goes mainly for new traps and more characters. That doesn't really make it all that different from the first one. The fact that it's so maligned is based mostly around that and it's cheese factor which doesn't bode too well for most movies. This one tries to rise against it with a couple of great moments but the fact that it's so cheesy and clichd is the major source of complaint. I didn't have too many problems with this one.The Final Verdict Far better than it's reputation will give it but don't compare it to the original and it might be interesting. Take it on it's own merits and you might find yourself enjoying it a lot more than you would.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and a very brief mild sex scene";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure some would say that you'd have a better chance of picking the winning lottery numbers every week than picking out the worst horror sequel of all time. Hell when a film like Silent Night Deadly Night can spawn no less than four followups there is obviously a LOT for one to choose from. But those who think that this is truly an impossible task have never seen the Hills Have Eyes Part II. And boy I sure envy them because they won't have to go to their graves pondering what else they could've done with their life during the 90 minutes they used up to watch this film. Hills Have Eyes II is not even gracious enough to provide one with 90 minutes of bad laughs. It is just plain DEAD! I mean this must have had the most unenthusiastic film shoot in history. The direction the script and the acting are so flat that it doesn't look anyone involved in the project gives a damn at all. You'd never think that Wes Craven himself whose 1977 original was a genuine horror masterpiece could be responsible for such an utterly lifeless piece of celluloid but as he's stated many times before this came at a time when he'd do ANYTHING to scratch out a living in the film biz though I'd personally have chosen to find work at a sweat shop than have my name attached to something like this. Thankfully his next project was the hugely successful Nightmare on Elm Street which helped the otherwise talented filmmaker go on to bigger things though ironically Hills II was held back for release until a year afterwards and would probably still be sitting on a shelf somewhere if Elm Street were not such a success.Anyway there's no sense dwelling on where this sequel goes wrong because it does so in EVERY department but there are definitely a great deal of things that stick out. Despite being such a lifeless piece of work The Hills Have Eyes Part II is and always will be remembered among horror fans for one reason and one reason only the dog's flashback. That's right in the annals of horror movie stupidity there has never been a moment to top the lunacy of the Carter family dog having a flashback to some of the events he witnessed in the original film! Hell there are so many damn flashback sequences in this film that it actually makes for a reason to watch it if one has trouble finding a copy of the original Hills Have Eyes they can just rent the sequel since it shows just about every scene from the original anyway. Of course those who fondly remember the original are gonna be shaking their heads at the absurd contrivances in this sequel. The only returning member of the mutant family this time around is Pluto who is now living in the desert with The Reaper who is supposed to be the brother of Papa Jupiter the original leader of the clan. Think about this for a second. Remember the chilling scene in the original Hills where the old man at the gas station tells the story about his wife giving birth to Jupiter and how the kid developed into a monster that eventually murdered their daughter? Strange that he makes no mention of Jupiter having a brother. Even stranger is how he says that giving birth to Jupiter almost tore his poor wife apart  yet she still finds the strength to deliver another kid that's even bigger. But not to worry about the plot holes since Craven doesn't give any more regard to his direction or editing either especially near the end when one of the major characters just disappears completely from the picture! I'd just love to ramble on endlessly about all the laughable blunders in this film but I realize that taking the time to complain about it is just another set of minutes that I'll end up wishing I'd spent on better things when I go to my grave.".

Only drawback is this film compared to Friday the 13th in a lesser sense as death scenes were comparative and most of them were unexciting. Parts I found interesting were Ruby's return to the desert as a civilized human now the number of remaining mine cannibals and the amount of buildings. This film was far less brutal than the original however many flashbacks and references connected the two well enough to be franchised. I physically burst out laughing to the canine flashback scene I wont spoil it and tell you what happened but I will remind you its infamous and applaudable. This was a somewhat entertaining 87 minutes of an 80s horror sequel and may be valuable to have viewed for the upcoming The Hills Have Eyes 2 2007. 80s horror sequels comparable to this film include The Return of the Living Dead Part II A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge Friday the 13th Part II and The Howling II.

My boyfriend and I didn't even hesitate to pick it up we thought it was going to be another awesome fright fest of the blood thirsty cannibals with probably better effects since Wes had pretty much made good money at that point and also established himself as a great film maker at that point. So we watched it last night with the lights off and you know what happened after the movie was over? We just looked at each other with the most blank stare as if we just saw a car accident. The Hills Have Eyes Part II was just a poorly made film and Wes should be ashamed of himself for ever thinking that this would have been a good movie. The characters were just ridicules and not to mention that he brought back characters that either died in the first film or would have no purpose in this sequel. Not to mention the characters from the first film have flashbacks from the first Hills have Eyes movie but also the dog has a flashback as well! This story was just a bomb.We have a group of teenage friends on a bus just going across the country one of the girls happens to be Ruby the little cannibal girl from the first film that saved the baby somehow she's established herself into a model citizen that has a bubble gum personality until she bumps into her old relatives at the same site with the group. That's right they're all at the same site and now they are invited to dinner where I'm sure they'll be the guests of honor.The Hills Have Eyes Part II was really pathetic and low not to mention beyond unbelievable. They didn't explain some of the deaths they never explained what happened to the rest of the family from the first film we only see the brother and he has a pointless role because you don't see him for the rest of the film. Also of course some how the blind girl manages to save the day... I just I can't I'm sorry I just really hated this film. I can't believe Wes did this to his own classic tale just please do yourself a favor stay as far away from this film as you can it's no wonder I didn't hear of it probably people don't wanna think that it ever happened.110".

More like ninth circle of flashback hell.Now filmhounds will tell you that the flashback is a weak cinematictechnique but that a skilled director can sometimes pull it off.  Thesepeople assumed the dreamer was bipedal.  When a DOG starts havingflashbacks... My God. I was so young.My rating 210. A documentary perhaps on how a horror films can go wrongakin to the Teenagers Don't Drink and Drive flicks shown at some highschools.  Avoid.".

That didn't turn out to matter though because nearly the entirecontents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick. A double feature?  More like ninth circle of flashback hell.Now filmhounds will tell you that the flashback is a weak cinematictechnique but that a skilled director can sometimes pull it off.  Thesepeople assumed the dreamer was bipedal.  When a DOG starts havingflashbacks... My God. I was so young.My rating 210. A documentary perhaps on how a horror films can go wrongakin to the Teenagers Don't Drink and Drive flicks shown at some highschools.  Avoid.";

After filming most  but not all  of the original script the backers reneged and pulled funding before it could be completed leaving the unfinished film to languish on a shelf somewhere for a spell. It wasn't until after Elm Street's success that the studio convinced Craven to finally finish it. And no he wasn't given money to shoot the rest of the footage he was simply left with the task of piecing together what WAS shot and then padding the rest out with flashback footage from the first. To tie it to the original several cast members return to reprise their roles and the same basic premise and desert setting are retained but the tone and the approach to the material is quite different this time out. In fact it's almost impossible to believe the same man could possibly be responsible for both films. This sequel seems more like a secondrate cashin made by an inept inexperienced hack attempting to capitalize on the first film's success than an alreadyestablished filmmaker. It's no wonder Craven later disowned this film.After the opening credit scroll informs us that The following film is based on fact lol please we briefly catch up with original Hills survivor Bobby Carter Robert Houston. Still traumatized by the events of the first movie Bobby finds himself unable to accompany his buddies across the desert to a motocross competition to test out their new Super Formula Racing Fuel. Going in his place is his friend Rachel Janus Blythe who as Ruby was a member of the desertdwelling family of the first film but is now a reformed excannibal after having helped the Carter family put an end to her brood's murderous ways. Or so she thinks. Along with three racers a mechanic a few girlfriends and Beast the same German Shepherd from the first movie don't ask Rachel  Ruby soon finds herself back in familiar territory. Running short on time the crew decide to venture off the main road and take a shortcut their bus breaks down near an abandoned mine and then the rest plays out like business as usual as Pluto Michael Berryman and Papa Jupiter's hereunto unmentioned big brother The Reaper John Bloom start picking them off one by one.Gone is the original film's intelligent subtext centered around two vastly different families clashing over harsh terrain and an ordinary mildmannered middleclass family forced to turn as vicious as their attackers in order to protect themselves. In its place we get a handful of obnoxious illdefined cardboard teenagers no one could possibly give two hoots about. While the first film was a tense bleak survival film this one is presented just like any number of other poorlymade slasher flicks with characters who continually do senseless and idiotic things pitiful attempts at comedy and terrible dialogue You're not feeling psychic again are you like you sometimes do?. The slasher feel is reinforced further by Harry Manfredini's rehashed music which is nothing more than recycled bits and pieces from the Friday THE 13TH series. I could even live with all that but this film is genuinely inept and filled with continuity errors and lapses in basic logic. It's almost mindnumbingly stupid... and the absurd moment the dog has his own flashback is really just the tip of the iceberg!Early on Rachel has a runin with Pluto and uses karate ! to defend herself. Immediately afterward she's shown laughing and joking along with the rest of the cast and accusing two guys who have disappeared of playing pranks too hard instead of you know putting two and two together they may have been killed by the psycho cannibal who'd just attacked her moments earlier. After she leaves the teens in her charge to go look around they proceed to joke play pranks on each other and and idiotically wander off by themselves so they can get killed. The movie probably reaches its low point when one of the cannibals steals a motorcycle slaps on a helmet and starts driving around the rock cliffs while laughing maniacally. I wasn't even sure if this was supposed to be funny or not.The murders themselves are rather tame. Someone's crushed by rocks and there are a couple of booby traps but most are just yanked offscreen and then found dead later on. The only gory moment is when one of the girls gets her throat cut and even that's not much. For what it's worth our heroine Tamara Stafford ends up being a blind girl who has some kind of extrasensory perception though the script doesn't really make novel use of that idea. The only thing this really has going for it are some nicelooking outdoor shooting locations and the underground lair the last few scenes take place in. Other than that it's terrible.".

Since those events Bobby has created a brand new type of fuel named 'Super Formula' that he  some friends are going to test out in the desert in a dirtbike race.

Unfortunately after a mixup with the time it appears that they won't make the start in time in time that is unless they take a shortcut across the open desert where they damage their bus  become stranded at a abandoned house. It's not long before they come under attack from more cannibal cavemen including Pluto Michael Berryman who actually survived the original after all... Written  directed by Wes Craven this sequel to his original The Hills Have Eyes 1977 is probably not as good  has a bad reputation but despite this I actually found it an alright way to pass 85 minutes. The script has a decent setup I surprisingly quite liked the characters even if they were stereotypes  I thought it moved along at a fair pace. The one thing I didn't like about The Hills have Eyes Part II is the slow middle section which started to drag after a promising setup  not a lot of thought was put into it's reasoning. It descends into standard slasher film mode towards the end but I thought it handled itself reasonably well although it could have done with a slightly better bad guy rather than an ugly fat drunk looking bloke who can't even run properly. I personally don't think the flashbacks from the original harm The Hills Have Eyes Part II much they are few in number  are all over before the halfway mark despite what you may have read elsewhere. Director Craven manages to create some decent scenes  good atmosphere which he is aided immensely by the Californian desert locations as they add a unique picturesque bleakness  beauty to the film  make for a perfect isolated location that many horror films rely on. The cinematography by David Lewis capture these locations pretty well  as a whole The Hills Have Eyes Part II is well made with some OK bike stunts  considering it supposedly only had a budget of 1000000 I didn't think it turned out so bad. The gore is somewhat tame but more plentiful than the original someone is impaled there is a slit throat some severed limbs  dead bodies  a hatchet stuck in someone's head. The acting is OK for what it's worth which isn't much. While I can't say The Hills Have Eyes Part II is a particularly good film I can't say it's a bad one either I found it quite watchable  to an extent entertaining. If your stuck for something to watch for 85 minutes than I think you could do a lot worse than this worth a watch at least.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gangster Squad is entertaining as hell. It's also a total mess. Seriously it's like watching a liveaction cartoon with an Alist cast trying so hard to make this dialogue credible but there's nothing they can do. It's a cartoon. Over the top hammy dialogue crazy shootouts with no consequence. If you don't shut your brain off within the first 20 minutes of this movie then you're doing something wrong. It's a shame because the plot is based off of the real life gangster Mickey Cohen who was the ruler of LA for a time and the source material has endless potential. But the faster you can accept that that's not the kind of movie this is the quicker you can appreciate it for its camp value. Some things that stand out are Sean Penn's ridiculously over the top performance. Not that you can fault him for it. The part is written as a stereotypical gangster with temper issues and the script throws him these cheesy oneliners that wouldn't sound authentic coming from anyone's mouth. But to his credit he's fun to watch. As is Brolin who plays the leader of the squad and probably the most human character of them all. And there's Ryan Gosling is doing a really weird but oddly fitting voice for this time period with his natural charismatic charm. The supporting cast is good as well but they practically nothing to do. There's no pathos anywhere  it's all overblown bombast and if you're okay with that then I think you'll get a kick out of Gangster Squad.If you're expecting LA Confidential 2 stay the hell away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally intended for release in September of 2012 Gangster Squad has belatedly hit theatres this week. The film follows the story of LA crime boss Mickey Cohen and a group of offthebook beat cops to bring him down. Based on a true story What movie isn't these days? the film and its fantastic cast promise much but come across as bland and boring.Set in Los Angeles in the 50's Mickey Cohen Sean Penn is a crime lord who has taken over and there seems to be nobody who can stop him. The few good cops are outnumbered by the cops Cohen has bought and it seems all hope is lost. But Police Chief Nick Nolte decides something needs to be done and assigns good hard cop Josh Brolin to put together a team to go after Cohen. What follows is the assembling of a team of notso perfect cops and the war they wage on Cohen's empire.Sound familiar? That's because we've all already seen this movie only done much better. You can tick the clich's off as you watch. Good cop being grilled by his dirty cop superior? Check. Older tougher cop and his young protg? Check. Evil henchman of the chief bad guy? Check. The list could go on but would approach spoiler territory. The climax of the film is somewhat predictable about half way through. You can foresee almost all of the events that will play out in the last 20 minutes and while it's enjoyable enough it's nothing you haven't seen before.The cast is a who's who list of names. Which makes the film all the more disappointing. With names like Brolin Gosling Penn and Stone they should blow you away. But the characters are nothing more than caricatures and nobody gets the chance to portray any real depth with the possible exception of Giovanni Ribsi. Sean Penn looks bizarre in a mountain of makeup although it matches his completely over the top performance. Ryan Gosling turns in a nicely subtle performance but most of the rest of the cast are stuck in cardboard cut out roles with individual stories set on railway tracks. We all know where they're going to go we just have to wait for them to get there.Also worth mentioning in the reason for the delay in the film's release. Originally the film was to be released in September 2012 but then the Aurora shooting took place. At that time one of the key set pieces of the film was a scene in which the characters shoot at people from behind a movie screen in a theatre. Realising how disastrously that would be received in the wake of Aurora the studio immediately suspended promotion for the film and set about reworking that scene. The cast re assembled in August to reshoot the sequence now taking place in Chinatown. Something I liked Robert Patrick's performance as the grizzled older gunslinger. As a Terminator 2 fan it was great to see him still taking out people almost at will.Something I didn't like The predictable climax. At the 60 minute mark I mentally made a list of things I thought would happen in the last 20 or so minutes of the film. Of my list of about 6 things 5 of them happened exactly as I predicted.Something that bugged me The scenes with Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte seemed to be shot out of focus. It was particularly noticeable in the shots of Nolte. For a film with a budget of 75M this just shouldn't happen.Summary Ultimately Gangster Squad is an enjoyable enough 100 minutes but isn't anything significant. There's no great performances no spectacular set pieces nor any big moments that you'll go home talking about. For the ladies there's an ample amount of eye candy in the form of a suited and fedorad Ryan Gosling and for the gentlemen there's Emma Stone and a nononsense Robert Patrick. But the story fails to ever really leap off the page and become something. We're told Mickey Cohen is bad but he's never anything more than that bad guy. We don't hate him we don't sympathise with him or desperately want him to be taken down. He's just the bad guy. The same can be said for all of the characters and the story as a whole. Which makes it on the whole ultimately forgettable.".

Every now and then one comes along that I find myself enjoying despite the warning buzzers blasting in my film snob brain. Such is the latest from director Ruben Fleisher who also directed the entertaining Zombieland.Inspired by true events should always be interpreted as a disclaimer that the movie will play fast and loose with history and the details of the story. Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen a renowned Los Angeles gangster from the late 40's. Due to widespread police corruption Police Chief Parker Nick Nolte authorized an off the books team to take down mob operations gambling prostitution etc. This much was documented in Paul Lieberman's book. How this story is presented by Fleisher and screenwriter Will Beall signed on for the Justice League movie has more in common with a comic book than actual history.The movie is extremely beautiful to look at. It's slick and stylish with a glamorous color palette and the production design is top notch  capturing the look and feel of a booming Los Angeles. If you are expecting the next L.A. Confidential or even The Untouchables you will be disappointed. It's more in line with Dick Tracy Scarface and Hoffa. In other words ... it looks great and the action characters and dialogue are all way over the top.The cast is superb but most are underutilized. Josh Brolin is the tough leader of the squad that features Ryan Gosling the token cool womanizer Robert Patrick the token deadeye gunslinger Anthony Mackie the innercity knifewielding token black cop Giovanni Ribisi the token geeky electronics expert and Michael Pena the rookie and token Hispanic cop. Unfortunately my crude descriptions are just about as indepth as the movie goes with any of them. In fact Yvette Tucker playing Carmen Miranda gets almost as much screen time as any of these cops as she sings Chica Chica Boom Chic.The violence is cartoonish in its fervor. The aim of these gangsters is among the worst in movie history and that's quite an accomplishment. Using Tommy Guns and pistols my estimate is that one in every 167 shots actually hits an intended target. Many elaborate set pieces are destroyed in the process. The exception is Robert Patrick's character who is actually featured in a detective serial. He never misses ... even after being wounded. Penn plays Cohen as a ruthless mob boss unwilling to accept any failure from his crew. And you know what that means. No pink slips here ... just ugly death via power drill burning elevator or classic car tugofwar.An interesting note is the presence of three actors from recent cult TV shows. Holt McCallany Lights Out Mireille Enos The Killing and Troy Garity Boss all have key roles in the film as does Jon Polito whose face and voice make him a mustcast in any gangster film.If you are able to turn off the logical and reasoning part of your brain ... just sit back and enjoy Emma Stone smoking a cig while wearing a red evening gown an understated Ryan Gosling with an odd speech pattern Sean Penn wearing a prosthetic nose and spewing hilarious bad guy lines and the creepy feeling that Josh Brolin is just 25 years away from looking and sounding exactly like Nick Nolte ... then hopefully you can take this one for what it is  a guilty pleasure. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1949 and Los Angeles is being run by mob king Mickey Cohen. Now a secret team of detectives and cops form together to bring him down and bring peace back to the streets.Gangster Squad was a nice romp back to the days where detectives said funny lines smoked indoors and held tommy guns. Here is a film that looks slick with a nice polish a great ensemble cast and a story that has enough meat to it for us to chew on. Yet people seem to be hating on it. Did they all expect another Untouchables? Sure Gangster Squad has moments where the inspirations from past films peep through but not once did this film try to be more than the sum of its means. Gangster Squad is a fun film has thrilling moments and will entertain you. Josh Brolin plays Sgt. John O'Mara a tough as nails cop who is willing to put his life on the line for truth and justice. This annoys his very pregnant wife who seems ready to pop at any moment. She takes it upon herself to help form the team he needs in order to protect him. The team involves Anthony Mackie an officer who is deadly with a knife Giovanni Ribisi a smart wire tapper Robert Patrick an ace with a pistol and his protg Michael Pea whose eager to learn. The last addition to the team is the young hot and dangerous Ryan Gosling who seems to have found himself entangled with the mob king Cohen's gal played by Emma Stone. There are obvious moments in the film where it tips its hat to predecessors like L.A. Confidential and the more obvious The Untouchables. There is even a sequences involving a stairwell although not as tense and more by the numbers shoot em up the sequence is still one of the exciting pieces in the film. Both those films are more intricate with plot characters and structure by a mile. Gangster Squad doesn't focus on stuff like that it wants to thrill you. Which is why some sequences in which we are suppose to care whether our characters live or die don't really pan out.It has a graphic novel feel to it very film noir and for those who've played L.A. Noir will get the same sense of style. While the film looks great in a lot of sequences that same style has some short comings mainly the use of CGI as movement for the camera. It's the most noticeable at least for me in two scenes. With Josh Brolin in an elevator early on fighting two crooked guys and the second is when Ryan Gosling decides to pull his gun out in the middle of a club. The second scene in question is in slow motion and focuses mainly on his face but the jarring background movement opposed to the steadiness of his face is just that jarring and it takes you out of the film and makes you realize you are watching a film.Everyone plays their roles respectively well even if the team seems one dimensional. Sean Penn hams it up in a role that demands him to overact. The make up may distract some but it added to the character for me. He was the one who seemed to have the most fun with his role. A lot of people scream style over substance and this may be true in some cases. I for one never went into the film expecting writing of another calibre and thus I found myself enjoying it a tad more. There are some laughable scenes due to how clich they are. One involves a character throwing their badge away into the water and another has the classic character yelling another character's name as they walk away when that person stops and turns no one says a word. Moments like these that are played out in numerous films make me yawn and roll my eyes. So go into Gangster Squad with an open mind don't expect greatness just a fun ride.".

I had decent expectations for the film with a stout cast the likes of Sean Penn Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling along with a director whose last two films I enjoyed Zombieland and 30 Mins or Less. So what went wrong? Like the summary says it was incredibly clich of every gangster movie out there and tried so hard to be like LA Confidential and the Untouchables. While this movie would have done much better in the 90's I don't feel it fits in this generation of film.You have Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen who decides he wants to be the king of Los Angeles and he will take out whoever is in his way. Nick Nolte plays the police chief who is tired of the way LA is going and recruits hard nosed doasIplease Sgt. John O'Mara Josh Brolin to create a crack team to take Cohen down. From there you have the obligatory roundupthe team where he gets the bifocal smart guy the pasthisprime outlaw and side kick the token black guy and the cop who doesn't want to join at first but is thrust into the fray.You then have a typical hunt down the bad guy have a couple of shoot outs where an incredible amount of bullets fly and no one gets touched and a very flat romance where you wonder why these two are together for no other reason than they are really good looking. There were also moments in the climax of the movie where the audience burst out in laughter and I feel that it was incredibly unwarranted.The only real redeeming quality was Sean Penn who gave an intense powerful performance as Mickey Cohen. All in all I was disappointed in Gangster Squad and feel like the entire movie brought nothing new to the table of the gangster genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "January movies are traditionally terrible. With this fact in mind I generally try to avoid theaters for one month out of the year. Unfortunately for me the topnotch cast and original September release date tricked me into buying the notion that this could be a good movie. The fact that my friends showed up unannounced to drag me out to see it didn't help either.This movie aims to be something lasting but for any serious movie buff it falls well short of it's target. At times it felt to me like a legitimate comedy. Mickey Cohen Sean Penn is a mob connected exboxer who decides that L.A. is his for the taking. Sergeant John O'Mara Josh Brolin is a WWII vet who is tasked with creating a crew to take him down. The rest of the cast falls into the good guys category of cops moles and love interests. This includes but is not limited to Ryan Gosling Robert Patrick and Emma Stone.I was never bored during this film. Having seen many movies even the terrible scenes kept me entertained by the sheer brilliance of overused plot devices and clichd character stories. Need a borderline cop who drinks smokes gambles but has morals? Ryan Gosling has you covered. Old fashioned sixshooter cop with dead aim? Don't worry Robert Patrick is there. Fear not because the writer Will Beall has also included the 1940s tech guy as well as a token black cop aggravated with heroin use in the community and an apprentice to Patrick's character who just happens to be Hispanic.I blame the failure of this movie entirely on unimaginative writing to the point of being almost insulting. It is not as if Brolin Gosling Patrick or least of all Penn are bad actors. They certainly made bad choices signing onto this script but I can't see the checks they are cashing. The entire plot is predictable. 15 minutes into the movie anyone could accurately predict the next hour or more. The actors are given nothing to work with. Additionally Emma Stone's character serves no purpose whatsoever other than to add an attractive female supporting. Though the film is wellshot what isn't nowadays and has beautiful set details the writing is so laughable it is nearly impossible to enjoy much of this movie.I'm not one to give a movie anything less than 45 stars merely because I did not like it. Seems childish but I couldn't give this more than three. The pace never slowed good for a star. The setting was good that's another. Finally the cast did what they could with this script that makes three. Can't find another strength to this movie. If you want to see the disowned child of L.A. Confidential be my guest. Rewatching something you actually like is probably a better option.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1949 Los Angeles is a city ruled by the mob. At the top of the crime syndicates is Mickey Cohen Sean Penn a ruthless mobster involved with murder women and drugs. To combat Cohen the police department look to construct a special squad of cops who will shut down his operations. Bill Parker Nick Nolte pitches the idea to honest cop John O'Mara Josh Brolin who is also a happily married war veteran. His wife gives him the idea of picking men that have little ambition and therefore less likely to be corrupted. One of the main men to join his squad is Sgt. Jerry Wooters Ryan Gosling who has eyes for Cohen's etiquette teacher Grace Emma Stone. The other members of the squad include Coleman Anthony Mackie Max Robert Patrick Conway Giovanni Ribisi and Navidad Michael Pena each of whom has their own specialties. The most depressing realisation about Gangster Squad is not simply that it is the lowest form of pulp trash but that it leaves in its wake the question of what if? Director Ruben Fleischer Zombieland 30 Minutes or Less has assembled a cast that the most seasoned director would salivate over only to show complete ineptitude towards authenticity and controlled performance registers. The only positive to be drawn from the film is that it contains some momentarily appealing photography. The rest of the film is a shambles. It's badly directed allowing for poor performances glossy overstylisation and serves no purpose other than showcasing a series of tiresome gunfights. How did Warners Bros who produced some of the most important gangster films ever made let this happen? It's through no fault of the source material. The film is based on a seven day L.A. Times series by journalist Paul Lieberman who in 2008 chronicled the real life formation of the Gangster Squad. Historical facts notwithstanding the film is as it claims inspired by a true story. It's the treatment of the material that fails. Discussing the film's copturnedwriter Will Beall Lieberman stated in an article for the Nieman Reports With 'The Gangster Squad' he understood that the studio wanted to go big with flying bullets and fists. Evidentially someone at Warner Bros. felt this subgenre had to be modernised by removing the substance and racking up the violence. The classic gangster films of the past were more psychological than ostentatious. Filmmakers like Howard Hawks used them as public warnings against the real life threat of gangsters and to pressure governments to take stronger action against them. The films provided cautionary tales about the way that ordinary people could be seduced the allure of power and money raising their social status but dispersing their friends family and moral values. Actors like James Cagney transformed the gangster figure into tragic Shakespearean characters that were physically and mentally corroded by the failure of the American Dream. The heavy emphasis on the violence and the action in Gangster Squad lessens the opportunity for complex moral ambiguity. A character asks John late if there is a difference between the criminals and the gangster squad. It's hard to believe given the film's insistence of what a monster Cohen is along with Penn's disappointingly monotone performance which substitutes nuances for snarls and angry grimaces. After an opening scene where he orders someone to be drawn and quartered between two cars there's little by way of sympathy or psychology. Similarly if Fleischer is interested in blurring the lines between the criminals and the police why does he frequently romanticise their battles with adolescent techniques like slowmotion freeze framing and careless juxtaposition? In one sequence he contrasts a raid with the Carmen Miranda song 'Chica Chica Boom Chic' as the camera crabs sideways scanning the crew as they beat up crims. Is there any reason besides including a superficial pop reference? This is true of Fleischer's overwrought visual style one which desperately claws for your attention only to remain vacuous. There are pretty moments in the film like a sumptuous wide shot of L.A.'s neon glowing nightlife and Emma Stone's first appearance in a red dress but they're designed solely to distract you from the film's emptiness and artificiality as these colour techniques are divorced from a theme. The performances in this mess range between embarrassing and vapid and in some cases both. Brolin's character is a dull lead the cando officer with the beautiful home and concerned wife. I found her surprisingly more interesting but the exchanges between the pair gnaw at terrible clichs The war is over. Stop fighting she tells him. When the rest of the cast is allowed to speak and some of them aren't they're embarrassed by laughably ornate dialogue such as This is a war for the soul of Los Angeles! and The whole town is under water and you're using a bucket when you should be grabbing a bathing suit. Gosling is the only actor who seems aware of how silly the project is. But his performance is compromised of poses and jokey lines so chilled that he could play Jerry in his sleep. Likewise Emma Stone's reunion with her Zombieland director leaves her with only two things to do smoke and look pofaced. The gangster squad itself is little more than a collection of action figurines defined by quirks than personality like the knife thrower the fast shooter and the Hispanic guy. I liked this movie more when it was called The Untouchables 1987. A tremendous cast and glamorous production design is wasted hosting loosely connected action scenes with little substance to support them. Warner Bros. decided to delay the film six months following the Aurora shooting. Or was it because they already knew how poor the film was? Now after the events in Connecticut how will they sell a film that's only interested in gunfire?".

Now after the events in Connecticut how will they sell a film that's only interested in gunfire?";

This feels like a studio executive went up to a script generator and typed in Undercover cop movie and it printed out the Expendables but with cops . Then he read it and put in  Undercover Cover Cop movie set in classic Hollywood. To get the positives out of the way the movie has a great aesthetic. It's beautiful colors pop out nice and saturated. The actors here are all solid. Nobody is really embarrassing themselves aside from being in this movie from their performances and some of them even manage to deliver some pretty cheesy lines really well. The pacing here is pretty good almost too fast but i'll come back to that. The action is nothing to speak of it's just there. The Direction leaves a lot to be desired unlike the atmospheric classic hollywoods movies this rips off which have a slow focused camera work to them this is shot like any other action movie. Ruben Fleisher is definitely an actor's director he is able to get decent to good performances from actors and I don't want to right him off just yet.The Ugly. This movie is so generic. Even worse it's predictable. I've noticed a slew of genre movies recently that take a traditional typical story and it's clichs and turn them into tropes and strive to make them better. Lincoln Lawyer 21 Jump Street End Of Watch take traditional story and plot points and make them better and inventive . This movie relishes in it's clichs but not enough to make fun of them. The first thing the villain does it kills somebody. No nuance or tension he just kills somebody.

This movie is written by Will Beall who is currently writing the Justice League movie that is set to come out in 2 years.

This script has no meat it has stock characters with great actors. Once again if this was Edgar Wright or Joss Wheedon they'd get some dimension or have a lot of heart or be really funny but no. The team consists of The Overdedicated cop The guy who never misses The guy who uses a knife The tech guy and the Newbie.

	schema:headline " An Early Frontrunner for Most Inconsequential Movie of the Year";
	schema:reviewBody "It's only the second release week of 2013 and already we have a strong contender for most inconsequential film of the year. Shot and edited without any idea of how to make it exciting written like what a 12 yearold might think a tough gangster movie would sound like and looking surprisingly modern for a period piece that takes place in 1949 and is inspired by true events Gangster Squad is a perfect example of mediocrity hitting the big screen.In fact the only interesting thing about this movie is how it came to be released in January and not in September like was originally planned. As many of you will note the Aurora shooting spree took place and was a tragedy. In Gangster Squad's trailer the titular squad shoots up a movie theater. Thinking that keeping that scene in would be rather tasteless the studio pulled back the release date and reshot portions of the film to have the big shootout take place somewhere else. They then scheduled a new release date of January 11 2013 instead of September 7 2012.Perhaps it's just the cynic in me thinking this but if the film was any good why would it get released in January which is the dumping ground for bad films? If the studio had faith that it was great surely holding it back another couple of months would have been the right thing to do. My theory is that they knew this wasn't going to be anything special or even good so it was dumped in January even despite its cast of stars and surprisingly large budget of 75 million.The basic idea of Gangster Squad is that a group of LAPD Detectives got together and formed a team whose goal it was to stop the gangsters who threatened to take control of Los Angeles. The villain is a ruthless man named Mickey Cohen Sean Penn a former boxer who pays off anyone who gets in the way of his business dealings which are illegal. Nobody can touch him everyone thinks but since we know the film is about the titular squad we're pretty sure that he can at the very least be upset if not fully removed from the equation.The gang John O'Mara Josh Brolin a family man and our protagonistnarrator Jerry Wooters Ryan Gosling a ladies' man and nothing more Rocky Washington Anthony Mackie someone who really hates heroin Max Kennard Robert Patrick the fastest draw in the Wild West  seriously he sounds like he's from the 1840s not the 1940s Navidad Ramirez Michael Pea a rookie cop nobody takes seriously because he's Mexican and Conway Keeler Giovanni Ribisi another family man and the one tasked with listening in to a bugged television set.Does that not seem like some sort of dream cast? Throw in Nick Nolte as the police chief who orders John to do this and Emma Stone as the love interest for one or possibly more of the characters and you're talking quite a strong group of actors. It's just a shame they had to go and make this such a lifeless bland uninspired movie. Did we really need a softremake of The Untouchables? That's really what Gangster Squad feels like.Much of the problem comes from the director Ruben Fleischer whose previous featurelength work is made up entirely of comedies. He did Zombieland which was a lot of fun and 30 Minutes or Less which was not. He does manage to inject Gangster Squad with some genuinely funny moments  the best of which involved a knockout blow which failed in its target you rarely see that in noncomedies at the cinema  but most of the time he feels completely wrong for this material. He doesn't seem to get the feel of this type of movie.There is no depth to any of the characters. The dialogue is so cheesy and unfitting that it feels like it was written by someone who maybe watch a gangster film once in high school and is trying to remember what the characters sounded like there's more slow motion than in a Zack Snyder movie but used without any purpose. Seriously there's a shootout late in the movie that is done entirely in slow motion and it accomplishes nothing  especially when you know that none of the main characters will die.Despite the overuse of slow motion the action scenes are still cut together in such a way so as to not allow you any idea of who's doing what to whom at any given moment. There's even a car fight but since all of the characters look similar and the cars are the same models you never know what's going on. The same is true of the fist fights  the climax is one which is to be expected and is the only decent action in the entire film  and many of the shootouts.There's nothing to Gangster Squad. Under the gangster movie surface it's an empty hollow movie and there's absolutely no reason to watch it. You trudge through it hoping the payoff will be worth the almost two hours of your life that it takes to finish  and it feels a lot longer than that  and you won't get that. The Untouchables exists so this film doesn't have to. It has an attractive cast and some touches of humor but Gangster Squad is a cheap knockoff of one of what used to be one of the most reliable genres around.".

	schema:headline " Spoof or serious gangster drama?";
	schema:reviewBody "I always knew I'd die in BurbankGangster Squad walks a really thin line between being a terrible film and an entertaining one. First of all it has a really great and talented cast it also has a good production design and is very stylized reminding us of some epic gangster films. On the other hand the film only looks gangsterlike on the surface it is not really a serious neo noir gangster film but more of a light comedic gangster movie. This is director Ruben Fleisher's follow up to his hit comedy Zombieland and in a way it does feel like a satire of sorts of gangster films but in some strange way it fails to find its own personality. You never know if you're supposed to take the movie seriously or not because something is missing in the mix between drama and comedy. One critic defined the film better than I could by claiming it is LA Confidential without the script. It has the look and the tone of a serious gangster film but the script which was loosely adapted by Will Beall from Paul Lieberman's book just fails and the dialogues seem cartoonish at times. The violence is pretty heavy as there are plenty of glamorized gunfight scenes and a large body count. Sean Penn plays the villain a little over the top but it works if you view the film as this sort of spoof of the gangster genre. And really in my opinion this approach is what works best because it is entertaining if taken lightly as a spoof. I feel sorry for those who went into this film with high expectations because they will mostly be disappointed unless they can live with a mindless popcorn action flick with some good performances. The story takes place in 1949 Los Angeles where Mickey Cohen Sean Penn a mob king from Chicago has taken over the city and is planning on controlling all criminal activities there with the help of corrupt officers and judges. He will eliminate whoever stands in his path. Sgt. John O'Mara Josh Brolin on the other hand is a WWII veteran who is determined to do what he can to clean up the city. When Chief Parker Nick Nolte hears about O'Mara's heroics he decides to assign him with a special underground task to form an elite squad of police officers that will take down the mob King. Thus O'Mara begins his quest to find the right officers for his special team with the help of his wife Connie Mireille Enos who is worried about his wellbeing and wants him to be protected as best as possible. O'Mara chooses Officer Coleman Harris Anthony Mackie Max Kennard Robert Patrick and his partner Navidad Ramirez Michael Pea Conway Keeler Giovanni Ribisi who's the brains in the operation and finally Sgt. Jerry Wooters Ryan Gosling who decides to accept O'Mara's proposal after a member of the mob kills a kid he knew from the streets. Together these officers begin to try to intercept and disrupt Cohen's operations working as an underground hit squad. Wooters also happens to be having an affair with Cohen's love interest Grace Emma Stone which could or could not be a good thing. And so the action begins as the squad tries to disrupt Cohen's reign and clean up the city.As I mentioned before this is an entertaining film which sometimes borderlines on the bad side considering it does have some pretty bad writing and underdeveloped characters. But it did work for me as a sort of spoof and light hearted film with a very stylized look to it. It has some fun action sequences with some strong performances especially from the always reliable Ryan Gosling who continues to reinvent himself in every movie. I absolutely loved him here once again. Josh Brolin gives a pretty solid performance when he is not asked to do the voice over bit it was a bit annoying at the beginning giving it a sort of fake Sin City vibe to it. The rest of the cast is pretty good although not getting enough screen time or story lines to develop their characters. Sean Penn plays the stereotypical bad guy a little over the top but I enjoyed his performance as well it wouldn't have worked if you were expecting a serious gangster drama film. In the end Gangster Squad did work for me and I was entertained with this shootem up gangster film but I know it isn't for everyone.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The violence is pretty heavy as there are plenty of glamorized gunfight scenes and a large body count. Sean Penn plays the villain a little over the top but it works if you view the film as this sort of spoof of the gangster genre. And really in my opinion this approach is what works best because it is entertaining if taken lightly as a spoof. I feel sorry for those who went into this film with high expectations because they will mostly be disappointed unless they can live with a mindless popcorn action flick with some good performances. The story takes place in 1949 Los Angeles where Mickey Cohen Sean Penn a mob king from Chicago has taken over the city and is planning on controlling all criminal activities there with the help of corrupt officers and judges. He will eliminate whoever stands in his path. Sgt. John O'Mara Josh Brolin on the other hand is a WWII veteran who is determined to do what he can to clean up the city. When Chief Parker Nick Nolte hears about O'Mara's heroics he decides to assign him with a special underground task to form an elite squad of police officers that will take down the mob King. Thus O'Mara begins his quest to find the right officers for his special team with the help of his wife Connie Mireille Enos who is worried about his wellbeing and wants him to be protected as best as possible. O'Mara chooses Officer Coleman Harris Anthony Mackie Max Kennard Robert Patrick and his partner Navidad Ramirez Michael Pea Conway Keeler Giovanni Ribisi who's the brains in the operation and finally Sgt. Jerry Wooters Ryan Gosling who decides to accept O'Mara's proposal after a member of the mob kills a kid he knew from the streets. Together these officers begin to try to intercept and disrupt Cohen's operations working as an underground hit squad. Wooters also happens to be having an affair with Cohen's love interest Grace Emma Stone which could or could not be a good thing. And so the action begins as the squad tries to disrupt Cohen's reign and clean up the city.As I mentioned before this is an entertaining film which sometimes borderlines on the bad side considering it does have some pretty bad writing and underdeveloped characters. But it did work for me as a sort of spoof and light hearted film with a very stylized look to it. It has some fun action sequences with some strong performances especially from the always reliable Ryan Gosling who continues to reinvent himself in every movie. I absolutely loved him here once again. Josh Brolin gives a pretty solid performance when he is not asked to do the voice over bit it was a bit annoying at the beginning giving it a sort of fake Sin City vibe to it. The rest of the cast is pretty good although not getting enough screen time or story lines to develop their characters. Sean Penn plays the stereotypical bad guy a little over the top but I enjoyed his performance as well it wouldn't have worked if you were expecting a serious gangster drama film. In the end Gangster Squad did work for me and I was entertained with this shootem up gangster film but I know it isn't for everyone.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Though made for a plethora of reasons a film need only achieve one goal to be successful it needs to be entertaining. Engaging characters good performances and a story that is engrossing even if a bit cardboard or clich. When a film ultimately fails it is because its characters are wooden or stereotypical the storyline is boring and the only question it might raise is was this intended to be sleep therapy for a study on insomnia? Set that film in 1949 and make it about gangsters and cops and you've got Gangster Squad a film so inept that Ruben Fleischer should win an award for managing to make a violent action movie that could put an Olympic sprinter to sleep in midstride.Josh Brolin stars as Sgt. Somethingorother a nononsense cop who is recruited by the grizzled police chief Nick Nolte who eats sandpaper apparently to stop a gangster from taking over Los Angeles. Brolin broods as the takenoprisoners Sarge his squad rarely referring to him by name because they probably can't remember his name either. Despite how stylized the trailers may seem how actionpacked and exciting it promises to be this is little more than a stable of stereotypes loosed upon midtwentiethcentury Los Angeles and hoping not to bore it half to death. It becomes exhausting to try to care about what's going on in the film because the characters haven't got a shred of credibility between them the only enjoyment comes from Robert Patrick himself packed tightly into the stereotype of the sharpshooting old westerner.Sean Penn's utterly hamfisted Mickey Cohen is taken down but who cares? The film never makes you care about the struggle against him or the city under his rule he's ruthless he's tough as nails and he's every other stereotype of the evil gangster that Sean Penn could look up the day after he got cast and decided to cram into the character. Every single actor in this film has been utterly fantastic in other films how could the ensemble be so frightfully uninteresting? The utterly versatile and likable Ryan Gosling is so bland and watereddown that he seems confused as to why he is even in the film. Emma Stone is rendered to eye candy a crime given her considerable talents.Yet as contrived as the characters are it doesn't come close to touching how terrible the script is. Penn mugs at the camera his only character direction seemingly sound more angry or be more gangstery. The film does itself a disservice to not show Cohen's rise to power it wants the audience to see how powerful Cohen is but killing his own men for their ineptitude and eating a steak dinner at a fancy restaurant does nothing to imbue the fear that Mickey is supposed to represent into the script. He quite honestly seems rather harmless and without a villain to care about the gangster squad's mission to tackle said villain becomes even more pointless.The real tragedy here is the fact that for two hours there are guns firing flashy action sequences and big period set pieces yet none of it seems all that interesting. It needed to be longer it needed to go deeper. Having Sarge's wife tell the audience that he'll pick duty over family is supposed to be meaningful but the scene is unnecessary the opening sequence with Brolin's character tells everyone that. Too much time is spent between characters needlessly talking exposition at the audience. Time better spent developing a camaraderie between the squad members is instead spent on slowmotion sequences or on Brolin's chinset MickeyCohenisbad speeches. If Mickey Cohen is so terrible why doesn't a film about his downfall just show the audience that? Not to say that Gangster Squad is completely bereft of enjoyment. The period setting was very well done with some magnificent costume and set design. It may have been senseless and boring but at least it felt like it was boring in 1949 and wasn't really out of place. A chase sequence early on with some vintage automobiles is excellently handled filled with some great explosive tension figuratively and literally. The film handles most of its gunplay and action sequences quite well it's just a shame that all the bullets are coming from guns shot by gunmen and are flying at targets that are equally vapid and meaningless. These aren't characters they're shells into which an actor was poured and just told to act like a singleline description from an old pulp novel about gangsters.Despite a moment here or there of decent action there's nothing redeemable about the entire experience that is Gangster Squad. It is empty boring and ultimately will leave the audience feeling... well nothing. What should have been an excellent period film with gangsters and cops with some depth and character exploration is instead ripe with brevity with everything thrown at the screen wrapped in a stereotype with so little substance you can almost see through Mickey Cohen.Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!".

Hmm... Over in the wise guys department is Penn on full tilt sweary and hammy overdrive. It's a very colourful portrayal menacing and completely over the top. How the performance sits with you will greatly depend on how you find Penn as an actor when let loose on a cartoon characterisation.It's all very period pleasing with a bustling late 40s L.A. hosting men with hats trench coats and tommyguns. Men who frequent the speakeasy bars as torch singers warble their stuff. There is nothing wrong with the production at all except maybe when the dialogue veers to clunky. The action scenes are well crafted loud bloody and exciting and the photography sparkles and the music soars.If only the makers had put some thought into it a bit of brains to go with the brawn. As a comic book type gangster piece it works well on entertainment terms elsewhere its lightweight and formula compliant with the Ribisi Patrick and Pena characters telegraphed a mile away. So quite some way away from the great The Untouchables then but better than Mullholland Falls. Make of that what you will. 6.510".

Gangster Squad is a movie that is trying to be something hip edgy and sleek but honestly the dialogue was so clunky I couldn't take a second of the damn thing seriously.Inspired on a true story which in some cases means that the story is bull in 1949 a copJosh Brolin is told to hunt down mob boss Mickey Cohen Sean Penn at any means necessary. So he forms a group of cops Ryan Gosling Michael Pena Giovanni Ribisi Robert Patrick and Anthony Mackie to go rogue and kill whoever gets in their way. In another story arc Gosling's character is in the middle of a supposed dangerous romance with Cohen's woman Gracie the always wonderful Emma Stone who is a strange choice for the part.Gangster Squad has a cast almost too good to be true. But that's the thing It isn't good. There isn't a boring second in this movie but yet there aren't many good ones either. We have some of the best living actors in Hollywood involved and none of them get to do anything special. Everyone involved delivers at least one outrageous line. Ryan Gosling even gives a bad performance that's how sad it is. Gosling puts on a Mickey Mouse voice and basically reads off of a teleprompter for most of the time. Penn is having too much fun here and he's way too over the top. But the moments with him are the most interesting.The dialogue is atrocious the last fifteen minutes is way too loud the romance between Gosling and Stone doesn't feel believable and the movie itself feels longer than the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. And I don't mean Zero Dark Thirty I mean the actual hunt for Bin Laden which was ten years. Everyone involved is having a good time but to me the whole thing felt like a farce. And that leads to the next problem the director.Gangster movies belong to directors like Brian Depalma Martin Scorsese Francis Ford Cappola and Michael Mann. The masters. They don't belong to someone like Ruben Fleisher. Fleisher's other credits are 2009's Zombieland and 2011's mediocre 30 Minutes or Less. Putting someone like him in the reigns of a movie like this is like letting Nancy Meyers direct Halloween.Gangster Squad isn't terrible. Only kind of terrible. But if this is the first movie I've seen in 2013 I truly hope that the year will get better. I'm looking forward to quite a bit so hopefully they improve. I guess that this is the best movie of 2013 so far and that really is not saying a whole lot.C".

Love Gangster movies and thought this looked great. loving Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed public enemy number one suprisingly so I was a little dismayed by the total lack of empathy with this movie upon leaving the cinema. It was running good right up to Brolins wife excellent acting btw began to help him hire the team of misfits. From there it pretty much fell away. the crew were average at best. The acting was strained. Brolin wasn't too bad. But even he was below average. Never looked too comfortable. I couldn't really put a finger on it but it never really got my blood pumping. A few plot holes I cant be bothered to go into and I wonder if this was the outcome of a total script rewrite by the director. Who knows. Penn tried his best to give the movie some depth. But even his performance lacked the Scorsese touch. Jimmy the Gent he wasn't. Despite the obvious attempt. Average movie that could have been good. Never great.".

The initially friendly natives who have no personal property concept turn hostile after a 'theft' is 'punished' violently on the spot. During an armed exploration Smith is captured but spared when the chief's favorite daughter Pocahontas pleads for the stranger who soon becomes her lover and learns to love their naive 'savage' way of harmonious life. Ultimately he returns to the grim fort which would starve hadn't she arranged for Indian generosity. Alas each side soon brands their own lover a traitor so she is banished and he flogged as introduction to slavish toiling. Changes turn again leading Smith to accept a northernmore mission and anglicized Pocahontas believing him dead becoming the mother of aristocratic new lover John Rolfe's son.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.'The New World' is a film that will draw out one of two very powerful emotions Love or Hate. I really don't believe there is a middle ground in this case. I think it is quite possibly the most beautifully photographed film I have ever seen. It is astonishing. The score from James Horner is in my opinion his greatest work. He's a wonderful composer but he has exceeded himself on every level. This is a movie that can be watched like art because it is and listened to as a symphony it might as well be one. Very few movies leave me stunned and 'The New World' is so luscious that I think it is worth the journey even if it is only to look at how beautiful it is and listen to how glorious it is. Is that a superficial way of looking at things? Perhaps but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities.'The New World' does have problems and I think it falls very much into a 'buyer beware' category. Malick's movie is long  very long  and feels every moment of it. I don't mind these things because I found it enchanting many in the audience with me did not. These are not people who are 'dumb' or who 'don't get it.' They are people who are used to 99 of the films that you will see. 'The New World' is very selfindulgent at times. No one can reasonably defend the pace of the film. I want to and I can't. This is a movie so full of substance that it is detrimental. It is so rich and textured that it would be hard to say where things could have been improved but aside from the first forty minutes which deal largely with the question of whether or not the Europeans can survive the first winter or not the dramatic 'action' that is the engine of a script that pushes one scene into the next is idling at best. 'The New World' has a plodding pace and it took me on a nice quiet stroll that I enjoyed immensely. I can not in good conscience though recommend to the man on the street that he go to see it. If less than a third of the theatre I was in walked out I'd be stunned. I lost count because so many people left. Mostly the middle hour and a half of the film is to blame. Scenes drift from one to the next  they're stunning and textured and personally I enjoyed them  but they involved a lot of hanging out. Two people hanging out in the woods. I understand that the film has deep meditative and philosophical meanderings about man's relationship with nature and how one impacts the other. I get it. But a lot of the love story is about two people hanging out in the woods. All the time. If one of them had said 'Let us go watch the grass grow for the afternoon' it would have been the most honest line in the entire film. It is the only thing I will fault Malick for here because it really does kill the film for a lot of people. His intelligence should not be questioned. I wish only he'd tried to focus the script a bit more and been specific rather than general. Can two people from different cultures be together? We get it already. We got it an hour ago. Oh more grass growing ... must watch ... ha! Forgive my little joke.The argument to be made though is that this film has not been made for everyone the studio is no doubt surprised to learn this and will be scrambling to recover their money  they did a good thing in making it but they're going to lose their shirts. It was made by Terrence Malick for Terrence Malick. I'm glad to have seen it but I spoke with twenty people who were not. There will be constant arguments on the user boards here at the IMDb. The film is going to have rabidly fanatical supporters who think everyone else is just too stupid to get it. And it is going to be criticized by many many others who died a thousand deaths just trying to sift through the movie.Two final thoughts the first is that I hate myself for having to say anything negative about Malick or his film. He's a special filmmaker and his films make it worth going to the theatre. 'The New World' is great but flawed and it is dishonest for anyone to pretend otherwise  such behaviour is deceitful and pretentious.Thought number two is that although the film is equal parts challenging and rewarding as great movies should be it is especially important in the case of 'The New World' to see it in the theatre. It is so majestic in scope that I don't believe the greatest home theatre can do it justice. It is truly epic in its cinematography and score. If it doesn't win Oscars for both we will have witnessed a massive artistic injustice. NOTHING this year NOTHING has come close to being a threat to 'The New World' for either of those two categories. Appreciate them as they were intended to be seen.".

It is so majestic in scope that I don't believe the greatest home theatre can do it justice. It is truly epic in its cinematography and score. If it doesn't win Oscars for both we will have witnessed a massive artistic injustice. NOTHING this year NOTHING has come close to being a threat to 'The New World' for either of those two categories. Appreciate them as they were intended to be seen.";

	schema:reviewBody "First let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences the actionless movement and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting I was very impressed with all involved particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive overacting. This movie is a historical drama but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film then The New World is waiting.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally saw The New World yesterday. It was quite an experience.This film is miles away from any other that I've ever seen before. It's a feast for the senses. Senses are the key to this movie. You either let them guide you or you've missed the whole point. I cannot blame anyone who has complained about how slow boring or even irritating this picture was. This is not the kind of movie that can be appreciated by intelligent reading. Neither does it belong to the category of highbrow artistic films that aim to an intellectual elite of an audience and shut out the rest of us poor lesser mortals. You don't have to understand this film you have to feel it. Just open up your heart and let the emotions carry you away and elevate you. The plot is simple and far from original. Adam and Eve paradise lost human greed and personal ambition coming face to face with the beauty of nature and the joy of pure living. Clash between illusion and reality dream and fact. The originality of this film lies in the way that these themes are depicted. Muted glances forbidden touches light and darkness mingle with the murmur of the river and the rustle of the wind  the breath of mother nature. Dialogs are scarce. Mainly voice overs run through the whole picture. I found them neither irritating nor useless. They are uttered in the form of inner thoughts secret longings muted prayers and they add to the dreamlike effect of this movie. Acting was actually very good. That was an extra bonus for a film like this where actors are meant more to help the story and the images unfold than astound us with their memorable performances. The actors' success in this movie lies in their ability to express their feelings through minor gestures glances and body language. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. She bends she submits to the inevitability of assimilation but she never loses her freedom of spirit. Farrell's sad eyes speak volumes of emotion that could never be expressed in spoken words and Bale's kindhearted demeanor is just perfect. The New World is like a poem. What I got out of it was a bittersweet taste in my mouth a swirl of images and sounds in my mind and a wealth of emotion in my heart".

	schema:reviewBody "The New World reviewed by Sam Osborn rating 3.5 out of 4 Filing out of The New World completely speechless and without notes I could fathom only single adjectives to describe the experience. Looking at these listed words on my memopad now they read Thunderous True Beautiful Solemn Forceful Gripping Honest and Slow. And for those who watch The New World with a calm countenance an open mind and a ready cache of patience Terrence Malick's longawaited picture will have a similar effect. The film is a masterpiece thirty years in the making. His goal is plain enough to affectively and honestly portray the love Pocahontas experienced in those first years that Europeans cut their first fresh swath from the New World. But Malick goes far beyond a simplistic love story. I was at the screening for Casanova a few days earlier where the film's objective was essentially the same to portray the love between Casanova and Francesca in the days of Inquisition Venice. But where Casanova approaches love at a bubbly comedic perspective The New World throws itself into a headlong narration of love's sorrow. Every frame of The New World reflects this painful aching emotion utilizing the sounds and images of environment to incredible innovative effect. The first shot of the filman extended shot several minutes in lengthfinds the camera staring into a river. It's clear and pristine carefree and surrounded by the blissful sounds of an unperturbed forest. Soon ripples begin forming and we notice the quiet droplets of rain pitpattering around us causing the water to flow a little bringing about a contented onslaught of lily pedals. The scene continues on drawing us farther and farther into Malick's deafening reality with only the sounds and images of nature. He creates a calm within us with these images a kind of serene canvas for him to later paint the vivid brushstrokes of human love later in the film. In this entire first act little is even said. But these scenes rarely grow tiring. He finds rich beauty with every situation. His forest is lush and his settlements picturesquely Dickensian. Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Few filmmakers would have the cool audacity to create a film so primarily reliant on nothing being said. The first and most important of Pocahontas' Q'Orianka Kilcher romances is with the infamous John Smith Colin Farrell. He's brought to the New World bound in a cage punished for earlier mutiny. But because he's the only soldier of the expedition Captain Newport Christopher Plummer opts to let him free on a strict probation. Their first encounters with the Naturals as they're called go coolly enough with curious interest from the Naturals and tense hesitation from the settlers. And even here Malick plays with flights of romantic whimsy. These scenes of first encounter are shot in windswept overgrown grassy fields with Pocahontas dancing and twirling about them with her brother catching the spry interest of Smith.Soon the settlers hear of a great city of Naturals down the river and Smith is sent to investigate. Things have been going badly for the settlers and Captain Newport has left back for London and a new store of food and supplies. Smith's expedition is cut short however when he runs into a narrow mazelike complex of swamps and is ambushed by warrior Naturals. He's taken prisoner by the Naturals but granted life because of Pocahontas' curious interest and her favoritism with Chief Powhatan August Schellenberg. This catalyzes our entrance into The New World's most prominent territory. The scenes of Smith's time with the Naturals are Malick's best. They're those first strokes of paint on his canvas and the seeds of that palpable historical romance.But admittedly even with The New World's supreme sense of confidence and slowmoving progression it sometimes wanders into the realm of selfindulgence. It especially grows tiresome in the final act when we're brought from Virginia to London our beloved Smith left behind to be replaced by John Rolfe Christian Bale and his stonewall courting of Pocahontas. I'd even venture to say that Malick could have left 30 minutes of these segments on the editing room floor reattaching them later to the Extended Cut DVD release that's sure to come. But moviegoing patience is the mantra of the Awards season and so some bottomdragging in films is what's to be expected.What was not to be expected however was Q'Orianka Kilcher the debuting actress playing Pocahontas. Few words she says but dialogue is not always what makes a forceful performance. Her body language and expressions are allowed to do the speaking for her. She's advantaged also by her strong muscular features that often betray hints of divine femininity. Farrell also does well particularly in his somber narration. He reads it as though he speaks the words to himself whispering them almost for only his imagination to hear. But his physicality is manipulated nicely as well exuding bubbly chemistry for Kilcher. The two mix ideally. Their sorrow and love and deeply resonated emotions are echoed about with their strong performances and Malick's supreme direction. And although Christian Bale strides into picture in the latter parts of the film our hearts lie with Smith and Pocahontas and we find ourselves resentful of Rolfe's advances. But this is just Malick's narrative trickery. We find ourselves raggedly torn between these two equally honorable men and put almost into the same position as Pocahontas. It's precisely the reason we go to the movies. We've let the director take his grip on us and lead us down the path into characters and identities of his own creation. And with Malick leading our way and with characters as tastefully dimensional as these moviegoing becomes a deep artistic pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Malick's method is to frame films as remembrances. Remembrances of romantic notions whether freedom peace war or love as his four films trace. This way he can exploit a languorous floating through remembered reality that never is that gentle or considered in actual reality. He can use his narration as things remembered floating over the sights. To make this as effective as possible he plays all sorts of tricks with the sound having different boundaries of different types between what you see and hear.Added to this is a considered approach to framing. You may have noticed that most filmmakers stage the action as if the world arranged itself to fit nicely in the window the camera sees. It makes for nice pictures and clear precise drama but we know it for what it is a theatrical device. Malick is like Tarkovsky he likes to discover things and if the way the world frames things so that they are off the window we see so be it. That's why his battle scenes are unique. With most directors you'll have smiting and dying nicely so that we can see it. Or alternatively we'll have point of view shots that are hectic as if we were a participant. These two battle scenes have the camera as a disembodied eye that shifts about as if it were the eye of dreams or nearly lucid recalling or even retrospective invention. Sometimes hectic as if it were point of view but never looking at what a combatant would instead having a poetic avoidance.I first met Malick when he was a lecturer at MIT and I a philosophy student. He spoke of French Objectivism and was clearly bothered by how the notation and language constrained the ideas. At the time I was doing my thesis on Thomas Harriot who is the hidden motivator behind everything in this story  the real story. Malick never saw the thesis because by the time it was finished he was off to explore this business of experiencing from the outside in cinematic language.But Harriot is likely the inventor of the external viewer of self notions that Malick liked as they reappeared in the French '60s and uses in his philosophy of film. Harriot suggested he got it from the Chesapeake Indians. So the circle closes a film about a people using their own mystical memoryvisions.If you take a little time to tune yourself to Malick's channel you will find his work to be transcendent. I consider this one of the best films of 2005 despite its apparent commercial gloss and the mistaken notion that most will have that it is a love story. It is about remembering and inventing love in retrospect. A world is always new so long as the imagination of recall is supple.The rest of this comment is of an historical nature. The love story is made up of course but that's apt for a movie that is about invented memory. The Indians are mostly wrong the body paint hair and dress according to the only document we have the John White paintings men and women were mostly nude even in winter and prided themselves on tolerance to the cold. There is no mention of the famous local hallucinogen cypress puccoon which was widely traded and how a stone age people were able to survive in a land a hundred miles from the nearest stone.My original comment was deleted presumably because there was a note about the unpeaceful nature of the people. Readers may want to consult good histories for that.Harriot a scientist and mage wintered over with a nearby holy tribe in 1585 and after he left Powhatan destroyed the tribe lest they combine their magic with Harriot's and overcome his stranglehold on taxes. He married the wives of the chiefs he murdered. Matoaka Pocahontas was almost surely the offspring of this union and it is why he sent her as a naked 10 year old to negotiate with the Jamestown settlers who Powhatan thought was Harriot returning.Powhatan never exiled Matoaka. When negotiations with the settlers failed he married her off to a satrap in the north to expand his empire. From there she was kidnapped. When he knew that Rolfe had shamelessly promoted his marriage to an Indian princess and arranged an audience with the King Powhatan sent the two holy men to accompany and protect her those you see here. She presented to James her father's cloak that is also shown in the movie. It was designed by Harriot for the his host the husband of Matoaka's mother.The scenery is very accurate and was filmed where things actually happened and in a few spots within a few hundred yards of where Harriot wintered over and I now reside.The HarriotMatoaka story is a key source for Shakespeare's The Tempest and it is likely that Shakespeare actually met Matoaka when she visited Harriot. One of the accompanying Indian priests had an argument over God with a Nixonlike cleric who subsequently published a list of all the demons thus mentioned. You can see that list of demons appearing throughout King Lear.Viewers interested in racial matters may be interested to know that by the time of these events Spain and Portugal had already imported over a half a million African slaves to South and Central America.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dreadful. That is the best word I can use to describe this film. It starts out slow...and then tapers off. This subject had all the makings of a great story flight from European oppression venturing into the Unknown internal conflicts struggle for survival battles with the indigenous peoples romance. All of these things should lend themselves to an interesting and engaging movie. Instead we get over two hours of a beautifully filmed but selfindulgent preachy meandering and ultimately boring work. There is little dialogue with most of the characters preferring to monologue almost inaudibly andor pray as they wander through the forest. There is even less action with the few battle scenes and occasional power struggles between John Smith and those who would usurp his command having little buildup and being over quickly which is about the only thing in this tedious movie that does happen quickly. You would expect that a film about the men who first tried to colonize Virginia to be exciting or at the very least interesting but it's a 135minute marathon to see whether you can stay awake and resist the urge to fastforward through the obviously overdone and drawn out scenery shots. Also you'll spend a lot of time turning up the volume to hear the selfimportant and pretentious voiceovers of which there are many.There are two and only two good things about this movie. The first is Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas. She's beautiful and seems a very promising young actress even if Malick did have her wandering around and mumbling for most of the movie. The other is the filming which is very picturesque and authentic. I visited the Jamestown settlement in Virginia and the film shot in natural light on a nearby river in Virginia looks identical. But even at that we are forced to sit through shots and sequences that easily take 34 times as long as is necessary to get the point across. For some reason 45 seconds or more after it is blindingly apparent that Pocahantas is whimsical or that Smith is sad we're still watching her skipping through the forest or him standing alone in a field and mumbling his monologue of course.Each of the elements that should make this an excellent film is somehow wasted. The struggle for survival with men in the fort boiling their own belts to eat the leather becomes laughable when the Powhatans bring deer and other game to help the colony. Why didn't they just go out and hunt for themselves? For a colony struggling to survive whose crops are failing without enough food at war with the Natives in a strange land with shaky leadership and little support from England...the characters in this movie spend an awful lot of time just walking at an excruciatingly slow pace around the compound and talking to each other or more frequently to themselves. Shouldn't they be working at something? Shouldn't someone in this film be in some kind of hurry? And as for romance how could any woman feel romantic toward Farrell's character who never looks anything but forlorn throughout the entire movie? How could any man identify with him or want him to succeed in leading these people when he seems so dispassionate and distracted for so much of the film? This movie could have been to the Jamestown settlement what Dances With Wolves was to the Old West. That movie was also beautifully filmed and didn't oversimplify the roles of heroes and villains but kept the story moving. Even with a plodding actor like Costner numerous voiceovers and three hours or more to watch you stayed glued to your seat. The only thing keeping you in your seat through The New World is gravity and that becomes less compelling as this dud of a film drags on and on and on...I tell you if the new world was really as boring as The New World it's amazing anyone else ever came across The Pond.".

	schema:reviewBody "The New World has an opening five minutes where Natives rush to the shore to get a view of the massive British ships that are about to land on what would become Jamestown that are every bit as fantastic as any of the scenes in Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's a perfect marriage of sound effects music and visuals that literally paints itself onto the celluloid as a jaw dropping work of art. The nature of discovery and the power of film is boldly on display in Terrence Malick's brave New World. Some viewers will undoubtedly get lost in the visual and aural poetry while others will be annoyed at the lack of a focused narrative and the sometimes sketchy character motives. This is a historical drama and the amazing sets costumes and makeup attest to the wonderful attention to period detail but there's also a dreamy surreal nature to the pacing that will lull some to sleep who were expecting a more traditional docudrama. This is more about the myth of Pocahantas and channeling ghosts than it is about the actual history behind the story. The dialog is as evasive and minimal as the visuals are overwhelming and painstaking. Plotting is secondary to the mood and meditations on love discovery curiosity innocence and the clashing of cultures.Malick does a great job at showing the civilized and barbaric sides of both the Natives and the British. It's a wonderful testament to that first realization that there is intelligent life outside of one's own world. Central to this discovery of the New World is the romance between John Smith a modest Colin Farrel and Pocahantas an amazing Q'Orianka Kilcher which is displayed with just as much wide eyedwonder and innocence as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Christian Bale as John Rolfe and Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport are also very good when they are allowed to act amongst the lush scenery. Composer James Horner who is probably second only to John Williams in creating unforgettable movie music outdoes himself as his rousing symphony coupled with divine music from Wagner perfectly matches the reverence and awe with which Malick uses his visuals to paint the myth on screen.Some judicious editing may have benefited the middle portion of the film which amounts to scene after beautiful scene of two people falling in love while worshiping nature but there are two more series of scenes one in the middle and one at the end that are every bit as uplifting as the opening one and serve as a perfect synergy of visual and aural delights that completely transported this patient viewer to another realm. I'm not so sure that this is what it was really like to live in 1607 but I have no doubt this is what the people of that time dreamed about.".

It's a wonderful testament to that first realization that there is intelligent life outside of one's own world. Central to this discovery of the New World is the romance between John Smith a modest Colin Farrel and Pocahantas an amazing Q'Orianka Kilcher which is displayed with just as much wide eyedwonder and innocence as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Christian Bale as John Rolfe and Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport are also very good when they are allowed to act amongst the lush scenery. Composer James Horner who is probably second only to John Williams in creating unforgettable movie music outdoes himself as his rousing symphony coupled with divine music from Wagner perfectly matches the reverence and awe with which Malick uses his visuals to paint the myth on screen.Some judicious editing may have benefited the middle portion of the film which amounts to scene after beautiful scene of two people falling in love while worshiping nature but there are two more series of scenes one in the middle and one at the end that are every bit as uplifting as the opening one and serve as a perfect synergy of visual and aural delights that completely transported this patient viewer to another realm. I'm not so sure that this is what it was really like to live in 1607 but I have no doubt this is what the people of that time dreamed about.";

It jumps from some kind of documentary shot hand held running through yet more grass and ambient sound to another beautiful shot of our main female character wearing a Vivien Westwood cut dress was it fashion for native Americans to wear off the shoulder animal skins or 34 crop tops in 1608 Its awful. Go watch crash Capote walk the line sideways even batman begins for modern Hollywood this is dreadful. Its like watching a 10hr Calvin Klein or Tommy advert i kept expecting them to whisper eternity by Calvin Klein. There are some great shots but then not as good as many other films that have a fully explored plot depth and content. If you want deep and sexual frustration watch lost in translation. I can't think of another film that tries to be such an epic and fails so bad maybe water world....but even that film is better. For all those that keep saying how this is an art film maybe try peter Greenaway if you want to be visually stunned especially prospero's books or the cook the thief his wife and her lover. This isn't art its Hollywood trying to do subtle and it doesn't work. An art film is not just something that looks pretty it is supposed to challenge the audience the only challenge here is to sit all the way through.".

I lost track of how many tall grass scenes there were.There was very little dialog which made the story even harder to follow. The narration by John Smith and Pocohontas was always mystical and dreamy and poetic. It added absolutely nothing to the story and was actually pretty annoying.

In fact we should BE so lucky to have seen any sort of emotion exhibited by these characters except the one scene of Pocohotas sobbing and rolling around in the mud.Maybe I'm one of those people who just don't get this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Halfway through Terence Malick's The New World the Powhatan princess referred to as Matoaka never thankfully by the misnomer Pocahontas arrives at the encampment of the English settlers in the dead of night to warn the thenpresident John Smith played here by Colin Farrel that her father Chief Powhatan August Schellenberg is preparing to attack them. She asks him simply  to Come away. After having seen what we've seen already we know what she is asking him to do. And we are begging him to do it. But he can't. It's simply too late for him.Whether or not any of the events depicted in Malick's New World actually happened in real life as they are depicted in this film is beside the point. I personally have read a fair amount of historical and anthropological lit on early colonial Virginia and sure I'm a little annoyed that Malick opted to portray Smith's neardeath experience at the hands of Powhatan and his fabled and doubtlessly fabricated romance with his favorite daughter when neither of these things actually happened in real life. Malick isn't as interested in historical accuracy as he is in historical truth and yes there is a difference. The land the English arrived in was an unspoiled eden at least by what they certainly knew. Thirty years later it was ruined and the Powhatans were driven from their land. We see this happen as it truly did eventually. No one is burdened with historical foreshadowing here. When the Indians first sight the ships they couldn't possibly know that this means the end for them and the beginning for Us. And they don't. It's that authentic. Instead they and we feel excitement. In a breathtaking opening sequence scored by James Horner with ample help from Wagner we are given what has to be a glimpse through some time portal into the actual moments when Algonquin natives first sighted the three Ships of the Virginia Company Charter. Sound and sight combine beautifully the film is filmed using natural light as far as I know to render a indescribably gorgeous montage unlike anything I've ever seen in the cinema. It MUST have been like that. When the English go exploring soon after they land and encounter a party of Powhatan Malick gives us a strange disturbing and yet joyous vision of this first encounter. The natives sniff and touch the aliens while the English stand stock still obviously bewildered and terrified. Jesus Malick. How did you do it?Malick has the natives and especially Pocahontas brillaint beautiful and passionate Q'orianka Kilcher move and speak in the manner of the animals that inhabit the region. The warriors strut and caw like male birds and Pocahontas dances through the fields like a leaping doe. These people do not movespeak or act at all like Western men and women. We really believe that they have existed removed from our civilization for time out of mind. They are other and it is beautiful to see. Malick contrasts the beauty and harmony of the Powhatan capital with the desolate grimness of Jamestown Fort which Smith returns to after a sojourn with the natives. Unlike the idyllic world of the Algonquin the settlers have proved themselves to be arrogant greedy and cruel. In the end Powhatan decides he must act for the good of his people and plans to exterminate the English. Pocahontas blinded by her love for Smith goes to warn HIM. Not the colonists. She begs him to come away back with her to a better place than any he can ever know with the Europeans. He refuses because he cannot bring himself to give up the men he has been elected to lead to death. It is a stoic choice but a fatal one for both Pocahontas and her people. The Powhatan attack and are brutally thwarted among the casualties is Pocahontas' beloved brother. Pocahontas is banished to the Patawomeck tribe whose chief sells her to the English for a copper kettle. Told Smith is dead she wanders about the fort desolate and is slowly anglicized eventually marrying a kind new settler John Rolfe an endearing Christian Bale and bearing him a son. Malick doesn't so much tell us all this through conventional narrative as SHOW us. There is no point followed by point here. He lets it happen and through achingly beautiful imagery shows us how it FEELS. Yes if you're in the wrong mood the continuous shots of green canopies and flocks of birds blooming across the sky may be a bit much. Some parts may be confusing especially toward the end. And the script seems at times to be nonexistent which is usually alright if you have the patience but is trying at points. Sometimes we wish they would SAY more though this is usually made up for by impressive nonverbal acting by all parties. Sticklers for complete historical accuracy will be disappointed but they should be advised to keep an open mind the truth is essentially here. There was a land once populated sparsely by a people who lived in harmony with the earth if not always with each other. It was taken from them slowly but surely and turned into something completely unrecognizable. Kilcher's Matoaka is Malick's chosen personification of America Unspoiled once leaping about nimbly as one with the tall grass then corseted roughly clothed and presented as a trophy to a foreign people. She opened her arms willingly and without guile to help a stranger in need. She was repaid with despair and grief and was remade in someone else's image to suit someone Else's' ways. It's all here and beautiful  joyous and terrible to watch. We wish we had come away with Pocahontas. Highly recommended for those with patience and an interest.".

	onyx:emotionText "Halfway through Terence Malick's The New World the Powhatan princess referred to as Matoaka never thankfully by the misnomer Pocahontas arrives at the encampment of the English settlers in the dead of night to warn the thenpresident John Smith played here by Colin Farrel that her father Chief Powhatan August Schellenberg is preparing to attack them. She asks him simply  to Come away. After having seen what we've seen already we know what she is asking him to do. And we are begging him to do it. But he can't. It's simply too late for him.Whether or not any of the events depicted in Malick's New World actually happened in real life as they are depicted in this film is beside the point. I personally have read a fair amount of historical and anthropological lit on early colonial Virginia and sure I'm a little annoyed that Malick opted to portray Smith's neardeath experience at the hands of Powhatan and his fabled and doubtlessly fabricated romance with his favorite daughter when neither of these things actually happened in real life. Malick isn't as interested in historical accuracy as he is in historical truth and yes there is a difference. The land the English arrived in was an unspoiled eden at least by what they certainly knew. Thirty years later it was ruined and the Powhatans were driven from their land. We see this happen as it truly did eventually. No one is burdened with historical foreshadowing here. When the Indians first sight the ships they couldn't possibly know that this means the end for them and the beginning for Us. And they don't. It's that authentic. Instead they and we feel excitement.

And most of the other terrible movies I've seen were at least bad enough to be funny. This one is just awful. The running time is 150 minutes not really long by today's standards yet it feels infinitely longer. If you asked me to describe the movie in one word I would probably have to use boring but that really only begins to describe it. If you don't write too large you could fit all the dialogue including the intensely dull internal monologues from the whole movie onto one 4x6 note card and the vast amount of parts when nobody speaks are also strangely devoid of music or sound effects. Last night was the first time ever that I could actually hear the film projector running. The movie is also full of so many jumpcuts that they have to have been put there deliberately yet they have no purpose at all and are only jarring and only further remind you that you're watching a crappy movie. The cast has a lot of really great actors talent that is completely wasted on this movie. Jonathan Pryce for example is an exceptional actor yet his role in The New World comprised sitting still standing up and clapping like an excited sixyearold. Sadly this is not an isolated case in The New World. The worst part is that it is completely pointless. Throughout the entire move almost nothing happens. I really can't stress enough how lousy this movie is. Ironically the popcorn I got was really good but I didn't finish it. The movie was so bad yet I sat through the whole thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hi Everyone I must first tell you that I am in no way a movie critic. I just felt an obligation to inform everyone about the truth about this movie. I went to see this movie last night with my fianc. The movie started out with promise. You were introduced to beautiful scenes of what is supposed to be 17th century Virginia. The only flaw I found here was that the music was irritating. It was a very loud group of strings which were pulsating for minutes on the same two tones. I was very excited when the cast appeared and the story began. The first 20 minutes had plenty of conversations between the characters. But after that the movie went down hill. When we are introduced to Pocahontas the story was believable. The only problem is that she never really talks. You hear a narrator in her voice as if you were hearing her thoughts but her entire lines to the other cast John Smith included could have been placed on one page of the script. The story has no real fight scenes or action of any sort. My fianc wanted to leave one hour in but I made her stay in hopes that this movie was just waiting for some climax.First I must say I do not mind chick flicks. If there is humor love action or sports I am all for it but this move lacked all of the above. All Pocahuntas kept asking herself is Who am I......Who am I. She falls in love but never talks to him...he leaves...she falls in love again never talks to him maybe has a kid I couldn't really tell maybe wants to leave him.....and so on. I am not lying when I tell you that the FEMALES IN THE THEATRE WERE SLEEPIN! All their dates were waking them up. When the movie was over you could hear one man say think God from the back of the theater and a lady in front of me say That was the worst movie of history! Just please save your money and go see Harry Potter again or something. Maybe rent this movie but I wouldn't even do that. You can go and see this if you want but all I can figure by the rating is that people went and say this movie and were so bored that they decided to come home and vote that the movie was good. Now they are laughing at me because I wasted my money on it. It was the only way that they could find humor in wasting 2.5 hours of there life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way overbudget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.Having read the book World War Z I could tell from the trailers for this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film but I can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes and to be fair many of these involve world cities falling to zombie infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However the book's immense battle scenes  the meat of the titular Zombie War such as the Battle of Yonkers nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies  are completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these especially the Yonkers scene because they would obviously fit so well into a film and the script even as it is now could easily be tweaked to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions of the PG13 rating and the narrative around is not engaging enough to really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make but it's hard to see where it all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and nonthreatening and in some cases individual zombies are computer animated which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle act in Jerusalem there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent and this is accentuated in the bizarre final act which was obviously the focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate movie. I consider myself a patient viewer but this very long and dull scene started to bring me down after a while and my less patient viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film and began to make fun of it at every opportunity  not really a fair criticism of the film but it's a real issue when it can't hold an audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting idea at its heart albeit one that completely doesn't connect with anything in the book but I just didn't think it was a well executed concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words a perfect 510 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book WWZ the filmand WWZ the book only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague which is not an original idea in itself.".

The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words a perfect 510 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book WWZ the filmand WWZ the book only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague which is not an original idea in itself.";

Here is a list of the things that went wrong1. PG13 rating The director and producers wanted to make this movie family friendly so they took away all the gore death and decay that makes the zombie genre what it is. This made the zombies totally not scary and even on occasions towards the end just plain laughable.2. Senseless plot The UN sends a small team to investigate the beginning of the outbreak. They have a neurologist on the team who incidentally cant stop using cheesy metaphors about mother nature. Why can't they send multiple teams with more than one expert on each? After all it is clearly a high risk mission casualties must be expected. After the neurologist dies right after his pretentious speech it is clear that the whole thing was an excuse to put Brad Pitt in a dangerous situation so that we will feel tension. We still didn't because see 3.3. Bad character development None of the characters in the movie had any depth. As a result we didn't care if they lived or died. Pitt's family was just the detestable suburban family who apparently does nothing but turn money into feces. Their marriage and children felt so plastic and readymade that I personally would not have felt a thing if Pitt was torn apart by zombies in front of his family. Well actually that might have improved this movie alas it couldn't have happened because of 1.4. The ending sequence Just as we think that the plot cannot get worse and we make peace with the idea of enjoying the special effects the movie takes another down turn in the last 40 minutes or so. The special effects disappear and we find Pitt and his sidekick in a W.H.O. research facility playing hide and seek with zombies. There is no suspense because the ending is announced basically in the first 5 minutes of this sequence Pitt will go into the zombie infested part of the building get some disease samples and bring them back. They will use one of the samples to infect themselves and see if zombies will lose their appetite. They do and we win with another pretentious speech about how it is not the end but just the beginning. Yawn.5. Plot holes a Zombies can diagnose a terminal illness just by looking at someone and for some reason they avoid that person. This doesn't make any sense at any level. First even a doctor with years of medical training can't do that without extensive testing. How can a mindless zombie who cant figure out how to unbuckle her seat belt do it just after a glance by the corner of her eye? Second why the hell would zombies avoid a sick person? There is no reason. After all the virus or whatever that is causing the outbreak is not harmed by any other disease. The W.H.O. scientists said so themselves.b The W.H.O. facility is in Wales Britain. Among the weapons they have in their arsenal is a baseball bat. Does the director even know where Wales is? Does anyone one soul in Wales own a baseball bat? Was that so difficult to make it a cricket bat? Come on now I think that the director is a bit of a thickie but I can't believe that no one who looked at this movie prerelease had seen Shaun of the Dead. And to add insult to injury the soldier girl with one hand picks the baseball bat. This scene alone is enough to prove that the director of the movie is blind from birth because anyone who had at least one functioning eye at any point in his life and used it to glance at a baseball bat would have immediately realized that it is a twohanded weapon. How could a special forces soldier could not recognize it as such and not pick the crowbar?c The cellphone battery In one scene the cellphone's battery is declared dead. In a later scene it is working again. Really?d When they decide to recover the disease samples they give Pitt no briefing about which containers contain what. But apparently at least one container is full of deadly stuff which would kill him immediately. Why? Why? OMG why? The security cameras show the room clearly. All they need to do is to seat Pitt and the soldier girl in front of one of the displays and show them where the goodies are before sending them in.e Pitt has no special combat first aid or survival training. He apparently learned all that stuff on the field and he is not a scientist either. Finally he doesn't have experience as a commanding officer. So why would he instead of literally thousands of military people who were purposetrained for such a mission is chosen to lead the mission? It doesn't make any sense. It would have made a lot of sense if his UN friend said something like Look I convinced these people that you are the best man to lead this mission though we both know that you aren't. You are just a guy who spent ten years handing out blankets to African countries. But I had to do it to save your family alright? They would have never let you on the ship otherwise and you would have died in Philly. That would have not only sealed this plot hole but also would have given Pitt's character a tragic and desperate quality which would have helped us care about him. But the mindless zombies who made this movie missed this chance too.".

Not a literal apocalypse of course just 16 dozen different zombie books graphic novels games and TV shows taking over the world like the plague and you just had to have your piece of the pie didn't you?World War Z is based on the 2006 novel by Max Brooks. The novel garnered some quite positive reviews praised for its international and political scope. It also caught the eye of producer and star Brad Pitt who after a long struggle with studios directors producers and other Hollywood zombies managed to put together a half decent movie with director Marc Forster.Half decent? Well WWZ certainly isn't a bad movie. You've got the longtime Oscardeserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane a likable goodlooking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously because after the now seemingly mandatory newsfootagemontage introduction Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough but the problem is that WWZ's politicalinternational context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ guess what? There still is. Granted it's never boring but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than never boring. Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think they put all the good parts in? Well this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills there isn't much of that either as its PG13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a notsogreat movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. Franchise of course if permitted by the audience because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.".

You have been warned.The Premiere I was at the London World Premiere last week and Interestingly there was clearly tension between Mark Director and Brad Pitt. I would have thought a director of this size movie would be able to make a speech. But no. Reading from cards he fumbled over his words got his actors names seriously wrong in front of 1000 people and was clearly very very nervous. Which is odd because any director should be excited or proud to be presenting their work to the world!Brad Pitt in interview said they chose Mark as he was really good at the little emotional moments between characters. Well they mush have cut those bits out.The movie A zombie film with no blood? I've no idea what the zombies were doing as we never see them kill anyone! They just run around a lot far too fast for a 'human being'. No decapitated zombies and a incredibly poor script that could have been knocked together in an evening. Speaking to actors who worked on the film they told me a lot of the dialogue was improvised. And it shows. Good dialogue is written. It is very hard for an actor to come up with great dialogue on set with crew around lights explosions gun fire and a budget and schedule pressing down on you  that is what rehearsals and dare I say a screenwriter are for.I just don't think Mark Forster Quantum of Bollox knows how to direct. No emotional connection to any of the characters. No big climax at the end and the least threatening Zombie in the history of movies. Click click click. A tedious VO from Brad at the end about only just the beginning of the war YAWN... We have heard this a hundred times.There was some truly awful acting characters that appear and go in a scene that do nothing and flimsy science that is just insulting to anyone who can actually think.The only good bit was the Zombie as Ants scene but it would have been hugely improved if a zombie with a giant leaf walked past in the background.The audience laughed at several moment that I don't believe the director even realised were gags! Brad doesn't even really do any acting. He does a bit of running around and a fight or two. No great lines and I don't really believe that he loves his kids and wife so terribly much.Best thing in it was  Daniella Kertesz but her scenes are clearly cut to bits unlike her hand which just seems to be fine after a couple of gin and tonics. I'll have what she's having!And leaning suitcases against a curtain? Seriously. That was really bad.The film could have been saved in the Edit  with some clever repositioning of the major scenes to get the structure right but having seen Brad and Mark together they had clearly fallen out of love with the movie.Nothing here we haven't seen in 28 Days Later or any other zombie film or even The War of the World that was written 100 years ago.At the end the applause was half hearted and everyone got up and left super fast.The aftermath Please GOD can we stop giving bad directors a second and in this case 10th chance. This film made me angry that a studio can waste so much money on what was a mediocre idea even at the beginning and gave it to a director who has a proved track record of not being able to fix a bad script or direct action.The budget on this would keep an independent film maker in business for the next 400 years  or if we put that in a real time scale  all the way back to Elizabeth the 1st.Frustrating.Nothing to see here ladies and gentlemen move on.".

The book was nothing like that! Booo! I'm sure he scurried away back home logged online and began tweeting posting and blogging furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre I hope he receives silence in return.It's true World War Z is nothing like the book. The book is told from the point of view AFTER the war. It's a historical account of what happened during the war. Rather than make a mockumentary with flashbacks which would have been the wrong decision in my opinion the filmmakers decided to put us right in the middle of the action.When adapting a piece of literature it is impossible to bring every page every paragraph every nuance onto the screen. Some have come close depending on the material but for the most part they all have to take their own creative licenses. After all it's called an adaptation for a reason otherwise they would call it a copy or mimic.Where World War Z works that's a mouthful and where so many others fail is that just because the world slips into total and utter chaos doesn't mean that governments military and law enforcement agencies go away. Quite the opposite. If anything these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. We see generals UN delegates and scientists trying to solve complex issues that they don't know anything about. Rather than going into hiding they act. Society doesn't crumble. Bands of cannibals and leather strapped gangs don't patrol the streets with necklaces made of teeth. People do what they can to survive and the higher ups try their best to find a fast and effective solution.At first I thought the movie started too fast. How could something this violent and concentrated go undetected but after a while I got it. The opening montage of news reports said it all. How many of us listen to everything we hear on the news? Exactly. So much goes undetected while we focus on issues that effect us immediately. It's too late when the virus touches US soil. Not even social media can keep up with it.As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. Though I think 28 Days Later takes the cake in terms of realism incamera effects and sheer terror this one holds its own. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 060 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news.For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D I know it's asking a lot but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price  deal with it. I tend to air on the side of screw it I want to see it in 3D. Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions Avatar and maybe Life of Pi but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly particles floating about in South Korea and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall take a deep breath look the enemy in the eye and say No.".

Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 060 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news.For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D I know it's asking a lot but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price  deal with it. I tend to air on the side of screw it I want to see it in 3D. Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions Avatar and maybe Life of Pi but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly particles floating about in South Korea and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall take a deep breath look the enemy in the eye and say No.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by giving a summary of the book A journalist travels the world AFTER the zombie outbreak to interview different people from different countries to see how they handled this massive infestation. It gives points of view from different characters on how they handled themselves and uses realworld scenarios to show realistically how such a thing would be combated. On to the movie Where did ANY of this go? First of all instead of showing how DIFFERENT people handle this situation it shows how ONE MAN handles it. Brad Pitt. For a movie that seems to want to be taken seriously as truetolife it sure does fail when it introduces the premise that somehow a RETIRED UN investigator is the most important man in the world and the only one who can save it. If such were the case why send him out with ONLY a handful of soldiers instead of a small army of Special Forces? Also why introduce this young brilliant doctor as the possible hope for humanity if he is only going to idiotically shoot himself in the first thirty minutes of the movie? To me it seemed like Brad Pitt said Woah wait a minute. You can't let a dorky doctor save the world. I'm the hero! Kill him off! stamped his foot and went to pout in a corner. I had heard that Pitt the producer and Forster the director were at odds through the entire filming so the script had to be rewritten several times to accommodate Pitt's hissy fits so I'm slow to blame Forster for this awful adaptation.The zombies LOL! These zombies are everything you'd expect if Disney decided to do a Pixar zombie film. Most of them are done using CGI and the ones who are actual actors are completely nonscary and laughable. Gnashing their teeth like poorly acted Cenobytes from the Hellraiser series. In order to sell more tickets they opted for a PG13 rating so there is no blood and I don't remember seeing a zombie kill a single person. How do you make a zombie movie when the antagonist which is supposed to strike fear into our hearts just seems like a football game gone horribly wrong? Super fast running and lots of flying tackles does not for a zombie apocalypse make.The plot I know this movie was trying for something different and failed horribly. They should have just called it 28 Months Later. The supposed plot twist at the end which was rewritten 4 or 5 times seemed put together at the last minute and as if the writers just said eh screw it. Just do this and release the movie so we can get a paycheck. Anyone who thinks that making it a metaphor for the current state of events and painting the UN into the saviors of humanity is something new has obviously not seen the FAR superior District 9. I will not get into all the other plot holes so monstrous you could drive a bus through them.The acting Who are these people? Why should we care about them? Their performances are wooden. They have such small roles because Brad Pitt seems to want to hog all the screen time and even then his own performance is stilted and lackluster. He lacks any sort of emotion and I never once felt that I could connect to his character at all. The filmmakers would have done a much better job if he'd been introduced as an average joe.Summary I see a lot of people praising the action in this movie but I found it extremely boring. Any action presented was the same Brad Pitt goes to new country Brad Pitt gets attacked Brad Pitt saves a handful of people Brad Pitt runs to new country. For the overbloated budget this movie offered nothing new or refreshing. On top of that it could not even succeed as a good zombie film. Movies like 28 Days Later The Horde and hell even Cockneys vs. Zombies show that a great zombie film does not need a huge budget to make it great. This was simply Pitt's and Hollywood's attempt at taking something people love zombies and cashing in on it. The 7.4 rating I see this movie had must have been paid for because 910ths of the user reviews I see for this film are just BAD! Same as the film itself. The good reviews I see praise it as The Best Zombie Movie I've Seen  which leads me to believe they haven't seen ANY zombie movies before and that the movie is Intelligent and Realistic which if you see my above points just isn't the case. Usually I am very forgiving in terms of movies lacking realism but this one was trying to sell itself on that very premise. Also I am not harsh on films for not being perfect adaptations of a book but this is different because it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the book at all aside from the wall in Israel and the title itself.410 simply because some parts of it did look nice and I'm even being in a giving mood with that.".

Well two breathless hours later I turned to her big grin on my face and had to state That was awesome! Yes I can see why people don't like it. It is very different to the traditional zombie movie and very different to the book. But you know what who cares  it's not a traditional zombie movie or the book  it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books. The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family it was enough it told me all I needed to know before launching into a fantastic break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence with a series of spectacular set pieces the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the stated in the movie fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie where mostly he just has to run like hell! and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1 to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be 2 that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids  I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that not the gore is what would scare them. 3 to go with the flow  I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun. I for one will be getting this on blu ray and I'll be first in line for any sequel. But I will admit an undated version would be very welcome!".

	schema:reviewBody "If a film is sold by a trailer it's this one . I've never read the source novel but do know it is structured as reportage where the world has been changed by a zombie infestation leading to a new geopolitical shape for the world so in many ways this is more of a prequel than an adaptation . I did like Danny Boyle's genre shattering 28 DAYS LATER and loved the sequel and unfortunately it looks like that franchise has ended so in some ways this could be a surrogate 28 MONTHS LATER . Add to this the trailers where the waves of infected storm barriers against heavily armed soldiers and we've got a Zombie classic in the making don't we ?No we don't because this is a film that gives the impression that it was written and made by zombies From the outset we get something incomprehensible  the outbreak itself . WWZ keeps the origins of the virus an enigma and right away this damages the premise . At least in 28 DL the audience are afforded an opening scene of the rage virus escaping and you're very quickly able to buy in to this scenario . WWZ doesn't do this but an opening scene alludes to a virus breaking out across the world via news reports . Cut to scientist Brad Pitt driving his family in Philadelphia and finds himself in a traffic jam . Within seconds people run screaming from their cars as rabid zombies run everywhere This scene is mildly effective but there's a spanner in the works . Two spanners actually . One is that's very clear that the incubation period of this virus is a few seconds almost identical to that established in 28 DL . In reality such a violent virus would spread like wild fire but the thing is it wouldn't be able to cross continents which renders the later parts of the film as incomprehensible from a logic point of view . Secondly you will find it impossible to buy in to this scenario . I know I didn't but please feel free to ask questions As the film progresses Brad Pitt's scientist  and I won't call him by his character name because he doesn't have a character  jumps on a plane to South Korea then off to Israel where the Israelis have managed to block out the infected by building a massive big wall  Wow that was quick Theo . The Israelis must be very good bricklayers to build a wall when the infection has only existed for a couple of days  Oh no because the Mossad chief got word from India a few week earlier that the Indian army were fighting zombies . Before you ask it's never revealed why the news media never got hold of this potential headline  nor is it revealed why when the rest of the world is battling Zombies this unknown virus never got in to Israel The action scenes in Jerusalem are impressive from a spectacle point of view but again lack internal continuity . Safe behind their wall the Israelis let in refugees  while armies of Zombies swarm around outside . Narrowly escaping the carnage Brad stops to amputate the hand of a female IDF soldier whose just been bitten which defies credibility  But Theo you know these Israelis are tough nuts and women have to endure pain and blood every month Not in the same league as amputation though is it ? Then Brad phones the UN who tell him that he must make his way to WHO research lab in Wales . Don't ask why there's no nearer research centres between Cardiff and Jerusalem . while on the aeroplane a Zombie that just happened to be hiding in the cupboard jumps out and spreads the infection leading to IDF girl to throw a grenade that causes the plane to crash in Wales . So they have a short walk to the WHO research centre  Wouldn't blood loss caused by getting your hand amputated make you too weak to go for a short walk ? And wouldn't Britain being an island make quarantine against the virus much easier ? I mean if the Israelis managed it ?  Look sit down and shut up . I know this was a major plot point that the rage virus couldn't escape from Britain in 28DL but if you think you can write a better Hollywood screenplay join the 7 billion people heading towards Hollywood right now . The last half hour involves more idiotic plotting that rely on coincidence  good fortune and after spending nearly every scene pointing out that the Zombies are attracted to noise someone just has to shoot a gun . The film ends with a solution to the problem which doesn't make the slightest bit of sense but means the human race can now concentrate on wiping out the Zombies  But Theo won't the Zombies die of thirst ?  I said shut up . If anything about this film made any sense it have been more than a loud dumb Summer blockbuster . You do notice that everything about it seems to have commercial consideration . Brad Pitt jumping all over the world meeting so many different nationalities does seem a cynical attempt at audience identification . Likewise the very obvious lack of blood and gore might supposedly attract people who fear the post apocalypse  Zombie genre  Hello Bob The Moo  but they'll notice the lack of intelligent plotting which severely damages the film and gore hounds who enjoy blood and guts will be disappointed by the extremely inoffensive nature of WWZ . Danny Boyle you're needed".

If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie. It literally shows everything that happens in the movie completely destroying any suspense that might have been had. World War Z isn't a conventional movie with a flowing plot line that builds to a dramatic conclusion. It's more like a bunch of individual parts laid out in a not so very straight line and strung together loosely by a single character. I don't have much of a problem with that or the facts the Zombies aren't of the undead kind slow moving kind like they were in the source novel. But rather the rabid sprinting quick turning kind like in 28 days later Brad Pit is good and takes the roll seriously. The CGi is top notch and the movie is well made. The problem I had is that I new exactly what was going to happen before it happened because they showed it in the stupid trailer. Literally every single cool action shot that's in the movie they showed in the trailer. Every single plot point. Even the dialog scenes. I knew the jest of what was going to be said because they showed the important parts in the trailer! I kept waiting for the extended version but it never came. There's no suspense. I know there's Zombies on the plane and that Brad Pitt blows a hole in the side sucking them all out crashing the plane because they show it in the trailer! That's just one example of a long list of scenes that you totally know what's fixing to happen because well... You've seen it already. This is one movie I wish I could have gone in completely blank.

	schema:headline " Brad Pitt not just a Valium for humans anymore";
	schema:reviewBody "The zombie outbreak starts with Brad Pitt with his family in stopped traffic. There's a huge explosion with no explanation of why. Then either a huge horde of humans are running from a small amount of zombies or a huge horde of zombies are chasing a small amount of humans. You can't tell who is who because all you see is a mob of people running in the same direction. Occasionally you see a zombie or two leap after a human so you can tell they're not all human. But otherwise they could have been filming the bull runs in Spain without the bulls.The zombies are part of what ruins the movie. They run faster than humans can leap onto flying helicopters and can stack themselves 20 zombies high to climb walls. They can detect any terminal illness in any human no matter the disease. No explanation is given how someone can go from ordinary human to super zombie in 12 seconds. Or why zombies just bite humans and then run away. If it takes 12 seconds to turn then why don't they continue to attack for 12 seconds?Next all the zombies are gone somehow and we see humans looting a store. The zombies are attracted to sound but somehow they can't hear people pushing shopping carts on pavement. After some shopping Brad takes his family to an apartment building which seems to be void of zombies. He convinces a family to let him and his family into their apartment. After a beer Brad tells the father that him  his family should go with him. However the father decides to stay. Bad decision. When Brad Pitt tells you to do something you do it. Within seconds of Brad leaving all of a sudden there's a hundred zombies outside the door breaking in.Brad's on his way to the roof for a helicopter rescue while being chased by zombies. All of a sudden the little boy from the family shows up. No explanation of how he got by all the zombies nor an explanation of why the zombies stopped coming to allow Brad to save the boy. All we know is when Brad Pitt is around zombies either stop coming or become very calm. Almost like they just took a Valium.Next they're off to South Korea. Nothing happens except Brad learns he needs to go to Israel and the North Koreans are fine because they extracted the teeth of their entire country. Can't infect without teeth How that stops the 4 billion people already infected with teeth is never explained. Brad gets to Israel to witness they built a wall around the country and survived the zombie apocalypse. Not for long. They're letting in people from everywhere. All you see is humans entering the country through metal walkways. Who knows where the walkways lead to or why the zombies can't get into them. Or can they? There's a scene later in the movie where a zombie picks up a human in the supposedly safe walkway and infects him. If that's all it took to infect the walkway then why weren't they infected a long time ago?Why didn't Israel get infected? Because they built a huge wall. Why did every continent get infected at nearly the same time? Because as explained in the movie it was the airplanes. Big cities were affected first and worst because of the international airports. Did Israel have airports? Absolutely. They had a line of planes leaving every minute. Did zombies infect the planes? They certainly infected the plane Brad Pitt left Israel on. So why didn't Israel get infected by one of the planes entering the country? Never explained.The reason why the zombies took over the country is dumb. After they let in refugees the refugees start singing and that noise attracts the zombies. Forget the fact that they have helicopters constantly orbiting the wall or the never ending line of planes taking off from their airports. It's the children singing that triggers the zombies to scale the wall and conquer the country. In South Korea army soldiers gave advice to aim at the knees to slow them down and then the heads to kill. So obviously we're not dealing with invincible zombies. So how do they manage to stack themselves 20 zombies high and then drop all the way to the ground uninjured? No broken bones. But if you shoot their knees they drop like flies.Then there's the amputation scene. Israel is being overrun by zombies so badly the girl running behind Brad gets bit. They kill the biting zombie and then conveniently zombies stop coming so Brad can amputate the hand of the girl and bandage her up. I told you Brad Pitt has a calming effect on zombies!!About the terminal illness theory. How did they not discover that the entire cancer wing of a hospital would be unaffected by the zombie virus. Or were the zombies simply avoiding Brad Pitt? I wish Brad Pitt infected himself with a virus that made him invisible to me.".

	schema:headline " A very Mixed Bag";
	schema:reviewBody "Pros Epic scope This is without a doubt the biggest zombie movie ever made. The exact budget of the film is unknown but due to its prolonged and troubled production some have estimated the movie cost as much as 250 million dollars to make. And the filmmakers really make sure you're aware of how expensive the movie would've been to make with a number of staggering shots featuring thousands and thousands of zombies swarming all over each other. The movie earns its title given the fact that it is truly a zombie movie on a global scale. Brad Pitt He's very good in this movie and is definitely one of the best things about the film. He makes for a compelling and likable hero who has to rely more on his intelligence than physical power. He's no superhero in this film and his vulnerability and everydayman nature keeps him relatable and likable.Action scenes As mentioned before there's a ton of zombies in this movie. And yes a lot of them are CGI which I personally don't have a problem with because there were so many it's unlikely they could've done a lot of these scenes with actual extras portraying the zombies. The hordes of zombies allow for some truly spectacular action scenes on a large scale all of which I'd rather not talk about in too much detail because the zombieaction scenes are really the best part of the film so it's definitely best not to ruin the scenes by giving you too much of an idea of what to expectUse of the word zombie This didn't necessarily make the film better but it was just interesting to see the word zombie used frequently by the film's characters. The word zombie has been treated for so long as a clichd term in zombie films that it's now kind of refreshing to see it used so honestly and openly in a serious zombie film. Cons Lack of gore Now don't get me wrong I don't need blood and guts in every single movie I watch. But with zombie films gory violence is a necessity. You need to see zombies getting ripped apart to emphasise how they are literally the living dead and you need to see humans die graphic deaths to reinforce how much of a threat the zombies can be. But this film wants to appeal to pretty much anyone aged 10 and up so Brad Pitt and friends can get more money so of course we get very little blood plus no onscreen guts severed limbs or exploding heads. Shaky cam This kind of ties in with the lack of gore it's like the cameraman is shying away from the more graphic moments it's The Hunger Games all over again. The shaky cam's only really noticeable in the film's first half hour though while the zombie outbreak is just beginning so it's not a huge problem. Still a little bothersome though.Unfulfilling ending This movie does end in an abrupt fashion and kind of left me wanting more. It ends very suddenly and I kind of thought to myself really? That's it? The biggest action scene in the movie occurs about halfway through the film and the final zombie confrontation was fairly quiet and lowkey which just felt a bit off to me. That being said the jarringly sudden ending could be seen as a good thing as it demonstrated that the movie went by fairly quickly. It's just under two hours long but the final scene honestly felt as though the film was at about the 80minute mark. But still the ending was a little unsatisfying so I ultimately see the ending as a con.Unintentionally funny zombies Zombies can be funny and zombie movies can be partcomedy and still be great zombie movies. Shaun of the Dead and ZombieLand are both very funny movies that also manage to be pretty good legitimate zombie films they don't exclusively poke fun at the zombie genre. George A. Romero worked some great satire into 1978s Dawn of the Dead by comparing the zombies in the film's mall to the mindless braindead consumers who inhabited the mall prezombie apocalypse. World War Z didn't feel like it was meant to have much comedy in it with its serious tone and gritty aesthetic yet at times I found myself laughing at the way the film's zombies expressed exaggerated twitchy movements and the manner in which more than a few of them chattered their teeth repeatedly in a cartoonish manner.Slight lack of tension The movie lacks some much needed suspense because it's basically Brad Pitt saving the world himself. Maybe if Pitt's character had a few allies forming like a ragtag squad or something and they went around battling zombies as a group it would've made things more intense and involving as a few of them would inevitably die along the way. I don't know a few more welldeveloped side characters would've gone quite a long way in making me more invested in the film's events.So there's my thoughts on this film. It's a mixed bag but ultimately I'd recommend it. It's worth seeing at the cinema just for those spectacular action scenes and simply so you can see the sheer scale of the biggest budgeted zombie film of all time. It's flawed as hell though so go in with moderate expectations. It could be a whole lot better but ultimately the film's still pretty decent and a good one to experience on the big screen. It's certainly a fine summer blockbuster but it's unlikely that the film will ever achieve a classic status.".

Check. Focuses on intensity rather than horror and gore to not alienate non zombie fans? Check. Safe young PG 13 rating? Check. All the makings are here because this is what the big Hollywood studio wanted. Despite the fact this movie doesn't resemble the book at all it appears that those attached to make this movie tried to make a decent movie such as the visually interesting director Marc Foster who wanted to make a movie with a message which would emulate the tone the book was going for. However the big studio disliked this and demanded rewrites and reshooting that damaged the relationship between the director and Brad and results in a quick intense action movie that lacks the character development and messages it needed to be a truly memorable movie because almost every one of those scenes were cut so much to the point that central characters get barley any lines. While the action scenes are intense and enjoyable on their own and Marc foster adds style to the lack of substance but its just not enough to save this movie. While it is better than it had any right to be thanks to Marc it needs more and it lacks in crucial substance. However from the reviews and box office reports it appears Hollwood has succeeded in creating a successful marketable movie that everyone will eat up and it will be too late when we all get the nasty aftertaste.....".

	schema:headline " A zombie film that lacks bite";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems unfair to criticise the film for not being like its source material given that it obviously didn't try to be but I'm going to start by bringing that up anyway. The book had so many sequences that could have been turned into amazing setpieces in a film and yet not one of them were used. The book also had some neat ideas about how a global outbreak and response play out. What might work? What would catastrophically fail? What would the cost be? Not one of these ideas were explored or even alluded to and there seems absolutely no reason why this was the case.It might have been okay to abandon these ideas if the film had some ideas of its own to explore or at least play out but it doesn't. Instead we follow Brad Pitt and Brad Pitt's baggage through a few setpieces as he first escapes from and then looks into an outbreak of zombies. There's little else to say about it than that.The first major problem came down to the zombies themselves. For a zombie film to get that right is critical and World War Z stumbled pretty badly here. The physical appearance of the zombies is a clear problem. Given the film's penchant for shying away from blood and gore to keep its rating audiencefriendly the only things that separates these zombies from regular people are milky eyes grey skin and a tendency to bare and snap their teeth. They're not the bloodthirsty creatures at various stages of decay and ruin that feature in most zombie films. This is generally fine in closeups but at a distance it's impossible to tell the zombies apart from regular people. And when most of your action scenes involve panicking people running away from what are allegedly zombies having them pretty much indistinct from each other means you never get much of an inclination about the level of the threat or even what's going on.A possible solution would have been for the film to opt for the shambling moaning Romeroesque zombies of the book. Instead of running and tackling having a slowly everadvancing tide of danger would have turned the zombies into something to be feared rather than something to try and spot in a crowd.But even later when the film displays zombies in their 'docile' state its shown how little the filmmakers understand how zombies are supposed to work. The jerking around and screeches were meant to be threatening and they are anything but. They are borderline slapstick and certainly comical judging by the outbreaks of laughter in the audience at my screening. They clicked their teeth together as if they enjoyed the sound. They repeatedly hit their heads against the wall in a way that was meant to seem deranged but just came across as silly. They spun and jerked around leading to a hilarious sequence of Pitt and two others essentially playing Red LightGreen Light with a snarling zombie. Nothing about these zombies seemed to work as intended.The second major problem came down to the complete lack of weight or tension. Brad Pitt isn't the type of actor anyone expects to be in danger at least not when he's in an action film so already there's the knowledge that he's fairly safe. But added to that his character is a practically invulnerable badass UN investigator whose field knowledge and ingenuity makes him able to adapt to any situation. His 'baggage' as I referred to them earlier is played at first by his wife and two daughters as well as an orphan boy  far too cute to ever come into real harm in a film like this. The baggage is then played by a doctor and a team of soldiers who are so bereft of personality and character that there is no reason to care about them. He then teams up with a young Israeli soldier who is the closest person aside from Pitt to qualify to be called a character but unfortunately she doesn't seem to serve any purpose. His final baggage comes in the form of a team of WHO doctors. I won't say anything about them aside from pointing out that all four are named in the credits as W.H.O. Doctor despite being a key part of around a quarter of the film. Though I wouldn't recommend the film to its credit it managed to attain a level of being entertaining and it never embarrassed itself despite a squeamish bit of product placement. It was clearly let down by a few core problems and while certainly not a good film I'd feel a bit mean if I were to label it 'bad'. I'm disappointed that it painted itself as a zombie film for zombie fans while clearly being a toothless blockbuster to appeal to a broader audience however understandable that move may be from a film studio's perspective given the production problems and cost blowout.

	onyx:emotionText "It seems unfair to criticise the film for not being like its source material given that it obviously didn't try to be but I'm going to start by bringing that up anyway. The book had so many sequences that could have been turned into amazing setpieces in a film and yet not one of them were used. The book also had some neat ideas about how a global outbreak and response play out. What might work? What would catastrophically fail? What would the cost be? Not one of these ideas were explored or even alluded to and there seems absolutely no reason why this was the case.It might have been okay to abandon these ideas if the film had some ideas of its own to explore or at least play out but it doesn't. Instead we follow Brad Pitt and Brad Pitt's baggage through a few setpieces as he first escapes from and then looks into an outbreak of zombies. There's little else to say about it than that.The first major problem came down to the zombies themselves. For a zombie film to get that right is critical and World War Z stumbled pretty badly here. The physical appearance of the zombies is a clear problem. Given the film's penchant for shying away from blood and gore to keep its rating audiencefriendly the only things that separates these zombies from regular people are milky eyes grey skin and a tendency to bare and snap their teeth. They're not the bloodthirsty creatures at various stages of decay and ruin that feature in most zombie films. This is generally fine in closeups but at a distance it's impossible to tell the zombies apart from regular people. And when most of your action scenes involve panicking people running away from what are allegedly zombies having them pretty much indistinct from each other means you never get much of an inclination about the level of the threat or even what's going on.A possible solution would have been for the film to opt for the shambling moaning Romeroesque zombies of the book. Instead of running and tackling having a slowly everadvancing tide of danger would have turned the zombies into something to be feared rather than something to try and spot in a crowd.But even later when the film displays zombies in their 'docile' state its shown how little the filmmakers understand how zombies are supposed to work. The jerking around and screeches were meant to be threatening and they are anything but. They are borderline slapstick and certainly comical judging by the outbreaks of laughter in the audience at my screening. They clicked their teeth together as if they enjoyed the sound. They repeatedly hit their heads against the wall in a way that was meant to seem deranged but just came across as silly. They spun and jerked around leading to a hilarious sequence of Pitt and two others essentially playing Red LightGreen Light with a snarling zombie. Nothing about these zombies seemed to work as intended.The second major problem came down to the complete lack of weight or tension. Brad Pitt isn't the type of actor anyone expects to be in danger at least not when he's in an action film so already there's the knowledge that he's fairly safe. But added to that his character is a practically invulnerable badass UN investigator whose field knowledge and ingenuity makes him able to adapt to any situation. His 'baggage' as I referred to them earlier is played at first by his wife and two daughters as well as an orphan boy  far too cute to ever come into real harm in a film like this. The baggage is then played by a doctor and a team of soldiers who are so bereft of personality and character that there is no reason to care about them. He then teams up with a young Israeli soldier who is the closest person aside from Pitt to qualify to be called a character but unfortunately she doesn't seem to serve any purpose. His final baggage comes in the form of a team of WHO doctors. I won't say anything about them aside from pointing out that all four are named in the credits as W.H.O. Doctor despite being a key part of around a quarter of the film. Though I wouldn't recommend the film to its credit it managed to attain a level of being entertaining and it never embarrassed itself despite a squeamish bit of product placement. It was clearly let down by a few core problems and while certainly not a good film I'd feel a bit mean if I were to label it 'bad'. I'm disappointed that it painted itself as a zombie film for zombie fans while clearly being a toothless blockbuster to appeal to a broader audience however understandable that move may be from a film studio's perspective given the production problems and cost blowout. For this reason maybe the film tripped up and fell flat on its face but as it dragged itself to the finish line I'm willing to applaud it for that at least. I suppose all I can do it sit here and try to imagine what might have been...";

	schema:reviewBody "World War Z despite involving zombies plays more to the likes of a disaster film instead of a zombie film. It's more of like 2012 than Resident Evil. We see shots of cities tumbling down to the rule of zombies and the world slowly turns into a zombie wasteland. The zombie attacks are largescale grand and extremely exciting save for the climax which ends up as a smallscale sequence but is equally satisfying. The hero is Gerry Lane a retired United Nations investigator who is recruited by what is left of the U.S. government to assist a young virologist Dr. Fassbach in investigating the virus. He reluctantly accepts this task in exchange for his family to be able to shelter in a U.S. Navy vessel. After Fassbach dies in a hilarious way he is determined to stop this outbreak. During their visit to Camp Humphreys in South Korea where the word zombie was first used in reference to the outbreak they learn that the zombies are attracted to sound. They also learn that Israel has established itself as a safe zone after it quarantined itself within a wall. Unaffected civilians regardless of nationality are allowed to enter. But due to the civilians singing loudly through a microphone the zombies pile themselves up and manage to overcome the wall and chaos ensues. This the largest action sequence in the entire movie. The scale is so massive and this scene is extremely exciting. Millions of uninfected humans being chased around by millions of zombies. The chaos is just indescribable. Add in the fact that the zombies are mindless and uncivilized and the chaos just multiplies itself. But this scene isn't the only one. There's another one earlier back in Philadelphia where Gerry witnesses the zombies firsthand for the very first time. All the action sequences are highly entertaining massive but surprisingly bloodless which is peculiar for a film with zombies. They're massive except the climax where it's noticeably smaller set in a WHO facility but the tension is equally high and allows more shocks. Brad Pitt portrays the lead character Gerry Lane. His character is devoid of personality here as most of the time he's just involved in action. But Mr. Pitt delivers a performance that is quite pleasing. The rest of the cast gave good performances too and the acting shouldn't burden the whole movie experience. The script isn't that bad too. It diverges significantly from the original book and it is a bit uneven but the lines make sense. It also works because it contains a real plot for the script to follow through. It has a sensible plot and the script acknowledges this. It's also worth noting that it has several humorous scenes too.It's far from perfect it's heavy on action sequences and it's uneven but World War Z is an extremely fun ride for everyone to enjoy. I would also say that it's rather familyfriendly as there are child characters that appear quite prominently. Another reason it's rather familyfriendly is that it's bloodless. It has a real sensible plot unlike most mindless movies containing zombies and if you ignore the tiny faults and plot holes World War Z will take you away on one of the most fun rides. Rating 710Final Verdict World War Z is uneven and far from perfect but it's a fun and exhilarating ride that is more of a disaster film instead of the typical zombie film and rather family friendly.".

	schema:headline " World War Z is an entertaining fun night out but not original in the slightest";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally after years of facing difficulty with production and resources World War Z has come our way and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie it actually mixes horror suspense and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jumpscares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. Anyways the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccinecure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake that's for sure. Now I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting especially Brad Pitt's which as usual doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances. With that being said the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration which means right off the bat we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes if that of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on fast forward in order to get to the point. This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general and zombie movies or we can say Horror movies as a whole definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later the film has to reach the actionpacked bits as soon as possible. And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest shall I say adaptation of the book this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter. I haven't read the book which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan on the other hand you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So to put it most understandably if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed you'll experience a wild rollercoaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful nervewracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean it's yet another zombie movie dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case during its first act World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness really. This all begs the question how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone but then again as long as these studios continue to rake in millions they'll continually produce the same product. In the end World War Z is a fun entertaining night out but if you can't make it to the showing don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.".

Now I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting especially Brad Pitt's which as usual doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances. With that being said the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration which means right off the bat we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes if that of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on fast forward in order to get to the point. This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general and zombie movies or we can say Horror movies as a whole definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later the film has to reach the actionpacked bits as soon as possible. And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest shall I say adaptation of the book this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter. I haven't read the book which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan on the other hand you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So to put it most understandably if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed you'll experience a wild rollercoaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful nervewracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean it's yet another zombie movie dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case during its first act World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness really. This all begs the question how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone but then again as long as these studios continue to rake in millions they'll continually produce the same product. In the end World War Z is a fun entertaining night out but if you can't make it to the showing don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.";

I mean come on World War Z I expected a war of epic proportion. Instead I got total zombie domination while living people retreated to whatever safety could be found. The War scenes were nothing but regurgitated zombie attacks while people flee screaming for their lives. The next big issue is the narrow scope of people capable of countering the threat. We have a UN something something that has the authority to command helicopters and navy vessels and apparently can convince anyone in the world that Gerry Brad Pitt is a good guy that shouldn't be delayed in his efforts by simply stating his name into a satellite phone. This person later lacks the power to keep Gerry's family safe on the boat and demonstrates utter humility considering his rank when offers bed service to Gerry's family.As the story develops the audience becomes aware that Gerry is some kind of super duper ex military dude that is apparently the best in the world at all things. We're all hosed if Gerry doesn't deliver. He hooks up with another Rambo type girl in Israel I think. Point being all these elite military characters fail miserably at avoiding the one thing that attracts every zombie withing 100 miles making NOISE!! They literally bump kick fall shoot yell at every opportunity given attracting hoards of zombies in the process. I suppose this was necessary mechanic to zombie conflict but it certainly didn't compliment their supposed elite skills.The story is weak and the solution and family reunion are visible long before they should be which only strengthens the disappointment in the movie. Where's my refund?".

	schema:reviewBody "World War Z 2013  out of 4 Brad Pitt plays a U.N. worker who must leave his family behind and go search for a cause or cure for a zombie outbreak that is pretty much destroying every form of life. On his mission he must travel across the globe trying to see what might work in the human's defense of the zombies. I'll admit upfront that I haven't read the book that this film is based on so I can't comment on if it butchered the book or if the film got it right. That aspect of the conversation just doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that we've got an insanely high budget and yet they couldn't work out some sort of interesting story. For the most part we just see Brad Pitt going from one beautiful location to the next and we see that the once beautiful place is now full of zombies. Every once in a while Mr. Pitt has to walk through dark hallways and what really hurts the film is that these sequences just aren't scary. In fact I'm going to say it right out loud that there wasn't a single scary moment to be found in this picture and the entire disaster aspect of what was going on just didn't work for me. Never did I feel that the world was really coming to an end and this is a bigbudget that can't pull this off yet look at what someone like Romero did in no money. Another problem is that the zombies are all rather bland whether they're real effects or the majority of them CGI. They're not scary no creative and the lack of gore shouldn't be bashed because you don't need gore to be scary but at the same time when you have the violence offscreen it just makes the film seem rather childish. Pitt offers a nice performance but this is certainly far from his best. It was nice seeing David Morse and the rest of the supporting players are good as well. I don't know what was wrong with the final third of the movie where they had to go back and film a new one but what we got here just doesn't work as its too slow and boring. WORLD WAR Z sadly is delivered as a very disappointing movie no matter if you're familiar with the original source or not.".

First of all I might have enjoyed this movie if they had changed the name from World War Z to The Disease or Biters or Brad Pitt Vs. Dead People. WWZ implies that it was based on the book by Max Brooks. I'm quite convinced that the writer didn't even bother to read the book.SPOILERS The book was set on the basis that the WWZ had already happened and humanity was beginning to rebuild and overcome the virus worldwide. The author was responsible for going around the world interviewing a lot of people about how the war began and progressed in order to create an oral history of the tragedy.The film went backwards with characters having one lead and continuing back to find the origin. The book started in chronological order with a thirdworld doctor discussing the first outbreak in his village then progressed based on the individual stories told from the perspectives of people who survived. Everything that made the book great was completely ignored and the production company decided on spending a high budget on major CGI scenes and generic zombie effects as well as hiring Brad Pitt to attract an audience. And on top of all that the lack of zombie gore there was little to none giving me the impression of a very lowbudget zombie movie.In conclusion if you have never read the book enjoy looking at Brad Pitt and are impressed with CGI action then this movie may be for you. However if you are a fan of zombies at all then avoid this movie like you would a real zed. I almost want to compare it to WARM BODIES but I couldn't bring myself to see that one.".

Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography costumes art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine  the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine look out for her waist  it's absolutely tiny! who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing crying and feeling inspired.

	onyx:emotionText "I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography costumes art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine  the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine look out for her waist  it's absolutely tiny! who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing crying and feeling inspired. A great watch sure to win some major awards this year! 1010!";

And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn't traditional by any means but what he did worked. The cgi was not the best but it kind of created this fantastical other world while still being realistic and grounded. So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For example Jackman ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging which I thought was brilliant. There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However I do see why a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't a lot of impressive violence crazy camera shots etc. the things critics seem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story which it tells extremely well. The only thing I can point out because I saw it with my boyfriend who knows nothing about the story there are two or three slightly confusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But they are either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on. Anyways that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many many times and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it even more.".

The showing was introduced by producer Eric Fellner of Working Title who underlined the commercial challenge of making a film in which all the dialogue is sung and the themes are so political and praised director Tom Hooper The King's Speech for his insistence that every take was sung live.The two main characters are presented in the opening seconds of a sweeping introductory sequence the police inspector Javert Crowe and the prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean Jackman in postrevolutionary France. There follows over two and half hours with barely a spoken word which will not appeal to all cinemagoers but the production is a triumph with Cameron Mackintosh's musical opened up by dramatic shooting on Pinewood's brand new Richard Attenborough stage and some historic English locations. If Crowe and especially Jackman are excellent Hathaway  who lost 25 pounds and most of her hair for the role  is outstanding as the destitute Fantine and Cohen and Carter almost steal the show as the comical Thnardier innkeepers.I'm not sure how long it will take for Les Misrables to recoup its investment cash wise but it's going to win award after award and rightly so.".

	schema:reviewBody "The guiding ethic of any film adaptation of a legendary source must be Change as little as possible. Those in charge of Les Miz knew precisely what they were working with. A few songs are shortened a handful of lines altered and a few scenarios condensed or adapted to their original literary form but the whole remains gloriously and satisfyingly intact.The Work Song is set to the image of a hundred convicts battling a stormy sea to pull a listing ship into dry dockand only here does the film's liverecording ethic fall short as the music and voices lack the power to match the imagery seemingly washed out by the sea noise where the live musical would normally captivate from the first note.Neither of them theatrical belters Jackman and Crowe's performances feel subdued in the opening scene. But the film finds its gravitas the instant Colm Wilkinson appears as the Bishop of Digne and from that instant the next two and a half hours are nothing less than the repeated sliding of the viewer's soul up and down a finelyhoned blade.The ability to take closeups gives the film an intimacy that is unattainable on a Broadway stage and power numbers are sometimes reduced to a chilling whisper. Anne Hathaway destroys herself to bring Fantine to life and her incredible personal pain washes in waves from the screen. The tooth removal normally excised from the musical is even back from the bookthough modified in location. Confrontation is then viscerally set as a fullon closequarters sword fight.Film also allows a depth of scale that challenges the stage. The transition to At the End of the Day is a grim and powerful scramble through the slums of Paris shaking the screen with the palpable rage of a nation. Look Down is another tour de force while Do You Hear the People Sing emerges from a quiet elegiac call to arms that organically overtakes General Lamarque's funeral procession.Samantha Barks' ponine lights up in her every interaction with Marius and shots of her in the background of A Heart Full of Love are soulrending. But she suffers just enough tiny cuts that A Little Fall of Rain is not quite as arresting as it should be and the constant closeups amputate the power of a scene that should captivate not only through its intimacy but through the inactivity that washes across the entirety of a onceviolent stage.Russel Crowe's softvoiced Javert takes some getting used to and while it works more often than one might expect he sometimes seems to be singing with a sock in his mouthmost notably during One Day More where he seems to have been mixed in at a different volume level from the rest of the cast. Yet the cinematography of Stars is simple yet stunning and Javert's Suicide suffers nothing in this interpretation.M. Thnardier endures a few cuts most notably the truncation of Dog Eats Dog but Sacha Baron Cohen steals enough asides and chews enough scenery that his part hardly feels reduced.The background has been filled in with elements from the novel and those who have read Hugo's epic will appreciate nods to Fauchelevent and the PetitPicpus convent Gavroche's elephanthome Marius' grandfather and the tavern behind the barricade. There is even a quick cut to Gavroche when ponine is shot winking at their normally undisclosed sibling relationship.Even the finale remains perfectly and satisfyingly intact. The only challenge with a film that so precisely parallels its stage inspiration is resisting the necessity to deliver a standing ovation once the final note has been sung. If only they had found a way to incorporate a curtain call.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of the musical I have been waiting with anticipation for this movie release. I just got back from the Christmas eve 10pm showing of this movie and I must say that I am somewhat disappointed. There were some positives but I feel it could have been so much better.First the positives. There are some very strong performances here.Anne Hathaway's performance has already drawn critical acclaim so I won't dwell on it except to say that the acclaim is well deserved.Hugh Jackman's voice tone and interpretation of Jean Valjean is quite different from anyone before and I found myself drawn deeply to this Jean Valjean sympathizing with his every emotion. I thought he did a great job of switching between a rough gravelly tone to a more clean ringing falsetto depending on the emotions of the character. I do have a complaint about directorial cues on one of Jean Valjean's key numbers but more on that below.Eddie Redmayne as Marius gives a great performance. For the stage productions Marius has always been one of my least favorite characters always lacking depth with what I perceived as just immature blind infatuation for Cosette as his only emotion. In this movie Eddie really captured each moment his love for Cosette in the moonlight garden scene his determination and drive for revolution his remorse and anguish during Empty chairs at empty tables a real tourdeforce performance. I thought he was wonderful.Also the setlocationsscenerycostumesmake up really allow the audience to immerse into the story. I think this point is one of the greatest benefits a movie setting has over a stage production and this movie delivers on this front. From the beautiful country settings to the grime and grit of poverty in Montreuil and Paris there is a strong sense of realism that you can't get in stage production they did overdo it slightly in the sewer scene.Now on to the negatives.I have seen a few reviews complaining about the slow pace of the film. I thought the opposite. It felt kinda rushed. I know the stage production is 3 hours long but I wish they hadn't sacrificed the story and proper delivery to save on run time for the movie. Some of the scene transitions are rather abrupt and leaves a sense of this being an ensemble of songs rather than one flowing story. I'm not a purist in that I will complaint about every single change from the stage production but some of the cuts and omissions really hurt the flow of the story and leaves some key characters and relationships woefully underdeveloped. Having said that I do think one addition was brilliant the scene with Jean Valjean singing to a sleeping Cosette in the carriage as they leave the Thenardier's inn. It really gives a great insight into the change that Jean Valjean goes through and the bond that he forms with Cosette.Enjolras seems shuffled as a minor character which is too bad as Aaron Tveit played the part with great passion when given the chance. Even though fleeting Enjolras Grantaire and even Gavroche share some moments in the stage production that allows us to bond with these characters. I felt the movie marginalized each as their own without developing a bond between them.Eponine also seemed to be underdeveloped. I can't quite place it. The individual performances were very strong but On my own and A little fall of rain didn't quite have the same emotional impact that I thought it would. I think it was due to the lack of insight into the dynamic between Marius and Eponine. There was a lot of Eponine watching Marius fall in love with Cosette from a distance but only one instance that I can remember of Marius unknowingly hurting Eponine during their interaction. I can think of 3 or 4 such occurrences in the stage production and really sympathizing with Eponine each time it happened. Again subtle differences but it really detracted from the overall story for me.Also I didn't care for Hugh Jackman's rendition of and Tom Hooper's direction of Bring him home. In the stage production this song is very subdued with Jean Valjean singing in beautiful high falsetto while watching over a sleeping Marius. There is a beauty to its simpleness and it is almost like a glimpse into Valjean's mind as he silently sends a prayer up to God. This movie's interpretations is much more... dynamic. Hugh Jackman delivers with a stronger force as Valjean nervously walks around the 2nd story of a building looking down on a sleeping Marius at the barricade. Certainly a very different interpretation and it didn't work for me.One last bit of negative was the casting of Russell Crowe as Javert. I am a fan of Russell Crowe and while he is a great fit for the look and persona of Javert I just did not feel he fit the vocal demands of the character. It prevented me from empathizing with Javert my favorite character from the stage production.With as much anticipation as I had going in I'm afraid it was a bit of a disappointment. I really wanted to like this but came away thinking of what could have been. Certainly a must see for all fans of the musical but it is a shame that this movie will be the sole judgement of Les Mis for millions of viewers who may never have a chance to see the stage production.".

And let me tell you Les Mis did not disappoint! From the very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music I was hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie I was riveted.Singing Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL but was excellent in Stars and Javert's Soliloquy. Hugh Jackman too had his weak moments...but really wowed during Who am I? and Bring Him Home. Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance followed closely by Samantha Barks.Acting A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again Anne Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks Eddie Redmayne Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen were the much needed and absolutely hilarious comedic relief. Production One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming makeup hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people weren't made to be pretty as Hollywood often does thankfully the actors' teeth were not left moviestar white.Overall one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times through the whole film and the finale completely RUINED me. I was sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended walking through the theatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!".

Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance followed closely by Samantha Barks.Acting A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again Anne Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks Eddie Redmayne Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen were the much needed and absolutely hilarious comedic relief. Production One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming makeup hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people weren't made to be pretty as Hollywood often does thankfully the actors' teeth were not left moviestar white.Overall one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times through the whole film and the finale completely RUINED me. I was sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended walking through the theatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!";

	schema:reviewBody "Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no buildup no backstory no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask okay how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax plot twist after plot twist tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? If you can watch this film without crying I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat not just because I smell good. The audience at the 1040 a.m. matine  the theater was packed  applauded at the end and was very slow to leave the theater even as the closing credits rolled. Typical of big fat nineteenthcentury novels there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie but that was a good thing. The human suffering on screen was overwhelming suicide enslavement exploitation of living humans' body parts prostitution disease spite malice child abuse starvation sadism a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself This is only a movie even as tears streamed down my cheeks. Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave. They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's Barge Haulers on the Volga. Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman Javert. They spar throughout the film as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises  you get the idea. A story this big this broad and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of Les Miserables. I loved him. Anne Hathaway Eddie Redmayne Samantha Barks Helena Bonham Carter Sacha Baron Cohen  they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire some ice some power some insight to Javert the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive. I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest emulating Jesus is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. Les Miserable is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up but then the poor fail their own putative saviors and allow them to be massacred alone. Javert representing law and order is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy. I think Les Miserables is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When Les Miserable was a stage play tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella in Jean Valjean no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But along with millions of others I saw my own struggles in Valjean and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on I can too! I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones I dreamed a dream and Do you hear the people sing? All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film as a complete Les Mis virgin having no idea as to the storyline and having never seen any previous production nor having read the novel.But I enjoy musicals both in the theatre and film versions and I went with an open mind and looking forward to seeing something a little different from the norm. Sadly within the first few minutes I knew I'd made a mistake and this has become one of my most hated films of all time.Indeed I always rate films but rarely review them but I just had to get this off my chest. Particularly because so many reviews seem to be gushing about its brilliance and although I'm fully prepared to admit that my views are in the minority I think it's important to air them if only in the interest of balance and representation.It didn't take long to realise that every single word of the dialogue was to be 'sung'. I say 'sung' rather than sung because it wasn't what I could really refer to as singing. Just because one woooooord of any given liiiiiine is extended like thiiiiiis does not in my mind make it 'singing'. In fact if it weren't for the extended words in nearly every sentence the film would likely have been at least thirty minutes shorter.The lack of spoken dialogue really detracted from many of the scenes. When even the most mundane of sentences has to be delivered in such a way it becomes grating. I wouldn't have been at all surprised for someone to bellow out pass the saaaaaalt. It was just awful. And the repetition! I understand that chords and themes repeat throughout musicals often linking similarities between scenes and concepts and characters. It isn't that I don't understand that. But this was too much. It was as though the same tones and flow were repeated every four lines. Every. Four. Lines. With the third or fourth wooooooords extended. Every. Single Time.I'm getting wound up reliving the moment and I've waited till the following morning before doing this review in case my opinion mellowed. It hasn't.And the duration of the film only served to make it worse. Occasionally the film would announce via onscreen text that it was now 8 years later or whatever. And I felt as though I'd been there for that entire time. In fact it felt like longer.It became one of those films which leaves you feeling physically drained from the effort of battling through it. It was that bad. It felt like I've undergone a test of endurance and although I got through it it wasn't without mental scarring!Beyond the monotony repetition and delivery there was the story which perhaps as I had no prior knowledge of the source was nonsensical. People falling in love within a single glance which then goes on to motivate someone else to endure warfare to carry the person halfdead? Chasing someone for what 17 years because of breaking parole for a loaf of bread which itself warranted a previous 19 years of suffering? Only to then throw yourself to your death?Am I meant to believe these characters? Am I meant to care about them?Anne Hathaway's deterioration from factory worker to cropped and toothless prostitute was compacted into all of 42 seconds so when it came to her performance of I Dreamed A Dream which was a rare highlight in the film its impact was stunted because why should we care about this woman? She's only just been introduced to us and we know nothing about her presumably because everyoooooone is too busy singing like thiiiiiiiis instead of actually making us caaaaaaare.Yet apparently Hugh Jackman cares so much about her that he then devotes his entire life to her child? It was mentioned at the very beginning that he has a sister and a nephew of his own why not take care of them? Or were they dead as he went to a cross in the ground after being paroled but if that's the case it wasn't explained well.A film should be able to stand on its own two feet and not require its audience to have read the book or seen the musical. The Harry Potter books far exceed the movies yet people can enjoy the movies on their own merit. Not so with Les Mis.And the casting was bizarre as well. I don't understand why the casting was given to Hollywood actors instead of singers. Borat? Really?? And accents were flying all over the place. Early in the film when Hugh Jackman is in the church he suddenly sounds as though he's stepped off the first boat from Ireland and half of the cast of jumped straight out of a Mary Poppins chalk drawing!I can't find a single redeeming feature to mention about this film. Miscast. Rubbish sets most of it looking like obvious CGI. Repetitive 'singing'. No spoken dialogue. Nonsensical plot. Ridiculous pacing. No character development or involvement. Beyond doubt one of the worst films I have ever watched and I would sooner have my teeth extracted by a French street urchin than ever have to endure this horror again.".

	schema:headline " The definitive Les Miserables movie experience!";
	schema:reviewBody "As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.As far as the acting and music is concerned I can find very little to fault. Russel Crowe was the weakest of the lot as I just didn't find his voice to be up to the task of singing some of Javert's songs Stars immediately springs to mind. Hugh Jackman Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were all especially good. The intense emotions their characters experience throughout the story are perfectly performed.This naturally leads to a critique of the music. Anyone familiar with the Broadway show will undoubtedly find themselves joyously mouthing along to the familiar lyrics and might be surprised at a couple of brand new songs written specifically for the movie. Just as in the show the music is brilliant and meshes wonderfully with the story.One of the biggest treats however were the sets and special effects. The beauty and squalor of 19th century Paris was showcased magnificently and it really allowed you to become engrossed in story.This is a movie that both fans of the novel as well as fans of the musical can both fall in love with since even though there are some deviations from the novel this is still the closest a film version has ever come to being completely faithful to the book. Additionally this movie is a perfect chance for those who have never read the book or haven't heard of or had a chance to see the Broadway show. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. My only warning is to limit your fluid intake since at 2.5 hours your chance of encountering an overflowing bladder is a very real danger.".

	schema:headline " A superb film version of the beloved musical";
	schema:reviewBody "If you don't like musicals or are not a fan of the throughsung style skip this movie. I will only irritate you much like bombastic action films torture me.But if you're a fan of Les Miserables or musicals in general then you're in for a treat.Many people have criticized Tom Hooper's direction. For me I just think these people have no idea what Hooper is doing and do not realize the effects of his work with the help of Danny Cohen's marvelous cinematography. The Dutch angles work very well especially during the Lovely Ladies sequences  Hooper skillfully created a surrealistic nightmarish Paris for Fantine and the audience making us feel queasy and uncomfortable and horrified in some ways for Fantine. We have to realize that this is not a videotaped version of the stage play or concert. This is a movie. Hooper said that he wanted to create an extremeheightened realism that is on the verge of being surrealistic. I for one applaud his choice and I think it works beautifully for the movie.Same with the closeups. They created the kind of intimacy you won't get on stage and also provided the opportunities for the actors to do their work. The result is amazingly personal intense. Obviously it works better for some actors than others that's why we're thinking of giving Anne Hathaway the Oscar not Amanda Seyfried but over all it's a great cinematic choice  together with live recording... it's emotionally powerful.I do have some gripes certain handheld camera shots could have been avoided or stabilized  there is really no need for them. The barricade scenes can be somewhat chaotic and rushed. Unfortunately Hooper has to work in the confine of the musical structure and the story is already almost 3 hours long. Also they had to cut or shorten some songs to fit the time frame  to those who have seen the show 30 times it could be unsettling.The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman carries most of the movie with dignity and amazing versatility. He may not be the best singer in the world to play Valjean but he IS Valjean on screen  his voice is characterized to fit Valjean perfectly. His What Have I Done is a revelation of what his songanddance man who is best known for Wolverine can do.Anne Hathaway deserves all the accolades she is getting. Her I Dream a Dream will become the de facto performance for those who will play Fantine in the future.Eddie Redmayne is a surprise  I know the actor can act but I had no idea that he could sing so well. And that he could sing and act at the same time with such grace and charm. It's not an easy thing to accomplish.Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit have done Les Miserables on stage before and they are excellent in the film. Many stage actors can't transition to the screen but these two have succeeded with a lot hard work no doubt.Amanda Seyfried is one of the weakest links in the movie. She is of course lovely as the adult Cosette Isabelle Allen is excellent as young Cosette even though the part is underwritten in the film or on stage. Her singing voice is okay but not as strong as expected and I find her performance somewhat one dimensional. But she and Redmayne have great chemistry together and that's a good thing.Russell Crowe also is the weak link. He is a good actor and I think he does his best with this role. But his rockopera voice is jarringly different from the rest and he just stands out like a sore thumb. However in the course of the movie he grew on me. In his final scenes I can see the great acting it's all in the eyes people!. So while I can't say he's the best Javert ever I'll give him a pass.The supporting cast and background actors are all excellent.The production is rich and wonderful with great sets great cinematography great costumes. Is it perfect? No. I haven't seen one single film this year that is perfect. I don't think that exists. At the end of the day pun intended Les Miserables is all about the music the characters and the emotions and this film delivers. I expect many award nominations for this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you don't like musicals or are not a fan of the throughsung style skip this movie. I will only irritate you much like bombastic action films torture me.But if you're a fan of Les Miserables or musicals in general then you're in for a treat.Many people have criticized Tom Hooper's direction. For me I just think these people have no idea what Hooper is doing and do not realize the effects of his work with the help of Danny Cohen's marvelous cinematography. The Dutch angles work very well especially during the Lovely Ladies sequences  Hooper skillfully created a surrealistic nightmarish Paris for Fantine and the audience making us feel queasy and uncomfortable and horrified in some ways for Fantine. We have to realize that this is not a videotaped version of the stage play or concert. This is a movie. Hooper said that he wanted to create an extremeheightened realism that is on the verge of being surrealistic. I for one applaud his choice and I think it works beautifully for the movie.Same with the closeups. They created the kind of intimacy you won't get on stage and also provided the opportunities for the actors to do their work. The result is amazingly personal intense. Obviously it works better for some actors than others that's why we're thinking of giving Anne Hathaway the Oscar not Amanda Seyfried but over all it's a great cinematic choice  together with live recording... it's emotionally powerful.I do have some gripes certain handheld camera shots could have been avoided or stabilized  there is really no need for them. The barricade scenes can be somewhat chaotic and rushed. Unfortunately Hooper has to work in the confine of the musical structure and the story is already almost 3 hours long. Also they had to cut or shorten some songs to fit the time frame  to those who have seen the show 30 times it could be unsettling.The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman carries most of the movie with dignity and amazing versatility. He may not be the best singer in the world to play Valjean but he IS Valjean on screen  his voice is characterized to fit Valjean perfectly. His What Have I Done is a revelation of what his songanddance man who is best known for Wolverine can do.Anne Hathaway deserves all the accolades she is getting. Her I Dream a Dream will become the de facto performance for those who will play Fantine in the future.Eddie Redmayne is a surprise  I know the actor can act but I had no idea that he could sing so well. And that he could sing and act at the same time with such grace and charm. It's not an easy thing to accomplish.Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit have done Les Miserables on stage before and they are excellent in the film. Many stage actors can't transition to the screen but these two have succeeded with a lot hard work no doubt.Amanda Seyfried is one of the weakest links in the movie.

I do not remember the last time that an audiovisual experience inflicted me with so much pain both mentally and physically. I think my theatre seat still has indentations from me clutching the chair frantically throughout the movie. I felt like the Clockwork Orange protagonist when he's tied down to a chair and fed those nauseating stimuli the main difference being that he got to listen to some quality music in the process. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of hubris in my time.The review by MouthyMatthew summarises it the best. Over the top. Chords and themes excruciatingly repetitive How possibly wouldn't they be? I mean every line in a 159 minute movie has been sung down to the most banal mundane statement you can imagine.. The movie successfully drains your life energy as it progresses since you have to employ a supernatural effort to stick with the characters' lines. What would be a series of seemingly important storyline details ends up receiving a very cursory treatment. For instance Fantine's tragic life trajectory. Furthermore why on earth would they hire Hollywood bigshots with a singing talent of a sexually frustrated walrus to play these parts?? And the accents oh for the love of god. What the hell? Overall impression laughably sappy yet unconvincing and above all insufferable.In my humble opinion I think people should not see this movie if they have not been exposed to the story earlier by reading the book or seeing a good musical production of it. I truly hate that this will be my first impression of both the story and the characters the one that I will always be stuck with.".

That's not the case with this big horrible mess.In addition to being one of the most boring movies ever made there is very little to like beside some sets and costumes and the fact that Hugh Jackman can hold a note for almost a minute. Other than that Hathaway overacts Crowe looks disturbed most of the film and appears to be missing something. I can't even find words to describe the emotions I discovered with Helena and Sasha. They finally met their match. For years these two have survived a few cinematic bombs but this movie is the equivalent of the Black Plague... Very little is left standing.With a camera that seems to be on some type of epileptic seizure a very truncated story line and one of the most incredibly unappealing and forgettable song scores of the last hundred years it's hard to enjoy something that calls itself a musical but doesn't quite have anything remotely close to a melody. For more than two hours one hears something akin to the scratching of nails on a blackboard and why does everyone wear so much rouge? A few years ago the director gathered some of the best British and Australian talent and won a Best Picture Oscar with a very weak film. This type the trick doesn't work because the material and the direction are outstandingly weak.If the musical genre doesn't suffer a painful death after this nothing will be able to kill it. If Jackman's character got 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread I can't even imagine what a judge would give the producers and directors for creating this tuneless torture. Fantine was lucky to meet her maker in the first 20 minutes... We had to endure 2.5 hours of this horrible experience.".

This is not a critique of the actors or their singing but of the director's choice to not guide them toward performances scaled for the shots. There's a difference between belting out a musical showtune to the back row or coming in on a close up to capture the moment which requires a quieter more internal thought. And if you're going to play those moments very wide or very close hone the performance to suit the choice. Too often the performance is out of sync with the shot.Next focus. In today's world of monitors DITs and playback there is no excuse for so much of this film to be out of focus. I don't care if your depth of field is two millimeters. Go back and get it right or pump some more light on the subject and find a depth of field and lens your AC is comfortable with.Then there are creative choices like playing Lovely Ladies strictly for the ugliness of the nineteenth century gutter it's set in and Master of the House with so little energy that not even SB Cohen can elevate it.I am not sure what film all those ten star reviews on this IMDb page are for. I can only hope that they were written by people who loved the musical and lived in hope that the film would live up to its legacy but haven't seen it yet.As for me I have seen it and am bitterly disappointed.".

And she's great and she deserved the Oscar but we all who where aware of the story of les mis knew that the role was going to win the actress best supporting no matter who it was or how good she played it.I really wanted to like this film and I tried pretty hard but considering a movie this boring goes on for an unforgiving 160 minutes I just couldn't stop pleading for the movie to end.

Russell Crowe his acting is splendid. His singing not so much but the more I hear his voice the more I begin to like! Eddie Raymane he's the big surprise for me. He ails every note as our young boy searching for love. Amanda Seyfried though she wasn't in much her voice was mouth droppingly beautiful. Cohen and Bonham Carter hilarious! Nothing else to say. Samantha Barks she has the best voice and has amazing talent for someone unknown to the film world. For people to know... Les Miserables is 100 singing s you've been warned. Yes some might not like it and some will love it! For me I loved it. It was a tear jerking heart racing at times picture with amazing sets. Brilliant Acting also! Anne Hathaway is the high point of the movie. It starts high then goes amazing to dull and boring to comic relief to romance to gut wrenching action!

Sorry for the money.I do not know if my expectations are too high being myself a musician but I sort of think that what a musical is all about is singing. Acting is important costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takes are nice too. However hence the word MUSICal it's all about music and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main two actors Jackman and Craw are undoubtedly very good actors but have no idea how to sing They are incapable of singing a straight note and it is obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably at acting school as usual with these cases a month's coaching before the shooting is not enough  all professional e.g. Broadway singers who suffer for years are not stupid they do it for a reason. Had they not been famous everyone would laugh.Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some proper cast for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow.If one can tolerate the insufferable singing I admit that the rest is excellent. The acting is superb the takes breathtaking the costumes and sets fantastic and the emotions overwhelming. If....I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to the rest. However music is in my opinion half the job and in this case half a job very badly done.".

Acting is important costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takes are nice too. However hence the word MUSICal it's all about music and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main two actors Jackman and Craw are undoubtedly very good actors but have no idea how to sing They are incapable of singing a straight note and it is obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably at acting school as usual with these cases a month's coaching before the shooting is not enough  all professional e.g. Broadway singers who suffer for years are not stupid they do it for a reason. Had they not been famous everyone would laugh.Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some proper cast for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow.If one can tolerate the insufferable singing I admit that the rest is excellent. The acting is superb the takes breathtaking the costumes and sets fantastic and the emotions overwhelming. If....I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to the rest. However music is in my opinion half the job and in this case half a job very badly done.";

The ONLY really good performance in this movie was the child who by the way comes from the London Stage production of Oliver. It showed. He could sing. He had talent. Otherwise this was an assembly of basically TV actors and a couple rock star types. The real tragedy of this movie is that the people who could have done it justice those with musical stage capability never got the chance to make the kind of money Hugh Jackman et. al pulled down for this.The other terrible thing was the closeups. A few would have been artistically interesting.

Well this film has that quality in spades. It drones on and on and on and on and on....relentlessly. I came out physically drained.Its interesting to note that many of the good reviews this has received are from Les Mis nutjobs who stalk the production like emotional hobbits. Ignore them they are lying through their teeth. I cried all the way through...I cried in the car park...are these the thoughts of a balanced grownup I ask you? I would say though that I suspect it makes an OK stage show. I've seen excerpts and it gets by just. But there are probably only two OK tunes in the whole piece the rest are the stage equivalent of a whistling milkman...that is to say tuneless and unidentifiable.Watching Crowe sing in this is worse than cringeinducing his voice is just awful. Jackman is far far worse. The girls get by vocally  just.And thats the sad thing because its a talented cast and the acting element of it is actually extremely good. Had it been a film of Victor Hugo's book it would have been absolutely outstanding..........but they tried to sing and it all went down the toilet. I firmly believe that had they used proper singers instead of these amdram luvvies it might have stood a chance. It is after all supposed to be a musical not a film with actors trying and failing to carry a tune although I use that term in the loosest sense here.You should go and see it even if only to share my pain but take a book to read because at nearly three hours its two hours too long IMNVHO.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first time that I have actually seen this story and to put it bluntly it simply blew my mind right to the point that as I am writing this I am listening to the songs on YouTube. The one thing that unfortunately drags this particular movie down and pretty much everything else about this film is absolutely spectacular is Sacha Baron Cohen. Every scene in which he was in was painful and maybe that is still a hangover from Borat and as far as I am concerned he completely butchered 'Master of the House' though it was redeemed with 'oohh Santa!' if you have seen the film you will know what I mean.Basically the story is about grace and how one man responds to grace. Many times I have heard pastors use this story to describe grace and they namely refer to the scene where the bishop responds to Valjean's theft of the silverware with the statement that it was gift and the only problem was that he left too early because he forgot to take the candle sticks. If it be only that scene that made this story stand out then that would be enough but it goes much further because the whole theme of the story is about how Valjean responds to this act of grace in that he completely turns his life around and becomes a well respected citizen.Still believe it or not there is even more. This story is almost Shakespearian in scope in that there are at least three or four plots intermeshed into the story with the main plot being the redemption of Valjean. For instance we have a love story a story of self sacrifice an exploration of the life of the peasant in early 19th century France a failed revolution and of course the dogged pursuit of Valjean by his nemesis Javert.I remember making a comment about Cohen on a facebook entry and a friend of mine responded by making a snide comment about Russell Crowe singing and maybe that tarnished the film a bit but after seeing it I don't think Crowe did a bad job at all and if fact I think he took up the challenge and succeeded with flying colours. In fact by the end of the movie I had no problem with Russell Crowe playing a major role at all. As for Hugh 'Wolverine show us your claws' Jackman well we all know that he can sing and that he has starred in musicals previously and as the main character he was absolutely superb.".

Rachel Miner is an amazing actress and once again proves that she is good in anything no matter how big the budget or how low the budget she is a true gem to watch.Since I cant imagine any of you not ever knowing anything about Roswell or Area 51 this movie would probably make no sense if you don't and it does a good job in quenching your appetite for the real unknown and restricted Area 51 showing you what could be found there and the positives and negatives of harboring alien life forms there.There is one part that you will instantly think of the movie Aliens in when an alien comes face to face with military personnel however it no where near resembles the Alien in front of Sigourney Weaver and this should make you chuckle.From a makeup artistry standpoint the aliens are not horribly made they just are not scary when they are shown of course this is an opinion and not fact. There are a few different alien types in this movie one that resembles an octopus one that resembles the clichd 1950's alien from the Roswell photo an alien that resembles a man covered in veins and again something from the movie Critters. The special effects makeup team probably did the best they could with their budget and went from there. The blood and gore ripped body parts and blood splatter was very realistic looking and good job to the design team.People LOVE to hate on movies and rip them apart. However if you give this a chance and see it for what it is a movie that entertains then you will like it. Don't hate it based on someone else hating it. Form your own opinion.All in all this movie is entertaining and a fun watch. It cannot be taken seriously like you could take Aliens or War of the Worlds seriously it is out of that league price rangebudget its a completely different movie but it is what it is and it deserves a chance while it may not be the best thing you've ever seen it certainly wont be the worst movie you have ever seen either and if you are a fan of Gore this does have a lot of that.".

Of course I recognize all of the bad aspects of this movie and all of its plot holes and weaknesses but quite frankly it never took away any of the fun I had with watching this movie.It's a movie that really 'borrows' heavily from other better known genre movies most notably Alien and The Thing. But I'm even willing to forgive the movie for doing so since it works within the context of the movie.The movie does feature some pretty good creature design. All of the aliens are pretty cool and monstrously dangerous looking ones. Definitely not something cheap looking like a guy in a rubber suit while if of course still is a guy in a rubber suit but that is besides the point.Pretty good and enjoyable for what it is.610 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Despite their endless need to release less than mediocre TV movies upon the world then the occasional gem pops out from their production line. And 51 is just one of those rare occasions.We are all familiar with the story behind Roswell the crash of 1947 and the secret military base known as Area 51 right? Right! Then you are already up to speed with the base story of 51. A group of reporters are allowed onto the otherwise restricted Area 51 grounds for a tour and to tell the story when something goes awry. Alien lifeforms escape captivity and threaten all within the Area 51 base. And the story is a fastpaced story with lots of action and some suspense as well.The aliens themselves were actually not too badly made though there was a bit too much resemblance to the aliens from the Alien franchise movies in regards with their tail and such. But other than that then the aliens actually looked cool. There was sort of a mixture between alien and pumpkinhead going on. As for the morpher shapeshifter well the makeup and effects were good enough. But for me personally then I wasn't too keen on the idea that he looked like a featureless human with no skin. The concept of 'patient zero' was cool though.As for the cast in 51 well being a TV movie and all there were no major Hollywood blockbuster names but there were some familiar faces from the TV though such as Jason London playing Aaron Schumacher John Shea playing Sam Whitaker and a couple more. The people in the movie were doing a fair enough job with their roles but the movie was carried by Jason London in all fairness.I was pleasantly surprised by 51 and being interested in the whole Roswell and Area 51 thing this movie was a nice addition to the subject. It proved to be entertaining and exciting so thumbs up for this SyFy movie.".

However from the get go I knew I was in for a good serving of high definition amateur hour. The news anchorwoman scene which served as the film's opening just didn't look right  neither did a similar scene which served as the film's conclusion. The acting in most scenes is a little dodgy although much of the blame must be attributed to the lackluster script  lack of finesse in the editing department. By poor editing I mean there should have been more closeups  camera angles. Still though it could have been worse. What I did like about this film were the creature effects. Also for those interested in lashings of blood  gore there were sufficient quantities of both. And to be truthful it was actually quite amusing watching the actors labor like troopers through some of the weaker scenes. In conclusion don't watch this film if you're expecting something great. If however you're like me  just can't resist a horror flick even with a guaranteed cheese factor knock yourself out.".

When this one gets going with the creature on the loose running throughout the military base is when it really gets the most out of this one with the fact of really generating the absolutely enjoyable stalking and hunting scenes throughout the midpoint in here. There's a big sense of familiarity with them using the motion tracker devices and the crawling around corners pointing guns off into the distance while the curved spiny tail of the creature pokes through the chest of the intended victim yet the highenergy action and creepy situations this enters into during these sequences more than makes up for some of those minor issues throughout this part as the film. There's some even more fun to be had from the big action confrontations here along the way with the group going after the deformed creature throughout the upper stages of the base where it really begins picking off the remaining soldiers which allows some great gore and action into the mix along with the rather enjoyable fun of the creature's makeup and costume. While these here give this one a fun time this one does suffer somewhat when it gets to the rather bland scifi leanings in the first half. The scenes of the group going around the base with blas history lessons that don't mean anything to anyone really makes this struggle to get going and by also showing the different gadgets and special tools throughout here that showcase the extraterrestrial powers of the creatures here this scifi tone in here makes for a rather disjointed time. The aliens battling each other as well isn't all that impressive with them just holding their hands out which looks silly and stupid. Along with the minor familiarity in several scenes these here hold this one down.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language.".

Horror ensues when a few aliens imprisoned in the hidden underground complex attempt an escape.The tone is mostly serious but with a slight campy vibe in the first act. The plot is akin to Aliens 1979 except on a TV budget and taking place at a desert military facility. Three kinds of aliens are included an interesting SuperAdaptoidlike one a wickedmonster type featuring child and mother Lady Death and a smaller kindly one with psychic powers. All three are pretty well done for a TV movie. Unfortunately the group of reporters is thoroughly dull the actors are serviceable but their characters as written are forgettable. The only character I found interesting was Sgt. Hanna played by petite cutie Rachel Miner.Overall the proceedings are kinda Meh but not without some interesting points.THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in the studio in Louisiana combined with some desert locations I don't know where though.

I wouldn't quite dwell on any characters here though as halfway through their tour the aliens escape and that's when the fun begins.The story might be generic but at least there's plenty of gore to keep you awake. Folks are torn to bits shot have their faces torn off and even have their heads stamped on so the film has that going for it. It's always quite fast paced so it'll do as a not bad time waster.

I even lost interest in finding the film funny because of how poorly made it was. Shocking effects nothing special about them and painful script and storyline. I've seen some poor films in my time and this is certainly making the top ten list.I understand that with a limited budget no where near the 1m estimate I'm sure scifi can be a difficult genre to create however less would've certainly been more here. Leave the audience in suspense a little rather than showing us the aliens straight up. By far one of the most interesting parts was seeing a keyboard typing without any hands present clearly controlled by an alien mind. This enigma grasped my attention for a whole minute! When you see TNT written on the side of a box supposedly produced by the US Army you loose all credibility in my opinion. Teacher's comments Must try harder. Much much harder.".

Not even a B movie but if the movie is really made with a budget of 1M it's very well made. The scenes are pretty realistic and you get a sense that you are in a military installation.Bruce Boxlaitner was a right pick for the lead role. He was able to carry the story.

The Aliens are neat and It has a couple good plot twists. I wouldn't call it a true horror movie but more of an Action movie with some solid SciFiHorror incorporated. Greatest BMovie of all time? Not by a long shot. Fun SciFi Alien based BMovie? Yep.It's uneven at parts and sometime the military seems a little helpless but when you step back a look at it as a whole It's not to Shabby.".

	schema:reviewBody "'51' Two Stars Out of Five Another SyFy network entry in this year's 'After Dark Originals' apparently 'After Dark Films' and the SyFy network joined forces this year in producing a couple of films allowing 'After Dark Films' to release the movie in theaters as part of their 'Horrorfest' series and SyFy to release it as well as an original TV movie. I hate SyFy network's original films I think they're some of the worst movies being made presently but I've always enjoyed the 'After Dark Films' series to varying degrees some are stinkers but most are at least somewhat interesting and entertaining. The two films coproduced with SyFy network this year are undoubtedly some of the worst that 'After Dark' has had to offer. With that said though '51' is one of the better SyFy network films I've ever seen. It's still a horrible movie but for SyFy network it's a step in the right direction.The film is set at Area 51 when due to public pressure the government has decided to allow select members of the press tour their site. A veteran news reporter known as Sam Whitaker John Shea and a young up and coming journalist and blog writer named Claire Fallon Vanessa Branch as well as their cameramen are the selected guests allowed in to Area 51. Col. Martin Bruce Boxleitner leads them on their tour with instructions of not letting them see anything of real importance or vital security especially the alien beings living there down below. Martin does a good job of leading the press on until all Hell breaks looks when one of the base's alien inhabitants decides to break free and save his fellow species.The acting writing and directing are all excessively cheesy and goofball. The film was made on a budget of less than 1 million so the cast and visual effects are of course lacking you'd think there'd be a much larger number of people working for such a high security military base rather than just a couple dozen. It does kind of have fun with itself though and it could have been a cool 50's like 'B' creature feature but that would be too big a compliment for this. It's aimed in that direction but it definitely falls a little short. It's not as awful as you might expect from SyFy but it's definitely nothing worth wasting time on either.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vyhQaTxuL7SQ".

	schema:headline " This is Korean cinema at its very best an edgeofyourseat thriller that brings you into the demented psychologies of seemingly ordinary individuals in everyday life";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest Korean actionthriller to hit theatres in Singapore 'Confession of Murder' is a gem of a film that can be compared to the likes of 'Old Boy' and 'Memories of Murder'.At the heart of this movie is the tale of Detective Choi whose quest is to capture the one thing that evades him. It's a very human resolve and one that is particularly relatable to the people of our time. We're not all cops searching for a suspect but very much like Detective Choi we have that one answer that we seek our entire lives and work hard to find out. The prevalence and influence of the media plastic surgery as well as blind devotion to a public figure have all been gracefully written into the script and so surrounding that story is a context so rooted in reality that it could very well be our own daily lives.The performances in this film are truly commendable particularly those of the stuntmen for the deadly accurate execution of the stunts. In particular the main actors brilliantly brought in the subtle aspects of their characters in order to bring humanity to a largerthan life drama effectively giving a hook for the audience to relate to the movie on a deeper level.There is also dark humor in the movie which brings some levity into an otherwise dark world that the audience becomes immersed in. One almost feels guilty for laughing which is a testament to the irony of the humor. What makes the situation on screen so humorous is how exceedingly close it is to what would happen if such a thing were to take place in reallife. Such a thing is almost never portrayed in films for the sake of cinematic impact but by doing the opposite 'Confession of Murder' turns itself into almost a satire and criticism of popular culture.This is one film that defines 'order in chaos' and does so with a great deal of style. The makers of it have taken a complex plot and planned it out with such precision that even to the nonKorean speaking viewer the story being told is clear and concise. There is no beating around the bush with this film. The pacing is just right such that Confession of Murder never loses the audience's attention and even at the most tumultuous times of this film such as one of the many fastpaced dialogue exchanges details are never lost. Even the action sequences have been tightlychoreographed in order to mould into the complex camerawork and it shows on screen as a beautiful and graceful wedding of skills from both cast and crew. The twist at the end is also a reminder of what great cinema is and is capable of doing i.e. shocking the audience by leaving out one aspect of the story and then revealing it at the end only to change the audience's entire perspective of what has happened all along. It is making the audience feel like they should have known better. It also proves the uncomfortable truth that we are capable of being fooled and that reality as we perceive it is often imperfect.In this film the peripeteia then leads to a startling climax which fulfils the purpose of every character in this film before moving down into a resolution which leaves no loose ends untied. Indeed 'Confession of Murder' is a film indeed worth watching and a tale highly relevant to our celebrityobsessed times.".

We're not all cops searching for a suspect but very much like Detective Choi we have that one answer that we seek our entire lives and work hard to find out. The prevalence and influence of the media plastic surgery as well as blind devotion to a public figure have all been gracefully written into the script and so surrounding that story is a context so rooted in reality that it could very well be our own daily lives.The performances in this film are truly commendable particularly those of the stuntmen for the deadly accurate execution of the stunts. In particular the main actors brilliantly brought in the subtle aspects of their characters in order to bring humanity to a largerthan life drama effectively giving a hook for the audience to relate to the movie on a deeper level.There is also dark humor in the movie which brings some levity into an otherwise dark world that the audience becomes immersed in. One almost feels guilty for laughing which is a testament to the irony of the humor. What makes the situation on screen so humorous is how exceedingly close it is to what would happen if such a thing were to take place in reallife. Such a thing is almost never portrayed in films for the sake of cinematic impact but by doing the opposite 'Confession of Murder' turns itself into almost a satire and criticism of popular culture.This is one film that defines 'order in chaos' and does so with a great deal of style. The makers of it have taken a complex plot and planned it out with such precision that even to the nonKorean speaking viewer the story being told is clear and concise. There is no beating around the bush with this film. The pacing is just right such that Confession of Murder never loses the audience's attention and even at the most tumultuous times of this film such as one of the many fastpaced dialogue exchanges details are never lost. Even the action sequences have been tightlychoreographed in order to mould into the complex camerawork and it shows on screen as a beautiful and graceful wedding of skills from both cast and crew. The twist at the end is also a reminder of what great cinema is and is capable of doing i.e. shocking the audience by leaving out one aspect of the story and then revealing it at the end only to change the audience's entire perspective of what has happened all along. It is making the audience feel like they should have known better. It also proves the uncomfortable truth that we are capable of being fooled and that reality as we perceive it is often imperfect.In this film the peripeteia then leads to a startling climax which fulfils the purpose of every character in this film before moving down into a resolution which leaves no loose ends untied. Indeed 'Confession of Murder' is a film indeed worth watching and a tale highly relevant to our celebrityobsessed times.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are no lack of examples when it comes to very sterling specimens of solid psychological crime thrillers to come out of South Korean cinema in recent years and it's no different that Confession of Murder also belongs up there with one of the best the country has to offer in the genre. Written and directed by Jung ByoungGil whose earlier film was the documentary Action Boys he has shown that he's not all just about action but has the knack in crafting a taut thriller with its fair share of twists turns and more importantly providing it with such a tormented soul that will allow you to feel sympathetic for the victims involved and root for retribution on the culprit. If that can be found out.At first glance the story seems simple enough with Detective Choi HyungGoo Jung Jae Young losing his opportunity to nab a masked serial killer who had claimed more than 10 victims in a random killing spree with that obsession spiralling his life downwards with the ultimate insult added to injury when his mouth got slit by the killer's knife leaving a deep scar he bears as a symbol to his failure. Fast forward to some 15 years and with the Statute of Limitations expired Lee DooSuk Park SiHoo comes out in the open to admit he is the killer responsible for the spate of deaths and now releasing a book as a memoir and confession to his dastardly deeds. A little bit of an artistic license here I believe since the Statute of Limitations is only for civil cases and not criminal ones like this but let's not quibble and accept that it does pose an intriguing proposition something like double jeopardy.So begins the cat and mouse chase of trying to prove or disprove that Lee was indeed that man more than a decade ago who had shattered the lives of many family members with his killings and now arrogantly living the high life of a celebrity no thanks to celebrity culture that we cannot understand fully where cult followings grow out of the most bizarre of situations and those who are good looking are automatically assumed improbable to doing the most wicked of deeds. With bodyguards in tow and the law shackled by its own statutes there is little that Detective Choi can do except to sit back and witness media adoration and rocket sales of a book that shouldn't have been published in the first place.Similar to Park Chan Wook's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance the events that unfold her include that of the impact to family and how family decide to take it upon themselves in vigilante style to execute their brand of justice when the law gets paralyzed. In between the more emotional dramatic moments where their pain get experienced with Lee's sheer audacity of a public appearance and confession director Jung felt it was perhaps appropriate to inject extremely light comedy to diffuse heavier moments that were dangerously close to stagnating the narrative with a wee bit of action for good measure as well. Something's not quite right and there's more than meets the eye of course when yet another man comes out to claim notoriety and responsibility to the serial killings throwing everything you'd assume into disarray.Which is a good thing of course especially for the jaded amongst us who constantly think we have seen it all. What the story also by Jung did was not only to lapse into providing red herrings that were obvious but to really invest an audience's time and emotions into the story. We learn about a select group of victims and how their unnatural passing causes inexplicable pain to their closest ones and the brilliance here is to make it really personal as well for Detective Choi with vested interest to want to bring the murderer to justice yet hampered by the same law he is sworn to uphold as an officer.This primary dilemma plus what I thought was the ultimate twist followed by the obligatory finale pursuit and emotional closure was what made Confession of Murder a carefully thought out crime thriller in a genre that's becoming increasingly challenging to have novelty and originality but Jung showed there's still substance in the tank on top of having very polished and stylish production values rewarding the patient audience. Having the right cast was also half the battle won with Jung JaeYoung as the detective and Park SiHoo the confessor sharing good chemistry opposite each other in this high stakes cat and mouse game. A definite recommendation!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a strange mix of cartoonfunny thriller noir and drama all packed in an adventure.There are some twists you don't see coming and when they do they come down pouring. Some may find them predictable but considering the pacing of the movie I do not deem most of them predictable except the first one and this is not actually good all because of timing. Since I do not intend to share any spoiler here it will be hard for me to explain my point of view but I will give it a try The movie twistbombs you during a single scene of confrontation up until which you had time to dwell on possibilities but wouldn't in my case at least because I was too busy savoring the rich performances an already gruesome and captivating story and even if I saw a twist coming and try to wrap my head around it it was hard for me to let the next twist sink in amid all the empathy the story and some of the performances forced me to experience. The shockers in this movie are serious in content and this crowd of twists causes a desensitization in the viewer that doesn't let the whole thing sink in. Where there could be a punch these are like successive little slaps in your face.I find the cartoonishly unrealistic scenes in the movie to be a treat. It was nice to watch but it also had a function it gave a glimpse of the new characters that were introduced the way a caricature does.The social commentary is where the perfectly executed noir steps in. A great satire to public perception of psychopathy and how it is engineered by media. Might give some insight to those clueless people out there who haven't yet realized how we transitioned from denouncing behavior that exudes lack of empathy to glamorizing it condoning the criminals it breeds because you know as well as I do how much we are attracted to people in Wall Street as they speculate and kill our future with a single phone call because of all that sexy hair and slick outfit and their intelligence. Well there is no high functioning psycho in the movie but the commentary nails it nonetheless.It is the pacing of the later twists with respect to twist content that led me to give this one an 7. The punch vs slap thing in other words.It is a great thriller tainted with abundance of stuff at the cost of more important stuff. The actors in this movie did a great job and character development could have been much better had the script allowed room for it. Come to think of it this movie should have been at least half an hour longer. As it is it feels like they crammed it all in 1.5 hour so as not to cut it short.If you are binge thriller watchers watch this one. It is a nice Korean thriller by all means. If you look for more in a movie then I think it is still worth to give a shot. My guess is that you will be both delighted and disappointed but you will be nowhere near what did I just watch?. No. This one's better than that.".

But his authenticity is soon questioned when another person claiming to be the real killer turns up.Directed by Jung Byunggil this is his mainstream feature film debut  even though the story suffers from few scenes that are far too outstretched or predictable it's a solid start to his mainstream career.

Yet the best part is the society it portrays where the supposed serial killer becomes a media sensation due to his good looks  gets his own fan following despite the unforgivable acts he committed.On an overall scale Confession of Murder might be predictable despite its twists n turns and isn't further helped by its nonlinear narration which doesn't contributing much to the cinematic experience anyway but it's another fine addition to the long list of dark thrillers South Korea has been churning out since the dawn of the new century.

In Korea they changed the law to more then 15yrs. But anyways it's about what if that person that committed a atrocious crime such as murder reveals himself to the public. And a cop is right on his tail to get even with the guy because he has a major beef with the culprit. I thought it was going to go in that Law Abiding Citizen sort of direction but am glad that it's actually far from it. It does have some goofy scenes that takes away from the seriousness.

I will be interested in the rating of this film after hitting the theaters...I recommend this to everyone who likes original interesting situations and story and wicked twists.";

But must be careful because many hint showed.Last 40 minutes.When my mood keep going down it grab its momentum back with a really really good twist that's unthinkable and unpredictable. The momentum rise back and make all the audience cannot leave their seat ever to yawn. If I'm the president of south Korea I will just change the law and catch the murderer if he just confess like that. But I'm not korean so I don't know their law. However in this part all my curiosity answered and prevent me from going to give this movie such a low rate.

Got a little Big Bad Wolves going on. But then the INSANE tonal shifts start cropping up and also one of the worst action sequences I've ever seen this car chase that is absolutely terrible.It looks like something out of a soap opera the way it was shot all flat and weird and then there's the CG that looks like it fell out of 1993 and the editing is a nightmare. It's just an incredible garbage presentation.AndOK let's go to Spoiler Town Population The Whole Damn MovieSo there's two bits early on that let me figure out what was going on. The dude jumping to his death and then the fake killer whispering in the Lt.'s ear. I figured huh OK I see where this is going. But that's fine right? Because initially it was an interesting trip.But as it was happening I started thinking about it and that's the movie's fault. It would stop being engaging enough or have too much garbage and I would be distracted by the plot. Why the hell is the plan to have this happen literally minutes before the statute of limitations is up? The Lt. clearly has the leg up with that recording. And while obviously being a serial killer J is arrogant enough to agree to this interview but like how incredibly lucky was the Lt. for it to happen an hour before he can't be prosecuted!?! OK and so fine whatever. Then there's this terrible overly cg'd chase where the serial killer has broken like 20 other laws enough to get his ass locked up for forever. But they're still going on about only a couple of minutes and then they can't prosecute again. Dog! He just stole like 4 vehicles took people hostage wrecked everythingI'm pretty sure his ass is going to jail FOR THAT!And then the cherry on this poop sundae is the maudlin and for some reason first person flashback leading up to his lady getting offed and I mean come on. We get it. We got it earlier. If you're trying to give us some reason for him killing J it's no surprise. It's just maudlin sappy trash. Ugh.I had gone from enjoying the movie to being incredibly mad at it all within the last 35 minutes or so. It started off as a solid enough Seven kind of thing but like if Seven had a scene where Brad Pitt goes to the zoo and has wacky Adam Sandleresqe antics or Morgan Freeman has to take a dump while fighting a sewer alligator and just devolved into another garbageass thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "This definitely reeks of OJ but is so much more entertaining.Is there seriously a Statute of Limitations in Korea or anywhere that is which allows people to confess their crimes after a certain amount of time with no repercussions? Okay 1 real or not you'll have to buy that to watch this movie and 2 I'm on the next flight there.Well once again Internet Channel and HorrorWannabeOneStop Shudder led me to believe this was horror. Perhaps their purchase negotiator saw Murder in the title and snatched this up without reading a single synopsis. This is not horror. BUT it is a REALLY good movie.It's more action comedy and mystery. It's also one of the most original movies I've seen recently. Man those Asians specifically in this case Koreans know real storytelling. That Asian market of films is making me completely turn my back on my own country. While our country is focused on bucks from remakes reboots caving in and shameless knockoffs for even more money Asians are making Art.I digress...Confession of Murder is a delightful revenge thriller with a ton of action comedy and heart. It's brilliant with its twists and turns and red herrings  only these are for the plot and not characters. You truly think it's going one way and a sharp left makes you humble. I clicked on this movie with the simple icon of the movie poster with two Korean men and the title. It was a part of my Shudder subscription so as a fan of horror I obliged. So when I offer the synopsis I want to be as simple as possible so you can enjoy this roller coaster of great storytelling as I did.The movie begins with an incredible chase scene in the rain from an obvious cop and a more obvious intelligent bad guy. No spoilers as this is just the synopsis and is only the first 5 minutes of the twohour movie the bad guy gets away and years later comes clean with a memoir of all the murders he's committed in a nice neat novel. He's allowed to due to a Statute of Limitations SOL law that states if not charged with a crime following a certain amount of time 15 years heshe cannot be charged with the crime. And now...let the mayhem begin with these confessions of murder.Again that's just the first 5 minutes or so. So I didn't spoil much. Besides maybe I get an SOLdiscount since the movie came out 6 years ago and surely by now I'm free to talk about 5 minutes screen time of a movie.The movie's two biggest flaws are the runtime and suspension of disbelief. The grand majority of Asian films I stream have to be right at the 2hour mark close to it or way above it. They certainly do not know how to edit or are too terribly arrogant with their art. In most cases it definitely can be cut down some but that might be just this ole American guy used to shorter movies.Oh and that second point? Suspending our disbelief. Well aside from the SOL issue there's a few great action sequences that reminded me of many more movies such as The Matrix Reloaded Lethal Weapon 3 Captain America Civil War  Black Panther Terminator 2 Judgment Day Death Proof and The Transporter films...and is just as unrealistic. Sure they're fun to look at and get into the action but to believe one moment is to totally live in a fantasy world.Nevertheless I had fun with the comedy that made me laugh out loud a few times tear up with the heart of the victims marvel at the action that was well choreographed and most of all LOVE the script that kept evolving and keeping me glued to the edge of my seat. Well done. Well done.Final thoughts So just for fun I right now watched the trailer to see if gave anything away. Amazingly it did not. It perfectly gave enough to the audience to see this movie and like I did above provided the few seconds of the movie to evoke interest. Man...stop making me hate Hollywood so much in lieu of wonderful Asian cinema! You guysgals do it so much better!".

The genres themselves promised surprises in this South Korean action thriller CONFESSION of MURDER starring Jung Jaeyoung and Park Sihoo. The film is so unpredictable smart  intelligent that after watching it you'll officially salute its makers especially the one who scripted this masterpiece!CONFESSION OF MURDER is the best of its kind. A film full of thrilling surprises and mindblowing action sequences it's the perfect South Korean film I had been looking for. It easily proves that films and filmmakers in South Korea are nothing short of being branded as genius. Visually this film is an absolute masterpiece. The screenplay is the best thing about the film as you won't have seen or heard such a brilliant screenplay before ever. The action is another major strength as are the two lead actors Jung Jaeyoung and Park Sihoo they keep you glued to the screen for the entire duration and there's not a single moment in which you'll feel bored or distracted. Jung Jaeyoung delivers a sharp and intense performance while Park Sihoo keeps the viewers engaged with his solid expressions.The film is gripping from its very first sequence. From here it won't be difficult to predict that the film's going to be unpredictable. Mark my words UNPREDICTABLE. And I seriously mean it.CONFESSION OF MURDER benefits a lot from the intelligent and watertight screenplay but suffers slightly due to the editing which often slows down the film's pace occasionally. But happily this doesn't happen for long and what you get at the end of the show is a cinematic masterpiece. Full marks to its director and writer Byunggil Jung for such a well executed film and a salute as well for bringing out the best of the two lead actors as well as giving such a great film not only to the Korean but also the world audience. Strongly recommended!".

When arriving there he learns that Tak was badly beaten in a fight by a former student named Johnny Light Welterweight World Kickboxing Champion Jerry Trimble who is responsible for terrorizing martial art dojos across Downtown L.A. While Tak recovers from his injuries Li tries to settle his differences with him while preparing for an allout kung fu brawl against Johnny and his group of students in order to regain his master's honor.Shot on location in L.A. THE MASTER was sort of how RUMBLE IN THE BRONX was with Jackie Chan where a Chinese kungfu expert travels to a crime ridden area in America to achieve a simple goal while encountering thugs and impressing people with his combat methods. He teaches a Police Force healing secrets as if he was instructing a Tae Bo class teaches a Latino gang kung fu to help them beat off thugs and faces off against an American martial artist to save his master and other hostages held by Johnny's students. The film's simple plot allowed plenty of space for nonstop martial art fights.One of the film's greatest achievements was the nicely choreographed fight scenes courtesy of costar Yuen Wah who incorporated traditional kung fu and weaponry. The absence of fancy wirework and computergenerated effects allowed the fights to be believable and realistic as possible. Yuen Wah revealed his incredible kung fu specialties against a group of fighters on a building rooftop. He uses closerange takedowns Wu Shuoriented butterfly kicks acrobatics and other fight moves to show audiences that he is a true master of the art. Jerry Trimble exchanges blows with Jet Li on more than one occasion but the oneonone finale features Trimble using Tae Kwon Do to execute his cinematic footwork while dealing with Li's counter attacks fastflowing jabs and Wu Shu Kung Fu. In addition to that fight Li gets his leg stuck in a circular pipe handle but is still able to pull off kung fu.Li helps his newlybefriended Latino gangster buddies fight off Johnny's posse two of them who were played by stuntman and martial artist Steven Ho Liu Kang's brother in MORTAL KOMBAT and Ju Jitsu expert Stefanos Militsakakis BEST OF THE BEST 2 MAXIMUM RISK DAREDEVIL before facing off against Johnny on top of a car.Yuen Wah is famous for his recent role as the Landlord in KUNG FU HUSTLE and remembered by fans as the man one who caught the apple in ENTER THE DRAGON and doubled for Bruce Lee in some of the sequences. He also had a small role in Chinese CONNECTION aka FIST OF FURY as the Japanese who taunts Lee by telling him to walk like a dog. He was a regular in oldschool kung fu flicks produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers recently saluted by Quentin Tarrantino in KILL BILL VOL. 1's opening.World Karate Champion and Tae Bo exercise founder Billy Blanks made a quicksecond cameo as a gang thug but unfortunately he did not do any fighting which was a disappointment. The reason why the filmmakers did not let him fight will be a mystery but with his martial arts skill shown in countless Bgrade Hollywood movies he should have fought someone but instead he is depicted as an unknown extra.Originally filmed in 1989 THE MASTER would not earn the 5time National Wushu Champion his crown to superstardom. The film was delayed until 1992 because Li and Tsui Hark were unaware of what was to come that year when they collaborated again to make ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA which was a boxoffice success and Li's ticket to superstardom in Asia.To help capitalize on Li's fame in America the generally unknown film THE MASTER finally got an international DVD release in 2002 by Miramax Films to give viewers the chance to witness the stunning talents of this kung fu master.Overall THE MASTER was a bad movie with good fight scenes. It suffered form poor acting and bad antics but it still deserves a full view because it was one of a few modern kungfu movies to feature lightningfast raw and streeteffective kung fu to make it comparable to fightfilms like ONGBAK and THE PROTECTOR.".

	schema:reviewBody "I noticed there wasn't a lot of information on this movie along with some low rating and negative reviews. Nonetheless I vowed to own every Jet Li movie so I had to buy this and watch it. And I must say I was positively surprised! Jet Li plays the student of Uncle Tak Yuen Wah who is a kung fu master and has established a shop for traditional Chinese medical treatment in America. Meanwhile there is an evil martial arts club that causes trouble challenging and beating up kung fu masters all over town. Only with the help of Jet can these hooligans be stopped.You can't enjoy this movie if you overanalyze every detail and point out the goofs which are rather numerous. The Master is probably one of Jet's goofier movies with a lot of miscommunication jokes and silly sidekicks. If this isn't your deal try focusing on the great nonwired action scenes with Jet Li and Yuen Wah who are both excellent fighters. All in all this movie isn't for everyone and it's definitely not Jet Li's best by far. HOWEVER if you consider yourself a true Jet Li fan and can withstand some silly humor then you should definitely see this movie. The fights were surprisingly good which made me enjoy The Master.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is unintentionally funny at times due to the dubbing and dialog but it's still a very fun martial arts film that i enjoyed the fight scenes were fantastic!. All the characters are cool and the story is pretty good as well plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!.It's extremely violent at times and the fight scenes were very brutal and realistic however it does not take it'self too seriously plus the opening was great and very memorable!.Jerry Trimble is way cool! as the main villain and is one fantastic martial artist and i thought the finale was really cool with some wicked stunts! plus the ending is very funny!. Some of the humor is quite bizarre but hilarious at the same time and the dubbing and dialog had me cracking up plus the main fight between Jet and Jerry Trimble was simply fantastic and very intense!. Jet and Crystal Kwok had great chemistry together and the scene where Jet's character learns to drive is hilarious plus the fight choreography was great. This is unintentionally funny at times due to the dubbing and dialog but it's still a very fun martial arts film that i enjoyed the fight scenes are awesome i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good. Hark Tsui does a very good job here with great camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The acting is good. Jet Li is amazing as always and is amazing here he is very funny kicks that ass had a neat character had great chemistry with Crystal Kwok seemed to be having fun and was lots of fun to watch however his dubbing is terrible! Jet Rules!!!!. Wah Yuen is great as the master he was intense and is one good martial artist i liked him a lot. Crystal Kwok is cute and did fine with what she had to doand also had great chemistry with Jet!. Jerry Trimble is very menacing as the main villain and is a great martial artistsand is one scary dude!.Anne Rickets did what she had to adequately and was like ably perky. those 3 dudes were funny too!. Rest of the cast do okay. Overall i highly recommend this one! just expects lots of cheese!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " a brief but masterful introduction of the martial arts to the West.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film The Master is wonderful. Admittedly it may initially disappoint but this should only happen on first viewing. It is a movie that requires attention to detail as all masterpieces do and knowledge of other martial arts movies and legends. Nonetheless after first viewing during which time the proverbial penny should drop and deeper understanding commence there are amazing viewing rewards! In fact if you should ever want to show off your knowledge to others of the deeper purpose of martial arts andor Jet Li well this is definitely THE movie to have! First though to find the deeper story! So to help the penny drop and to help find full appreciation of the consummate mastery of this Tsui Hark movie especially its script consider the possibility that the Master  Bruce Lee the first internationallyrecognized master of martial arts. On another level to move closer to the story's higher purpose consider the Master as the true spirit andor reason for the practice of martial arts. Second consider the possibility that the movie is an extremely respectful criticism of the postBruceLee commercialism of martial arts and the resultant use of martial arts in street violence.Finally consider the possibility that the martial arts people of the East saw a need to reinforce via another master Jet Li the true spirit andor reason of martial arts to the people of the West. This last point helps explain why the movie is set in moderntimes and why it deliberately avoided the highwire tricks the movie is introducing to America the real martial arts mastery of Jet Li. In so doing it is dealing with real socialcultural issues in a real way with a real and meaningful answer for that answer watch the nonpreaching and nonjudgmental corrections to violence in this specific movie!Now to match the above viewing suggestions to the movie! The Master opens with the master as a doctor who is physically healing and attempting to mentally healwarncorrect a macho streetfighter type. In fact the movie actually links this doctor via the Po Chi Lum herbal medicine shop to Wong FeiHung. Wong FeiHung you may recall was the master from Once Upon A Time in China an allbutdivine hero in Chinese martial arts history who was born in 1849 and who inherited a herbal medicine shop call Po Chi Lum a shop where he also taught Kung Fu! The dimension and breadth of the movie should now start to tease sensibilities into a state of alertness! Jet Li of course had already starred as Wong FeiHung in earlier movies and how! but because there is a higher purpose to this story than pure commercedriven martial arts entertainment Jet Li does not play the role he immortalized for cinemagoers. Instead Jet Li plays one of this master's students! Why? Well in brief Jet Li is paying homage to the mastering spirits and legacy of martial arts. Why? Well in brief that's the lesson the West needs to relearn otherwise the martial arts can be used for violence and destruction not personal and community peace and safety.At this point consider the role that Jet Li plays in this movie like his master he is a healer i.e. of the policemen's ulcers which also suggests the authorities have not quite learned how to correct and stomach street violence! So the movie has a social critique at work too! Truly this story gathers to a giddying greatness the more it is meditated upon! It's great! Then of course Jet Li is a man of peace despite and because of his great martial arts skills. This is why he won't teach the Latino gang the martial arts because they will use such skills violently for personal ends not to help ensure personal and public peace later in the story Jet Li teaches them enough to protect themselves. This is a very fine edge of difference but a critical difference! Jet Li is also a worldly innocent as beautifully and humorously demonstrated by the onesided romance. Of course all Jet Li's don'tcallmemaster positive qualities are in sharp contrast to the callmemaster bad student's egodriven mistakes including the mistake of never having learned what the true purpose of martial arts actually is i.e. mastery over self and the resultant increasinglyperfected personal path to peace! So as the bad student very capably shows to challenge andor kill a master  to lose directions to the true meaning of martial arts  to not be a master regardless of physical prowess  to be killed by the self as a martial arts exponent. To become a true master and thus find the invisible hands of nonterrestrialpower making you effortlessly invincible this movie suggests requires a full willingness to place martial arts in the service of humanity ....!Actually enough ... it is time to stop! It will take a book or two to explain this movie ... it is great! There are problems for viewers certainly because both before and after this specific movie Jet Li starred in some of the most sublime actionmartial arts movies in the history of world cinema nevertheless The Master is also an awesome achievement once the deeper story starts to become visible! Be patient with this movie it will reward ... a masterpiece is patiently and respectfully waiting to speak to you! Be warned when the glory of the story starts to gather momentum your eyes will widen and smiles will arrive like a thousand chuckling sunrises! A masterpiece of reverence for life and community spirit has been scripted here and as is clear from the fact that he doesn't play Wong FeiHung the master Jet Li clearly demonstrates his accord with the spiritual values offered by the infinitely disciplined fully loving immortal heart of martial arts!".

	schema:reviewBody "While The Master aka Lung hang tin haa is not the best of all the Jet Li movies then it is a fairly entertaining movie in itself. The mixture of Asian and Western filmmaking isn't something that speaks to just everyone. I wonder if Jackie Chan took influence from this movie for the 1995 Rumble in the Bronx movie as there are so many similarities.Personally I found The Master to have a bit too much comedy as it is not something that is usually associated with Jet Li movies. And the dialogue was also quite bad at times.The action and martial arts was wellchoreographed and executed which was as expected. And this is what keeps the movie interesting.If you enjoy Jet Li movies then there are far better movies available. But at least it should be seen once if you enjoy his movies and martial arts skills.The Master is entertaining enough for what it is but don't expect anything extraordinary.".

I wonder if Jackie Chan took influence from this movie for the 1995 Rumble in the Bronx movie as there are so many similarities.Personally I found The Master to have a bit too much comedy as it is not something that is usually associated with Jet Li movies. And the dialogue was also quite bad at times.The action and martial arts was wellchoreographed and executed which was as expected. And this is what keeps the movie interesting.If you enjoy Jet Li movies then there are far better movies available. But at least it should be seen once if you enjoy his movies and martial arts skills.The Master is entertaining enough for what it is but don't expect anything extraordinary.";

SBS would show lots of Hong Kong movies but the Jet Li Jackie Chan and even John Woo films seem to be few and far between so I knew that I was going to enjoy this. To my added surprise I discovered that this film was made in Los Angeles even though it is a Hong Kong film so I thought that this was pretty impressive. Most Hong Kong films are either made in Hong Kong or Vancover. This was made in the film making capital of the world.The plot is pretty simple. A kungfu expert is becoming quite cocky and beating up all of the masters in Los Angeles to become the strongest in America. He finds his old master and beats him up but the master manages to escape and is nursed back to health. Meanwhile Jet Jet Li comes into Los Angeles to find his old master having obtained a tourist visa. Once he has found his master he must then deal with the American upstart.This movie is quite funny and full of fancy martial arts. I enjoyed it even though the thought level was low but that does not make a bad movie. Some of my favourite movies are little more that huge gunfights but at times I believe a brilliant gunfight can make or break a movie. The Master is a kungfu movie and for those who love martial arts should come this way. The Chinese make far better kungfu movies than do the Americans as we can see when we compare this with something staring VanDamme. Okay Bruce Lee annoyed me somewhat in the Big Boss but as with everything we must take the good with the bad. The other curious thing is that a friend said that all Tsui Hark films have a magical element to it. Okay Twin Dragons did but this movie did not.".

What seems really surprising for a film set in America with an American supporting cast including upandcoming fighter Billy Blanks in a brief part is the Chinese involvement not only does noted director Tsui Hark helm the movie but soontobe action idol Jet Li also stars in the leading part. Sadly the level of entertainment this film offers is surprisingly low and a long way from most Hong Kong martial arts films which reaffirms my longheld belief that Tsui Hark is an overrated director who makes more misses than hits.The plotting is simplistic in the extreme basically consisting of an old and failed kung fu teacher getting beaten by a gang of thugs until his pupil comes back to set things right again and the scripting isn't much better offering up a clichd gang of Mexicans who absurdly take Jet Li on as their teacher after failing to rob him! and characters who have no reason for existing and who aren't explained fully either  just who the heck is the young girl who looks after Uncle Tak anyway? The film veers wildly from comedy to hardknuckle action and back again a fault which seems to be due to the laughable dubbing which turns most of the dialogue into humorous or not as the case may be wordplay. The actual martial arts sequences are also in short supply at least until towards the ending where we get a nice big fight on the top of a tower block followed by a great stunt of a man falling for ages from the roof. I also enjoyed a brief battle on a bus which has a great and gruesome gag involving a shotgun backfiring on the owner which has to be seen to be believed. Sadly the martial arts are never as graceful as in most Hong Kong movies and in fact even worse than your bogstandard Van Damme flick they just lack the style and finesse to make them enjoyable and their lack of appeal is a big blow to the film.Jet Li fans may also be disappointed by the star's undistinguished appearance here as the young idiotic baseball capwearing 'Jet' a happy yet dumb character closer to the type of goodnatured fools that Jackie Chan plays so well than the brooding hardasnails heroes and villains he would portray later in his career. Sadly Li's skills as both a serious actor and a serious martial artist are wasted in the film as nothing he does is at all memorable. The only real display of talent from Li is during the final oneonone against villain Jerry Trimble where he gets to show off a few nifty manoeuvres. Trimble himself is imposing as the villain but overacts a little too much for my liking although Yuen Wah does good work with his befuddled and flawed teacher and Crystal Kwok is fine as the annoying female buddy  although perhaps sometimes a little too annoying! And no sadly the Pamela Anderson created in the cast is not THE Pamela Anderson but instead a middleaged woman with glasses!".

I have seen some bad Kung Fu movies in my time but this one is extremely awful. The storyline was completely ridiculous and the acting was poor. Jet Li isn't really known for his acting but this is a bad attempt at humour and the annoying music throughout the film made it feel dated and a drag to watch. A lot of the scenes were really far fetched and the showdown with the longhaired baddie wasn't that great. Basically this is complete rubbish and I haven't got a good word to say about it. Terrible!RoundUp Jet Li is one of the fastest Kung Fu artist that I've seen but his acting skills haven't really been that great. When he stars in movies from his native country he isn't that bad but when he crosses over he's only really good when he isn't playing the leading role. He became a household name with movies like Lethal Weapon 4 Unleashed The One and Romeo Must Die and with his recent role in the Expendable franchise he's becoming more popular but he hasn't hit the stardom of someone like Bruce Lee or Jackie Changeup. Personally I like the way that he fights but that about it.I recommend this movie to people who are into there comedic action movies about a Kung Fu expert who visits his relative in America. 110".

Terrible!RoundUp Jet Li is one of the fastest Kung Fu artist that I've seen but his acting skills haven't really been that great. When he stars in movies from his native country he isn't that bad but when he crosses over he's only really good when he isn't playing the leading role. He became a household name with movies like Lethal Weapon 4 Unleashed The One and Romeo Must Die and with his recent role in the Expendable franchise he's becoming more popular but he hasn't hit the stardom of someone like Bruce Lee or Jackie Changeup. Personally I like the way that he fights but that about it.I recommend this movie to people who are into there comedic action movies about a Kung Fu expert who visits his relative in America. 110";

Nathan West as well as several of his elite Special Forces trainees on what appears at first to have been a routine training exercise during a hurricane in the jungles of Panama. Only two survivors are found Dunbar and a badly wounded Kendall the son of a highprofile Joint Chiefs of Staff official. Neither is willing to cooperate with Capt. Julia Osborne's investigation. So base commander Col. Bill Styles calls in exRanger Hardy an old friend and a persuasive interrogator. Osborne disapproves of Hardy who is on leave from the D.E.A. after having come under suspicion of accepting bribes from local drug traffickers. She is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits. With time running out Hardy and Osborne call a temporary if uneasy truce. Hardy ...";

	schema:headline " Anything But Basic...";
	schema:reviewBody "Basic takes a lot of plot twists through the steamy jungles of Panama. They are often impossible to follow. No literally. Impossible. As in they literally do not piece together. You can try to analyze them but when you do you find out there is nothing really to be analyzed. But the film by confusing and tricking the audience makes it appear as if something is there which is almost as good as if something really is there. Therefore the movie though frustratingly difficult to follow at times is entertaining. Confused yet? Yeah that's what the movie will make you feel like. The film opens up in a raindrenched Panama jungle at night on an Army training mission headed by Sergeant West Samuel L. Jackson. Most of the filmALL of the film for that mattertakes place at night during a rainy hurricane and adds to the nonexistant plot. What is so intriguing is that the plot isn't really there but the writer tries to manifest one and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses. But I already went over that didn't I? Flash forward to the next day. An Army chopper picks up two men from the training mission one injured and one very much alive. The injured man Kendall Giovanni Ribisi is sent to a hospital and the alive man Dunbar Brian Van Holt is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very Southern Osborne Connie Nielsen. Dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a Ranger. So in comes Ranger Tom Hardy John Travolta to piece together the events surrounding the death of Sgt. West and his team. The writer of Basic James Vanderbilt has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with. I like movies like these where you see different characters telling their version of one event but the mistake Vanderbilt makes is that he overuses the plot flashbacks in the middle of other events. It becomes hard to seperate present from past and what's real from what's not. So many revelations happen that I feel like I'm in the middle of the writer's mind as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time. There is a limit to how many times you can use surprise revelation endings. Vanderbilt uses three of four in a row piled on top of each other time after time after time. Just as we think the plot twists are done and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot something else happens and we zoom in suspensefully on John Travolta's face as he along with the audience realizes something. Which leads me to something else. The end of the film leaves more open than concluded. So many plot holes are never ironed out. With the ending being the way it is you can look back at certain events and think Why did that surprise soandso and Why did that event happen as it pays no relevancy to the plot? The answer to all this? Simple It's called audience manipulation and James Vanderbilt uses it a lot. He throws the audience a bone to keep them happy continues with something else throws another bone and when it's all done and over we're choking on all these bones and he doesn't realize it. Interesting how he said he named his character Tom Hardy after the Hardy Boys. If I recall the Hardy Boy novels which I was an avid reader of at one time usually revealed a lot at the end. Basic tries to but does not. The film has an excellent director at its helm John McTiernan. A man who chooses his projects carefully and wisely and unfortunately sometimes horribly Rollerball was exceptionally bad. But Die Hard and Predator are two of my alltime favorite action films Predator being my alltime favorite alien movie. Who wants McTiernan to return to his roots and film a Predator 3? It would be good but don't count on it. Like I said he chooses wisely and if I assume correctly he's the kind of director who doesn't like to return to old projects. Basic confused me but after the film was over and my mind was in a knot trying to figure out all the different plot twists I realized how much fun I had being duped by this film. I laughed to myself as I came to realize that this movie has a paperthin plot and the filmmakers all tricked us by taking so many twists and turns and throwing so many confusion bones at the audience and making us believe that the underlying plot of the film was something deep. I really enjoyed this movie even if I still don't really understand it fully. Then again I don't think you're really supposed to. 3.55 stars ".

What I'm saying is that the movie is incoherent and the narrative is purposely I guess to give a sense of continuous twists confusing. I also find it less satisfying in todays standards despite the obvious chemistry between John Travolta and Connie Nielsen.To realize how confusing the plot is take a look at the contents in Wikipedia. Usually in a movie there is a Plot section with a summary or a more detailed description of the plot. Here you have ...subsections of the plot as follows1.1 Dunbar's story1.2 Kendall's story1.3 Dunbar's second story1.4 Kendall's second story1.5 Pike's final explanation1.6 Final twist and explanationI don't recall any other movie to have such a structure in its topic in Wikipedia!!The thing is you are trying to follow what is happening especially in the first viewing and you even might have a suspicion about who the actual bad guy is but the convulsive script combined with John McTiernan's erratic direction have as a result a movie that is ultimately confusing.If you see it superficially you will probably enjoy it. Travolta's character has an attitude of a knowitall maverick investigator Connie Nielsen looks really good and the end is designed to think of it as rewarding and satisfying.But if you look more closely and give it a second thought you will see clearly that this movie is more like a disappointment.P.S. The atmosphere and the theme of the movie plus the similar lead role of Travolta but with Madeleine Stowe instead of Connie Nielsen reminded me of The General's Daughter 1999. A better movie if you ask me.".

	schema:headline " Not a tight enough film to handle all the twists it wants to do";
	schema:reviewBody "Infamously cruel Sergeant West takes his unit into the Panama jungle on a training exercise. Two days later two of his men return and report the rest dead.  When the base investigator makes no process the base commander calls in shamed DEA agent Hardy.  The investigation continues well with both of the two men telling their stories however Hardy finds that the stories contradict themselves and that the truth is much much more complex than first appeared.For the majority of this film everything goes the way you expect it to but yet it all still works reasonably well.  The plot twists in several ways as each contradiction brings out a bit more truth in the overall tale.  It is filled with dramatic interrogation scenes which although clichd do still serve to be reasonably gripping.  However at some point and I can't say exactly when it happens the sheer volume of twists and the leaps we are expected to make simply become too much for the quality of the material and it more or less collapses in on itself.It isn't that the twists are too much of a stretch it's that they are too much of a stretch for this film.  Usual Suspects has massive twists that bewilder and require big jumps but that had the acting and script to back it up.  Here the same isn't true the script doesn't do a good enough job of gradually revealing a story to us just to twist it instead it just seems to be constantly changing the foundations to the point that I felt I was on quick sand rather than a base where the walls kept moving if you get my meaning.  What I'm saying is that the story didn't set itself up well enough to provide killer twists instead it was constantly pulling small then bigger twist after twist  to the point where I was expecting the next one before it arrived.  Not to unfairly compare but Usual Suspects gradually added layers rather than twists as it builds to a climax.  Basic just keeps twisting but eventually gets to the point where it overstretches itself and the twists lose their impact.The dramatic tone suffers for this reason and after a good start it all too quickly loses it's impact.  Travolta tries hard and for the most part he does OK but his slick character loses it towards the end and his final winks' are not easy to understand.  I got the feeling that he didn't understand his character anymore that I did.  Jackson gives a better performance in flashback although his character is pretty much a basic sergeantmajor clich until the ending goes and ruins a fair amount of what he had done up till that point.  Nielsen is pretty good but gives a masculine performance in a masculine film.  The support cast is actually pretty good although Ribisi damaged his reputation with me by doing some sort of weak effeminate spoof character.  Diggs Holt Daly and Sanchez all do pretty well and their solid flashback sequences help the interrogation to be more dramatic.Overall this film is too twisty and some of them really demand jumps that are just not made possible by a script that doesn't do enough to help the audience out.  It still manages to be pretty dramatic and enjoyable for at least the first half but the final third demands too much and twists too much for the material to cope with.  Not as awful as other reviews lead me to expect but it collapses alarmingly fast towards the end.".

Jackson gives a better performance in flashback although his character is pretty much a basic sergeantmajor clich until the ending goes and ruins a fair amount of what he had done up till that point.  Nielsen is pretty good but gives a masculine performance in a masculine film.  The support cast is actually pretty good although Ribisi damaged his reputation with me by doing some sort of weak effeminate spoof character.  Diggs Holt Daly and Sanchez all do pretty well and their solid flashback sequences help the interrogation to be more dramatic.Overall this film is too twisty and some of them really demand jumps that are just not made possible by a script that doesn't do enough to help the audience out.  It still manages to be pretty dramatic and enjoyable for at least the first half but the final third demands too much and twists too much for the material to cope with.  Not as awful as other reviews lead me to expect but it collapses alarmingly fast towards the end.";

After what seems like a perfectly good ending I won't elaborate but you'll see the movie just keeps going. All of a sudden what really happened was fake here's what really happened or did it? The conclusion of the film is an absurd reversal of nearly every premise of the film. I half expected one of the characters to reveal themselves to be an alien or a vampire or some other Tales From the CryptTwilight Zone nonsense ending.Much like The Recruit the script doesn't know when to quit with all the reversing. Thanks to the masterpiece film The Usual Suspects now every dopey mystery has to have the big surprise. And you can do that once maybe twice in a story. But you can't press that reset button five or six times! If I spend 90 minutes watching a film I've got to know that at least part of that story really happened. You can't wash it all away with that guy was lying. No wonder Entertainment Weekly titled their review Trashomon.P.S. If you watch the film on DVD there is a really funny extra segment with the screenwriter.

	schema:headline " Not the best movie in the genre but it could have been a lot worse";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though I had some doubts about this movie before watching it I definitely wanted to give it a try. There were several reasons for that. One of those reasons is because Samuel L. Jackson plays an important role in it. That man on his own is already reason enough to watch a movie but I also knew that it was directed by John McTiernan who also made The Hunt for Red October The 13th Warrior and Die Hard With a Vengeance. Three movies that I've seen and liked very much. The only one that didn't really do it for me was The Thomas Crown Affair but with an average of three out of four I could only hope for the best with this movie.Basic starts with showing us how army sergeant West takes six of his special troops on a training mission into the Colombian rain forest from which only two return alive. When the rescue mission arrives they see one soldier killing another and carrying a wounded comrade. As soon as they are back on the base the interrogation of Dunbar  one of the two survivors  starts. But he refuses to talk to anyone else than another Ranger who he doesn't know yet. That's where former Ranger and current DEA agent Hardy comes in. He is able to get a confession out of Dunbar but as he digs deeper he only finds more and more prove of contradictions and illegal practices...This is one of those movies that you have to watch when you can keep your mind to it from the beginning until the end. If you think that you'll need to take a break in between you better don't even start watching it because the entire story is so confusing and so many plot twists make it almost impossible to watch it unless you can keep focused. But don't think that this means that this movie isn't any good. It's especially thanks to the many twists that I kept watching because the interrogation scenes and the 'action scenes' on the base didn't always do it for me. What I also liked about this movie was Samuel L. Jackson's performance. He was really nice as the tough sergeant West. You could see that the man enjoyed playing this role. John Travolta wasn't bad either but I've already seen him play better roles.Overall this isn't a bad movie. Thanks to the mysterious story and the many twists it is hard to keep track but when you are able to do so you'll have fun watching it. Still not everything about this movie was that strong and that's why I give this movie a 6.510. It isn't the best movie in the genre but could have been a lot worse than this.".

Three movies that I've seen and liked very much. The only one that didn't really do it for me was The Thomas Crown Affair but with an average of three out of four I could only hope for the best with this movie.Basic starts with showing us how army sergeant West takes six of his special troops on a training mission into the Colombian rain forest from which only two return alive. When the rescue mission arrives they see one soldier killing another and carrying a wounded comrade. As soon as they are back on the base the interrogation of Dunbar  one of the two survivors  starts. But he refuses to talk to anyone else than another Ranger who he doesn't know yet. That's where former Ranger and current DEA agent Hardy comes in. He is able to get a confession out of Dunbar but as he digs deeper he only finds more and more prove of contradictions and illegal practices...This is one of those movies that you have to watch when you can keep your mind to it from the beginning until the end. If you think that you'll need to take a break in between you better don't even start watching it because the entire story is so confusing and so many plot twists make it almost impossible to watch it unless you can keep focused. But don't think that this means that this movie isn't any good. It's especially thanks to the many twists that I kept watching because the interrogation scenes and the 'action scenes' on the base didn't always do it for me. What I also liked about this movie was Samuel L. Jackson's performance. He was really nice as the tough sergeant West. You could see that the man enjoyed playing this role. John Travolta wasn't bad either but I've already seen him play better roles.Overall this isn't a bad movie. Thanks to the mysterious story and the many twists it is hard to keep track but when you are able to do so you'll have fun watching it. Still not everything about this movie was that strong and that's why I give this movie a 6.510. It isn't the best movie in the genre but could have been a lot worse than this.";

Poorly written poorly directed Whatever happened to you John? and even poorly photographed How can a Hollywood movie look so ugly?. The film is like The General's Daughter but with a bunch of unbelievable twists and turns attached to it. Nothing makes sense in this movie. The screenwriter builds the whole film around false flashbacks like that's hard and keeps pulling the rug from under your feet so many times that halfway through the movie you don't care anymore. He tries to make The Usual Suspects or House of Games but the writer is no Christopher McQuarrie or David Mamet. He cheats shamelessly with the Point of View with the Information you're given with the character's motivations.... This is one of those movies that when the final twist comes you look back at the whole film and realize that nothing makes any sense.Even worse you do not care about the characters they are nonexistent just walking cardboard figures you do not care about the investigation there are no true facts that you can hold to you just want the movie to end. McTiernan has definitively lost his gift for action everything is noisy and confusing. Spielberg can direct action see Minority Report making it dynamic and frantic but clear at the same time. McTiernan cannot. It's all chop chop chop.Because the whole action takes place at night under the rain during a hurricane the film is really ugly and LOUD. The wind keeps howling the character keep yelling the sound effects of the machine guns are deafening... I can assure you something by the end of the film you'll have a headsplitting headache.".

Who cares.On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 2 for being the most discombobulating movie experience I have ever had the misfortune of suffering through.";

They may all be correct but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach its visual and acoustic impact its mesmerizing flow and its completely groundbreaking storytelling and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts.

	schema:reviewBody "Cloud Atlas is nearly three hours in length but I wasn't bored for a minute. The film alternates between six very different stories quite seamlessly creating an exhilarating experience. It's part scifi part historical drama part love story part comedy. Any number of things could have gone wrong with the film. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh. But they did and it's something to see.The film takes us on shipboard in the 1800s where a young man forms an unlikely bond with a stowaway a runaway slave. It tells the sensitive melancholy story of a promising young composer in the 1930s  separated by prejudice and misfortune from his lover a man named Sixsmith. It also brings us to 1973 where an intrepid reporter finds herself caught up in a web of murder and intrigue. In the present day the film offers up the comedic tale of a publisher on the run from a gang of thugs. Plunging into the future it shows a dystopian vision of Seoul South Korea that is comparable to Blade Runner and a primitive postapocalyptic Hawaii.Linking these stories together are the simple thematic elements of love compassion and a love for liberty. The correspondence between the composer Robert Frobisher and Sixsmith depicts the plain beauty of love as well as any film I have seen as do tender moments between the central characters of the portion of the film set in the futuristic New Seoul. Even in the blatantly comic segment with Jim Broadbent as the publisher a deep passion for freedom and human dignity shines through.All the actors do a great job in their multiple roles. You can care for Tom Hanks one moment as a villager in a future Hawaii and then revile him in the next scene where he plays a truly despicable doctor. The best performances are given however by Doona Bae and Jim Broadbent. I think they surpass all the rest. Bae plays a fabricant a kind of clone designed to serve humanity. Her gradual awakening to her own selfworth to the subjugation of herself and of her people is beautifully and movingly conveyed. She is heartbreaking in this role. Broadbent is equally excellent as the publisher Cavendish. His expressive face and popping eyes are ideal for comedy  and he's hilarious. But he's more than that. Broadbent infuses the character with a sense of sorrow and weariness at key moments. Cavendish has depth a history regrets from his past. Broadbent brings all this out brilliantly without losing his comic touch.Everything in Cloud Atlas comes together to create a film I found thoughtprovoking and highly entertaining. I don't hesitate to recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to get lastminute tickets for this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.The very opening of the film is mesmerizing and sets pace for all that is to follow. Six stories are intertwined to create one magical ride through time and space as all stories move forward as one. To those who haven't read the book I expect you might find the movie confusing at first. It seems unclear at the beginning and for most of the first hour and a half at least what all these characters have to do with one another. The end ties it up quite well but for a three hour film you might find you've spent a bit too long grasping at straws. Just let it go and enjoy what's before you It will all come together in the end.An important aspect of the film is that actors play different characters throughout the film finding themselves in different stories and eras. Often it works. The futuristic plot with Jim Sturgess is one I particularly enjoy. But sometimes it feels like they're incorporated just a tad bit much. Tom Hanks' role in the editor's story seemed huge and important and first but it seemed we were supposed to forget about it. As I walked out of the theatre I felt I had seen not only Cloud Atlas as a whole but a series of other films as well. I think maybe for a film such as this one actors who weren't as known would have been better. It may have been easier to believe in all their different characters and forget who they were. But as far as their performances went well they were great. Tom Hanks shines from the opening sequence to the very end. Halle Berry was adequate for the journalist and Hugh Grant... actually it seems he's playing himself in this one too. But the true star as always is Hugo Weaving. He steals the screen whenever he appears and is mesmerizing both as the devil or a regular assassin. The costumes and make up went from absolutely stunning it may take you a few minutes to recognize actors sometimes to somewhat distracting. Changing the race and age of an actor has got to be challenging but it's still hard to forget who they are. I expect the film will get an Oscar for this however as I don't think anyone will beat them in this category before winter comes. The score was also incredibly powerful and beautiful and helped set the tone for the movie greatly.Cloud Atlas will take you anywhere and everywhere. It may surprise you by its sudden burst of violence sometimes exaggerated and almost funny sometimes cold and raw. You might cry at times as the characters make choices and sacrifices. One story is particularly funny and had the theatre laughing quite often. All in all Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film. It's a voyage that will take you to places you didn't expect. Don't try to understand it just let yourself go and you'll find you understood what it was all about. If you're looking for a linear plot then this film isn't for you. But if you want to experience something different then by all means buy a ticket for Cloud Atlas when it comes out. I know I'll be seeing it again.".

Once you clue in to that overall theme it is no longer confusing when the story jumps from a runaway slave in the 1800s to a post apocalyptic future battle between some of the last humans remaining on earth.All this audacious style and structure makes Cloud Atlas a curiosity to say the least but the film is lifted to the realm of Masterpiece by the allstar ensemble cast. This impressive collection of actors fires off amazing performances like the Expendables 2 fires off high caliber bullets. I mean this will long be considered one of the greatest acting clinics ever filmed and a high point in some already outstanding careers as the end credits alone are astonishing to watch.Overall this is a movie that transcends the simple elements of stars and plots and special effects and boldly assumes to take the cinema to another level of storytelling much like Avatar took film to a new level of technology a few years ago. The ambition the technical brilliance and the passion that was put into this film makes it one of the great epics of our time.".

But I think that 99 of the people that see this film will appreciate it. I'm NOT one who tends to like films that are overly artistic I hated Tree of Life for example. But while the overall message of the film is hard to put into words it is easy to understand. The film is very watchable and the nearly 3 hour length seems to fly by. The stories are sharply written and for those who are afraid of getting lost while viewing no worries ... you'll enjoy seeing clues that link the stories but even if you miss the clues you still will see a story that is well explained and easier to consume than an experimental art film.I am absolutely shocked that the reviews from the experts have not been more favorable and the lack of box office sales is a crime. Please go see this movie  if you can see one film this year this is the one!".

	schema:reviewBody "Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense it wants to tell you something through plot characters dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film much longer and denser than much of what is available today. Ambition defines this film. In just under 3 hours six radically different stories are told and they appeal to a broad audience a 19th century tale of unlikely brotherhood the letters of a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's a San Francisco set conspiracy in the 70's A hilarious account of an old publisher's woes. A Blade Runneresque clone's struggle for freedom and the survival of a tribe after 'The Fall'. Genre conventions are toppled as these stories with different tones are juggled in short intervals leading from comedic highs to shocking drama in minutes.But as with the characters these plots are connected thematically and clever wordplay and visual imagery links the stories such as the end of a monologue referencing the gates of Hell and cutting to a shot of the gates of a building that for Cavendish at least is the gates of Hell. Each of the stories has strengths a few have faults but together the medley is incredible. I found that while the earliest two stories began slowly and plainly they developed very well and provided fantastic drama especially the 1849 story. The Nuclear thriller was strong Halle Berry is great and there are some real twists and I also loved the 'Dirty Harry' and 'China Syndrome' vibes but comedy bled into it from the 2012 story which diminished the climax. The 2012 story is hilarious and its first scene is a standout Tom Hanks is incredible as Dermot Hoggins. Although while the story is interesting it doesn't fit quite so well thematically it's almost too light. Listening to the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' fits with all the stories but can't resonate with Cavendish's. The future Korea is visually stunning and communicates its themes well certainly the darkest plot but the action can get over the top Yes I know who directed this and there are some horrible clichs. But that scene of horrendous dialogue the weakest in the film can't derail a great piece. Lastly is the bleak Hawaii set postapocalyptic story. It was my favourite possibly because I'm a sucker for anything involving apocalypse. But Hanks and Berry are fantastic again the barbarians are menacing and scary and the story is cool. It also concludes the film perfectly.I've only talked about the plot! The actors really steal the show. In the credits each actor's name is placed with a clip of every one of their characters everyone in the theatre stopped and stayed. People play characters you had no idea they played. A few highlights Sturgess' lawyer and the slave Autua Frobisher Hugh Grant's sexist nuclear boss Cavendish and Hanks' Hoggins. Doona Bae as Somni and Hugo Weaving's Old Georgie round it out the latter is truly a demon. Much credit has to go to the makeup literally making actors disappear into their roles. There is a huge number of transsexual and even racebridging roles it's worthy of note that Lana Wachowski was at one point Larry Wachowski. Also deserving of praise and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Sound quality is topnotch as well listening to Old Georgie is chilling as is the vision of Korean diners and well... the whole future.But all this plot serves a purpose and Cloud Atlas intends to tell you things. Freedom is possibly the biggest theme as well as the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time we're part of a large human network. Really though there's so much to talk about you should just see the film. There are small stumbles every so often but the structure hides them very well. No one story takes more time than others no one character takes more time than others and the structure and pacing drives the film forward briskly. It's a shame this film hasn't been better received commercially because it's a phenomenal achievement interesting scifi and drama and as of now the best film I've seen in 2012. 8.810".

	schema:reviewBody "My wife and I were able to see an advanced showing of Cloud Atlas last night at The Chicago International Film Festival. I will say that I was thrilled to see this movie from the moment I saw the initial trailer release. I am a huge fan of movies that are epic in nature and are rather daring by taking on the task of time lines that may span a millennia.I will not provide any spoilers but I will say that the film is truly grand in scope and as you may have deduced from the trailer the film time span passes through hundreds of years and includes many characters and story lines that are interwoven or overlap.I cannot say enough about the performances in the film. From top to bottom everyone displays amazing performances. Hugo Weaving obviously is a show stopper in several scenes. The makeup and costume design will throw even the seasoned filmgoer off as the transitions made by these characters are nothing short of spectacular. I cannot see another film coming close to being in the same category for the Oscar in Costume and MakeUp.The visuals and the score of the movie were the biggest takeaways for me. There were moments that reminded me of Blade Runner mixed with Out of Africa. There are a large number of stories within the film some large and some small but many strong enough to be individual films themselves. That being said with the long running time of the film almost 3 hours coupled with the multitude of story lines and the very numerous edits the film can be a daunting task for even a seasoned viewer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fighting to pay close attention to every detail to the first hour of the film to understand what was happening. The first 10 minutes alone caused me some confusion.This film will not be for everyone due to its complexity and length but for those who are true fans of films this epic in nature will truly appreciate the film. I very much look forward to another viewing of the film and encourage everyone to see the film at least once.Cheers".

	schema:reviewBody "Impressive. That's the best description I could come up with after being asked by my brother and sisterinlaw about my thoughts on Cloud Atlas immediately following the film's secondever public screening we'd just attended. Not a very incisive assessment I'll grant you but my head was still spinning as I tried to make sense of what I'd just witnessed over the film's jampacked two hour and forty three minute running time. This may be one the most ambitious and epic films I've ever seen demanding rapt attention from viewers as they're taken on an odyssey that spans the globe over 500 years and hopscotches between numerous interwoven story lines that incorporates just about every film genre available featuring actors playing several different roles each. Cloud Atlas is based on British author David Mitchell's bestselling 2004 novel and was a huge challenge for the filmmakers to adapt and finance its estimated budget of over 100 million also makes it the most expensive independent film ever made. The architects of this beautifully twisted madness are directorswritersproducers Tom Tykwer Run Lola Run and The Matrix's Wachowski siblings Andy and Lana Lana was Larry until a gender transition that was completed about five years ago. The Wachowskis notoriously press shy were surprisingly on hand along with Tykwer to introduce the film's second screening the morning after its starstudded TIFF world premiere on September 8th at the Princess of Wales Theatre. A movie this expansive should have a massive cast considering how many characters appear  not so in this case though. Principle actors Tom Hanks Halle Berry Hugh Grant Jim Broadbent Hugo Weaving Jim Sturgess and Xun Zhou each take on multiple roles that plays loose and fast with the actors' ages races and genders Susan Sarandon Keith David James D'Arcy and Doona Bae also have smaller roles. Having so many dimensions to explore with all of their characters must have been acting nirvana for this lot. For the most part they pull off the various requirements of the roles many of which require a significant amount of prosthetics and makeup. Several of the roles were so well disguised that I was completely clueless that a certain actor had played the role until the end credits visually made some of the big reveals learning that Berry played the white Victorian housewife and Grant a war paintlayered native completely floored me. Sticking around until the end is an absolute necessity for Cloud Atlas  the oohs and ahhs from the soldout audience as they discovered who actually played some of the parts was a wonderfully unique filmgoing experience for me. For all of the positive aspects that the race bending and gender bending idea brings to the film there is the faint whiff of novelty attached to it. Things do get a little silly when you have Weaving seemingly playing an Asian character whose makeup produces more of a Vulcan look which may have been intentional as it's for a scifi sequence that takes place somewhere in the 2300s as well as in full drag playing a Nurse Ratchedlike character. The latter obviously has parallels to Lana Wachowski's own life and although the nurse character provides some decent laughs I was a little hung up on how it seemed one of the character's main functions was to generate laughs purely based on the surreal sight of Weaving playing one truly ugly looking woman. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. Weaving does provide one of Cloud Atlas' most memorable roles as the seriously creepy Old Georgie who terrorizes one of Hanks' many characters. Hanks does some of the best work I've ever seen from him playing four different characters that range from an unscrupulous doctor in the 1800s to going far against type with maybe the film's standout character a modernday thuggish British writer named Dermot Hoggins who gets the ultimate revenge on a critic for a bad review. Berry is excellent with her predominant roles playing an ambitious reporter in 1970s San Francisco and a political figurehead from what I could grasp aligned with one of Hanks' characters in the far future in one of the film's few story lines that doesn't quite work. Also great is Broadbent as both a composer and playing a man tricked into living in a retirement home who provides the film's best comic relief. The weighty Cloud Atlas principle themes of philosophy reincarnation oppression and destiny along with the film's highly challenging pace and complex nonlinear storytelling construct will overwhelm many  that's okay however. I was lost a number of times  not Tinker Tailor Soldier Spylevel lost mind you but definitely out of sync with what was happening on screen. This is the type of daring film that demands multiple viewings to completely grasp the filmmakers' grand scope and there's nothing wrong with a little audaciousness from Hollywood once in a while. Even with a bigname cast it'll be very interesting to see how the otherwise difficulttomarket Cloud Atlas will fare at the box office come late October.".

It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption musical composition the slave trade science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.The white actors acting as Asian and vice versa are distractingly comical although I understand there is a reason for it.It's easy to see why it wasn't a box office success and didn't receive any major nominations.Skip it.";

It's the way you make me feel as if I've learned a secret of life while being indoctrinated to the insidiousness of big oil the heartlessness of corporations the racism of Christianity the crushing of the weak by the rich the need for an antiCapitalist revolution and the beauty of gay love. Your music is the cherry flavoring of the poison you have once again spoon fed me through my entertainment a power you abuse without apology. The idea of Cloud Atlas that people are bound through lifetimes is one that I'm not sold on. Conversely the common binding of the same stale ideology through reincarnations of cinema sold with the power of music that you have once again demonstrated.As much as I wanted to like this film and as much as I had hoped that this film would be creative and inspiring I just found little of value here. This is just another demonstration of one of thousands of Hollywood propaganda pieces designed to brainwash the masses through your entertainment and push a liberal agenda.The gist is nothing deeper than the idea of reincarnation and soul mates. There is really nothing new that this film adds to any schools of thought and it contains no idea that you didn't already more comprehensively examine when you were 19 and stoned.The changing of stories is also nothing new to the movie industry. I've heard people describe the movie as difficult to understand or complex but it's not. Memento was a pioneer in this realm and uncreative Hollywood types have been milking the technique for all it's worth ever since. Been there done that. When stories start skipping around like this you should realize it's multithreaded. At that point pay attention and just go with it and hopefully the director ties everything up well at the end and you don't realize that you've just wasted 3 hours with no payoff. Multithreaded stories are pretty common now. It's how Hollywood makes you think with a structure rather than a worthy plot. It's how they create a sense of complexity out of a void and in this scenario makes it next to impossible to care about any of the stories or characters. The stories were boring the acting was nothing special at best and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. At one point a gay man kills himself. I really don't know why nor do I care. I know from the music that the film wanted me to care and to be emotionally invested but nope couldn't care less. The guy that committed suicide seemed like a self centered egomaniac douche and if there was any characteristic of him that would make me care about him I didn't see it. I think the only character that I remotely liked was the escape slave but perhaps just the idea of escaping made me happy after two hours into this film. As stated above the music is fine enough and gives you the sense that you're growing as a person but when you actually think about it there is nothing new groundbreaking or even particularly interesting going on here. I really thought that there was a distinct chance as I was watching that the film would take all the little pieces of crap stick them together and I would be amazed by the brilliant piece of art that was revealed. Nope! It was just a bunch of crap stuck together. You were expecting some genius ending that unfortunately no one had the talent to produce. Kinda like Lost. With Lost JJ wrote himself into a box he did not have the talent to coherently write himself out of but at least Lost was interesting along the way.I read another review that stated that there are a lot of people who are praising this movie because they're afraid that others will think they're stupid for not getting the movie. I think that is very true because I have yet to hear one rational explanation of why this film is not horrible. Here's the bad news they are stupid. Not because they are so dumb that they don't get it but because they're so dumb that they don't realize there's nothing there to begin with and they don't possess the mind to question it. I know Tom Hanks is in it. I know Halle Berry is in it. SPOILER ALERT I am about to reveal the most mindblowing aspect of this film. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry can be in a crap movie! This film is best watched with subtitles as the clarity of the words is not great in some parts and is obscured by dialects in other parts including the ebonicy dialect that adds nothing in the post apocalyptic story between Hanks and Berry. Not only did that one particular dialect add nothing but it subtracted and distracted from the story with how silly it sounded. It honestly reminded me of Jar Jar Binks and nothing good reminds you of Jar Jar Binks!Personally I found my mind drifting and contemplating much deeper topics such as how much money you could make if you actually went to Hollywood with the skills to make someone look old rather than plastic. I'm looking at you too Prometheus! Some of the makeup jobs looked quite atrocious.If you think you might like a film made up of a nougatty center of liberal brainwashing with a coating of stale ideas then by all means see this movie. On the other hand if you can tell the difference between deep sounding music and actual depth then you'll probably be disappointed too.".

I did not know it would be a three hours hell.The movie is very beautiful made. What more can you expect from the Wachowski brothers or brother  sister I got lost there. The movie switches from the one parallel universe tot the other. In the preview the only thing the actors and actresses said was that the story is very complex and everything will come together at the end. Like boring the preview was so was the movie. We got to see three hours of scenes going from story to story and back. Only to tell a simple story what the whole movie was really about. Yes you get to know what the movie is about at the end but it is very disappointing.Acting was bad. Makeup was awesome. The actors and actresses were pimped up very beautiful. Sometimes the actors and actresses had to speak words of the English language in a different way like we are used to. I could see they had a bit of trouble there and that really stole the magic of the movie.Some people left the cinema before the movie was over. Most people like me stayed. Maybe because we hoped the movie would get better or the urge to know what this movie was about or maybe not letting our money we paid for the movie wash down the drain.One big advice don't watch it in the cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure what to say about this film. It was attempting to be all things to all men . . . literally but failed so miserably I cannot conceive of how it is regarded highly by anyone who saw it. The only thing more embarrassing than the pacing directing editing and performances in this film was the makeup which especially when Hugo Weaving appears dressed in drag as a middle aged nurse reminded me of a less convincing Mrs. Doubtfire. Hugo's transformation feels uncomfortable and halfhearted designed for cheep laughs because the audience knows this is a man who is far more comfortable in a gman suit and shades and not in knitsweaters and comfortable shoes attempting to capture the nuances of Nurse Ratched. If it weren't for the fact that each story is edited together and connected by some goofy newage reincarnation mumbojumbo it would amount to little more than a series of fairly pedestrian clichs in genrefiction. The fact that the same 15 or so actors about 2 or 3 of whom are better actors than this film allows are jumbled between the plots makes the film even more difficult to enjoy. Imagine you're being served a 6course meal and for some reason the chef has decided to use the same 6 ingredients in every course . . . Including the ripe old cheese that was Tom Hanks in this film. The worst performance by far was turned in by Doona Bae whose character seems to be built around 95 hairstyle 2 skimpy skirts 1 never having shoes on for some reason 2 passively reciting her lines in a sort of monotone sigh. A scene where she is supposed to be giving a speech that will cause a revolution in her world sounds like it could have been read from a cue card by a shy 9 year old this even after her character has only recently found out that her sisters have been getting ground up into juice boxes and fed to her. The scenes set in NeoSeoul apptly named since the Wachowskis directed this sequence are nothing new. A futuristic dystopian cityscape has been done so many times since Blade Runner did it best 30 years ago that there's no wonder left in seeing them especially since noone has successfully improved on the original. There is of course plenty of martial arts gunfu and even a Neo in NeoSeoul but the effects look rushed and unconvincing. At nearly 3 hours this film is a ponderous plodding mess that needs to be put out of its misery and converted in to a drinkable form for those who enjoyed it so they can simply sit there and consume it without taking up theatre space from better films. They can put Deepak Chopra's name on the box to help sales.".

But rather show things in some sort of sequence the movie cuts back and forth from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of about a half dozen different stories multiple characters played by the same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even if you could figure out the storyline there's nothing original about it. Oh and bring a translation book since about 25 of the dialog is in some sort of pidginEnglish invented for the movie.I don't mind movies occasionally trying to shake up the traditional narrative Memento was an outstandingly original twist on the conventional storytelling. But Cloud Atlas is not only confusing it's ponderous grindingly slow gratuitously violent selfimportant and dull. It cost 100 million to make and it'll no doubt enter the ranks of one of the most expensive flops in movie history. It's not even forgettablethe story is so unintelligible that you really don't have anything to forget when you leave the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I start  this review is more of a study and thus is by nature full of spoilers. I'm worried that people might not appreciate the interconnectedness and message of the film and brush it off. I actually thought I was going to hate it going in wasn't sure after almost two hours then I realized I was in love. So I would suggest if you plan to read on see the movie first. One critic Joe Morgenstern from the Wall Street Journal spouts This wouldbe epic is beautifully photographed elegantly crafted and adventurously cast. Unfortunately though it plays like a gargantuan trailer for a movie still to be made. Morgenstern obviously did not understand the movie. How can he call something elegantly crafted and then claim it has poor structure gargantuan trailer in the same breath. Okay whatever I don't need to diss critics  Cloud Atlas does that in one of the earliest scenes when an outlandish Tom Hanks playing an lowlife writer who's just published an autobiographical work tosses a critic off of a building. I will say this though. Cloud Atlas is epic. It's more than epic. It's length and pacing are deliberate  you are supposed to be tired when watching it  this is a story that spans generations  if it was an hour and half it would not resonate. The beauty of the filmmaking is that these guys guys and gals get it. Zack Snyder  a talented artist  tried something similar with Sucker Punch but ultimately failed big time. He focused too much on the visual crap. I loved the story of the girls in the home  but the action stuff was hokey repetitive and trite. He thought we would eat it up but the audience has seen it before. Then there's Cloud Atlas we follow several storylines ranging from comedy to drama to three days of the condor'esque paranoia but when it comes to the action effects fantasy and hard scifi they do it lightly sprinkling the massive work with seconds here and there. Just enough to leave us satisfied but little enough to not overwhelm or undermine the complexity of this literature. I'm paraphrasing an incredibly powerful line from the end of the film here You can't make a change you'll just be a single drop in an entire Ocean. What is an Ocean but a countless pool of drops? This is the controlling idea for the movie Can one man make a difference? Cloud Atlas believes so. Follow this single drop and watch how it ripples. Tom Hanks drops the critic off of the roof to his death. The death leads his publisher on a hilarious journey where he is wrongfully placed in a mental institution. The journey leads him to write an autobiographical novel in kind but as he is a talented writer obviously one who has been neglecting his talent writes a good book. The book is turned into a movie where in the future a small clip of the movie incites a revolution which makes a person into a pseudoDeity. This one bizzar drop  or act led a ripple which caused a revolution hundreds of years in the future. In other words an single persons actions can have godlike effect. Then comes the theme of art or creating. Hank's character was writer. Cloud Atlas was a musical work. Letters between lovers. A Dairy and a video made by a rebel. A madeforTV type movie based on a book. Each one of these creations of art pass through time connecting people and inspiring them to create ripples In other words by creating even the most insignificant works people might find inspiration. Hell I felt like writing this review just from seeing the movie. Maybe my review will lead somebody else to write a song which will in turn ripples. The concept of reincarnation. Each actor plays myriad parts over a vast amount of time and space. The argument of good vs. evil is explored here. The Hugo Weaving character is almost always evil in the physical sense  Hugh grant in the sense of conspiracy Basically if your name starts with Hu  you are a bad guy. Keith David is a rebel. Halle Barry represents curiosity or investigation. These characters are archetypical and live within each of us  the most interesting is Tom Hanks who plays both good and bad characters. In his futuristic storyline  he has a personal devil Weaving that tells him to do bad things  but he does not! This is because inside us all we are capable of good or bad it's the decisions we make that define us. In his future storyline he chooses to be good. Ironically V for Vandetta  also written by the Wachowsky brothers has this similar theme of standing up to the man. An incredibly simple scene sums up the entire film. In the comedic storyline near the end the old escapees are in a bar having a beer when the cross dressing Weaving who made it big as a cross dresser in Pricilla Queen of the Desert arrives to take them back to the oppressive old age home. The little old man who barely speaks a word the little voice stands up and incites a riot. Just as Halle Barry reveals a report that ends a conspiracy or Doona Bae's viral video that incites an uprising that saves the lives of millions. The message here is a little voice can incite a thousand little voices. One singe drop. One single ripple. One perfect movie. If the message of Cloud Atlas is true then I hope that the creation of this film will inspire a million voices to make a million ripples. I for one am inspired. I will add to this review as I let the ripples spread in my mind. For now that's all I got.".

Where you are naive is when you say 'the movie' is what is great. What is great in reality is the story. You would be just as well served by reading the book. The movie however is so horrible it's painful. If the movie was a Shakespearean play performed in Shakespearean times then I can understand how people could enjoy it. It honestly views as a play on a stage. The made up languages accents and ways of speaking are so outlandish it's impossible to follow and horribly acted... The feeling of the movie is fake and incredibly laughable especially when it's clear that the director was going for realism and suspense but failed so very horribly.

Now cut each one into sections of less than 60 seconds then splice them all together in a seemingly random way. This is an accurate representation of the three hours that is cloud atlas. Does that sound like an appealing way to absorb 9 different stories? All being intercut with one another until it's impossible to keep track of them? It also doesn't help that each character is played by the same actor. I know it's supposed to be their past lives but it just makes it more confusing. Now I'm not going to jump on the lovehate bandwagon. There were good things about it and bad things too. The idiots will say It's stupid! and the film snobs will say Your IQ is low if you didn't get it. I understand that it was about a grand scale idea that our past lives affect our future lives and vice versa.

I tried to find humour in Ben Stiller's performance but I'm sorry I'm not 10 years old and don't do dope or take drugs of any kind. I just don't find Ben Stiller funny in any of his films though I bet there are any number of people behind the camera laughing at his every wide eyed attempt at ironic humour his manager his agent his psychiatrist etc. Frankly I don't think even he gets it. His idea of comedy died with the Three Stooges. Only Phil Silvers can carry off being Phil Silvers even Steve Martin must be aware of that by now know what I mean. Be original! The first rule of comedy is IT HAS TO BE FUNNY! It wasn't. I'd like to see Stiller in a dramatic gritty role for a change. I bet he'd make a great action actor with say Bruce Willis he'd nail it. I have yet to see a subtle comic performance from him. Those eyes and expressions of his have been done to death. The only one who made me remotely smile was Richard Ayoade a man who through his hit UK sitcom The IT Crowd which made the absurd brilliantly hysterical has a genuine feel for absurd throw away dialogue. Jonah Hill can be very very funny and anarchic but in this he was miscast sorry Jonah. Vince Vaughn IfIshoutloudenoughit'llbefunny brand of comedy just annoyed me. It was insulting. They were all doing their own bit but none of them seemed to be relating to the others. Yes if that was the point it didn't work. Anyone one of their characters in reality would have walked away from the others. Comedy comes out of real situations. None of that had any sense of reality about it. It was like a low budget remake of The Burbs kind of but without the class and black humour. My advice is don't watch it. Go and paint your car or knit yourself a suit of armour or something. You'd be better employed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never claimed to be a screenwriter nor would I even try to be but it seems to me that if The Watch had just been about a group of goofy inept overthetop neighborhood watchmen then it could have been a much tighter coherent and interesting endeavor. Under the eye of director Akiva Schaffer Hot Rod and penmanship of writers Jared Stern Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen however the film is badlymanaged and all over the map  thematically speaking. I use writing loosely though since much of the dialogue was adlibbed by leads Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn and the undisciplined approach certainly shows with these vulgar and stilted performances.Adding murder mutilation orgies and an illconceived alien invasion just shows the desperation and bloated budget the cast and crew were forced to work with. Never has the phrase less is more been so sorely needed in a socalled comedic production.Thus the first pairing of Stiller and Vaughn since 2005s Dodgeball A True Underdog Story is sadly wasted as the laughs come few and far between. And when they do they are usually overshadowed by following sequences of slaughter mayhem and utter confusion that leaves both casual film patron and experienced movie critic scratching their collective heads in complete bewilderment.The ludicrous plot has longtime Costco manager Evan Stiller grieving over the killing of a Mexican security guard in a most offensive and stereotypical scene. Starting a comedy with a vicious bloody murder is hardly the best way to go but that is just the beginning of this film's problems.Appearing in front of a high school football audience in one of the few really funny sequences Evan makes an appeal for neighborhood watch recruits but can only attract three weirdos  Bob Vaughn Franklin Jonah Hill fresh from 21 Jump Street and an Oscar nominated performance in Moneyball and Jamarcus Richard Ayoade  who use the situation to get away from their wives and family members and look to get drunk and party.The quartet is a joke a really UNfunny joke however being ridiculed by smartmouthed teens random citizens and local law enforcement. When more murders take place though as well as the discovery of a forthcoming alien invasion the group begins to suspect most everyone in the small Ohio town is involved because evidently the invaders can also assume human form any further plot explanation is really unnecessary at this point.Along the way there are also several pointless subplots in The Watch one including Bob's slutty daughter Chelsea Erin Moriarty and her sexcapades as well as Evan's low sperm count neither of which is even remotely interesting or humorous. Lame supporting characters include Will Forte MacGruber as the disbelieving town cop and Rosemarie DeWitt Your Sister's Sister as Evan's nondescript wife. Then the final conflict takes place at the Costco store and like the rest of the enterprise is boring confusing and nowhere near as comedic as it needed to be.And so The Watch the muchanticipated StillerVaughn reunion well anticipated by SOME people I suppose falls flat on its face. The painfully humorless and obscene story that meanders around like a rudderless alien spacecraft makes this comedy one of the most disappointing and depressing adventures of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me this movie is a clear sign that some filmmakers still care about making a good comedy. The movie is not just simple cheap predictable laughs it actually is being one that relies on its story development and character buildup.No I'm not saying that this is a very clever or brilliantly written and made movie but I definitely prefer the approach of this movie above that of the average and more standard modern comedy. This is being a somewhat more subtle movie with all of its comedy and how it got incorporated into the movie.Thing that made this movie especially great and fun to watch for me were its characters. The movie truly is mostly about its characters and their interactions with each other. All of the actors play quite well off each other and manage to give their characters some distinctive and enjoyable personalities. Really without the movie its characters and actors portraying them this would had most likely been a terribly weak movie.It's true that most of the actors are playing the same type of characters they often play. Ben Stiller again plays a normal guy who gets caught up in a crazy situation and Vince Vaughn basically is being a big manchild again. But somehow it all works out quite well and entertaining for the movie and I even dare to say that some of the biggest Stiller andor Vaughn haters still could get some enjoyment out of this movie and not feel annoyed by their performances and characters. It's hard not to really spoil this movie but it's about something way more than just about a neighborhood watch with a bunch of misfits in it. There are some interesting and unexpected developments in this movie at least when you haven't heard about them already. I won't say anything about it since I feel that it's more fun to just go into this movie without knowing what is going to happen in it. So I advice you to also stay away from any trailers and just let this movie surprise you.I simply had a good time watching this movie!710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The Watch is a funny buddy comedy filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller Vaughn the rest of the cast and writer Seth Rogen. Like a delicious onion the film does a good job peeling away at the story. Yes it is not hard see the plot coming but it's how the characters deal with the situations they encounter that makes the film entertaining. Crybaby critics with their stuck up trendy smugness See told you the plot was predictable.. Wow way to over dramatize the obvious you're so clever. I bet that Titanic ending took you by surprise? For all those critics who whine and cry about The Watch maybe they should just stay home and watch one of their Disney classics on VHS. This is a great film to see escape the chaotic world and have a few laughs.".

Vince Vaughn had a few funny moments but again he played the same character we've seen in all of his prior movies. And Will Forte he only has one character. At least he was irritating. Costco was funnier than any of these hasbeens and neverweres. The plot was contrived and struggled to stay together throughout. I would have walked out but for Jonah Hill who was genuinely funny and needs to stop carrying other people's movie's. Even with his moments of brilliance I could not wait for the movie to be over.

	schema:reviewBody "It's got a great cast an interesting setup some hilarious dialogue  and space aliens. The Watch is stocked with immature humor grossout  gags and crass conversations as one would expect but once the  otherworldly visitors appear it simply doesn't gel. The concept of  defending against an extraterrestrial invasion has been successfully  merged with humor before see Men in Black Mars Attacks! and Attack  the Block but here it feels like an afterthought neither authentic  nor necessary in conveying a story of misfit buddies attempting to  protect their town. There are a few undeniably funny moments of  vulgarity styled after the laughs often found in the works of Jonah  Hill and Seth Rogen but these segments feel misplaced in a film that  can't wrap itself around a sensible plot to showcase the comedy.  Evan Trautwig Ben Stiller loves his town of Glenview Ohio and is  deeply devoted to both the community and his job as the manager of the  local Costco. But when the night guard at his store is brutally  murdered Evan determines to get even more involved and creates his own  neighborhood watch to help the undermanned police department track  down the killer. Recruiting Bob Vince Vaughn an overprotective  father who just wants to hang out with the guys Franklin Jonah Hill  a triggerhappy maniac rejected by the police department for mental  instability and Jamarcus Richard Ayoade a mildmannered Brit with a  fantasy of rescuing lonely housewives Evan attempts to lead his misfit  gang in search of clues. When the group uncovers the unearthly beings  behind the crime they must band together to save not only their  beloved town but also the whole world.  The Watch is a confusing mess of genres delving into comedy horror  with bloody violence and slimy monstrosities drama romance of the  lighthearted kind and actionadventure bizarrely fixating on  slowmotion shootouts. At times even when it's just comedic it  switches between slapstick situational dialoguedriven  teenoriented and raunchy. It never knows what it wants to be partly  thanks to the shifting styles and perhaps mostly due to the current  events surrounding the real life Neighborhood Watch shooting in  Florida a tragic incident and extremely unfortunate coincidence for  the marketing of this movie  forcing plenty of edits and the changing  of the title. Regardless of the controversial subject matter the  unearthly direction The Watch chooses to go spells certain doom for the  effectiveness of the humor. Like a spoof of Invasion of the Body  Snatchers coupled with a cross between Men in Black and Old School  there's simply no home for the vast range of unrelated settings  characters actions and conversations largely involving bodily fluids  as if preoccupied with duplicating the verbiage of Superbad  which is  not surprising considering scripting by Seth Rogen.  Tackling the classic scenario of a common quiet little suburb becoming  immersed in extraordinary occurrences with a few central roles being  the only ones aware of the situation The Watch borrows too heavily  from previously established filmic premises. What's worse is the  promising ensemble cast which looks good on paper but results in  disinterest. Stiller is once again the straight man insistent on doing  his job Vaughn is the loudmouthed instigator and Hill is the kooky  oddball spouting most of the offthewall comments and revealing his  life to be the least matured. Will Forte rounds out the group with an  amusing appearance as the stereotypical incompetent overconfident  cop. While themes of isolation suspicion control reclaiming family  values and expending limitless ammo in an environment free from  sincere physical consequences seep into the mundane plot the  disorganized and extraneous feel of many of the scenes causes The Watch  to be a consistently threadbare bore.

The remainder of the attempted humor involved Vince Vaughn rambling on far far too long in blatantly obvious ignorance to the task at hand. I know that's supposed to be the humor but it just isn't. At all. And worse yet it's just really annoying. I had higher hopes for Richard Ayoade who was hilarious in the series IT Crowd but the gratuitously vulgar and sexual references shoehorned into the dialog significantly detracted from my previous opinion of him. But here again if you're taste in humor includes jokes about someone hoping to have their balls sucked this is probably right up your alley. While I can't say that I've ever found Vince Vaughn's trademark and only character terribly funny Ben Stiller can play a genuinely funny roll. Whether it's a career on the wain or just a bad plotscript this is not one of Stiller's better performances.

Wrapped around supposedly funny cast with a very predictable script to waste 1.5 hours of your life. At first glance I thought I would see a great slapstick comedy with an interesting script of otherworldly creatures attempt to invade a neighborhood and the men with humdrum lives getting together to form a neighborhood watch team protect their neighborhood from the aliens but the movie was not up to par at all. I think Ben Stiller can be funny when he is by himself than teaming up with others to be funny. I loved the Zoelander for sure  I loved all the Fockers sequels except for the Christmas one. I rate The watch 1 out of 10.".

There is no real humor in the movie the acting is very poor the writing is terrible and who knows why this was even produced. The CGI aliens are fairly well done but do come across as just a rip of the Aliens movies. The supposed sex scenes don not show anything which is not a bad thing but they are extremely hookie. The police sergeant is a typical comedy tool that of course comes around at the end of the show.".

	schema:reviewBody "2012 was a really rough year for Ben Stiller with 'Tower Heist' barely breaking even 75M budget78M domestic152M worldwide and 'The Watch' a bona fide box office flop 68M budget35M domestic68M worldwide. So you have to ask yourself how could a film which featured Ben Stiller Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill have failed so miserably? Three words IT WASN'T FUNNY!!!!! Plus I really have to question director Akiva Schaffer's vision for this film what was this film suppose to be? A comedy a sci fi film an alien invasion flick a murder investigation whodoneit film a buddy flick or a neighbor watch group defending its home turf movie??? My suggestion would have been to pick one genre and run with however this film trying to be all of these movies was just too insurmountable to achieve!!!!Ben Stiller stars as Evan a local Costco manager. When his nightshift security guard is mysteriously killed and skinned while at work Evan organizes a neighborhood watch group to find the perpetrator of this hideous crime. However the ragtag group of individuals who answer his flyers include the following Bob Vince Vaughn a husband desperately seeking other men's camaraderie Franklin Jonah Hill a police academy reject and Jamarcus Richard Ayoade the token black guy.This bumbling foursome is able to uncover that aliens have invaded their little metropolis and are walking amongst the human populace in the skinned carcasses of their victims. Furthermore the aliens are also on the verge of completing a radio transmitter which will signal their home planet and commence a planetary invasion. However to make this film into a comedy writers Jared Stern and Seth Rogen decided that the only way the kill the invading horde is to shoot them in the nads nuts penis region. This film fails miserably on every level. On a comedic level the film isn't funny. As a Sci Fi film it's comparable to 'Mars Attacks'. There is absolutely zero charisma between any of the actors to justify calling this a buddy picture. For a film to be a successful comedy the jokes should flow freely and effortlessly however this film just tries WAY TOO HARD and the jokes are forced and unfunny. The film sequence where the watch group apprehends their first alien creature and decides to photograph the event for posterity reasons starts out fine enough then spirals out of control into some sort drunken frat party gone awry. And as stated above it's not funny.This is not a dreadful film however this much talent should have been able to produce a raucously hilarious film with little or no effort. But what we the audience got was just that little or no effort. My understanding is that almost 60 of the script was actually adlib  improv'd by the actors. Note to writers. Do your damn job comedic actors are only as funny as the written words you have them say!!! I cannot recommend viewing this film. This film is neither good enough to enjoy nor bad enough to mock therefore leaving the audience in that indifferent state of being. Indifferent is definitely one place I do not prefer to be when watching a supposed comedy and would suggest you bypass this humorless travesty.See more of my reviews on FB  The Faris Reel".

Jonah Hill has been in some great films in the last few years Moneyball 21 Jump Street but has also been in some really bad films The Sitter was the latest example. Unfortunately he's not doing well here either. The Watch is another example of a film that sacrifices jokes and good performances for grossout humor and it's not very funny. Just like That's My Boy.The film starts off with Ben Stiller's character who forms a bunch of clubs because he has no friends. He then starts the Neighborhood Watch the original title of this film to try and find aliens that might live in the neighborhood. Vaughn and Hill are two of the new members and they both have their share of problems. I won't spoil anything else for you but this is a raunchy unfunny gross film that almost treats the audience like idiots. I can't tell whether or not this is worse than That's My Boy but it comes pretty close. This is easily one of the worst films of the year. Do yourselves a favor and don't see this but considering the fact the film hasn't done well at the box office you probably haven't seen it. Good for you!Final Verdict 210".

I still ask aren't there any screenplay writers out there capable of writing anything but foul language? Is that the skill level now? If so everyone out of the pool.no I mean everyone gets fired and they start all over with some fresh talent in Hollywood. Even when there is a bit of a plot an idea to develop it all seems to hinge on each and every actor speaking as filthy as possible calling it a movie wrapping it up and sending it out to the public.that same public I guess with standards set so low as to accept this stuff as worthy of spending money on.So I am left wondering...is there no one to actually look at this stuff before it's finished? Nobody capable of stepping back and saying Hey I think we might have something here but let's clean it up and put some creativity into producing something the audience will be happy to sit through. I suppose once upon a time a long long time ago foul language was a shocker and if nothing else the writers directors producers could go for the shock value. Not so much anymore. How about digging a little deeper and coming up with actual creativity? Too much to ask? I don't think so. Why not give it a try? In this case as I said earlier it got so downright stupidsilly as to end up being amusing. plus there was a bit of a twist there to spice it up. But come on..give us real dialog even if it means someone has to strain to produce it. We deserve it. We're the movieloving public. The people who like to go to the theater and then buy the movie when it comes out in DVD. Only we don't these days....'cause there is precious little to either want to see or certainly not to own.".

The trailer didn't look good and It seemed like it would just be a deadbeat comedy that lacked laughs. This film is actually one of the funniest i've seen this summer! The cast did a great job in their roles and all of them are really funny! The plot was actually one of the more original ones i've seen in a comedy in a long time which I really enjoyed. The film provides a good amount of laughs as well as some action as well. I was also surprised by how raunchy the film was. Trust me when I say this is a HARD R comedy. There were also more than a few twist in this film that really caught me off guard. Without spoiling anything I will say that The Watch is one of the funniest movies you will see this year and I highly recommend it! If you thought Ted was funny you ain't seen nothing yet!".

	schema:headline " I Loved It";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I see a movie that I get really excited about I seek out reviews from professional critics and fellow fans. Often times they will point out things that I may not have noticed and it's exciting to feel connected to someone through art. When I find lots of negative reviews I begin to feel a sort of let down. I wonder if my opinion was wrong or why I'm the only one who liked it. Keep in mind I'm an 18yearold girl so I have not yet grown out of such thoughts. I am also not an authority on film. Everything I know I learnt from reading Roger Ebert and watching lots and lots of movies. However this movie really stuck with me. I saw it 2 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. I decided to take a page out of Ebert's book and explain why I loved it instead of just saying it's awesome. Here's why 1. The Children I'm a sucker for kids in movies especially when they actually get to act like kids. The 1yearold Lily and 3yearold Victoria are so beautiful that they tug at your heartstrings without even trying. They were well cast. 6year old Lily and 8yearold Victoria were truly phenomenal little actresses. Megan Charpentier already a seasoned veteran with previous credits including Jennifer's Body Red Riding Hood and Resident Evil Retribution handles this heavy subject matter with maturity and poise. She manages to balance innocence with experience. She has been traumatized by her past maybe her heart is a little harder than the average 8yearold if it wasn't she wouldn't have survived all that time but we still get glimpses of the little girl who just wants a mommy. Isabelle Nlisse is in my opinion genius as little Lily. I think CGI must have been used to make her movements appear more animalistic but a child of her age maintaining such seriousness is riveting to watch. When she plays with her toys it's like watching an actual feral child in a documentary I repeat it is LIKE watching a feral child not IDENTICAL to.2. The Parents Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj CoasterWaldau as the uncle and uncle's girlfriend of the little girls are very well cast. I was a bit sceptical of Jessica Chastain's rocker chick look but she brings such life and courage to her character that you actually see her as a bass player instead of a classically beautiful Hollywood star trying to look like a bass player. I had never heard of Nikolaj CoasterWaldau before this film. I love how much he loves the girls. His caring for them is so sincere and honest. You truly believe that he is the kind of guy who would spend 5 years and money he doesn't have on the hope that his nieces might still be alive. He is a loving father figure who doesn't get as much time with the girls as her should in my humble opinion.3. Mama The demonspiritghostentitywhatchamacallit of Mama was created using CGI and a very tall thin actor. Many audience members laughed when Mama first came in to full view. I agree that she looked a little funny. Her hair was really weird and antigravity like Mama in the short film and her face was oddly asymmetrical. However I think that she was perfect. Just the right amount of creepy and sad. This is one of the only horror movies in existence that causes the audience to feel real sympathy for the evil villain.4. The Director I admire Andrs Muschietti for taking so many risks. It is rare to find a filmmaker today who will go against what the audience may want. He didn't use any fake scares the situation was scary enough on its own. There are brilliant moments of natural humour that were so refreshing. He did not mock his characters or the situation but he found the string of comedy that was there already and used it to his advantage. How many times have you been having a miserable day and then just stopped and started laughing about how everything went wrong? That is the humour of Mama.5. The Story Part of the reason that I love horror movies is that they aren't bound by the usual visionary constraints of say Italian neorealism films. Tragic stories are exciting and implausible all at the same time. I think that this was a very original take on a story of motherdaughter bonding. Of course there's no such thing as a completely original story but there is such thing as a completely original vision. The story affected me very deeply. I'm still trying to come to terms with how it ended.6. Using Clichs Effectively There are a lot of clichs involved in making a horror film. There are only so many ways to introduce the plot line of a supernatural being. This genre requires stock characters and they do their jobs well. They use some of my favourite scare tactics using a camera as a light source unexpected appearances by the entity etc.... Those particular clichs are necessary. Would you really want to see a Jim Carrey comedy where he uses dry humour and no body language? Or a Baz Luhrman film with dull colours and understated characters? Clichs are not always a bad thing.This is why I loved this film. Agree or disagree but you can't say I didn't think it through.Take care Hannah".

	schema:reviewBody "Mama is directed by Andres Muschietti and written by Muschietti Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross. It stars Jessica Chastain Nikolaj CoasterWaldau Megan Charpentier Isabelle Nelisse Daniel Kash Javier Botet and Jane Moffat. Music is by Fernando Velazquez and cinematography by Antonio Riestra.A Suicidal father abducts his two young daughters and takes them to a cabin out in the woods his intention is to kill them. Before he can enact his plan he is killed by a strange entity leaving the two girls alone in the cabin. Years later the girls are discovered in the cabin completely feral and when any sense can finally be made out of them they talk of being looked after by someone they call Mama And it seems Mama has come back with them to civilisationBased on his own 2008 Argentinian short of the same name Andres Muschietti expands the idea out to a full length feature film. With pretty decent results as well. Pic is a supernatural fairytale thick on ethereal atmosphere and not over reliant on boo jumps or an adherence to blood and guts spilling just to put bums on seats. From the moment the girls are found scampering around the wood cabin on all fours clearly having survived on cherries for five years there's an uneasy feel to the story. We already know there is a spirit involved as we half glimpsed Mama during the precredits sequence what we need now is a good story and a healthy quota of frights and peril for Waldau and Chastain as they become surrogate parents to the troubled youngsters And again Mama mostly delivers all that is required of it for a good night in by the fire whilst perched on the edge of your seat.Chastain is excellent as the punk rock chick reluctantly mothering two children before her time the two girls Charpentier and Nelisse are also top draw exuding the sadness and confusion that children of that age would obviously be feeling under these circumstances. While their reactions to what we ourselves can't see via glances or hushed exchanges has a creepiness to it that delivers a bucket load of dread. Muschietti's direction is very stylish not only does he marshal his principal cast members with great skill he shows some ingenuity in scene staging with one sequence particularly brilliant as Chastain does housework and the younger of the girls plays with Mama in the bedroom we know it even though we can only see the wee bairn. The soundtrack and score is suitably screechy and the cinematography by Riestra has Gothic tints to it.Why Mama is not a bona fide entry in the upper echelons of horror is mainly due to an annoying mistake that so many horror genre film makers make namely showing too much of the spook. There is a point around the hour mark where Mama herself just stops being scary a shame because the effects work isn't half bad. There's other less itchy problems such as Waldau being reduced to a bit player from the midpoint a subplot involving Kash's Dr. Dreyfuss just feels like setup material while the ending is sure to be a bit too WTF for some. That said this is good genre cinema for those who like The Woman in Black type of thrills and story telling. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "A ghost is an emotion bent out of shape condemned to repeat itself time and time again.Another South American director has made his splash on Hollywood after the successful debut of Mama in theaters this year. Argentinean director Andres Muschietti made over 70 million dollars in the box office and received decent reviews for this horrorsuspense film based on a short 3 minute movie he directed in 2008. That short film garnered the attention of movie executives such as Guillermo Del Toro who decided to produce and present this film. The fact that Del Toro's name was used here and that the coveted Jessica Chastain signed on to play the main character gave Muschietti the tremendous possibility of debuting on a high note. The formula worked pretty well because critics and audiences seemed to enjoy this film alike and we could be heading to the start of a new horror franchise. I enjoyed most of the movie and loved Jessica Chastain's performance but the ending just ruined the entire film for me. It is kind of the same problem pretty much every ghost story film has. I feel like most of the endings in this genre are pretty unsatisfying and ruin the entire suspense the film has been building throughout the story. There is no denying that Japanese films have heavily influenced the genre with films such as The Ring The Grudge Dark Water and One Missed Call which have all been remade but the truth of the matter is the only film that really worked with critics was The Ring. They have tried to imitate its success but I haven't been scared like I was with The Ring which had a pretty satisfying ending compared to the rest. I do prefer this type of psychological horror more than the gory slasher films but I find it troubling that they can't find a satisfying ending. My favorites in this genre will always be the first two I saw Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath and The Ring. The rest have all fallen short. Mama was close to achieving that similar success in my opinion but the ending really hurt it.The film centers around two girls named Lilly Isabelle Nelisse and Victoria Megan Charpentier who are abandoned in a cabin in the middle of the woods after their father murdered their mother and was attacked by some presence inside the cabin. Five years later the search finally pays off and their Uncle Lucas Nikolaj CoasterWaldau finds them. To everyone's surprise the two girls have managed to survive on their own but they live like animals crawling around the floor and talking to walls. Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel Jessica Chastain decide to raise the kids with the help of Dr. Dreyfuss Daniel Kash who continues to treat the girls in order for them to make the transition from their isolated lives to a normal and nurturing family life. Annabel soon discovers that these girls might have never been on their own and that somehow the presence that was with them in the cabin might be in their home as well. Several suspenseful and horrifying events begin to take place while the girls continue to talk to shadows in the walls and call out for Mama.The film has several thrills and suspenseful moments with a great performance from Jessica Chastain. It was good to see her try out a different role and she proves she can do about everything. It's hard to find good performances in horror films but this may be one of the best. The movie also has its weaknesses like pretty much all horror films do considering the protagonists always seem to make stupid decisions but that is what makes the genre so entertaining at times. They are clichs which we have learned to accept. The two girls were also surprisingly good they had strong performances as well. I really enjoyed everything about the movie up to the last 15 minutes which pretty much ruined everything. Psychological thrillers usually have this impact they begin with a lot of promise but end up on the wrong note and that is exactly how I felt about Mama along with Sinister a similar movie I got to see a few months ago. The film is above average thanks to Jessica Chastain and Guillermo Del Toro's influence in the production of the movie but that is about it. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

Psychological thrillers usually have this impact they begin with a lot of promise but end up on the wrong note and that is exactly how I felt about Mama along with Sinister a similar movie I got to see a few months ago. The film is above average thanks to Jessica Chastain and Guillermo Del Toro's influence in the production of the movie but that is about it. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "The title may be tacky but this CanadianSpanish coproduction with Guillermo del Toro lending his name as producer is one of the better horror films to have come out from the West in recent years despite being filled with the usual clichs actually contain a proper story and delivered really well in terms of chills thrills and everything that's necessary to creep you out and make you jump at your seat. Cowritten and directed by Andres Muschietti Mama shows how it boils down to story building upon his short film of the same name some 5 years ago and a solid cast to gloss over the expected bag of tricks.Many of the clichs were put to good effect which in some ways you'd come to expect certain things to happen in a certain way and they did. While it may be blunted in terms of anticipation and build up it didn't shy away from delivering that sucker punch when required and kept good work in framing and editing for maximum impact when the moment called for the unabashed dip into tried and tested elements. One thing you'll note is how assured Muschietti's direction is as if doing it all for the very first time with the aim of wanting to stir up its scares really well. Liberal use of CG also helped but never done in slipshoddy fashion which added a layer of positive production values to the film.I mean there's creepy children a ghoul that gatecrashes a reunion of sorts and the usual spooky house no thanks to noises during strange timings and the rote blinking of lights. All ingredients that you've seen utilized to the death in various horror film productions but coming together really well in Mama playing to the strengths of these elements while fiercely ignoring the negativity associated with lazier filmmakers who just slap these elements together expecting them to work. It's not a special effects extravaganza when it's not required and Mama showed just how its story and characters were allowed to lead rather than to have strangely illogical moments even for a horror film fall coincidentally into place.Jessica Chastain may be the latest IT girl in Hollywood and it's encouraging to note she's really going all out to take on various roles in different genres despite her more recent art house leanings of late. Here she's the quintessential scream queen albeit only just given her role of Annabel being a rock star wannabe sporting almost full body tattoos that betray a rather soft demeanour when her maternal instincts get called upon to look after the nieces of her boyfriend Lucas Nikolaj CoasterWaldau. They were found after having disappeared for five years which the opening sequence and credits would have pointed to an unnatural upbringing under the hands of the titular Mama ghoul. Battling for custody it is with reluctance that the couple take the children under their wing probably because Annabel knows she'll eventually be dumped with the kids which did happen.And the entire middle act is when the fun begins for fans of horror films forking out good money to be entertained with the roller coaster ride of scares. Muschietti and his story collaborators Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti managed to keep an entire back story up their sleeves to reveal them in teasing fashion which worked to keep you engaged throughout. And credit must go to Muschietti and his DP Antonio Riestra for having framed the initial introduction to the ghoulish elements that went for maximum WTF surprises especially with sleight of hand techniques that didn't jar the narrative nor relied on the necessity of a jump cut edit to hammer home its creepier moments. It grows slowly and that's one master stroke Mama had that worked wonders.This is the second film in a row that had its child actors provide top notch performances. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse play sisters who with the aid of CG move around complete with unnatural mannerisms having it in term to creep you out before having to develop their characters into emotional cores that added a lot more depth to this film as it steamrolls its way to the finale. Andres Muschietti is the name to watch now for taking something that's expected to be clich in a horror film but fulfilled more than you'd bargain for. A definite recommend!".

	schema:headline " A Fantastic Film Experience";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film with high expectations. I am a horror movie junkie despite their general lack of critical acclaim. They should be entertaining even if they don't give you nightmares. After first viewing the trailer over the summer rolling in for The Possession I eagerly anticipated the January release. Seeing that Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to the project made me even more giddy. I saw it opening night.I was not disappointed. Not in the slightest. In fact I was happier with the movie than I intended to be. Believe me that's saying something.Not one scared by stories themselves but solely by moments that utilize the element of surprise I have never jumped out of my skin more times during a single film than I did for Mama. That pretty much makes it the scariest movie that I have ever seen. However seeing as different things scare different people that is most likely not the same for everyone. If you aren't a jumper don't worry it's still very much worth it.The story is not your typical ghost story. It has a terrific exposition to settle you into the film's focus. The situation is solitary enough that you won't yourself experience it but isn't so farfetched that it's unbelievable. The characters are both likable and flawed which gives them dimension and makes them more interesting. And the girls are adorable but not so cute that it detracts from the terror. As you can see the film is very much balanced. A good film needs that balance.As far as scares go some are quite subtle. A few you don't particularly realize are happening until something changes and you're caught offguard. Seeing that the premise is supernatural the idea of an elusive antagonist is key. You can't see too much of what you're supposed to be afraid of and for the majority of the movie you don't. The cloud of mystery surrounding Mama herself is hauntingly beautiful and will both demonize and delight you. By the time you finish it you will most likely feel both happy and sad and will not know where your emotions should be.I highly recommend Mama to anyone because it is not your stereotypical horror movie. Its distinct lack of gore and high level of wellcrafted story makes for an exciting experience for both horror lovers and those who don't necessarily appreciate the genre. If you get the chance to watch it take it immediately. If you aren't given the chance to watch it make the chance yourself.".

While trapped in the woods Victoria Megan Charpentierand Lily Isabelle Nelisse formed a guardian to protect and care for them who they call Mama.This is an excellent movie. Be warned that it does remain dependant on jump scares to scare you but they are what I like to call true jump scares. Not a cat bursting out of a corner or a shoe falling from the sky. Mama utilizes CGI by creating dark disturbing images along with a tense orchestral sound track to scare your pants off. The acting was also superb particularly Jessica Chastain and Megan Charpentier. Isabelle was solid also but I had a feeling that before every take she was told what to do but Megan was old enough to understand the script and story. Something that really impressed me was how the story unfolded and how beautifully the mother daughter relationship was portrayed. The cinematography was also one of the most beautiful jobs I've ever seen on a horror film. Camera work was steady and the dolly shots were smooth and suspenseful. Overall Mama was a terrifying horror movie with a beautiful story and wonderful camera work. I hope this movie is recognized as a classic for years to come. This movie also proves that PG13 horror movies can be scary after all. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Horror has been one of the least appreciated film genres nowadays for relying nothing more than the excessive amount of violence and repetitive jump scares plodding the storytelling by its completely lifeless characters who are ready to get killed. Mama is something else however it still has those horror movie clichs like those easy loud jump scares and some ghostly pathos but there is a fascinating concept behind the scares that leaves the audience a beautiful story than just a cheap horror shock. It also has a set of strong performances and solid production. It could have been much genuine in being scary than simply loud but Mama is still one of the great horror films we got in a while.Unlike most modern horror films this movie's ambition is to tell a compelling story. Obviously there is a hidden emotion beneath the concept but before we get to that it explores around the characters and the gloomy atmosphere. Rather than throwing a horrific death scene to show fear it scatters some symbolic objects that indicate the presence of the titular monster. It's a fascinating trick of manifesting its mysteries and fear. What defy the odds of the genre are the characters. They are not only ought to get scared. This is a rare set of modern horror characters that possesses a genuine soul. The performances handle them terrifically. There is a lot of remarkable performance to talk about but anyway. It's not only about the scares. It finely balances the drama to the darkness of the story. Personally it's kind of more interesting when it simply tells the story of the two kids and the Mama ghost even though it features a horror clich of ghosts telling their past to the central character. In the end we'll realize the film actually offers more to the picture.The only largest misstep they had is the excessive amount of loud jump scares. Though they can be effective at some point. They still used some other ways of scaring the audience like mimicking the clever horror trick of The Orphanage and letting the character be alone exploring the creepiness going on. It could have lingered on those parts to feel the danger of the characters but instead they immediately send off a loud jump scare because it works to everyone. The film uses some CGI which made the monsters look a bit awkward but they are decent enough. Everything looks great in general. The cinematography and the production are a total pay off. It's just beautiful to look at.Mama turns out to be pretty good. At glance it doesn't look like the kind of horror film we usually thought about but furthermore we get to realize it is beyond than we should expect. The clichs still exists but they are used in a better way. Putting aside those cheap scares it's a refreshing story that is indeed worth telling. It's still far from classic but it is also far from generic and annoying like most horror films we get these days. The performances and the filmmaking give more to the experience. Mama is the kind of horror film that abandons the gruesome acts and rather shows its dark aspects in a quite endearing way.".

	schema:reviewBody "When sisters Lily and Victoria are left in the woods after a series of horrific events leaves them orphaned how would they survive for the next five years until they are eventually rescued? Have no fear Mama is here. The debut feature from Spanish director Andres Muschietti has some plot hole but still delivers the goods in a scary almost poignant way.In Mama there are similarities to the American version of The Ring in the way some of the scenes are shot in that grainy static antiquated black and white style. Horrorghost film fans might think parts of the film are clichd and they would be correct. However the two sisters in the film played by Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse make for interesting viewing. As Victoria and Lilly the two are feral creatures having lived in the wild the bulk of their lives. Even after being taken in by their uncle Game Of Thrones' Nikolaj CoasterWaldau Lilly still prefers to run around on all fours eat with her hands while on the floor and sleep under her bed. Her speech is relegated to growls and grunts with a few words mixed in. Her big sister Victoria has a faster time assimilating to the civilized world. She even begins to cozy up to her uncle's punk rock girlfriend Annabel Jessica Chastain.What makes Mama work is the relationship between the female characters. Chastain  Take Shelter Zero Dark Thirty has the lead role. She's the girlfriend but becomes the unwilling stepmom to the two girls. The girls accept her to different degrees but still cling to each other first and foremost. They also cling to Mama and vice versa. Thus what you have is a battle of wills between the supernatural and the living world with the emotional and physical well being of two little girls hanging in the balance. Maybe the presence of Barbara Muschietti sister of the director as one of the producers and writers of the film had some influence on having women as the driving force.In addition Mama might feel and look like the style of Guillermo del Toro film. That could be because he executive produced the film. If you are familiar with his work you can see his hand in guiding this maiden voyage. Even so Mama stands on it's own merits. It's far from perfect. The acting especially from the kids some trippy and macabre imagery  and a bit of a twist might make you want to sleep with the lights on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was hoping there would be a way to write this review without adding any spoilers but the ending of this movie is so awful that it is unavoidable. Mama is the story of two young girls who are abandoned in the forest for five years and are discovered then brought back to civilization with the hope of rehabilitating and reintroducing them to a normal life. What is largely unseen for most of the movie is what the children describe as Mama a ghostly creature that had watched over them during their abandonment and who is now jealous of their new found family life. What works in this movie are the strong performances by the young girls unsure of their new environment and trying in their own elementary way to explain to other adults who Mama is. And for most of the movie we only get glimpses of Mama and the lessismore visualization works for the audience. We learn through the research of the child psychiatrist assigned to the girls that Mama is really a woman from 1800's who killed herself and her infant after escaping from an insane asylum. We are told that ghosts from the past return and torment those in the present until some wrong is righted. This could have sufficed to end this movie with an acceptable conclusion  but this movie went too far including the unnecessary death of one of the young girls at the end. We see the wrong righted with the return of the skeleton of Mama's infant baby returned to Mama reminiscent of the way that Johnny Depp tossed the head of the Headless Horseman to Christopher Walken in Sleepy Hollow leaving no further need for violence. But for reasons not easily explained Mama felt the need to take one of the living children with her after she had gotten what she came for. Furthermore when Mama is made visible to the adults and children at the end of the movie she looked more cartoonish than scary and became a caricature of the terrifying ghost represented earlier. A very disappointing ending to a film that showed promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mama is the first big horror film release of the year so as a horror movie fan I really wanted to watch this. It has the name of Guillermo del Toro not as director as I first thought but as a producer so we expected fantastic visuals. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jessica Chastain there too looking like I have not seen her before sporting a short dark Joan Jetthairstyle. This film really had a lot going for it.Mama is a malevolent female spirit who jealously hounds the couple Annabelle Jessica Chastain and Luke Nikolaj CoasterWaldau who adopts a couple of young girls who had been found living wildly in an abandoned cabin in the woods. Throughout this movie in the way of disturbing dreams and jarring apparitions we join Annabelle try to discover what exactly Mama wants that she cannot seem to get. Firsttime feature film director Andrs Muschietti succeeds to create a horror film that was visually stunning as it was emotionally charged. The stylish look may have been influenced by the producer Guillermo del Toro. The emotional ride was largely due to the restrained yet effective performance of Jessica Chastain as a single rockerchick who was suddenly given the unexpected and unwelcome responsibility of being a stepmother to two very disturbed girls.The one drawback for me was Mama herself particularly how she looked. I admit I did not really like how she reminded me so much of Sadako of the Ring films in all its obvious computergenerated glory. However the camera angles used to show Mama and her point of view were quite innovative. There were gaping plot holes when you think the story through and try to give explanations to Mama's illogical behavior. But hey she is a crazy ghost after all! Just sit back imbibe the creepy atmosphere and feel the emotion in the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying I never and i mean never post reviews but this movie was so bad I feel like it is my duty as a human being to warn the world of this abomination. Where to start...OK lets start with the positives. The movie starts off as a respectable film and what appears to be an interesting concept at first. The acting is pretty good considering the script they had to work with. I want to clarify it is not the actors fault for how bad this movie is.Now for the negatives the movie starts to fall apart the more you see Mama and all of her computer generated glory. She looks like a distorted Sarah Jessica Parker but far less scary than the real SJP. Its really hard to be scared of something that looks so unreasonably fake! I mean Disney's the haunted mansion staring Eddie Murphy has scarier CGI. Saying everything scary happens in the trailer would be far too kind because it wouldn't mention all the hilariously bad moments where Mama and her victims just stare at the camera making goofy Neanderthal faces. The cgi which i can not stress enough was a total joke was not even the worst part. The plot that seemed original in the beginning turns out to be as generic as possible and one really lame ass ghost story. I can't decide the worst part of it all it has to be either how unlikeable the main protagonist was or the egregiously bad endingoverall plot. The main protagonist is a rock star who is selfish at first and just an all around douche. She is completely self absorbed and immature and than just magically out of no where becomes a mother figure and loves these two girls and they some how love her after just 3 days. Once again the actors are not to blame they did their jobs the best they could given what they had to work with.Spoiler Overall summery of Mama's plotTwo little girls are raised by a ghost who...yep you guessed as it is trying to make up for the child she lost. The girls are found and given a home and new family by their aunt and uncle. Uncle gets put in a comma and aunt who isn't quite ready to raise children is left to raise them and falls in love with them like 3 days later. they are haunted by what could be the lamest ghost since Bill Cosby as ghost dad. Oh whats this? Giving mama her real baby back makes her stop haunting us? No way!!! Mama goes away taking one of the girls but leaving the other for some reason but not before literally punching a hole in the uncles heart....but its OK some how hes totally fine. The end".

	schema:reviewBody "Mama 2013  out of 4A couple Jessica Chastain Nikolaj CoasterWaldau take in their two young nieces five years after they were kidnapped by their father and spent the majority of that time alone and in the wilderness. The two girls slowly start to come out of their state but it doesn't take long for the couple to realize that there's something else with them. MAMA is a feature length version of a short film by the director and for most part it's a successful horror film. There are a few problems that we'll get to but for the most part I thought director Andres Muschietti did a fine job at really creating a dark atmosphere that hangs around the entire film. He also managed to use this atmosphere and make it very effective during many of the scenes which were quite creepy at times. I thought that really made the film stand out compared to so many other stories was the character played by Chastain. In most films like this you have the good person doing good deeds to protect the ones she loves. That's not the case here because her character doesn't want these girls doesn't like how they've changed her life and there's not really any cute scenes. The character development here is something quite rare in horror films but I think it really works itself out nicely. As for Chastain it's good that some of her caliber is here because a great performance really helps bring credit to the events in the film. The supporting players are good too and this is especially true of the two actresses playing the girls. Now what really doesn't work in the film is the CGI mama character. I'm sorry but I really don't see why you have to have poor looking CGI bring a film down. Not only is the CGI rather poor but the ghost creation just does so many unrealistic things that you can't help but not be frightened of it. The director does a good job at building up the tension but once the creature actually comes it goes away. Still MAMA is a pretty strong horror film that's not perfect but it's certainly good enough to watch.".

	schema:headline " An Unforgettable Experience Brought By Muschietti Del Toro and Chastain ! !";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all my fellow moviegoers and horrorfans i must begin by saying that even in a decade's time i doubt that my instant love for this film would have changed in any way.Was it because of the wonderful work of the entire cast and crew on the film that struck me?Or even that rare feeling you get when a film has been carefully nurtured with love and selflessness and raised up to be one of the best in the genre to come out for a good long while?Or is it the wonderful Jessica Chastain with a little mix of Nikolaj CoasterWaldau's assuring performance as Lucas and of course Isabelle Nlisse's and Megan Charpentier haunting performances of Lilly and Victoria.And once we are rolling and underway Muschietti and Del Toro never really let us go.Their ideas their intelligence and vision along with some brilliant acting made this film a special cinematic experience.Suspense and horror wise the filmmakers have made a wise choice not to go with blood gore and other clichs nowadays horrors are filled to the brim with.Another great choice is the masterful cast they have chosenChastain Waldau the whole cast.And since i'm very fond of Chastain i will get on the subject thoroughly in a moment.The film was shot in incredible style not revealing in the opening scenes and step by step showing more and more both story and emotional wise.Not only that but with the titular character of Mama we find more about her we see more of her and in the end we experience what means being her being all of them.This storytelling arc i found very suspenseful and the great character development in Annabel and Victoria the bigger sister lead up to the climax which is very heavy on emotions pain and a triumph of the director's extraordinary vision.Which in my humble opinion leads to the strongest quality that this film has in it's possessionthe cast!!Game of Thrones's Waldau does a really solid job portraying Lucas the uncle who never gave up on his nieces and kept searching when nobody else did he never let go.Isabelle Nlisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild insecure girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word girlfriend is very misleading in this situation it does no justice to the relationship between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling not just a bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically happens in every horror movie.But here people are fullblooded real emotional humane.So they clearly love each other after all Annabel stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces they moved in a new house together she left her life of the tattooed beerdrinking guitarplaying Rooney Mararesembling woman that was not yet ready to be a mother.At the end Annabel has become so fond of the girls that she takes the role of a real mother caring protecting and loving them when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and is gifted with the love of the bigger sister Victoria in return which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflictthe unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters and the choice that they have to make.A real mother or Mamaa hurt but jealous ghost with a history of her own a mother who is able to take a life in order to preserve it a mother who defended the two children for years in the wild as if they were her own but not a real fullblooded mother at all...There is no right choice here which means things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...So for those who were able to bear with me for so long i'm going to wrap it all in a nutshellthis film is an experience that needs to be seen an experience resembling a beautiful but also painful story with no winners and real human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica Chastain's warm and fullblooded portrayal of an otherwise clichd character that she shows has been played the wrong way all those years is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant and as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years for her devotion and skillfulness she is the best choice for this role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higherregarded as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps but for enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value in a world where scripts are better Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for an Oscar among other highprofile awards for her mesmerizing and beautiful yet humane portrayal of a forcedbythecircumstances mother ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.So with the 1000word limit upon me for one of the best films in the genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole this piece of devoted filmmaking and acting will keep you mesmerized until the very end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an impression on me and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again as soon as possible as she has proved to be equally impressive and devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has taken.The onetwo that's shaping up at the U.S. boxoffice this weekend for her proves she covers more cinematic ground than most and that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress Oscar this year as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero Dark Thirty!My ratea deserved 1010 !!!".

when nobody else did he never let go.Isabelle Nlisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild insecure girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word girlfriend is very misleading in this situation it does no justice to the relationship between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling not just a bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically happens in every horror movie.But here people are fullblooded real emotional humane.So they clearly love each other after all Annabel stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces they moved in a new house together she left her life of the tattooed beerdrinking guitarplaying Rooney Mararesembling woman that was not yet ready to be a mother.At the end Annabel has become so fond of the girls that she takes the role of a real mother caring protecting and loving them when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and is gifted with the love of the bigger sister Victoria in return which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflictthe unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters and the choice that they have to make.A real mother or Mamaa hurt but jealous ghost with a history of her own a mother who is able to take a life in order to preserve it a mother who defended the two children for years in the wild as if they were her own but not a real fullblooded mother at all...There is no right choice here which means things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...So for those who were able to bear with me for so long i'm going to wrap it all in a nutshellthis film is an experience that needs to be seen an experience resembling a beautiful but also painful story with no winners and real human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica Chastain's warm and fullblooded portrayal of an otherwise clichd character that she shows has been played the wrong way all those years is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant and as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years for her devotion and skillfulness she is the best choice for this role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higherregarded as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps but for enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value in a world where scripts are better Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for an Oscar among other highprofile awards for her mesmerizing and beautiful yet humane portrayal of a forcedbythecircumstances mother ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.So with the 1000word limit upon me for one of the best films in the genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole this piece of devoted filmmaking and acting will keep you mesmerized until the very end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an impression on me and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again as soon as possible as she has proved to be equally impressive and devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has taken.The onetwo that's shaping up at the U.S. boxoffice this weekend for her proves she covers more cinematic ground than most and that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress Oscar this year as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero Dark Thirty!My ratea deserved 1010 !!!";

	schema:reviewBody "If I had to summarize the review of this film into just two words those words would have to be Gawd Awful or Pure Stupidity both statements equally and eloquently captivate the essence of unbelievable stench that this film exudes. Written and Directed by Andres Muschiette it's actually quite comical to count how many times both he as his wife Barbara's names appear on the screen during the film's opening credits. Rated PG13 this film is further justification as to why you should not bother seeing horror movies geared toward younger tween audiences.The film centers around two sisters Victoria and Lilly. After their father shoots and kills his business partner and their mother he flees the scene of the crime with the two siblings in tow. High speeds and icy roads lead to an auto accident in the middle of nowhere. This motley crew is able to find shelter in an abandon house in the middle of the woods however with no food or water Jeffrey decides to shoot the siblings. Before Jeffrey can pull the trigger of his gun an entity Mama sweeps into the house and whisks Jeffrey away to oblivion. In the five years that follow Jeffrey's brother Lucas is still seeking closure to the events which occurred has hired trackers to comb the surrounding woods in hopes of finding his lost brother and nieces. The trackers stumble upon the abandon cabin where the two sisters more animal than human still reside. The authorities are notified and after a lengthy child custody hearing the two siblings are placed with their Uncle Lucas with visitation rights granted to his sisterinlaw Jean and child counseling sessions arranged with Dr. Dreyfuss. As you may assume with a film of this nature the Mama entity is not eager to lose her two adopted children and thus follows them to their new dwelling. Also the Mama entity is just a tad bit jealous so in an act of rage she inadvertently throws Uncle Lucas down a flight of stairs putting him into a coma This action brings us to Lucas' wife Annabel played by Jessica Chastain. Receiving incredible accolades for her role in 'Zero Dark Thirty' I can only imagine the horrors that must have been racing through her mind when she heard the studio decided to move up the release timeline for this film to capitalize on all her new found fame.Anyways to make a long story short it seems the Mama entity is destine to remain on Earth until it can right its wrong. In this particular instance she is trying to find her lost baby. Forced to jump off a cliff with her child in her arms when she was alive she was separated from her baby in the fall. If the movie would have followed the rules that it established then the film may not have been better however it would have at least made sense. In the films climatic conclusion where Mama entity and dead baby carcass are finally reunited the heavens should have opened up and the two should have ascended into eternal bliss but did this happen???? Oh no that would have made complete and utter sense to this completely ridiculous film. Instead writerdirector Muschietti decides that the Mama entity should leap off the cliff with her new improved living daughters.This is definitely one of those films in which you have to ask yourself Well what happened the following day? In the span of twentyfour hours Dr. Dreyfuss sisterinlaw Jean and youngest sibling Lilly are all dead only Lucas Annabel and Victoria know what happened and that a vengeful ghost was the culprit. So as they are explaining all this to the police do you think that they would get prison or psychoward?This is truly a horrendous film and a total waste of Hollywood resources. To even associate Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth name to this project is insulting and misleading. I cannot recommend seeing this film. You would be best serviced to avoid seeing this film.See more of my reviews on FB  The Faris Reel".

	schema:headline " Jessica Chastain is the only good thing about this";
	schema:reviewBody "Mama concerns two young girls abandoned in the woods by their murderous father who went on a killing spree following an unexplained financial crisis. His story is never really resolved and its point is only to deliver the girls to the woods. The girls take refuge in an empty cabin and are overseen by a protective spirit. They are found later by a doctor in a feral condition and taken in by their uncle and his edgy band member girlfriend Jessica Chastain who is reluctant to take on any kind of parental role. We soon find out that the spirit of Mama follows the girls and is protective and jealous of any other parental figure in the girls' lives. After the uncle is injured after a fright from the spirit Chastain's character has to take on the role of sole protector and comes to find affection for the girls. The arrival of Mama's spirit is heralded by moths whose symbolism is never quite clear though perhaps they represent reincarnation.This movie started out as averagely good PG13 horror. There are no false scares in the movie all the jumps have payoffs. Chastain's character is welldrawn and I'm impressed with her ability to transform physically and sink emotionally into a role. Her role might be appealing to women who are sick of seeing brain dead maternal type women as caretakers in horror movies.Soon however a lot of the plot devices become laughable. Flashback scenes do not quite make sense and are filmed in a bizarre jerky daguerreotype style that made the preview audience laugh. A throwaway librarian character a harbinger if you've seen Cabin in the Woods gives a ridiculous melodramatic speech about ghosts and their unresolved conflicts that prompted unintended laughter. There are logical inconsistencies as well. Upon the discovery of the girls five years later we are told it appears that the crashed car is just yards off of the main highway and the cabin not too far from that. The cabin has some modern touches that lead us to believe it is not as old as the spirit that inhabits it. There is a scene of possession of a minor character that is very poorly handled and finds no great resolution. And typical for horror it seems whenever the characters go in to search the cabin it's always the dead of night.I will not describe the ending but many people will feel cheated and offended at the vagueness and lack of satisfactory comeuppance. Some may feel we've followed the story for nothing or have been lead to sympathize with the wrong characters when the movie wants us to follow other characters' trajectories.All in all I'd wait to stream this one and skip paying for it theatrically.".

	schema:headline " Not Jump out at you scary but creepy";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror movies are indeed a genre that is always a hit or miss for me. Sometimes they deliver the chills they intend but many of the modern scary films are filled with too much cheesiness to make me jump or shriek in terror. So once again I went to my local theater to check out the latest Hollywood horror entitled Mama starring one of my favorite actresses Jessica Chastain. Like so many of her films I looked forward to being entertained by the lovely redhead and hopefully by the movie as well. So what does this movie have in store for you? Read on to find out.From my experiences many horror films today prefer to use the art of making people jump with things suddenly appearing out of nowhere. While some directors know how to pull this off many give away the surprise jump with camera work and audio tricks to warn you when something is coming. Guillermo del Toro's films though throw in some of these scenes but instead focuses on another scare factor that affects me a little more creepiness. Yes my friends Mama is creepy indeed using a combination of many things to create a world that has a good chance of giving you goose bumps. One factor that was a major contributor to the scare factor was the use of shadows. From the very start of the movie the houses are covered in shadows hiding the mysteries from within. In some cases the camera is pitch black with only the haunting sounds and shifting shades to give insight into what lurks within. Yet many scenes involve using various sources of lights to provide a false sense of security that leaves you wondering if something will happen which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't. This unpredictable behavior kept the tension high for me and kept me wondering just where the movie was going. Of course these techniques would be nothing if it weren't for the human imagination. What I mean is that hiding Mama's true form for most of the movie allowed my mind to paint a picture of the specter that lurked within the halls and walls. Oh sure a few glimpses of her here and there provided some input but there was still enough mystery left to allow me to envision some horrible nightmarish creatures. Of course once Mama's form was revealed it didn't agree with my imagination but surprisingly still was quite a sight to see. The dislocated joints malnourished limbs and disproportional faces were painted with a sickly brown color that gave it an added touch of realism to send tingles down your spine. Unfortunately some of the scenes relied too much on the CGI to bring her to life and her exaggerated movements blurred into mediocre CGI effects. What they lacked in the looks department though was made up for in the way Mama moved. At first nothing more than distant floats and occasional bursting out of the wall Mama's behavior quickly evolved into something I hadn't seen in a while. The damage to her body gave it incredible flexibility that allowed her to contort into numerous positions that had the audience screaming in horror despite how fake it looked. For me though the scariest movement was her rapid dislocated walk she performed as she reached out to grab the little girl at the same time. A few additional creep factors had to be the little girl Lilly and the background music. Lilly is the creepier of the two sisters as her silent demeanor and large eyes are a combination that will affect most. Most of the movie involves her stalking around the house watching from the shadows silently like a creature on the prowl. When someone confronts her she says little as her large eyes seem to peer into your soul to shake your core. As for the music factor well it's nothing spectacular but it fits well with the scenes of the movie. The piano in particular provides a spectrum of sounds to match the emotions sometimes implying doom while other times giving an extra sound that somehow provides the desired effect. Besides creepiness though this movie doesn't have many unique strengths that boost is score. The acting is fine with Chastain once again doing a nice job with her part but other than sounding and staring creepily at the camera there wasn't much to comment on. Many of the characters were fine and had a little more development than I expected in a horror movie yet their development was very linear and predictable despite the emotion they portrayed. As for the story it still falls into one of the tried and true plots that have been overused in Hollywood. However the way the story was developed was entertaining and well done in my opinion. Instead of Chastain and the gang making random discoveries the history of Mama was uncovered through a series of dreams research and hypnotic interviews with one of the girls. While it certainly isn't the best I did enjoy the nice change in the delivery. Mama is a horror movie that does its job right. Keeping it PG 13 was indeed the right decision as it allowed the crew to make a movie that could mess with your head instead of drenching the screen in gore. Wondering if it is worth seeing in theaters? I'll say it is but more for the horrifying screams and sounds instead of actually story. I also wish people precautions as this movie may have some flashing light moments that may cause seizures if not careful. My scores for Mama are the following Horror 7.5 Movie Overall 6.57.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the title says i enjoyed this movie immensely the usual horror clichs are there but i still feel the movie felt fresh and did things slightly differently from the norm. Mama herself is an excellent creationthey keep her image out of it until later for maximum tension and then when she is unleashed its like all the dread thats been building explodes into fear. her movement etc is exactly what is needed to make this sort of film scary. There are a couple of moments that are pure terror and i was laughing after a few of the bits just because i was so amused and entertained by the scariness. My girlfriend actually moaned with fear at one point! Her face throughout the 2nd half was priceless P i think some of the other reviewers are being overly critical yes the end wasn't amazing but it think it did a much better job than a lot of other films like this and seeing this gives me hope that there's still very scary things that can be done in this genre of horror. Its maybe not a 10 more an 8.59 but im giving it a ten to balance out the negative reviews.".

Mama herself is an excellent creationthey keep her image out of it until later for maximum tension and then when she is unleashed its like all the dread thats been building explodes into fear. her movement etc is exactly what is needed to make this sort of film scary. There are a couple of moments that are pure terror and i was laughing after a few of the bits just because i was so amused and entertained by the scariness. My girlfriend actually moaned with fear at one point! Her face throughout the 2nd half was priceless P i think some of the other reviewers are being overly critical yes the end wasn't amazing but it think it did a much better job than a lot of other films like this and seeing this gives me hope that there's still very scary things that can be done in this genre of horror. Its maybe not a 10 more an 8.59 but im giving it a ten to balance out the negative reviews.";

	schema:reviewBody "Last year when Guillermo del Toro helped executive produced Troy Nixey's directing debut in a supernatural chiller called DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK many horror fans were expecting an edgeoftheseat spookfest but what they got was a horrormovie yawner instead. This year it's sad to say that del Toro failed to live up to his good reputation for the second time in another supernatural chiller called MAMA. Expanded by sibling filmmakers Andres and Barbara Muschietti from their 2008 short Andres Muschietti's directing debut does bears the influence of executive producer Guillermo del Toro's trademark of graphic supernatural elements and moody visuals. Unfortunately MAMA is a crushing bore that doesn't do much other than repeating the same scare over the course of 109minute running time.Like DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK the movie begins with a promising setup a depressed father named Jeffrey Nikolaj CoasterWaldau shot two business associates and his exwife before kidnapping his two little daughters Victoria Morgan McGarry and Lilly Maya and Sierra Dawe and flees with them to an unknown destination. During the getaway he was driving too fast on a snowy highway and eventually losing control of his car. The car crashes but all of them survives. Soon after he takes the kids through the woods until they come to an old cabin in the middle of nowhere. Once inside he takes out his gun to prepare a double murdersuicide. But before he is able to pull the trigger something sinister appears from the dark and snatches him away. The two little girls are then left by themselves with only the mysterious creature as their companion.So far so good. But what follows next is an awfully familiar story that fails to find its proper footing ever since. Five years later the girls Victoria Megan Charpentier and Lilly Isabelle Nelisse are now grown up to 8 and 6yearold respectively. Both of them are gradually discovered living on their own in the cabin and later brought to an institute where they are studied and held under intensive care by a psychiatrist named Dr. Dreyfuss Daniel Kash. After years living remotely all by themselves the girls are feral frightened and limited in their language abilities. Throughout their state of isolation they are so psychologically disturbed that they are thought to have created an imaginary female protector named Mama.Then one day the girls are released into the custody of their uncle Lucas also Nikolaj CoasterWaldau and his gothrocker girlfriend Annabel Jessica Chastain. However Annabel isn't a motherly type and doesn't seems to be comfortable having two children living in their house. But that's not the only problem  apparently the girls have somehow brought along their Mama with them. Things get worse when Lucas is hospitalized following a mysterious fall down the stairs and forced Annabel to be left alone with the girls. Slowly Annabel discovers something is very wrong that the socalled Mama isn't an imaginary person after all.Everything in MAMA is painfully clichd the story is pedestrian and most of the scares are more of the same. The pace is also slowmoving with nothing much happens and the revelatory finale is a huge disappointment  especially when the director finally shows the fullbodied creature of Mama. Needless to say the creature looks too fake with its spotty special effects.Somewhere in between there are worthwhile camera placements by Andres Muschietti but his overall direction is a routine exercise in style but little substance. The cast does what they can with their given roles particularly from Jessica Chastain's credible performance as Annabel.The rest is a yawner.".

Victoria gets a true mother and father. I haven't seen much character development in a horror movie at all. The most before this was Sydney from the Scream franchise and that was rather minor. The way that this all comes together in the end is incredible. Even mama has a beautiful yet disturbing revelation. An intense movie like this needed some sort of relief and it has a few funny little bits. The script was written well and the story was really unique.

Where two sibling kids that move like a spider Gollum especially the younger one that gets found in a small house in the woods. And a couple decides to take care of them because the guy feels responsible because they are the daughters of his brother who disappeared. And the 30yr old garage band girl who is the girlfriend of the guy because she feels that she needs to put up with it. This movie does a decent job of making a dislikable character somewhat likable near the end. Like I said the structure design and vibe adds a lot to the creepiness but when it comes to the story it doesn't really stand out. This movie is much better than Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark which is another movie presented by Guillermo del Toro. But it doesn't reach the psychedelic dreamlike vibe that is creepy or even scary and yet beautiful although it tries to be. The film The Orphanage comes to mind. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "There does exist an expression in the German language that describes this movie perfectly. It's groes Kino. Literally translated it means big cinema and you use it for movies that are really grand Grand in their structure grand in emotion and grand in class. If any movie deserves this title then it's this one.The Plot Berlin during WWII. We get an insight in the daily life of two complete different women who don't know each other. Lilly is young married with four kids and because of this can afford a quite pleasant life as Hitler was fond of mothers with many kids they got more of everything than other families more money more food etc.. So while her husband is somewhere out there fighting the enemy Lilly occasionally has affairs and while she has her fun with the men a nanny is taking care of the kids. The other woman also being quite young is Felice. Felice is Jewish works as a journalist for a newspaper and unlike Lilly has to daily cope with the fear of being discovered and transported to a KZ. As if it all were not enough Felice is lesbian and enjoys life as much as possible in the circle of her mostly lesbian friends. Now one day Felice by chance sees Lilly in a theatre and almost instantly falls for her. Surprisingly enough Lilly loves her back and they begin an irresistible and passionate affair which at the time and circumstances back there was like dancing on a volcano Of course the film deals with WWII and the holocaust here but the best thing about it is that it's only done on the side. The plot concentrates on the two women the two different worlds they live in and their feelings towards each other. It's all so intensive and it's not all about two suffering girls who lived in a horrible time and were not allowed to love each other it's about two strong women with a lust for life who tried not to care too much about the Nazi regime but to concentrate on seizing the day. After watching it you don't only feel for them you admire them for having been so strong and courageous. But most of all you get to appreciate love and life again.A truly great film about a great love in times where this love seemed to be impossible. Based on true events.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much from Aimee and Jaguar mainly because my satellite delivery company gave it a rating of only two stars out of four usually reserved for semijunk like Batman sequels. But that rating was deceptively low. This is a welldone and even fascinating flick. There are three chief reasons for my saying this.First is the reconstruction of the period  1944 in Berlin. By that time the war was lost for Germany and everyone seemed to know it except the German citizens. Voices on the radio keep muttering on about how unconquerable the Germans are but evidence to the contrary is all around. Berlin is bombed and blasted areas reduced to piles of flaming rubbish. Food is difficult to come by. There is gaiety at parties but it is tense and forced. People have no place to live except for whatever few feet they can cadge off someone else or pay exorbitantly for. For the few Jews blending in with the rest the situation is more than simply desperate. Asked for their papers on the street they try to run and are shot dead. But there isn't anything in the way of self pity here. These women  they seem to be exclusively females  are pretty tough and pragmatic cookies. They dance when they must with power brokers while the band performs bravely on stage or a samba plays on a scratchy old record. The prop master deserved an Iron Cross. Makeup is outstanding as well. Hair is marcelled to a turn lips are blushed eyes are heavily kohled. I know I'm getting these words all wrong but you know what I mean. The perfomers don't look as if they were in contemporary makeup and garb with merely a nod to period fashions. The authenticity is such that they look almost alien to our eyes. Gee and it was only fifty years ago too. Where does the time go?Second there is the acting. Well in a word it's simply fine all around. Felice is a beautiful darkhaired young Jewish woman. Actually she fits a common German physical template very well with her thin upturned nose pointed chin wideset glistening eyes and a pair of those eyebrows that seem to arch up onto the owner's forehead like V2 rockets instead of hovering placidly over her orbital sockets where they belong. For an unusually good example of what I mean take a look at Jon Voight's girl friend in The Odessa File. Felice's German appearance however doesn't detract from the character's believability. German Jews by that time were pretty well assimilated biologically and culturally one of the reasons their attempted extermination came as such a shock to them and to everyone else. Felice is surrounded by friends who seem to be mainly lesbians as carefree as the real circumstances permit. Lilly Wust the woman Felice meets and begins by exploiting is an equally fine actress. In fact she really is very good with her reticence and her frozen empty smile. Lilly is married but her husband is away at the front most of the time and she is almost crushed by fear and loneliness. At first when Felice comes on to her after their friendship has matured she beats frantically at Felice's face and chest. Later yielding to her needs Lilly goes to bed with Felice who makes gentle love to her and suggests that Lilly be Aimee while she Felice be called Jaguar. I must say that this scene which is no more erotic than it should be is a tour de force on the part of the actress playing Lilly. I've rarely seen such a complex of emotions  fright awe sexual desire loneliness and love  projected with such impact. Lilly trembles all over in a kind of Jungian flooding out until her instinctive repressions overcome she grasps Felice and buries Felice's face against her breasts. Lilly's husband Gunter is a reasonably nice guy too. He comes home to visit his wife and children at every opportunity even taking French leave from his unit to help Lilly celebrate her birthday. Alas he stumbles into the aftermath of a homosexual saturnalia.The third element of this film that I find so impressive is the story itself which I've kind of limned in above and won't go into in any detail. Let's just say that it has everything in it that you might expect in a movie designed for grownups. I can imagine a group of teenagers sitting around with popcorn and beer and complaining that Hey this thing has SUBTITLES. And Why can't we see more of her boobs? I kind of sympathize there. And Why does she get shot off screen so we can't see her brains blown out? I don't think they'd get through the first five minutes let alone the whole movie but if you do you will find your efforts rewarded.".

But the film is exceptional not just for its frankness in presenting the passionate relationship but for its portrayal of Berliners trying to lead ordinary lives while their city is under heavy bombardment and is being destroyed before their eyes. And this nearnormal background throws into sharp relief the ghastly horror of the Nazi regime its vain pursuit of total victory and its fanatical hatred and persecution of Jews.The acting of principals Maria Schrader as Felice Schragenheim Jaguar and Juliane Khler as Lilly Wust Aime has an integrity and intensity which has almost disappeared from Hollywood but it never lapses into melodrama. Outstanding in the large supporting cast are Johanna Wokalek as Ilse a rival with Aime for Jaguar's love and Detlev Buck as Aime's husband Gnther who manages to elicit our sympathy for his personal predicament while repelling us with his Nazi arrogance and cloddishness.A notable feature of the movie is that it reminds us that like London and Paris wartime Berlin still had a thriving nightlife with Beethoven concerts well dressed women and officers drinking in luxury hotel lounges and smart receptions. Jaguar and her friends also represent a bohemian fringe of society dating back to the Weimar period of the 20s and early 30s that had not been extinguished by the Nazis. These scenes give the film colour and style features sometimes missing from movies set in time of war.This is one of those very rare movies in which not only every element  scenario acting camerawork effects interior and exterior locations music etc  is almost perfect in itself but in which they add up to a true work of art.

It is ostensibly a true story based on the memoir of the surviving lover who lived on in Berlin for another 50 years. The story starts in November 1943 at the beginning of the British air campaign to obliterate Berlin. It ends not long after the attempt to assassinate Hitler in July 1944.The doomed lovers are Felice Schragenheim and Lilly Wust Jaguar and Aimee were their pet names for one another. Dark haired intense Felice is a Jew. She's living on forged Aryan papers that identify her as a Wehrmacht officer's widow and hiding in plain sight by working as a secretary for the editor in chief of a Nazi Party newspaper. She's also involved in some kind of resistance activity involving false documents. Just in case she doesn't have enough stress in her life she's part of a coterie of lesbians mostly but not all Jewish whose idea of a good time seems to be to go to tea dances at the Hotel am Zoo flirt aggressively with Wehrmacht officers on leave and buy black market ration coupons in the ladies' room. Felice and her girlfriends also get a few laughs and pick up a few marks on the side by posing in cheesecake pinups for the photographer who works on the fake documents.Girls in the Bund Deutcher Mdel the Nazi girl's organization had to do a year's labor service on a farm or as a household servant. As the story gets under way Felice's current girlfriend Ilse is doing her domestic year as babysitter for Lily Wust. The blonde not quite bovine Lily could be Mrs. Aryan of 1943. Her husband Gunter is a platoon sergeant on the Russian front she has four sons for which achievement she has been awarded the Deutches Mutterkreuz medal in bronze she blames the Jews for the air raids and she claims to be able to smell a Jew. Lily is unhappily married to a lower middle class regular guy who thinks of her as the little woman. She's none too bright and believes whatever she's told. She's also a hopeless romantic who looks for but does not find the love of her life in a succession of quickie affairs with Army officers. Her kids are getting tired of Ilse shlepping them to the zoo during the afternoons. Her husband is apparently cheating on her as well when he's home on leave. Felice apparently needs more excitement than her commonplace life is providing. She thinks it would be droll for a Jewish woman to seduce this slightly overripe Hausfrau and fulfill her romantic dreams. Nothing will do but that Ilse contrive an introduction. Ilse though jealous does so and Felice gives Lily her personality at full blast coming on to her in a series of torrid love letters signed Jaguar. Lily who hasn't got the first clue eats it up. She loves her new social life and all her new friends they discreetly find her amusing. She falls hopelessly in love with Felice who of course falls hopelessly in love with her. On New Year's Day 1944 they fall tremblingly into bed together. The marriage breaks up Felice moves in the boys think she's great and even Lily's parents accept her. The discarded husband eventually dies somewhere in Russia missed by no one.Everybody would be deliriously happy except for a few minor problems. The Royal Air Force keeps trying to kill them all every night. The Gestapo keeps checking papers in the street and rounding up the remaining Jews in Berlin including Felice's family. Felice's Nazi boss who thinks she's the world's greatest secretary keeps asking sympathetic personal questions that have highly inconvenient answers. Felice almost blows her cover at the office when she can't quite show the proper shock and horror at the July 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler. Meanwhile the bright young SSUntersturmfuhrer who rounded up the rest of her family has made finding Felice his personal project. Felice's friends in the underground are about to flee to Switzerland and they offer to get her out with them. Knowing what's at stake Felice turns them down to stay with Lily. She finally confesses to her astonished lover that she is Jewish. Lily by this time is so besotted with love that she wouldn't care if Felice were a Martian with two heads. Of course it all ends badly. One summer day as Felice and Lily return from an idyllic picnic in the woods the Gestapo are waiting at the apartment to wrap up this loose end. Felice is taken away to Theresienstadt and we see no more of her. We learn that Lily who truly doesn't have a clue actually tried to visit her in the concentration camp the attempt probably did Felice no good. That's pretty much it. The story is framed by a present day encounter between Lily and Ilse in a Berlin oldage home in which Felice's two former lovers come to terms with each other. Fifty years on Felice is still the one and only love of Lily's life. This is emphatically lower middlebrow entertainment applying every clich known to man and woman to earnest but melodramatic period romantic costume drama. The plot would make a pretty good libretto for a real opera. It's great fun and I ate it up.".

At some point I had a revelation. I understood that there was no imbalance of power. I realized that the Nazis were not all powerful as I had presumed. All around them were people of the same if not more strength opposing them. The resistance was as cunning and determined as the Nazis  it was inevitable that good would win. There is a line in the movie where one girl is telling another girl who is reprimanding her for something You did not create the world  God did. Wonderful way to say  you can't judge me.The love making scene is hard to watch. Don't get me wrong  I am not prejudice  it is hard to watch  because the Lilly is so scared and beaten psychologically physically by Nazi men and when the Jewish girl Felice kneels at Lilly's feet and just holds her ankles and rests her cheek on the Lilly's calves you are in as much pain as the Lilly. The actress who plays Lilly just breaks your heart because her whole body is wracked in these hysterical shivers and no words. It is the old saying put before you in the form of these two women  one Nazi one Jewish  that the master becomes the slave' And of course it symbolized the whole Nazi situation. It is what Shakespear tried to to teach us in MacBeth  the blood was so much more powerful than the knife.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Aime  Jaguar is so strange it has to be true. If it were fiction it would be accused of being utterly unbelievable. But true it is.The movie is told in flashback from the recollections of an elderly German woman who relives the events in her life during WWII.  Married to a Nazi officer who is away fighting on the eastern front she meets is courted by and is seduced by a brash beautiful lesbian. But not only is this woman a lesbian this alone could have landed her in a concentration camp she is also a Jew and a member of the antiNazi German underground. And all this in 1943 as Allied bombs begin dropping on the capital of the Third Reich. Yes this couldn't be fiction.The movie focuses on the relationship between the two women. It's a complicated relationship and one that is not fully explored. What motivates the young Jewish woman to pursue the German officer's wife? Isn't there enough danger in her life already?  And the hausfrau was she a closet homosexual all along? Or is her motivation boredom or the stress of wartime? These issues are not answered satisfactorily.Another drawback is the strange lack of tension. Any one of a dozen missteps could send them and their friends to tortuous deaths at the hands of the Gestapo. But they don't seem to be all that concerned. I'd be a blithering wreck but they party on often with the Nazi Party.I think these are valid criticisms but Aime  Jaguar is still an interesting of not odd movie. It's still worth a rental.".

It is a story of a Jewish woman who is living in the time of war...of the Nazi repression and extermination of Jews and others. It is the story of how she had to live her everyday life to exist to eat to survive. How she couldn't expose herself even when loosing those she loved.  How she lived each day at a time.It is the story of the German woman who was the perfect German wife with her perfect German children and how she had to cope with the loneliness unhappiness and repression of her life as she lived in that time.It is the story of LOVE. Of the love that emerged between these two women...one living in fear of her life and one living in boredom of hers. Of the honest and raw emotions that were able to be expressed between them in the face of all that was happening around and with them.  It is the fulfillment of that love that being  together brought them finally after the secret of being a Jew is admitted.  Of love being lived in the face of complete uncertainty. For me it completely transcended gender identification. It is about LOVE!  It is the story of history ...giving a much more personal view of everyday life at those times... the personal lives of two woman ....  of women.  Woman's history.It is the story of pain    The pain in that people had to live like this....and die like this. A pain in which we should never forget these atrocities ...and to not let them happen again...and again...and again!".

However when Lucie's modeling connections lead to an exclusive recording contract offer despite the fact that she cannot sing Lucie is forced to seek out Marie who possesses a good singing voice to perform in her place. Marie reluctantly agrees but when she returns from the performance she finds that Lucie has committed suicide leaving her no choice but to assume Lucie's name.

The film is made up of four intercut short stories that share little other than the fact they're set in Rome. Some have fantasy elements some are more absurdist others more straightforward character farce.But somehow though they don't make much of a logical grouping the whole thing is lighthearted and fun enough that it seems grumpy to pick on it. Sure some jokes fall flat and some ideas seem unfulfilled but a lot of it is wonderfully acted and cleverly written. And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds even 2nd tier Woody simply telling playfully comic tales is a welcome sight.".

	schema:headline " All of your heart's fantasies played out in Rome with love celebrities death and opera";
	schema:reviewBody "To Rome with Love is a fantasy film a comedy about people living out their fantasies. The great thing about it is that it's subtle enough that you don't recognize the fantasy element in all of the relationships until later on in the film. The obvious one is when native Roman Leopoldo Pisanello Roberto Benigni becomes a celebrity over night. It's better to be a celebrity than an unknown. And as Benigni shows way funnier too.It's the type of film where everybody gets to see themselves as famous or supremely interesting or a guiding angel or married to a hooker or the object of a movie star's affections or on a romantic rendezvous with a thief or having the ability to change the world with one simple idea. It will take you to wherever your heart desires. And then you'll realize why it's often advised to think with your brain rather than with your heart.Half Italian and half English we follow two relationships involving Romans and two relationships with Americans in Rome. A young Italian married couple get separated and the young man finds himself living out every other young man's fantasies while the young woman finds herself living out her own fantasies.Hayley Alison Pill a New Yorker transplanted in Rome falls in love and gets engaged to a successful Roman lawyer. Her parents Woody Allen and Judy Davis make the trek across the ocean to meet their inlaws. But Allen's obsession with death and equating retirement with death causes him to create a national disaster or success story depending on how you look at it.Jack Jesse Eisenberg is an American architect living in Rome with his girlfriend. First he meets his architecture idol John Alec Baldwin who sees Jack as the younger version of himself. Or more accurately Jack sees John as the older version of himself the joke works better that way. Then Jack meets Monica Ellen Page who is his girlfriend's best friend and is the object of all men's fantasies.Page also gets to play the role of the selfobsessed pseudointellectual  commonly referred to as the pedantic one in most Woody Allen movies. Other than Allen himself Eisenberg and Baldwin play a sort of tagteam version of the selfdeprecating neurotic hero although this time with a touch of confidence.Confidence is not to be confused with optimism because as funny as To Rome with Love is it also has Allen's usual undertone of pessimism. Death is going to come sooner than you would like but not soon enough. And even if you do get to live out your heart's fantasies they may not lead to everything that you hoped for. This film is the comedy version of death and negativity and can provide you with the simple joys in life.".

	schema:headline " Allen's Most Disappointing Film from Europe";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's seventh postcard from Europe lacks enough postage. It should be rubberstamped Return to Sender. This is undoubtedly the most disappointing of all his films set in Europe.Following a lifetime spent channeling New York's neurotic side creating some of the most memorable roles in modern film history Annie Hall Leonard Zelig Danny Rose and of course  Allen himself the 76yearold film legend abruptly departed his familiar Manhattan backdrop in 2004 taking his introspective wit across the Atlantic initially to London then Barcelona followed by Paris and now Rome.His latest release To Rome with Love has all the ingredients of yet another tasty Allen stew. But in the end all we sample is watereddown broth poorly seasoned with stale recollections of the spicy flavors that made Match Point Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris so thoroughly original and enjoyable.To be fair to Allen he's coming off his biggest commercial success ever which is a hard act to follow. Since his heyday as a writerdirectorstar during the 1970s Allen's films haven't performed particularly well at the box office. But like summer stock theater they tend to make just enough money to keep Allen atop the list of directors most actors long to work with. For that reason Allen pretty much gets his pick of the litter as to who he casts in his films and often writes characters perfectly suited to the typecasting.Indeed for Allen the blockbuster 2011 hit Midnight in Paris was tough to match  either critically or commercially. But not only does To Rome with Love fall far short it doesn't even belong on the same continent.The plot is very familiar territory for fans of Allen's films. Three stories are supposedly entwined full of quirky characters ultimately providing audiences with humor greater understanding and ultimately revelation. That was supposed to be recipe.Trouble is this time around none of the stories Allen has penned are particularly interesting or memorable. Predictably Allen does manage to steal one segment playing a bored American retiree who is accompanying his wife to Italy. They are scheduled to meet their daughter's soontobe husband and family. As one can imagine the interaction between Allen and the nonEnglish speaking Italian family has its moments. The story blossoms when Allen unexpectedly discovers the Italian father can sing like Caruso. But the high point of this operatic minidrama becomes too forced testing the audience's patience to say nothing of straining credibility.In the second story Jesse Eisenberg The Social Network plays an American student living in Rome along with his girlfriend. When the girlfriend invites Monica to pay a visit played wonderfully by Ellen Page Juno Eisenberg becomes infatuated with the new house guest and the fireworks begin. The always reliable Alec Baldwin perfectly cast as the debonair knowitall oddly provides a voice of reason during Eisenberg's degenerative courtship hoping to stop his protg from making a complete fool of himself.The final story seems both camp and patronizing cookiecutting arguably the only Italian actor widely recognizable to American audiences Roberto Benigni  Life is Beautiful as the warm roasting chestnut to provide some wildlyexaggerated depiction of the average Italian. This story gets old quick and drags down what would otherwise be at least a mildly entertaining film.Italy should be perfect canon fodder for Allen's innumerable idiosyncrasies. A nation of wildlygesturing people full of passion about everything  art soccer food whatever  seems the perfect foil for all of Allen's selfcentered New Yorkers. Instead the opportunity is wasted. The film might as well have been shot in Cleveland.Without giving away too much there's no payoff in the end. For audiences expecting to see the combustible explosion during the final climactic scene from Allen's vast cinematic laboratory we are left wondering why any of this mattered.And that's the trouble  it didn't.In his masterful 47year film career Allen rarely delivers a product that seems so unfinished. It's as though Allen wrote a somewhat decent first draft and then suddenly called in the cameras to start shooting. Allen knows very well that greatness comes through time and repetition.Like fine wine this one needed to age a bit. It was served far too early. And like so many bad Chiantis the tannins were overwhelming to the point of being undrinkable.".

The always reliable Alec Baldwin perfectly cast as the debonair knowitall oddly provides a voice of reason during Eisenberg's degenerative courtship hoping to stop his protg from making a complete fool of himself.The final story seems both camp and patronizing cookiecutting arguably the only Italian actor widely recognizable to American audiences Roberto Benigni  Life is Beautiful as the warm roasting chestnut to provide some wildlyexaggerated depiction of the average Italian. This story gets old quick and drags down what would otherwise be at least a mildly entertaining film.Italy should be perfect canon fodder for Allen's innumerable idiosyncrasies. A nation of wildlygesturing people full of passion about everything  art soccer food whatever  seems the perfect foil for all of Allen's selfcentered New Yorkers. Instead the opportunity is wasted. The film might as well have been shot in Cleveland.Without giving away too much there's no payoff in the end. For audiences expecting to see the combustible explosion during the final climactic scene from Allen's vast cinematic laboratory we are left wondering why any of this mattered.And that's the trouble  it didn't.In his masterful 47year film career Allen rarely delivers a product that seems so unfinished. It's as though Allen wrote a somewhat decent first draft and then suddenly called in the cameras to start shooting. Allen knows very well that greatness comes through time and repetition.Like fine wine this one needed to age a bit. It was served far too early. And like so many bad Chiantis the tannins were overwhelming to the point of being undrinkable.";

	schema:reviewBody "You kinda always know what you'll get with Woody Allen films by this point which is that for every work that he does that knocks it out of the park Match Point Midnight in Paris he'll come back and then... make a film that just stays as a single or double to use baseball terms i.e. Scoop and this film. To Rome with Love is another Woody's European City Tour that follows London Barcelona and of course Paris and with Rome he pays tribute by doing one of those Italian anthology comedies I haven't seen a lot of them frankly but I'm thinking like back in the 60's with Boccaccio 62 and there are four stories that Woody could also have made individual films. Well two would have been potentially amazing if they had the right focus one of them not so much the time it has here is fine. Let's quickly rundownWoody himself returns for the first time on screen since Scoop a little too old to be the romantic lead anymore aside from say married to Judy Davis and he and his wife go to see their daughter played by Allison Pill who is set to get married to Michelangelo. His parents are simple Roman folk the father a mortician... who is also an amazing opera singer but the catch is that he can only sing great in the shower don't we all? so Woody makes a trick have him sing in the shower  on STAGE! Alec Baldwin plays a guy who I think looks back on his younger self as an impressionable architect Jesse Eisenberg very Woodyesque surrogate but plays his own strengths well as well who has a new romantic interest in the superneurotic actress Ellen Page plays a different turn for her that I had fun watching though intentionally annoying as a character. An Italian couple are in love and are unfortunately separated and through wacky misunderstandings wind up with other partners over the course of one day. And Roberto Benigni is a regular guy chased by the paparazzi. Why? Why not?Woody juggles between these stories and the worst I can say about it is it has an air of a sitcom to it. There's some misunderstandings and usually around fame or love or sex or all of the above and it's not too deep. Well maybe the BaldwinEisenberg plot has some poignancy about a Man of the World who looks back on his youthful indiscretion or wouldbe one and there is a lot of humor to be mined. Hell it's great to see Benigni have fun and be actually funny again in his premise where he starts to go down deeper in the rabbit hole of fame. And while it's the weakest plot of all with the two Italian lovers split apart when Penelope Cruz comes on screen for her brief time she's sexy fun and intelligent in her acting. Even Woody Allen himself telling a lot of the brand of old semicorny jokes but ALWAYS with a knowing wit and punchline is amusing. But when comedy works it works and there's a lot of stuff that worked here for me more than it didn't. Just seeing the old Italian man singing in the shower on stage and applyingwashing off Pagliaci make up! is a gag that only the most cynical would turn off on. It's a master filmmaker having fun and a jazz clarinetist yeah I'm going there noodling around on his instrument in a cinematic sort of way. I think for the summer season which has passed know it's a fine way to spend an afternoon or evening not to mention with a wonderful cast by olderandyoung Hollywood players and Italian notsowellknown folks. Just not in an OMG YOU MUST SEE THIS IT WILL WIN AN Oscar sort of experience.".

But on the other hand the movie is filled with a sensation of horror vacui that makes it a bit heavy and prolix which is uncommon in Woody Allen.It was a pity. Knowing the outstanding results Mr Allen has achieved in portraying human troubles and tragedies one is left with the curiosity to know how he would have managed to portray or allude to the tragicomic current events that Italian reality abundantly offers.

	schema:reviewBody "The opening sequence of this film filled me with hope....Rome probably my favorite city in the world seen through the awestruck eyes of Woody Allen....unfortunately until the equally magnificent closing scene he doesn't really make Rome an integral part of his stories....of course there are a few token references to the Collosseum and the Vatican but also a few too many interior shots. Woody himself at age 77 is still the funniest performer in the film AND of course he gives himself most of the best lines as well He does it for pleasure not for money  Well there is a lot of pleasure IN money!. But while his segment is pretty funny it's also basically onejoke. The segment with the Italian couple moving to the big city begins well and the couple is appealing but it goes astray when it turns into a story of double infidelity this could have been handled either as an allout farce or as a serious drama but Allen seems rather disagreeably to imply that the whole incident was beneficial to the couple! Nevertheless this segment includes the three loveliest women in the film the adorable upandcoming Alessandra Mastronardi the gettinghottereveryyear Penelope Cruz and a cameo by the ageless Ornella Muti! she should have had a bigger part. The segment with the American couple who find their relationship tested by the arrival of the girl's uninhibited best female friend feels mostly artificial and unconvincing  perhaps because Ellen Page never quite succeeds in looking like a strong enough temptation for Jesse Eisenberg to abandon Gret Gerwig. As for the Roberto Benigni segment it's pointless unfunny and repetitive. When I saw Il Mostro at the theater in the mid1990s the audience was roaring with laughter during 90 of Benigni's scenes in To Rome With Love the audience was dead quiet. Overall a lightweight disappointment from Woody though not without moments of pleasure for his fans.  out of 4.".

Most noteworthy about this film is the score. It is so beautifully and aptly played throughout that it seems to almost be a narrator of the movie as it gently guides the viewer from scene to scene. The fantastic score also gives the movie an extra element of rhythm both literally and figuratively in that it keeps things quite upbeat. The acting was very well done with the exception of Ellen Page which was not really her fault because she was simply not well cast for her role. Overall this movie was great!

Starting halfway through the previous decade Woody Allen altered his standard oeuvre from mostly comedic farce with a dash of autobiographical drama set amongst towering New York skyscrapers to films set in major European centers where the city itself is almost its own character. Barcelona nudged its way into the love triangle of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Paris's nightclubs and streets were a central character along with Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein in Midnight in Paris. In To Rome with Love Woody is even less subtle about his intentions by loudly proclaiming in the film's title what he is up to.There are multiple stories entering and exiting the stage with even more characters however unlike the majority of films which juggle numerous plot lines these do not intersect they exist by themselves and involve their own unique Roman characteristics. There is John Alec Baldwin who chooses to retrace his former life as a young man in Rome 30 years ago and ends up having a very interesting encounter with Jack Jesse Eisenberg Sally Greta Gerwig and the flippant Monica Ellen Page. John has seen it all before and sets himself up as a Greek Chorus variant to the younger crowd. By the end of their section every man in the audience over 30 should be nodding their heads in agreement about the Sally vs. Monica pros and cons. Their love triangle is a convenient excuse to insert the ancient ruins and architecture which you knew must fit somewhere in the film.Hayley Alison Pill is in her early 20s and fulfills one of the ultimate lost tourist clichs in Rome she bumps into Michelangelo Flavio Parenti falls in love and decides to spend the rest of her life in Italy. Upon hearing the news Hayley's parents Phyllis Judy Davis and Jerry Allen jet over to Rome to meet this guy and survey the situation. In his typical Woody Allen way Jerry has a lot to say about the turbulence on the flight over sizes up Michelangelo as a Communist and can barely stand the irony that Michelangelo's father Giancarlo Fabio Armiliato is an undertaker. Leave it to Woody to be able to fit his absolute phobia of death and all its accompaniments into a film about Rome. This particular film segment uses Roman opera as its backdrop with a very clever farce involving singing in the shower.The most blatant comedic segment in the film is Leopoldo Roberto Benigni. He is just a regular working stiff who wakes up at the same time every morning eats his toast goes to work engages in water cooler talk and comes home. One day Leopoldo starts getting chased by obsessive paparazzi and screaming autograph seekers wherever he goes who want to know what he likes on his toast how he shaves and whether he is a boxers or briefs man. There is no reason for his sudden fame explosion which confuses Leopoldo all the more. This also confused the old ladies sitting next to me however this was a brilliant way for Allen to skewer the celebrity fetish. Some people are famous for just being famous even though they have accomplished absolutely nothing.It seems Woody Allen used his most recent European love letter to fit in some messages he has had stirring around his brain for a little bit. He tackles the odd fascination with know and donothing celebrities the appeal of going after the vapid and attractive female even though you know she is ridiculous and it will only end badly and what I suppose is a critique of not being a prude at the beginning of marriage. Milly Alessandra Mastronardi and Antonio Alessandro Tiberi have just arrived in Rome after their wedding to start their new life. Through a silly and contrived sequence of events which only serve to set up a ridiculous situation Antonio winds up with a stunningly gorgeous prostitute Anna Penelope Cruz and Milly winds up tempted by her most favorite actor in the world. This particular part of the film does not work too well but it does provide plenty of laughs as inappropriately clad Anna visits the Vatican.To Rome with Love is not among the top tier of Woody Allen's decade long infatuation with filming in European locales Midnight in Paris but it is certainly not the worst Scoop. Weaving in and out of these disconnected plot lines is fun and most of them are quite enjoyable. Using Rome and all of its wonderful settings to tie all of his characters together easily helps out what will most likely become one of the more middle of the road and average Wood Allen pictures. However it is worth noting than an average Woody Allen film is head and shoulders above what is playing down the street in your local multiplex right now.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've said it before and I'll say it again  you can't churn out movies the way Woody Allen does and not have a few clinkers along the way. To Rome with Love is not a masterpiece but it has some good scenes.Set in beautiful breathtaking Rome the film tells four stories A retired opera director Allen visiting his daughter and her new fiance discovers the boy's father can sing like Caruso a prostitute Penelope Cruz is mistaken for a man's wife by his family the man's wife is quite naive ends up on a film studio and is taken to the apartment of one of her favorite actors a man Alec Baldwin returns to the place of his youth and serves as the conscienceadviser to a young man Jesse Eisenberg about to fall for his girlfriend's friend Ellen Page. And a director Roberto Benigni becomes an overnight celebrity and is hounded everywhere he goes.Some of these worked better than others. I'm partial to the opera singer story  Allen and Judy Davis play Jerry and Phyllis the parents of Hayley Allison Pitt and her future fatherinlaw Giancarlo is portrayed by opera star Fabio Armiliato. Giancarlo's voice is magnificent but only when he's in a shower so Allen comes out of retirement which he is dying to do and stages a Pagliacci with Canio in a portable decorated shower.My second favorite is the newlyweds featuring Alessandro Tiberi as Antonio Penelope Cruz as Anna and Alessandra Mastronadi as Milly. This is the most Italian part of the film and perhaps the most successful. Milly leaves the hotel becomes terribly lost and loses her cell phone. While she's wandering around Anna Cruz enters Antonio and Milly's hotel room mistaking it for the room she was to go to and starts trying to kiss Antonio on the bed just as Antonio's relatives arrive. His uncle mistakes her for Milly and she goes along with it.Milly meanwhile finds herself at a movie studio and meets her favorite actor who wants to seduce her. Everyone winds up at the same restaurant together.I didn't find the acting all that great particularly in the beginning it seemed very artificial though later I didn't find that as much. I frankly found the Jesse EisenbergEllen Page story a little annoying as I did the Robert Begnini one. By the way Penelope Cruz in a tightfitting short red dress was drop dead gorgeous.All in all worth seeing. I think Allen always has something to offer and even at his age is trying new techniques and new cities.".

Penelope Cruz when she worked with Allen last won an Oscar but even though she is not as good she is best in the film because she gets to be funny and speak in an accent. Then there is the love story which seemed OK but then how they end it was just off putting with me hating Page in this film. To sum up my feelings on the film all I have to say was I looked at my watch many times watching the film which is not a good thing when watching a film because it means it's boring. Allen was able to get this company of actors but I feel that he should have cut some plots and maybe it would have followed better then the final product.MOVIE GRADE E MVP Penelope Cruz".

And what about the young married couple straight from the country who come to Rome for a new wealthier life and get tangled up with a call girl Penelope Cruz and a philandering actor? What doings and what romance is in the air! Dear Woody don't be scared but I am a number one fan among many in the world. Therefore every work you create is like adding a new element to the periodic table. This one is fresh funny clever and utterly gorgeous in its photography. The cast very large is also terrific!

	schema:headline " The Bloom is Off the Rose";
	schema:reviewBody "To Rome with Love comes off as a series of short stories written by a middle school student lacking any logic and possessing the sexual maturity of a thirteen year old boy. Employing the bigger is better approach Woody Allen takes the device he used in the far more successful Midnight in Paris of a nebbish character swept up in an unexplained fantasy and cranks out a series of nonsensical vignettes depicting nebbish characters in unexplained fantasies replacing the impressive vistas of Paris for the impressive vistas of Rome. There are a few laughs along the way but Allen spreads himself so thin that he is unable to provide his universe with any depth or reality and tries to get by on the audience's familiarity with his work and the faded idea that whatever he puts on screen represents quality.The most successful episode features Alec Baldwin as a worldweary architect who makes a sentimental journey to the street he lived on as a student and encounters young Jesse Eisenberg now in residence and living out a romantic entanglement that Baldwin pops in and out of to provide jaded insight. This sequence at least offers some actual emotion for the audience to connect with largely due to the fine acting of Baldwin Eisenberg and Ellen Page as a sexy but neurotic actress steeped in Allen's signature pseudo intellectuality but is so confused about Baldwin's presence that the audience is unclear if he is simply the person he is presented as if Eisenberg is his younger self who he has come back to mentor or if it is some bizarre Twilight Zone scenario that is never fully resolved. Even when he is in the room with the characters Eisenberg is interacting with no one makes any reference to Baldwin and no one except Eisenberg can seem to hear what Baldwin is saying the few times when the other characters do respond to Baldwin only make it more confusing when they don't. Yet this peculiar relationship is never explained and seems a product of Allen's sloppy writing rather than mysterious forces at work.The rest of the vignettes are just lazy implausible nonsense whose outrageousness is forced and seems planted there to make up for any genuine wit. The most tiresome sequence is Roberto Begnini as a mundane worker bee who inexplicably wakes up to find himself the most famous man in the world. It's a onejoke premise that goes on for far too long and since Begnini's boring drone doesn't get any more interesting as a result of what he's experienced neither does the story.

	onyx:emotionText "To Rome with Love comes off as a series of short stories written by a middle school student lacking any logic and possessing the sexual maturity of a thirteen year old boy. Employing the bigger is better approach Woody Allen takes the device he used in the far more successful Midnight in Paris of a nebbish character swept up in an unexplained fantasy and cranks out a series of nonsensical vignettes depicting nebbish characters in unexplained fantasies replacing the impressive vistas of Paris for the impressive vistas of Rome. There are a few laughs along the way but Allen spreads himself so thin that he is unable to provide his universe with any depth or reality and tries to get by on the audience's familiarity with his work and the faded idea that whatever he puts on screen represents quality.The most successful episode features Alec Baldwin as a worldweary architect who makes a sentimental journey to the street he lived on as a student and encounters young Jesse Eisenberg now in residence and living out a romantic entanglement that Baldwin pops in and out of to provide jaded insight. This sequence at least offers some actual emotion for the audience to connect with largely due to the fine acting of Baldwin Eisenberg and Ellen Page as a sexy but neurotic actress steeped in Allen's signature pseudo intellectuality but is so confused about Baldwin's presence that the audience is unclear if he is simply the person he is presented as if Eisenberg is his younger self who he has come back to mentor or if it is some bizarre Twilight Zone scenario that is never fully resolved. Even when he is in the room with the characters Eisenberg is interacting with no one makes any reference to Baldwin and no one except Eisenberg can seem to hear what Baldwin is saying the few times when the other characters do respond to Baldwin only make it more confusing when they don't. Yet this peculiar relationship is never explained and seems a product of Allen's sloppy writing rather than mysterious forces at work.The rest of the vignettes are just lazy implausible nonsense whose outrageousness is forced and seems planted there to make up for any genuine wit. The most tiresome sequence is Roberto Begnini as a mundane worker bee who inexplicably wakes up to find himself the most famous man in the world. It's a onejoke premise that goes on for far too long and since Begnini's boring drone doesn't get any more interesting as a result of what he's experienced neither does the story. A young couple on their honeymoon are parted just as they are about to meet some people who are important to their future and the husband implausibly substitutes prostitute Penlope Cruz for his absent wife. The newlyweds end up throwing aside the marriage vows that they just took in an alarming display of Allen's sexual immaturity. And Allen himself makes an appearance as a frustrated opera director who discovers a major talent who can only show off his gifts in the shower in yet another onejoke misfire.It is sad that after a long stretch of subpar work and redeeming himself with some quality films like Midnight in Paris and Match Point that Allen is content to present a lazy effort like To Rome with Love which is so derivative of his early funny films without any of the freshness or inventiveness.

Unfortunately in Rome we're bogged down by four unrelated stories with characters that are charming but mostly never explored to their full potential. And with many of the scenes taking place indoors I never found myself being transported to the titular city as I was so completely with Midnight.

	schema:headline " Woody Allen's Roman Holiday";
	schema:reviewBody "During Woody Allen's European vacation he has made four stops in London visited Barcelona dropped for a short visit to New York City spent one summer in Paris and then he had Roman Holiday last summer. All the tourist attractions of the Eternal City are in full display in Allen's film and they are spectacular the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps the Coliseum and panoramic views of the city from above the rain at night and outdoor cafs. Like in Paris' movie before that Darius Khondji's camera finds unexpected and hidden angles of famous Rome beauty. The sound of wonderful melodic Italian songs and arias are heard everywhere and what is Italy or Rome without music? Four different stories in which the Romans and the visitors are involved play against this joyous background of Rome glowing under summer sun. It seems that Allen created a mini Decameron. The stories do not overlap but they have in common Rome and love in Rome to Rome.Comparison with last year Allen's film about Paris certainly arises but as Paris and Rome are two very different cities even though both are famous beautiful and often serve as a background or even an important character in the movie Fellini's Rome and Paris I Love You for example so the Allen's movies about Paris and Rome are quite different. The Roman film in my opinion lacks rare magic and brilliance of Midnight in Paris. The reason seems to be in switching from one story to another and there are as I've mentioned four of them. Each is funny and attractive in its own way but as the whole they failed to produce magic. As the rule all stories in an anthology can't be on the same level. The story of Leopoldo for instance had intriguing premise but then just lost some of its steam.Definite plus  for the first time in the last six years Allen is in front of the camera as well as behind it. Allen knows a secret of physical comedy. He can simply stay in the frame even in the background and keep silent and his face will express a range of feelings and emotions the predominant being a mixture of confusion and dumbfoundedness. Some might say that we've seen it all before but I don't mind. Allen is a good comedian who always makes me smile and laugh. And the same can be said of his Roman film. Allen does not do anything new here but the movie is good. For example the idea of introducing a singer with the great voice who can only sing in the shower was original and smart. The film is funny witty beautiful bright and very light featherlight. Its creator is 76 years but you hardly believe it when he sends us on Roman holiday.My conclusion  any Allen's movie even average comparing to his best work is worth watching. If you are a diehard fan like me you've seen it already. I've said many times before and I repeat again  even the average Woody Allen's movie is better than most cookiecutter comedies released by big studios. If you are not a fan give To Rome with Love a chance you may fell in love with it. This is the first anthology by Allen for many years and I'm sure you'll like if not four by some of the stories. I am personally delighted by the story of the owner of the funeral home who sang like Caruso and Pavarotti but only in the shower to the sound of pouring water while lathering his back. Or perhaps you'll like a surreal story of a simple Roman office employee who one sunny day out of sudden became insanely famous and popular. Moreover he could not figure out what actually happened and what exactly he did or did not do? Real celebrities and the crowds of the journalists all listened to his every word as the highest wisdom. Or you may click with the story of Jack a young American architect student his girlfriend and her best friend  a heartbreaker of Jack's inner voice played by Alec Baldwin. Well if you cannot stand Allen I'll let you in on a secret if you do not know by now. There is also Penelope Cruz in the role of Anna I think Woody bowed to Anna Magnani's Mother Rome and Sophia Loren  Filomena from Marriage Italian Style and it is impossible to take the eyes off her. Anna  is the character from the fourth story which is about newlyweds who came to Rome for a honeymoon from the small town and the cheerful confusion that occurred when the young bride stepped out of the hotel and got lost in the maze of the Rome's streets. If the presence of Cruz in her second Allen's film is still not enough for you well then I do not even know what to say. Only that you should choose for your Roman holiday another Rome not the one that Woody Allen created.".

The main characters all happen to be gay but that is not the focal point of the movie. There is no subplots about AIDS or dealing with samesex marriages or disapproving parents. The movie starts when all that stuff has already happened. It really makes you think. Two thumbs up! The cast is superb. Although not superstars the movie has some well seasoned actors including Fraiser star John Mahoney. Zach Braff does an excellent job as does Andrew Keegan Dean Caine and of course Timothy Olyphant. Kerr Smith also has a small cameo but well worth it. This movie begins to break down the stereotypes of gay men and comes up with some great gay lingo that my friends and I have adopted.".

As one character puts it Gay men in LA are a bunch of 10's looking for an 11. Essentially the tale of a Queer sports team comprised of staff and management at a popular restaurant run by elderly patriarch John Mahoney Frasier the film's paperthin narrative is roused by a combination of lively dialogue and welldefined characters played to perfection by a terrific cast culled mostly from the New York stage Ben Weber is the 'Plain Joe' whose inability to attract a boyfriend is due more to his lack of selfesteem than absence of personality Dean Cain Superman himself! is a hunky aspiring actor who leaves a trail of broken hearts in his wake punkstyle Zach Braff portrays a gymqueen wilfully blind to the dark side of gym culture Matt McGrath and Justin Theroux are exlovers who can't seem to let go of one another and Andrew Keegan is the cute new kid who stumbles into this disparate group whilst struggling to come to terms with his burgeoning sexuality. The unofficial packleader Timothy Olyphant is smart and sassy and increasingly aware of the personal opportunities he's sacrificed in his relentless pursuit of casual sex with strangers.The actors invigorate a fairly routine scenario though Olyphant whose demonic good looks have typecast him in too many villainous roles dominates proceedings as a young man standing at the crossroads of his life seeking confirmation of his own personal value. Mahoney is funny wise and dignified as the Shakespearequoting softball coach and Broadway singeractor Billy Porter gets some of the best lines in a role that otherwise amounts to little more than comic relief. Beefcake is provided by supermodelturnedactor Michael Bergin Baywatch Hawaii and Christian Kane semiregular on TV's Angel in cameo roles and the lovely Kerr Smith appears briefly in one of the movie's best scenes. Watch out too for a memorable appearance by Jennifer Coolidge as a 'helpful' hair stylist who brings the house down with a single line of dialogue! However a subplot involving Weber's sister Mary McCormack and her attempts to become a mother with longterm partner Nia Long is underdeveloped to the point of redundancy memo to gay movie makers if you're gonna include lesbians in these otherwise allmale offerings do 'em properly or not at all! and Cain's muchpublicized 'kiss' with Keegan is coyly hidden by the angle at which it's filmed a hideous copout the eminently straight Olyphant has no such qualms  he kisses his male costars with reckless abandon!. Shot on location by cinematographer Paul Elliott AND THE BAND PLAYED ON the movie has the look and feel of a widescreen TV show dominated by closeups and medium shots which invalidate Berlanti's use of the scope format.Gay cinema doesn't really need another romantic comedy but while Broken Hearts doesn't offer anything new it's salvaged by snappy editing a quickfire pace and firstclass performances by some of America's finest young actors. And thanks to a clever throwaway bit of namedropping the movie offers fleeting confirmation  at last!  of the role played by sexgod Antonio Sabato Jr. in the fantasies of hormonallycharged gay teenagers everywhere!

Essentially an ensemble pic along the lines of The Big Chill we get a look inside the lives and loves of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood.  Not as raw as Queer As Folk or as tame as Will  Grace this movie is your basic young people in angst as featured weekly on FOX UPN  and the WB the only difference being these young people and a wonderful older John Mahoney are gay. The R rating for language drug use and sexual situations which are only suggested almost seems a bit of overreaction.

Essentially an ensemble pic along the lines of The Big Chill we get a look inside the lives and loves of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood.  Not as raw as Queer As Folk or as tame as Will  Grace this movie is your basic young people in angst as featured weekly on FOX UPN  and the WB the only difference being these young people and a wonderful older John Mahoney are gay. The R rating for language drug use and sexual situations which are only suggested almost seems a bit of overreaction.

Don't we know people like this all the time?So the guys in the film remind me of my husband's crowd. And the main character reminded me of when I said NO MORE to the bar scene and just screwing around to be screwing around. I especially liked the scene with the movie star where he says Wait ten minutes before leaving and make sure nobody sees you. How many times had I been told that line of bull? Several.

The movie accurately portrays all those jerks who line the walls on Friday Saturday and Sunday nights claiming they want a relationship when all they want is to get into a Newbie's pants.".

On second viewing thanks to the IFC channel The Broken Hearts Club looks a bit dated since more daring films and television series have come out of the closet recently. It must have been a courageous undertaking by its director Greg Berlanti in 2000 at a time that gays were not as prominent as now. The director shows a positive side of the gay life that is not seen often in that all the characters have values and integrity something not often seen in mainstream films.The film is an excuse to bring together a group of young men trying to cope with their lives in that environment. There are different stories that mesh well together. At the center of it all is Dennis a photographer that seems to have his feet well planted on the ground and knows what he wants. The friends are united by Jack the restaurant owner who has taken most of the guys under his wing at his bistro and as a coach them in the softball team.We watch the different situations and how the guys react to whatever comes their way. The acting is good in general. Timothy Olyphant makes an impression as the serious Dennis. Zach Braff a film director himself is good as Benji. Dean Cain is the fickle Cole who loves a variety of lovers rather than quality mates. John Mahoney appears as Jack the older influence on the group in an impressive performance.What director Greg Berlanti succeeded was in presenting young men that appear not to be clichs as in other films of this type. The film is pleasant without breaking new ground.".

Sure there's more than a couple stereotypes yes all gay people are pretty well to do and wear fabulous clothes yet there are some enjoyable stories and points pondered herein. I didn't buy Dean Cain's role and personally I thought the character got in the way. I did understand what I felt the writers message was that being actors and actresses still clinging tight to their closets in mythologically liberal Hollywood. I felt the issue could have been explored better or to make it a more integral part of the story. It was left in a symbolic limbo of sorts. Also John Mahoney's character and purple guy their relationship seemed peripheral to the story at best. As with many gay orientated movies it was the heartbreaking hunks who were pushed to center stage. Again a stereotype brought forth. At least we were spared the spectacle of a number of buff guys ruminating in angst as to Why are we so good looking? Yes the film takes place in West Hollywood and the film shows this from the onset. It would have been an interesting twist to have THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB A ROMANTIC COMEDY take place in say Dububque Iowa Scranton Pennsylvania or any small to medium sized city.   Overall it is a good movie and will get people talking which is more than enough to respect it on that point. Despite my aforementioned points the film has some funny moments and will certainly entertain within scope. Recommended.".

I would assume that in light of HBO's Sex and the City Hollywood would make an attempt at doing a gay version not that it was needed the HBO series is in its own right about four gay men  they're just played by women. Here we're introduced to widely different young men and one older queen played by John Mahoney easily the best part of the movie hands down and their struggles through love and disappointment in a very deep place called West Hollywood.Of course it can be rather difficult to feel anything for characters who in a heartbeat throw a potential date out of the house due to the fact they don't like or are acquainted with Karen Carpenter or when one a relationship counselor practically stalks his exlover not before dispensing tidbits of advice that hint at a reconciliation. Zach Braff at least fares better his character has a hilarious moment as he tries to pump up in order to catch the attention of the gym bunny who he has the hots for. The same goes for Ben Weber who plays the male version of what Cynthia Nixon did in Sex and the City even though his cynicism does wear out its welcome later in the film. He does have a great moment of total bewilderment alongside Mary McCormack who plays his lesbian sister who gives him a tight deadline to decide to donate his sperm so she and her partner played by Nia Long could have a baby. It's a movie with more pluses than minuses however. Take it as the latest paperback that you might find in your local drugstore or supermarket of choice  nothing that will amount to a classic but a quick entertaining read. And that's always welcome.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the craze revived by The Blair Witch Project it had been done before with movies like Cannibal Holocaust and The Last Broadcast Apollo 18 presents itself as footage of NASA's last voyage to the moon in the 1970s showing us the real reason why we never went back. Through said footage we follow the exploits of three American astronauts  two on the lunar surface and one in orbit above the moon  as they discover that the moon is hiding a terribly dark secret. Apparently there's something already there which has nothing to do with either the Americans or the Russians and it doesn't want us there... or maybe it does but for unpleasant reasons. This is not a spoiler by the way the trailer reveals as much.The pros of this movie include first and foremost that it's a rather unique idea for a story. Ever since man has first walked on the moon there really has been no speculation of whether or not the moon supported life and no I still believe it doesn't and ever since Apollo 17 there has been speculation on why we never returned though it likely has more to do with time money and risk than anything else. Another pro is the film's realistic look the lunar landscape appears realistic and the special effects are convincing as well. As for the scares they're plentiful without being overly so.Apollo 18 is not without its flaws though. One thing that had me scratching my head is the high amount of gravity which was shown inside the lunar landing vessel. Contrary to popular belief there IS gravity on the moon as well as between any two forms of mass though it's not nearly as strong as what we would find on Earth. You can see the astronauts jumping at large distances while walking on the lunar surface but not inside the lander. Secondly I kind of wish they had developed the lunarian creatures a little more. The filmmakers use creative camera work to keep several things hidden which does help add to the suspense but I still think it would have helped things more to show the lunarians a little more. In spite of these flaws the film kept my interest.I see a lot of people hating this movie. While they have every right to I'm kind of lost as to a reason why. No Apollo 18 isn't a great film but it's not terrible either. Just take it for what it is.".

The trouble with framing something as being documentary style footage is you have to get the science right and be free from any loopholes that might break the audience out of the illusion. Apollo 18 falls short on this count. LpezGallego manages to recreate to a certain extent the lunar missions. Portrayed through the various cameras feeding live footage back to Earth we have a Big Brother style look into the doomed from the start space mission. The two man crew of the lunar lander also film themselves on 16mm cameras. Herein lies some of the flaws in the director's logic. We need to get into the character's perspective to relate. This is solely done through these 16mm cameras. They film themselves on the moon's surface as well as personal records in the module. The rest is all caught on remote cameras the audience being allowed to see the threat before the crew do privy to the danger the Department of Defence has exposed them to. The live footage makes sense to have been documented however the 16mm film rolls do not make it out they share the crews dire fate. How then are we seeing the actions of the crew amidst this found footage? It makes no sense pulling any reasonably astute watcher beyond the line of suspension of disbelief.It seems clear LpezGallego wants us to care about the cast. We need to care for the conspiracy theory to resonate. The story very directly harks into the era of Watergate where the powers that be cannot be trusted. But his illusion of found footage does not stand up at all well. Does the story really fail on this account? No. It's actually fairly entertaining as it goes. The tension builds the threat is revealed and played out. However the conspiracy theme and the documentary framing lend the film no real benefit and do not pay off. While there is reams of data on the films website to build the conspiracy it is not present enough on screen to sideline the notion we are victim to a none to subtle slight of hand. What the film did do with the early footage was remind me why as a child I was so fascinated with space. It shows with sufficient realism what the actual Apollo astronauts did and how we as a planet reached for the stars. This is not history as it tries to suggest but it is a reminder to me at least of how sad it is that we no longer pursue such epic destinations as the moon or beyond.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that the current trend of the pseudodocumentaries in the horror genre obeys to two main factors first it allows the addition of a stylish variation to all those rancid and stale formulas which seemed worn by such a repetition like the masked killer haunted house tortureporn etc. which acquire a varnish of innovation when they are disguised as true events. And in second place this trend allows the making of movies with an intentionally bad manufacture something which is simple when there are not too many available resources. After all why worrying about the illumination the cinematography or the mise en scne when they can simply put a group of amateur actors in front of the camera and call that documentary? Sure there have been some pseudodocumentaries which took advantage of the opportunity to create something interesting like REC and Lake Mungo but most of those films take that as an excuse to lower the standards of the genre even more Paranormal Entity might be the clearest example. I think that the film Apollo 18 is on some intermediate point between both extremes because even though I found its screenplay absurd repetitive and occasionally a bit tiring it generally kept me moderately entertained because of the realism of its verit aesthetic and the attention to every detail shown on its production.The screenplay from Apollo 18 is something like an hybrid of Alien Sunshine and Moon even though with all the fantastic elements reduced in order to increment the realism from the story. That might be the main reason why the film did not leave me very satisfied and it even bored me a little bit during its most exciting moments. The trailers of Apollo 18 promised a horror film but the truth is that it lacks of the necessary impact in order to provoke an emotional or even visceral impact. Even the scares feel forced in the documentary context not to mention the difficulty of accepting the fact that the characters keep filming when any sensible person would have dropped the camera in front of the first sign of danger. Another problem is that the performances feel bland and not very credible. It was undoubtedly a good decision to pick unknown faces not to ruin the realistic premise but I think they should have picked actors with more talent and charisma.Having said all that I have to give Apollo 18 a slight recommendation because of its solid recreation of the lunar mission. The version of the Moon presented by the movie might not be totally faithful from the scientific point of view but it is more than enough for us to accept the premise and visually transport us to the satellite we had only seen in brief clips from the NASA and in scifi movies which had only showed various stones on a sandy field. I know that I should not be giving a movie even a slight recommendation only because of its special effects but they are so good in this movie that I am going to make an exception also stating the fact that the movie achieves a few good moments of tension during the first half. However I regret the fact that the visual talent from this film could not adorn a better and more terrifying story.".

I won't say that I was disappointed by the entire film but the last 20  30 minutes pretty much ruined it. I won't explain the entire plot mostly because all the reviews I read already covered it. I unlike some people enjoy the technique of slowly and suspensefuly drawing out the reveal of the monstercreature whatever. Two of my favorites are Super 8 and Cloverfield and they played off your imagination and growing desire to see the menace. Whereas Super 8 and Cloverfield utilized this when we finally get to see the creature up close it's a powerful moment. Apollo 18 tries its butt off to do this but fails miserably. For one the reveal is FAR too short letting us see the moon menaces for about 2 seconds in the whole damn film. Seriously. And as others have said they are almost laughably ridiculous. There is absolutely NO explanation as to why these friendly astronauts are being attacked. They didn't mess with the creatures or anything. They aren't even the type of beings who could eat humans. Maybe all of this would've been able to be looked over if only we were given any sort of time with them. Too bad cause it coulda been really good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Spanish director Gonzalo LpezGallego's conspiracy theory science fiction thriller Apollo 18 reminded me of director Peter Hyams' 1978 scifi melodrama Capricorn One starring Elliot Gould James Brolin Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson. In Capricorn One when NASA had to scrub the first Mars landing the space agency decided to fake it. Things grow complicated when the astronauts refuse to participate in the coverup and they are hunted down and killed. In Apollo 18 the Pentagon dictates policy for the next mission to the Moon but they keep everything shrouded in complete secrecy. Apollo 18 resembles lowbudget horror epics like The Blair Witch Project and the Paranormal Activity trilogy where the chills were captured on camera as they occur whether the characters are present or not. Apparently everything that the Apollo 18 crew shot with their video cameras got transmitted back to Mission Control because none of the spacecraft survived. According to the premise not only did some anonymous individuals obtain access to these classified videos but they also edited the footage and then uploaded it to the Internet. The outcome of Apollo 18 purports to be the reason that NASA never launched another Moon mission. Between the brooding opening and closing graphics about the Apollo program and the discovery of the footage the action is suspensefully staged by LpezGallego with realistic production values atmospheric stock footage and convincing performances. Warren Christie Lloyd Owen and Ryan Robbins play the doomed astronauts and register believably in their roles especially Owen as the infected space man. Freshman scenarist Brian Miller and uncredited scribe Cory Goodman of Priest evoke genuine paranoia along the lines of the Open Water movies as our protagonists find themselves trapped literally between a rock and a hard place in this 86minute PG13 rated opus.Basically the U.S. Department of the Defense blasts Lieutenant Colonel John Grey Ryan Robbins of Sanctuary Commander Nathan Walker Lloyd Owen of Miss Potter and Captain Benjamin Anderson Warren Christie of Battlestar Galactica into space to setup several sophisticated detection devices on the Moon. Ostensibly these detectors are designed to furnish the military with the most uptodate accurate intelligence about Soviet missile launches. Lieutenant Colonel Grey remains in the lunar orbiter nicknamed 'Freedom while Commander Walker and Captain Anderson land the lunar module and establish a base camp with a rover. They do all the usual stuff such like planting Old Glory and collecting Moon rocks. Later inside the lunar module they discover that somehow one of the rocks has gotten out of the sample collection bags. Meanwhile something mysteriously interrupts their transmissions when they discuss their mission and later their predicament with NASA and then with the shady officials at the Pentagon. Indeed our heroes encounter deadly aliens. These deadly aliens are not the variety that Hollywood usually serves up. They are unobtrusive and sneak up on the astronauts as they carry out their everyday chores. Nevertheless what they lack in terms of a wicked appearance like the monsters in the Alien franchise the Predator franchise the Species trilogy and the arachnoids in Starship Troopers these aliens make up for with sheer numbers and pugnacity. These are some nasty dastards and they proliferate at the South Pole of the Moon. One of the aliens infiltrates Walker's suit and enters his torso. Anderson removes it and is puzzled by it. It appears to be a solid object without arms legs or a head. Our heroes go out for a ride and stumble onto the last thing that they could imagine that isn't either an alien or a monolith. The discovery that they make shakes the very foundation of their trust in both NASA and the Pentagon. Meanwhile after the aliens attack our heroes are told to remain where they are and perish as heroes because the Pentagon refuses to help them.Apollo 18 emerges as the kind of movie that you cannot reveal a lot about without spoiling the surprises. LpezGallego adopts the look and the feel of a documentary and some of the footage appears to have been lensed as if it were designed for publicity news clips. The three man crew shoots most of the footage with NASA equipment while the on board NASA cameras and outboard Pentagon motion sensitive cameras record everything else. Indeed despite the few opening moments during a family cook out Apollo 18 confines itself to three men. The action consists of astronauts performing their routine scientific chores in orbit around the Moon as well as on it. As far as they know they are not expendable but they learn later that they are not cleared to know everything important about the mission. The guys create a genuine sense of camaraderie. Their performances bristle with verve and nuance particularly when Owen's Commander Walker goes bonkers. If you enjoy having the living daylights scared out of you by the sudden appearance of objects aliens and individuals LpezGallego provides at least three solid examples abetted in part by editor Patrick Lussier's shrewd cuts. The Apollo 18 predators are not ostentatious but they are nevertheless lethal. Mind you Lionsgate Studio and LpezGallego are imitating the mockumentary marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project to hype the film as the real McCoy. You would have to be hopelessly nave to believe in such a premise. The Los Angeles Times has reported that NASA had nothing to do with Apollo 18. Aside from the contrived circumstances under which the decades old footage eventually materializes Apollo 18 qualifies as a wonderfully creepy exercise in suspense and tension without a happy ending.".

LpezGallego adopts the look and the feel of a documentary and some of the footage appears to have been lensed as if it were designed for publicity news clips. The three man crew shoots most of the footage with NASA equipment while the on board NASA cameras and outboard Pentagon motion sensitive cameras record everything else. Indeed despite the few opening moments during a family cook out Apollo 18 confines itself to three men. The action consists of astronauts performing their routine scientific chores in orbit around the Moon as well as on it. As far as they know they are not expendable but they learn later that they are not cleared to know everything important about the mission. The guys create a genuine sense of camaraderie. Their performances bristle with verve and nuance particularly when Owen's Commander Walker goes bonkers. If you enjoy having the living daylights scared out of you by the sudden appearance of objects aliens and individuals LpezGallego provides at least three solid examples abetted in part by editor Patrick Lussier's shrewd cuts. The Apollo 18 predators are not ostentatious but they are nevertheless lethal. Mind you Lionsgate Studio and LpezGallego are imitating the mockumentary marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project to hype the film as the real McCoy. You would have to be hopelessly nave to believe in such a premise. The Los Angeles Times has reported that NASA had nothing to do with Apollo 18. Aside from the contrived circumstances under which the decades old footage eventually materializes Apollo 18 qualifies as a wonderfully creepy exercise in suspense and tension without a happy ending.";

The film quality  including the variance between clear video feeds and grainy footage  is true to the era of the Apollo missions so that works as well. The men who play the three astronauts each give outstanding performances  subtle enough that they add to the realism but intense when appropriate. The plot makes sense and unfolds as the movie progresses so you gradually learn  as the astronauts do  why they are there and why they brought so many cameras. The suspense builds steadily with a nice wallop at the end. And the creatures are about as terrifying as any I've seen in a film. True to the spirit of found footage type films you never really understand the creatures fully but their menace is clear. Not quite sure what the folks who panned this film were expecting but for me this delivered the goods with style.".

The reasons behind this are obvious as it allows the development team to avoid expensive special effects due to the quality of the footage.Acting is also good. Given most main scenes are set in tight spaces the actors have to get the most out of their environments. They do this well building on the feeling of being trapped by not one but two main enemies. In fact it is this doubt and then dawning realisation that they are simply pawns in a much bigger game which comes across best and the growing understanding that they aren't going to be coming home.Taking time to explain the reasons behind the mission a reasonable launch date to avoid prying eyes and having obviously paid attention to footage from the other Apollo missions the plot moves well. There's enough going on at all times to keep you engaged.In the end this is never going to be everyone's film. It's going to be compared to Blair Witch and will be disliked by those expecting a scifi effects fest. It isn't these things. It's just a well made horrorthriller that doesn't outlast its welcome.".

The trailer easily invites viewers in with a question Why didn't we go back to the moon? It's a simple enough thing to ask citing curiosity and a chance to enter a world of fiction.Yes. Apollo 18 can only be fiction. Real footage does not require a Director and the actors are listed in another films as well. Also no life can be sustained upon the Moon. there is no atmosphere because the moon's mass is too small to create gravity and without gravity you can't have atmosphere. So how are alien spiders running around the moon? also the astronauts walk around as normal shuffling even. NASA most likely abandoned going to the moon because it's not possible to terraform it.As long as you suspend your disbelief and take the movie for what it really is  fun fiction  then Apollo 18 is a good thriller. The movie is filmed on video creating a grainy quality with a hand held camera to create a more realistic atmosphere. Although lacking in great splashes of action the movie is short and concise pushing the story along at an even pace.Suspend your disbelief and you find yourself in a thrilling mystery twisted with betrayal and fear. Apollo 18 is a good movie as long as you ignore the silly claim that it could possibly be real. On the whole it is very enjoyable and moves along at a very good pace.".

But 18 has 3 different angles to contend with so even though you as the viewer know something is wrong you can't exactly tap one fella on the shoulder and say Excuse me chap you don't want to be doing that.Not sure if it will come across as well on the small screen mind deffo a film to watch in the cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Matj is certainly one of the best films that I have seen in the past months. However I have to admit that the story and the message are especially tailored to my needs and appeal to my interests and activities. It is a Russian produce and just like all other Russian movies that I know the pace is rather slow. This may be due to the nature of the Russian people and actually it did not bother me. The narrative is based on a book of Gorki that had earlier drawn my attention thanks to the beautiful cantate that Berthold Brecht and Hanns Eisler made some decades ago. It tells the struggle for emancipation of a young worker in a steel mill around 1900 in Tsarist Russia. Surprisingly his rather meek mother manages to follow him on his road to awareness and development. Both actors do an excellent job and the protracted shots of Inna Churikova's face as the stupefied mother convince you that her brain is constantly grinding and creaking. I also like the scenes of village life and the quiet Russian music which both match the quality of this master piece Doctor Zhivago. I have never read the book but the film plot is highly credible and seems historically correct. The primitive life of the peasants and workers and the omnipresent oppression of the Tsarist regime are well known from other sources. We see this in the film for instance when the leaflets for agitation in the factory are all written by hand. The son is arrested for trying to obtain a printing press and in addition reads prohibited books. Although I seriously doubt if reading the Marxist and quasiscientific book Capital will much benefit a steel worker. Authentic is also the mother knitting the red flag for an event on May 1. On this day her son will be the flag carrier of the small group of socialists during a demonstration before their steel mill. Somewhat strange is the demand of the workers namely the realization of the political democracy. This is a political requirement and usually the workers were more enthusiastic about trade unionism leading to economic improvements prompt payments reduced hours hot tea authentic!. In addition a demonstration with only ten people together marching against the complete regiment of soldiers that protects the mill shows a silliness that seems inappropriate even for primitive workers. Nevertheless I concede that it may have happened on rare occasions. The scenes of the trial by the Tsarist tribunal are brilliant. There is also a shot of Lenin visiting the grave of Marx in London  which is authentic. Slightly confusing is the fact that a parallel drama line is interwoven in the plot. The affair with the printing press fails due to treason by a fellow worker. Later this man is murdered by another worker notably his nephew in revenge. This was certainly not the normal procedure in the labor movement of the time. The murderer is caught and seduced into cooperating with the secret police. In the final scene this villain stabs the mother to death for no apparent reason other than the distribution of leaflets. This is farfetched and I do not see the point. The Tsarist regime was undoubtedly ruthless in its oppression no tears for the Tsar and the secret police may have tortured on occasions but it definitely did not kill at random. The officers supporting the regime were perhaps illmannered and illguided but their intimidating actions remained relatively decent and humane. In fact the years of Lenins exile to Siberia were the healthiest ones in his life. The killing of the mother was a personal drama but not a social one and thus offtheme. Nevertheless as a whole the film is highly recommendable. If you like this genre you will also appreciate the films Reds Rosa Die Unbesiegbaren and perhaps Germinal some of which are in my list of reviews.".

He usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios. He's a hazard in a car but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle. But through it all he never loses his aplomb which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall.In this film the 20th Century is best or worst represented by the recurring presence of Americans. Around the time of the release of this film the French began to worry that the American who had liberated them from the Germans might never go away  a worry that remains influential in French politics to this day and with some justification. Certainly Tati's postman on his humble bicycle appears to be no match at all for the Americans in their motor vehicles  except that his innocent buffoonery somehow manages to get the best of them every time.That give's the film a slight satirical edge and one which leaves a real impression.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie will undoubtedly not be what you expect. The coverart of Tati DVDs paints him as a Chaplinesque figure but he's much gentler than Charlie. Charlie was energetic. You'll enjoy Tati's films if you expect a gentle trip to a beautiful little village. Throughout the film you observe more than get really involved. Tati always keeps you at a distance like a stranger.I liked Mon Oncle the best first run through but by that stage it was the fourth of Tati's major four pictures I'd seen so that must have coloured my impression. The most famous is Les Vacances de M. Hulot and M. Hulot is Tati's famous character who appears in Mon Oncle Les Vacances and Playtime. He doesn't appear in Jour de Fete which was Tati's first first featurelength.Tati is the Antonioni of slapstick comedy. There's plenty to look at in his movies as long as you stop waiting for a narrative. None of them have real stories. They do progress but its more the visual motifs of the various townspeople that develop throughout.Of the four I'd say Playtime is the least friendly to firsttimers.All copies of Jour de Fete since 1995 feature the imperfect colour process it was filmed with. Its not colourised that's just the best colour method that Tati had at his disposal in 1949 in France. Even after restoration it suffers from overbrightening and unevenness in colour and the overall impression is of a bad colourisation so just be ready for that and remember this colour version wasn't available until 1995 before that there was no colour and I think the colour's an important part of the experience of Tati's fete.I'd recommend you rentborrow before buying any Tati so you know what you're getting. Probably youtube won't be the best place any small segment of his films won't make sense on its own they're quite slowpaced and the characters and scenes are meant to accumulate not be excerpted.Happy hunting.".

When the carnival comes to town a tent cinema shows a movie of the hilariously hightech highspeed muscleman American postmen the insecure Francois first gets very drunk and then is seized with the urge to do his job very very fast. Gentle sharpeyed teeming with life this isn't even regarded as one of his best but after trying for years this screening finally brought me around to LOVING Tati. For one thing it's a love letter to bicycles a sure sell for the surprisingly large Bike Week audience that came out to Cinecycle for this screening. For another thing there are more articulated personalities in this movie than there are in any dozen current releases EVERYONE is acutely drawn from the woman in the high window to the recurring character of the buzzing bug. It's a goddam tapestry of humanity and as a result it's positively moving as well as laughoutloud funny. It's also very cinematic in spite of its antiquity most obviously in some outofnowhere colorization but also in compositions that pay off in a much less rigidly controlled way than any comparable American comedy  the good stuff is often happening in the corner of the frame like a good Mad comic with a halo.".

The speed of the modern way of life is brilliantly compared by the typical easy calm French way. Francois symbolizes this old way by doing everything slow and wrong on and off his bicycle. The little but creative stunts are really figured out for that time and are inspired by Buster Keaton and have a little touch of Chaplin in them.The uniqueness of the film is that the story is creating itself. As the day follows we get to know the village and it's inhabitants and we are also learn a small lesson by a little old lady with a goat.Surely a must see!".

	schema:headline " The Americanization";
	schema:reviewBody "Jacques Tati got an idea to create a comical postman character named Francois. He first got to try him in a short film L'cole des facteurs 1947 The School for Postmen which was first supposed to be directed by Rene Clement who had directed a few shorts with Tati but after Rene got sick Jacques Tati decided to direct it himself. The audience loved it and the producer asked Tati to make a fulllength version of it? Instantly Jacques Tati started working on it. He used many of the same gags he had used in The School for Postmen but added a deeper level made the film more personal symbolic and allegorical.When France was occupied by Nazi Germany during WWII Jacques Tati decided to go live in a small village. He promised to the people that if he'd keep making films after the war he would come back to the village to make a film. Well after the war was over he kept his promise. This is one of the main reasons what why this film was successful most of the people who acted in it were actual citizens of the village they were the same people who helped Tati during the war. Jour de fete was made with an incredibly lowbudget basically the cast and the crew worked without salary they decided to make the film and if it would make money they'd get it. So the cast  crew was very close and in it with their hearts.In Jour de fete the peace of the small village is broken by aliens  the market people. The people who come to the village try to change it bring something new to it infiltrate to it. This is allegorical to Jacques Tati's earlier situation when the Germans came to France occupied it and changed it. It's a film against imperialism this is one way too look at it. But there are several more interpretations and things to look at Jour de fete.The other is the Americanization of France and the rest of the world. Many film historians have researched how The Marshall Plan affected cinema it had the strongest impact on Italy but many state that the deepest study and influence can be seen in Tati's Jour de fete. Well of course the people who come to the village can represent this and globalization but the most obvious reference is when Francois starts to compete with the Americans. This is quite a melancholy sequence in Jour de fete Jacques Tati was always very good in combining melancholy and hilarity the villagers decide to water Francois drunk and after that show him a documentary about American postmen whose mail work much better they can post letters and packages much faster with airplanes and helicopters. After seeing this Francois feels the need to try compete with the Americans  starts delivering the mailings much more faster and the villagers joke at the expense of him.This is a hilarious sequence where Francois hardly tries to work as fast as the Americans but just ends up losing the control of his bike and destroying mailings. Many have written long studies based on this one sequence. Jour de fete is basically a tribute to the burlesque comedy to the American masters that Tati admired Charles Chaplin Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. In this sequence Jacques Tati makes some clear references to The General 1926 a film by Buster Keaton. In The General Buster Keaton loses the control of his train in which his girl is in. He starts running after it just as Francois does after his bike. The scene where Francois just almost gets the bike is taken directly from The General when Keaton runs through the woods and just almost catches the train.Jour de fete of course isn't just a tribute to these American masters Jacques Tati was bored at only seeing American films like this he wanted to make a French one and in the posters of Jour de fete he challenged the people to support French cinema instead of American. The scene where Francois tries desperately to erect the French flag at the center of the village is very symbolic Jacques Tati tries to erect the flag of French cinema to the American ground burlesque comedy.In addition to the deep content of the film it's aesthetically gorgeous. Jacques Tati decided to make the first French color film but because he wasn't sure of the technique they used two different cameras one blackandwhite and one Technicolor. Unfortunately they couldn't make it work in the laboratory and had to use the black and white version which Jacques Tati didn't like. After his death his daughter Sophie Tatischeff made a new restored version with the colors his father wanted. This allows us to see it in its original form and I think it really needs to be seen in colors. Because Tati planned it to be a color film it obviously has some meaningful parts that don't work in black and white. It's aesthetically but also narratively important.This is a very good film after it was finished it instantly became very popular and the producers suggested Jacques Tati to continue making films with the character Francois. But he wanted to make another character which would have a wider meaning. In result of this born Mr. Hulot who Jacques Tati played in 4 films. Jour de fete is his first fulllength feature but still stands out as a masterful film.".

Actually subtitles are not really necessary at all. Even bornandbred Parisians would have difficulty penetrating the heavy provincial accents of the villagers. Furthermore much of the dialogue is deliberately mumbled slurred or made indecipherable by background noise. The only stretch of speech that is clearly heard is the narration of the tent movie and its information could easily be picked up by simply watching the visuals. Even an ability to understand the old lady she is supposed to be a native but has an incongruous Parisian accent who acts as a narrator to tie the various segments together is not at all important.So what we actually have here is pure pantomime that is given added realism by being filtered through an aural surround. Tati is the perfect clown who makes the most of a succession of clever gags that are superbly timed and all the more enjoyable because of their insight into the mores and customs of the little village. In fact as a revelation of village life with all its atmosphere its interplay its horseplay its petty quarrels its comeandgo tensions the movie is second to none.The support characters too have a wonderful part to play in the action whether professional players like Frankeur Beauvais and Decomble or simple villagers like Valle and Wirtz who never made another movie in their lives.The beautiful music score lends further enchantment to the pastel colors of Tati's immaculately chosen locations.All told a little masterpiece and a fitting herald to Tati's best and most celebrated movie Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot 1953.".

He is determined to follow the American example through the few resources granted him and fast it sure goes but how much BETTERreally?By the time JOUR DE FTE was released towards the end of the 'forties Jacques Tati had appeared sporadically in films for nearly two decades so the medium was by no means alien to him.

The preference for the absurd to dominate rather than a coherent story is established and also at this early point Tati makes sure to avoid audible dialogue whenever possible. Furthermore he treats us with several clever cinematic twists and turns in his manner of choreographing the gags and situations in the film one example occurs early on when Franqouis is introduces to us while riding on his bicycle clearly disturbed by a furious wasp that stalks him. We see him arrive in longshot below us as our viewpoint is positioned from the top of a slope. As he waves the wasp away and finally regains peace our focus shifts to a farmer standing at the spot of the slope from where our viewpoint is located the wasp of course hastily flies to the farmer to seek his attention instead which the poor man won't deal with so he too waves it awayleading it back to Franqouis who all the while has remained in sight in the distance. This sequence obviously funnier when seen than read serves as a neat demonstration of how Tati was able to conjure a promising gag into a sidesplitting highlight of a film through his astute visual understanding. Granted it is less obvious here than in his later films one has to be more alert in order to notice the truly special moments but this is not necessarily a disadvantage.Yet another archetypal Tatiingredient present in his first fulllength feature is the sheer focus on humanity. None of the characters involved are particularly well developed which one might miss in one way but this makes the ultimate message of the film more abstract you don't have to consider it if you don't want to. To viewers who like to engage in analyzing however the central theme of JOUR DE FTE is the same as in almost all of Tati's films more precisely the many alienating effects of a modern society. This was a topic which had become increasingly hot in literature and other fiction since the late nineteenth century after the growing industrialism had defined the socialeconomical structures of the entire modern world and its less pleasing aspects had begun to unfold in the consciousness among common people. The relevance of this topic is likely to endure as I see no immediate end to the obsessive development of technology present today good and bad. However Tati's approach is here as later much less grim than that of George Orwell's futuristic novel or even Chaplin's MODERN TIMES while watching the mishaps of poor postman Franquois one can't be expected to think of much else than what occurs in the moment as he is constantly surrounded by characters of the same traditional clownworld as himself as well as merry often harmonious music. I suspect that the values which the film may possess in other terms than mirth making are likely to be ignored to a large degree by viewers who don't give the film some thought afterwards.JOUR DE FTE may not be Tati's best film for one thing the character of Franqouis does not although funny bear the kind of charisma or individuality which made Mr. Hulot into an icon. One does also get the impression that some of the gags and bits in the film when compared to Tati's later output would have benefited from more polish. Even so it's definitely well worth tracking down for a number of reasons which I've here tried to summarize the best I can. Finally I might add that I've only watched the original version in mostly blackandwhite not the much later restored and colorized one.".

This remake really only becomes one during the final twentyminutes when nearly every gag from the short is copied over. I didn't find any of the gags here to work as well and that includes the riding on the back of the truck the church bell and of course the bike running around on its own. The added gag of Tati accidentally hitting a large pig in the road got a small chuckle but it wasn't hilarious. The first hour of the film kept me entertained but I'd be lying if I say I laughed a lot. For the most part the film due to Tati's performance kept a smile on my face but for a comedy I was really hoping to laugh more. I found the biggest problem to be with the supporting characters who don't support Tati very well. There are countless gags that these supporting players set up but they add very little to the joke and again everything has to fall on Tati. The scene where they try to get the pole up in the air was very funny though.".

The film concerns a festival in a small town and the colorful postman Tati who serves it.Originally shot in both color and black and white with the black and white to be used if something happened to the untried color film. As fate would have it the film remained only viewable in black and white until recently because no lab would attempt to process the color film stock. Recently the color negative was processed and edited together by Tati's daughter. The result is a film that looks like a slightly faded color postcard from days gone by. I mention this because the film feel like an old snap shot of days gone by.The film is an okay film. Its funny and charming and very rough around the edges as befits a first feature. Its not a terrible film by an means but its not a great film. The film at times in fits and starts and there often seems to be long build ups to jokes that misfire while some seeming throw away gags bring big laughs. Its a problem that plagued several of Tati's other films to a lesser extent but here seems a bit more rampant because there doesn't seem to be the same rigid control Tati had in the Hulot comedies. Speaking of the Hulot films this film appears to have been raided if not for gags but for a certain visual style. I think every later film save Play Time has echoes in this one.I like this film but I don't love it. Its not a film that I'm going to be putting on again any time soon. Yes I will watch it again particularly once the memory of my recent marathon viewing of the Huolt films fades.If you're a Tati fan I'd give it a try.

	schema:reviewBody "With Jour de Fete French genius Jacques Tati began exploring many themes that littered his quite wonderful career. The plot is like many of his works very simple and is centred around one very basic idea  here the bumbling postman Francois played by Tati. The small rural town of SainteSeveresurIndre is visited by a travelling fair who bring joy and colour to an otherwise quiet area. Francois goes quietly about his business under the nose of the villagefolk who hardly seem to notice him apart from when they're making fun of him or getting him drunk. After seeing a documentary showing the advanced methods of postal delivery in the U.S. Francois makes use of everything around him to make his own service as fast and efficient as in America.Clocking in at only 70 minutes this is certainly Tati's least ambitious project but he was very much honing his craft this was his directorial dbut . His reputation as the Antonioni of slapstick is evident as Tati feels just as comfortable watching the simple and natural interaction of the village's inhabitants in the quite beautiful rural landscape as he is falling on his arse. Tati barely appears for the first twenty minutes or so which is relatively laughfree but these early scenes are important in understanding the point of the film. By having such a calm and naturalistic opening Francois' desperate struggle to meet the demands of a society relying increasingly on technology becomes all the more ridiculous. And there lies the satire something that he explored more headon and ambitiously in Playtime 1967.Not to say Jour de Fete is without ambition as Tati was so dedicated to his craft that he shot the film on two cameras  one with standard blackandwhite photography that was the norm in 1949 and one with Thomsoncolour a quite primitive and experimental colourising process. Thomsoncolour went bust before the film was released and Tati was forced to release the blackandwhite version that circulated for years. Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff and cinematographer Francois Ede managed to release the film in it's original colour in 1995 but the film looks grainy damaged and diluted. Yet it's nice to think that Tati thought his work and vision was too grand for blackandwhite and he's right. Although this is by far the least laughoutloud of Tati's work that I've seen there is plenty here to hint at the genius to come namely the quite brilliant final few frames that has an excited child running after the leaving fair gradually shrinking in the distance.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Jacques Tati proves more than any other filmmaker that comedy isjust as much an art form as drama. This was his first featurelength film and while it's not quite up to the level of his threemasterpieces M. Hulot's Holiday Mon Oncle and Playtimealthough the first time I saw each of them I said the same thingit's as delightful as almost any other film ever made. Tati is not yetM. Hulot but Francois a postman who rides through his smallhometown delivering mail on his bike. As the film opens the townis preparing its Bastille Day festivities apparently I don't think theyever say Bastille Day but it's pretty obvious. The jokes are notquite on the same level as those other three they are a bit moreslight though there were plenty of laughoutloud moments thecrosseyed guy has two hilarious scenes. Around 23 of the film is spent during the celebration Tati builds adelightful atmosphere that will be recall memories of these typesof small town fairs if you youself have taken place in them. Like hisother films the plot is very tenuous. Tati is much more interestedin the people around him.Near the end of the fair Francois sees a newsreel that shows howhigh tech American postmen are. They are trained to flyhelicopters the film tells us and do so to deliver the mail. Somehave their own airplanes. To train they race motorcycles throughobstacle courses jumping over fire and such. Francois isdepressed by the lack of adventure and supreme efficiency in hisown work through the night people tease him about being tinycompared to the American postmen. The next morning Francois devises different ways to make hisroute go faster. A lot of these scenes are repeated from his shortEcole de facteurs which is included on the Criterion DVD of MonOncle this film has been out on VHS before I've heard thatCriterion also restored Jour de fete but have no plans to release ityet which is depressing and well confusing. The end is as beautiful as the marvelous endings of his threemasterpieces. Fin in a Tati film is always a sad event. I can't thinkof any other filmmaker whose films I desire to watch over and overagain I've seen M. Hulot's Holiday three times in the month and ahalf since I bought it. There were tears in my eyes when Finappeared. 910.".

As the film opens the townis preparing its Bastille Day festivities apparently I don't think theyever say Bastille Day but it's pretty obvious. The jokes are notquite on the same level as those other three they are a bit moreslight though there were plenty of laughoutloud moments thecrosseyed guy has two hilarious scenes. Around 23 of the film is spent during the celebration Tati builds adelightful atmosphere that will be recall memories of these typesof small town fairs if you youself have taken place in them. Like hisother films the plot is very tenuous. Tati is much more interestedin the people around him.Near the end of the fair Francois sees a newsreel that shows howhigh tech American postmen are. They are trained to flyhelicopters the film tells us and do so to deliver the mail. Somehave their own airplanes. To train they race motorcycles throughobstacle courses jumping over fire and such. Francois isdepressed by the lack of adventure and supreme efficiency in hisown work through the night people tease him about being tinycompared to the American postmen. The next morning Francois devises different ways to make hisroute go faster. A lot of these scenes are repeated from his shortEcole de facteurs which is included on the Criterion DVD of MonOncle this film has been out on VHS before I've heard thatCriterion also restored Jour de fete but have no plans to release ityet which is depressing and well confusing. The end is as beautiful as the marvelous endings of his threemasterpieces. Fin in a Tati film is always a sad event. I can't thinkof any other filmmaker whose films I desire to watch over and overagain I've seen M. Hulot's Holiday three times in the month and ahalf since I bought it. There were tears in my eyes when Finappeared. 910.";

Even though he is not Mr. Hulot here his main character employs the same slowdeveloping type of visual humor as in his Hulot movies.As has been noted Jour de Fete is about a small French village's preparations for the Bastille Day holiday in spite of the bumbling Francois the town's postman. The camera follows him on his daily rounds to deliver mail and to cope with numerous hazards and humorous dilemmas almost all of his own creation. He is always gentle and not temperamental and explosive like Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp and he is often befuddled like Buster Keaton. This puts him in the company of some of filmdom's elite comics and he surely belongs with this group. They too belong to another era and to appreciate them and Tati you must be of a certain age. As I noted in my review of Playtime modern audiences may lose patience with Tati's subtle deliberate style.Jour de Fete is delightfully funny and ought to be seen several times as there are often several gags ongoing in the same scene. If you are a fan Tati is like Napoleon brandy  sipped and not gulped down.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you were forced to discard one piece of the soundtrack from Jour de fte it would be an easy choice to toss the dialogue. For Tati each physical gag was an opportunity for aural emphasis and embellishment and each sound had the potential to be a punchline. His works have roots from the worlds of vaudeville and pantomime and retain a little of the silent film masters  the technical virtuosity and timing of Keaton the bumbling everyman of Lloyd the attitude of Chaplin. But Tati's mastery of slapstick would not be complete without his sound design and through it he finds a way to magnify the farce of the everyday. Take for example his performance in Ren Clment's Soigne ton gauche where he plays the slacker Roger pushed into filling in as an impromptu sparring partner. The boxer makes a big show of flexing his muscles causing his jacket to burst at the seams and unzip with an aural flourish. Naturally Tati follows suit but his sorely lacking build instead causes his buttons to come undone with irregular and staggered pops. The sound is not merely what we should hear but part of the punchline itself and how it pokes fun at the character's stature. The introduction of Francois the postman would not be complete without sound as he rides into the village unceremoniously and is promptly assaulted by a bee visible only in the buzzing of the soundtrack. The shot like most of Tati's is pulled back and tracks his character around the bend as the bee switches visual planes and begins to annoy a farm observing from above on a hill and he too begins to wave and flap his arms like a madman and circle around an invisible foe. Another delightful sound gag occurs as Francois takes it upon himself to assist the villagers mounting a flagpole for the annual festival and in the midst of his elaborate gestures and instructions backs his head into the pole. The blow is soft so Tati utilises a 'doink' that makes a curious suggestion about the contents of his brain and Francois is only momentarily stunned. In the next moment he steps back onto a rake invoking a classic and causing it to flip up and hit him on the head but instead of a different sound effect from what we expect is a harder blow Tati reuses the same 'doink'. The joke isn't on his clumsiness or lack of spatial awareness but rather a jab at the thickness of his skull and its ability to take punishment. The gag also demonstrates Tati's knack for subverting an audience's expectations and twisting a humorous situation into something else  look at how Francois enters the village on collision course for the teetering flagpole before smoothly maneuvering his bicycle ducking under and turning straight into the open door of the local cafe. By acknowledging the predictability of his gags he could extend them into something much funnier he flips the joke around by having Francois place a chair into the gap to prevent a fall only to pull it away a moment later and deliver the punchline. Even as we can see it coming we laugh because the the comedic timing is impeccable and the situation unavoidable. Tati's puppetlike command of Francois' gangly limbs is skillful and the way he entangles himself into every possible predicament on his pathway is all the more impressive because of the impossible precision and coincidence required he slides along a package and times it perfectly with the swing of the butcher's knife. Sometimes the payoffs are longer and merge seamlessly with other jokes. The crosseyed man wins Francois a prize and then later as he drunkenly takes aim he is ever so slightly veered off course by a disparaging remark and shatters a window display instead with a trajectory the former would be proud of. The film itself was shot in both black and white and Thomsoncolor but the latter was never processed and only restorations can reveal a little of Tati's original vision. That version is ironically tattered and spotty compared to the crisp BW the proposed bright popping and saturated hues now bleary and faded. The simple effects earmark the film as one of Tati's least formally invention visions in simulating darkness he sidesteps dayfornight photography and instead employs a murky blue filter and pipes in a track of cicadas. Tati had been an adept comic performer for years before he hit the big screen finely tuning his grasp of physical comedy and taking on the odd acting job. His first short School for Postmen was a handful of gags stitched together involving Francois and plays like an undercranked version of the longer film. Starting with this feature he began to imbue his work with a sense of thematic absurdity and surround his characters with larger societal forces exaggerated for comic effect. Francois is a harmless figure who thinks himself larger than life until he views American propaganda and realises he isn't all that and is momentarily struck by the meaninglessness of his work. The American postmen seem like chiselled Apollos veritable Supermen without fear and the fact that Francois doesn't exactly fit the bill won't deter him and pumping his legs furiously he attempts his route 'Americanstyle' and gets into a whole lot more trouble. In his later films Tati's art direction and set design became stylised to the point of being caricature as symbolic props seeking to expose the sleek sterility and superficiality of modern living. But here he paints the village with affection and nostalgia and acknowledges every farmer butcher and small businessowner as the content characters they are still untouched by the grips of capitalist modernity. They would never fall to the brand of existentialism that plagues Francois who for all his effortless lack of coordination and vigour is relegated to hay duty by a skipping little boy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jacques Tati's first feature came as a salve to the horrors of war and its resulting despair check out the trailer as proof and the film's sweet sensibility seems designed to make the postwar French audience feel good about itself. It details an innocent peaceful time in the countryside in which a traveling fair comes to a small village almost as a reward for surviving the heartache of the previous decade and the happy villagers flock en masse to forget about their stresses for a day. Tati plays the village mail carrier a selfrighteous but likable beanpole who after watching a film at the makeshift cinema about advances in American mail delivery attempts to mimic them in all their ridiculousness using only his trusty bicycle. Tati has no problem poking gentle fun at his character's stuffiness but also delights in the absurdity of the feeling of inferiority the French seemed to have assumed after years of living under the yoke of the Nazis and then the Allies their competition with America is presented as needless and silly. It's not for nothing that Tati's character is named Francois. As a comedian Tati seems to derive his influence primarily from Buster Keaton's graceful and perfectly timed stunts but his take is more wobblyyou really feel the danger of what's happening on screen almost as if it were unrehearsed. Among other stunts he rides his bike through a fire and cuts in front of an oncoming car. While there are no real laughoutloud moments there are plenty of warm chuckles and some really pleasurable recurring gags particularly with a crosseyed old man. But where the film shines is in its poignant conclusion where the promise of a carefree future is personified by the child who adopts Tati's responsibilities after he sheds them to fade into the anonymity of the peasantry. As long as you come into Jour de Fete with the right attitude and appreciate it for what it represents you'll have some fun.".

The film is pretty much without plot and the main story involving a postman only starts a significant way into it but it still manages to amuse. The narration by an old woman does not enhance the film though. Certain random objects are coloured in for the black and white print and while this is interesting too see it is just a gimmick and not anything artistic. There is little if any thematic motivation behind the choices of what is to be in colour and therefore it barely enhances the film.

Before watching this colour version I felt sure I'd seen the film in black and white in about 1949. All I seemed to remember was the postman leaping on his tethered bike cycling away and being jerked to a standstill. But somehow it didn't look at all the same when I saw it in colour just now. Are the two versions identical in content ?Anyway the film has little to do with the fate worse than death. Unusually for Tati who has here a nearly normal walk it has something which is almost a plot which is that Tati sets out to demonstrate that he is the equal of American postal practices employing planes helicopters and the rest. Needless to say he fails but his French failure is preferable for those members of humanity with endearing values. End of story. I didn't think it was much good but it foreshadowed Hulot's sublime holiday. Holidays have no plots they just are. And so are ftes. Good shots of happy children.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life or Something Like It' is a romantic comedy with a betterthanaverage premise.  It attempts to address the question if you suddenly discovered that you might only have a week more to live how would you spend that remaining time and what changes would you make to your life?'  Perhaps because this IS a romantic comedy the best the film can manage to do within the tight strictures of the format is to raise a few of the more provocative issues surrounding the theme  those dealing with the meaning of life and the vagaries of fate for example  then drop them so it can address itself to the customary clichs one would expect to find in a film of this genre. One only wonders how a more seriousminded European filmmaker for instance might have tackled the same subject matter.Angelina Jolie plays a beautiful but thoroughly superficial and selfabsorbed TV news reporter living a nearperfect life in Seattle. Indeed when we first meet her Lanie Kerigan seems to have everything going for her stunning good looks a glamorous profession a handsome major league ballplayer fianc and now a major career advancement in the form of a regular spot on a national morning news program.  One day however her world comes crashing in when she meets up with a homeless man on the street a selfstyled prophet of God' who tells Lanie that she will die within a week.  When all his other predictions begin to come true Lanie realizes that this man may not be quite the lunatic or charlatan all her friends and acquaintances keep assuring her he is. Given this setup Life or Something Like It' can't help but grab our attention.  We wonder how we too would react if such a horrifying scenario were to suddenly present itself in our own lives. The problem is that the movie doesn't really do much with the material it has to work with.  Nothing Lanie does seems particularly thoughtful or meaningful when she is confronted with potentially imminent death indulging in some halfhearted attempts to reconcile herself with an estranged sister and father giving up her healthobsessive diet and exercise regimen and dumping the fianc with whom she discovers she has nothing in common.  Considering the thematic potential of this material the film always seems to be lagging several intellectual beats behind where it should be.  This is particularly true in the predictable lovehate relationship she shares with Pete one of her cameraman coworkers.  Yet oddly enough it is this very pairing of Jolie with Edward Burns that gives the film its moments of greatest charm.  Both performers are so likeable in their understated warmth and vulnerability that we can't help liking and rooting for their two endearing characters. Paradoxically then the film satisfies us most when it is at its least innovative.  The movie is at its worst in an embarrassingly unconvincing scene wherein a boozedup Lanie sans makeup and carefully groomed coiffure leads a contingent of striking workers in a rendition of Satisfaction' in the middle of a live TV interview.  Cloying moments like these merely serve to remind us that we are stranded in movie fantasy land when the film could with a little more effort have ascended to a much higher level.  The film incidentally endorses a rather reactionary view of women in the workplace arguing that a woman needs to consider whether achieving success in the corporate world is worth sacrificing a chance at achieving marital and familial happiness  a quandary that never seems to be posed to male characters in movies.Despite the fact that it has moments of quality and charm the film ultimately feels like a case of lost opportunity.  One finds oneself leaving the theatre in a state of frustrating ambivalence acknowledging that the film works on a level of superficial entertainment but knowing that with a little more depth and insight it could have amounted to so much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life or Something Like It. Dumb title if you ask me. Angelina Jolie as a blond? I don't think so. Ed Burns as the love interest? Sounds like a chickflick or something like it.'  All this needed was Greg Kinnear and I think we'd have something like Someone Like You' right? Well not exactly. Although this movie was obviously aimed at the female crowd and used just about every chickflick clich under the sun there was more here than I expected. I found this movie very predictable for the most part but the characters are so engaging  especially Jolie's that you find yourself getting wrapped up in them and the story that surrounds them. The thing that stood out for me where a couple of scenes that had the audience so quite you could have heard a pin drop. One was when Angelina Jolie's character asks her fianc what it is between them that dictates they should be together. Utter silence. The theater in anticipation of what lame answer is about to spew forth from her jock boyfriend was silent. The other was when Angelina's character is interviewing Stockard Channing's. Again total silence from the crowd. Those two moments in the movie  made it worth while for me. The rest is just as you would expect. I didn't find any above caliber performances here just the really good ones you'd expect from this cast. You wont see this one on Oscar night but I thought it was worth the ticket price and it didn't feel like a waste of time. That's my take. What's yours?".

	schema:headline " Interesting comedydrama movie from several angles";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie thanks in large part to the fact that I saw it on FX channel on their DVD on TV movie night where those two hosts can't remember their names... give you supplementary facts and other commentary about the movie during the commercial breaks.The story was actually fairly engrossing Angelina Jolie's character Lanie Kerrigan who is a news reporter is told by some strange street prophet Jack played by Tony Shaloub that she will die in a week. The story unfolds as she proceeds to live her rather hectic selfabsorbed life interspersed with romance a somewhat strained relationship with her father and sister and the everpresent wonderment as to whether Jack the Prophet will be correct in his prophecy that Lanie will in fact die in a week. In other words the movie does manage to keep you on the hook right up to the very end. The ending was a bit lame but still had a good message if you care to adjust yourself to it.Jolie's character Lanie is interesting because if you watch the movie more than once you will most likely start to be intrigued by her appearance the platinum blonde hair the puffy lips the expressive eyes the makeup.... you might start to think she resembles Marilyn Monroe or you may just write her off as a woman who actually looks a bit like an attractive transvestite!. But no matter because whether you like Angelina Jolie or not you can't help but be a bit intrigued by the appearance of her character which is kind of out there for Jolie. One potential problem though is that she is possibly TOO out there to the point where she may distract the viewer from seeing the message of the movieTony Shaloub's character Jack the Prophet is very well portrayed by Mr. Shaloub. He's lovably wacko and plus he has some pretty funny lines in spite of his plight in life. I like the Ed Burns character Pete because he reflects reality whereas Jolie's character is kind of too unreal but still fun to watch.I liked the setting of the movie Seattle since I live in Seattle. For those of us who live in the rainy city it's fun to see an interesting movie that takes place in our environs. They also used actual news people from a local Seattle TV station so it was kind of fun to see people whom I've been seeing on the local nightly news actually appear in a Hollywood movie. They changed their real names though which was kind of weird.There were a few things I didn't like about the movie the main one being that Lanie who works as a modernday TV reporter comes across to me as just way too much of a sexpot I mean just way outside the realm of reality. It gets to be jarring after awhile to see such a sexy creature being passed off as a news reporter when we all KNOW that no modern local news station would put such a pouty platinumhaired blonde on the air ....or WOULD they??? as Conan O'Brien would say. But mainly I liked the movie and it was actually worth a repeat viewing as it kind of grows on you and ultimately makes you THINK about your own life your own values your personal destiny etc. BTW there's a pretty good batch of songs that accompanied the movie too though I don't believe there is an actual soundtrack available so you will probably have to hunt down each song individually.All in all an interesting movie with a message worth pondering  if you can get past the steady distraction of the appearance of Angelina Jolie of course.Well that's my review. You guys have been a great audience thanks for listening!".

	schema:headline " A comedy...or something like it";
	schema:reviewBody "If it weren't for Angelina Jolie I would've fell asleep through the whole damn movie.  Jolie delivers another spirited performance and she is an extremely beautiful woman with a smile to die for.  But the movie is just dull dull dull.  First of all if the director wanted to make this a straight drama that's fine.  Just don't market it as a COMEDY!  If sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy then you're in for a treat.  The director is Stephen Herek who also directed the dull forgettable Eddie Murphy vehicle Holy Man.  Like that movie Life... is horribly uneven taking a serious turn way too early in the film and never recovering.  Despite extremely poor attempts I'm pretty sure Herek intended this to be a comedy.  Herek just has no sense of timing! And may I add there are certain scenes in the previews that weren't used in the final cutWhy the hell do directors tease us like that?!!!!!!  For example there's supposed to be one scene where Jolie is on the set of a TV show and a light from the ceiling falls down inches away from killing her. But there are no scenes where her life seems threatened.  Instead the movie gets preachy and sentimental about the subject of carpe diem and developing the alltoopredictable love affair between Jolie and Edward Burns.  Like always they start out hating each other's guts and about 20 minutes through the flick they're practically soulmates.  The character arcs are so quick and stilted.    I like Edward Burns but he should definitely stick to independent film.  I don't usually say this about directors but he should stick to starring in his own movies.  His writing is obviously much more creative than that of Hollywood screenwriters who get paid 10 times as much as him.  OK he was fairly good in 15 Minutes and quite good in Saving Private Ryan but he should try to steer clear of Hollywood.Every scene is so dull and downbeat.  Herek tries to redeem himself with pretentious fastmotion shots identical to those of Madonna's Ray of Light video.  If Jolie weren't the star this film would be dead in the water.  And Tony Shalhoub deserves better as well.  I'm not surprised to see him in a corny flick but he is an underrated comic actor and I loved him on Wings.  Jolie decided she would take a break from movies after done with Tomb Raider.  Why oh why did she change her mind and star in this ultimately forgettable pseduo romantic comedy?  She should've saved the blonde hair for a much better movie.  My score  4 out of 10".

She should've saved the blonde hair for a much better movie.  My score  4 out of 10";

If it fails to do that perhaps a character that the audience would care about is in order. Life Or Something Like It fails to do both.Lanie Kerrigan Angelina Jolie is a local Seattle news reporter who is being considered for posh job in New York for AM USA. She must first prove herself in the field by working with Pete an experienced cameraman Edward Burns whom she supposedly hates. When the ambitious reporter interviews a homeless prophet he announces that the blonde reporter will die within a week.

As Thursday Dday quickly approaches the reporter reevaluates her own life.The premise of the film is a little interesting at first. Sure it has been done over and over again but various interpretations have their own charm and there is room for more. However the development of the plot is just too obvious and there is nothing new nor is anything portrayed in a very intriguing way.While Life was marketed as a light comedy it is anything but. Comedy would have been a much better direction for the filmmakers however aside from a few jokes on the sidelines the film takes itself very seriously. The tone of the script is confused. It's similar to A Knight's Tale which also tried to hopelessly shift between drama and comic relief. In the end we end up with a picture that doesn't work as a drama or a comedy. Throughout the film it feels as though the filmmakers kept changing their minds.Unfortunately the confusion is not the only selfdestructive component in the movie. The character development also does the job fairly well. Jolie shows Lanie's ambition sufficiently but the movie suggests that there is more wrong with her life than a little healthy competition. It seems ridiculous that a person whose real tough faults we haven't seen is trying to change her ways. The movie seems to artificially pull Lanie into changing instead of using character development as cause for such an evolution. Lanie changes at the end but the question why? remains. Pete's relationship with Lanie also seems forced. Pete flashes randomly throughout the movie cueing Lanie's unfolding.Edward Burns carries his role well enough but unfortunately there isn't much to carry. Angelina Jolie just doesn't seem to fit into this role and while she is a talented actress there is something very odd about her in Life. In fact Tony Shalhoub is the only actor who remotely stands out in this movie. Although his dialogue follows the same scripted fate as the others Shalhoub manages to express with his voice and facial expression much more than the script actually inhibits.The script doesn't allow the audience to care much for any of the characters doesn't contain a single original idea and tends to push ideas aggressively instead of allowing the audience to discover them. The script also leaves off various unresolved mysteries most of which only seem to act as space fillers. The filmmakers take us towards one direction and back off immediately afterwards. Maybe they forgot? Considering the pacing most of the audience did too.Life Or Something Like It is comparable to one scene where Lanie's soon to be exboyfriend Cal takes Lanie to a ballpark in the middle of the night to throw a few pitches after a hearttoheart talk. Lanie expects Cal to have some words of wisdom for her or at least charm  but doesn't catch anything except the ball. Life Or Something Like It won't change your life and it won't change your mood either.If you need to kill time see the movie  But what if today is the last day of your life?Grade D".

	schema:headline " Just Okay To Me Not As Original As Expected or As It Should Have Been";
	schema:reviewBody "Life or Something Like It is a romantic comedy that wants to be a drama about reevaluating one's life circumstances. It was a movie with a lot of very good actors in it particularly Angelina Jolie Ed Burns and Tony Shaloub. However in the end it wasn't as original as it could have been and its message is far from unique. If I had a nickel for every time a movie used the hackneyed phrase Live life to its fullest I would probably never have to shell out my last ten dollars to see a movie at the movie theater again. For those reasons the movie was really just okay to me not great.Angelina Jolie stars as Lanie Kerrigan a young ambitious TV reporter who is already wellrecognized and credible in her local Seattle network affiliate. Her ambition is to be a reporter on the Today Showlike network morning news show AM USA. When she gets the opportunity to audition for the show a street psychic the great Tony Shaloub prophesizes her death effective seven days from the day she asked.Admittedly it is nice to see Jolie in a role that doesn't involve her being a toughasnails action hero or a sex kitten. Also she had some good parts in this movie that were a bit heartfelt such as when she reflects on her rebellious childhood or reconnects with her bluecollar father. However as good an actress as Jolie truly is my guess is that she must not have done much research for her role. Why? Because she is completely unconvincing as a TV reporter. When asking questions particularly in her last interview she practically whispered her questions which is something TV reporters at least good ones should not and do not do. Jolie probably should have studied Katie Couric or Meredith Viera and she wouldn't even have to leave her trailer to do it either.Her romance with Ed Burns' character was also really hokey not to mention predictable. He's a good looking guy and they fight constantly in the beginning of the movie. Such a setup is so overdone even dating as far back as Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and so unoriginal that I was not surprised at all when their romantic scene came up. It surprised me too because Burns is not only one of the more likable lead actors in the history of romantic comedies but he has also starred in written and directed some of the most original romantic comedies ever The Brothers McMullan She's The One. Burns is still likable in his role but this romantic subplot is so clich that it really ruins the film.The plot involving Jolie trying to deny or avoid death was also completely unbelievable particularly towards the end. First without ruining anything Jolie's character realization of her fate in the very end seemed a bit contrived given her circumstances. Second I didn't really get involved with her character enough to care if she died in the end. I guess the character wasn't developed enough or the plot was too flimsy and archaic. I can't decide which.This movie was certainly not terrible and it had its moments. For the most part though there were too many scenes in this movie that went beyond the laws of common sense that it was just too unbelievable. Other scenes if not unbelievable were just too predictable. If the movie had decided to just be a movie about a successful woman's premidlife crisis based on false prophecy and not a romantic comedy in Deep Thoughts clothing it probably would have gone on to more accolades. Instead it's just marginally good. I can't give it a stronger recommendation than that.".

	onyx:emotionText "Life or Something Like It is a romantic comedy that wants to be a drama about reevaluating one's life circumstances. It was a movie with a lot of very good actors in it particularly Angelina Jolie Ed Burns and Tony Shaloub. However in the end it wasn't as original as it could have been and its message is far from unique. If I had a nickel for every time a movie used the hackneyed phrase Live life to its fullest I would probably never have to shell out my last ten dollars to see a movie at the movie theater again. For those reasons the movie was really just okay to me not great.Angelina Jolie stars as Lanie Kerrigan a young ambitious TV reporter who is already wellrecognized and credible in her local Seattle network affiliate. Her ambition is to be a reporter on the Today Showlike network morning news show AM USA. When she gets the opportunity to audition for the show a street psychic the great Tony Shaloub prophesizes her death effective seven days from the day she asked.Admittedly it is nice to see Jolie in a role that doesn't involve her being a toughasnails action hero or a sex kitten. Also she had some good parts in this movie that were a bit heartfelt such as when she reflects on her rebellious childhood or reconnects with her bluecollar father. However as good an actress as Jolie truly is my guess is that she must not have done much research for her role. Why? Because she is completely unconvincing as a TV reporter. When asking questions particularly in her last interview she practically whispered her questions which is something TV reporters at least good ones should not and do not do. Jolie probably should have studied Katie Couric or Meredith Viera and she wouldn't even have to leave her trailer to do it either.Her romance with Ed Burns' character was also really hokey not to mention predictable. He's a good looking guy and they fight constantly in the beginning of the movie. Such a setup is so overdone even dating as far back as Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and so unoriginal that I was not surprised at all when their romantic scene came up. It surprised me too because Burns is not only one of the more likable lead actors in the history of romantic comedies but he has also starred in written and directed some of the most original romantic comedies ever The Brothers McMullan She's The One. Burns is still likable in his role but this romantic subplot is so clich that it really ruins the film.The plot involving Jolie trying to deny or avoid death was also completely unbelievable particularly towards the end. First without ruining anything Jolie's character realization of her fate in the very end seemed a bit contrived given her circumstances. Second I didn't really get involved with her character enough to care if she died in the end. I guess the character wasn't developed enough or the plot was too flimsy and archaic.

Well she actually did a pretty good job in this movie although I won't even comment on the blonde hair. Let's just say that brown is her look that's all. As for the movie the story is great. The story is amazing a skeptical journalist anchor woman gets a warning of some sort a prophecy from a random homeless guy and then tries to prove him wrong for the whole week that's left for her to live. Those who plan to or already have made their careers the only thing they know will relate to this movie like no one else. I actually admire Lanie for both of the lives she lead the career woman and then a family gal with a career that let's face it much smaller than the one she would've gotten in New York but still amazing. It pretty much took her a death to live through to throw out the highest peak of a journalist possible that she was offered in NY. And then again it's impossible to live such a life without any regrets for all the things lost because of that career and so she chose happiness over a dream. Kinda shows an example of when you really really want something and then when you get it  it's not as sweet anymore. You realize that wasn't the thing that would make you happy at all. Ahh that's why I absolutely love this movie and will continue on making my career my life until something better comes along and then to fully appreciate it I'll throw everything I ever dreamed of becoming away...and live every day as if it were my last one. Gosh if we only got to know the future. If only our plans turned out to become true without any heavy sacrifices.".

I suppose inconsistency could be expected from the writer of Joe Somebody John Scott Shepherd though. The viewer is supposed to suspend disbelief on this one and not take it too seriously. The message is the main point but live life to the fullest isn't necessarily something that needs repeating.This one would serve as a good rental or a mindless and safe date movie.

	schema:reviewBody "It's the 20th Bond film and premiered on the 40th anniversary of the series and in many ways it is really a tribute to the entire series itself. This film's strength and its weakness both lie in the fact that it is a blend of the classic Connery films the outlandish Moore films and the grittiness of the Dalton films. It's rolling the entire series into a single two hour adventure and the result is actually pretty entertaining. The first half is definitely stronger than the second a more serious adventure with a classic feel to it before taking a nose dive down into utter camp territory. I didn't mind the idea of making some scenes a little overthetop but I think they went overboard at times. Throughout the movie the filmmakers toss in little references to previous Bond films. I suppose it's a fun idea to stop and consider how far these films have come over the last 40something years and a long time Bond fan can find amusement in finding these subtle but long remembered treasures that poke their head in this film for one last time. As for the technical aspects of the film The special effects are a little too ambitious and don't always come across convincing. The dialogue goes back and forth from excellent to atrocious. The ensemble of actors is pretty strong except for Halle Berry who in my opinion was completely wrong for a Bond movie. The villains are a little more dynamic. The action sequences are an improvement in my mind. Granted there are some instances where the filmmakers push the envelope a little too far as mentioned above. However they also show a certain amount of creativity that seemed to be lacking in the previous two films. Overall this film is really a mixed bag. At moments there is potential for one of the greatest Bond adventures. At other moments you're thinking What the heck am I watching. Personally I feel the positives balance out the negatives but if anything this film is a good popcorn movie. All in all it wasn't a bad way to close out the series before rebooting it again with Casino Royale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Creating new exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best particularly as public tastes change and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the 'persona' created by Ian Fleming. While the heirs of Albert Broccoli his daughter Barbara and soninlaw Michael G. Wilson have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh' if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond and his world.After an astonishing pretitle sequence climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans the film offers a horrendous montage of torture with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange with an unsympathetic M remarking If it had been up to me you'd have stayed in North Korea... obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Pierce Brosnan at fifty is superb in this sequence vulnerable yet defiant and to this point DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a firstclass Bond entry.Then Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds solar power and a 'toogoodtobetrue' industrialist smarmy Toby Stephens and all of the creativity of the opening is lost with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly unbelievable situations sets and gadgets culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin.As she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY sexy Halle Berry 36 was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction borrowed from Ursula Andress in DR. NO and a few nicely choreographed fights she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand Rosamund Pike 23 was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost as chilly as her name but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. The most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune as Graves' 'enforcer' Zao. Charismatic ruthless and nearly unstoppable Zao was nearly a primal force far more menacing than Graves at his worst.While a swordfight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight and certainly ranks as one of the film series' more memorable sequences much of the rest of the production was silly with the story set at a breakneck pace to 'hide' the absurdities. The climax as a solar 'ray' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea allowing an 'invasion' to occur as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the 'ray' stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.Although DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan's highestgrossing Bond to date the film despite heavily promoting Halle Berry's presence failed to crack the 'Top Ten' box office attractions in the U.S. and disappointed many fans worldwide.With the purchase of MGM by Sony which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED a sad finish for an actor who'd worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium! While Broccoli and Wilson are still 'in charge' of Bond productions they have to answer to new bosses with definite opinions of their own on where the franchise should go...Can 007 survive THIS? We can only wait and see!".

The climax as a solar 'ray' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea allowing an 'invasion' to occur as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the 'ray' stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.Although DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan's highestgrossing Bond to date the film despite heavily promoting Halle Berry's presence failed to crack the 'Top Ten' box office attractions in the U.S. and disappointed many fans worldwide.With the purchase of MGM by Sony which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED a sad finish for an actor who'd worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium! While Broccoli and Wilson are still 'in charge' of Bond productions they have to answer to new bosses with definite opinions of their own on where the franchise should go...Can 007 survive THIS? We can only wait and see!";

	schema:reviewBody "On a mission in Korea James Bond is captured and tortured for 18 months. He is swapped with Korean agent Zao for his freedom.  However M has swapped him not to save him but because she believes Bond has cracked and is giving away information.  However Bond knows there is another mole in the area and escapes to uncover what Zao is up to and to uncover his Western ally.I looked forward to this film because I like Bond and easily get caught up in the hype. I think it is just down to the success of the formula and the fact that it feels comfortable to know you're getting a slightly different version of reliable product. For me familiarity has yet to breed contempt in this series. I wanted to like this film more although I did enjoy the vast majority of it. It's biggest problem is simply that it tries too hard and wants to do too much. The plot is OK and is a brave start showing our hero broken and in prison but from there it does try and do way too much. It was good to relate the precredits scene to the rest of the film but the film seems restless unless it is having a major bit of plot happening  too many little twists or new bits of plot that stopped the film flowing. The plot is OK at heart but the little additions of diamonds ice palace weapons in space DNA alteration electrical suits all gets a bit much.The film's direction is also a bit frantic. A little bit of Matrix creeping in and sudden rushing cameras etc. It isn't needed indeed they make the cake feel over egged like the director didn't trust himself enough to a good job and needed gimmicks etc. On top of this there are three or so cgi shots that are really poor and I mean Mummy Returns poor. It doesn't help that the theme song is one of the worst ever but I could get past that as the action under the credits helped distract from it. The action is all good on the whole but there didn't seem enough room for them and all that plot  also everything was overdone. We don't need matrix type effects in Bond  all we need is a certain amount of flair and well designed shots etc. I sound negative but I still enjoyed this despite the weaknesses cause at the end of the day the formula still works even with the monkeying around.One of the main reasons is Brosnan himself. he is getting better every film. He does some bad puns but never to the mocking extent of Moore and he also does the dangerous element of Connery. Even when the film starts to get silly he remains strong in the lead. Berry is wasted and is a distraction more than a good addition. From the cringe worthy first scene with Bond trading smutty one liners onwards she has no character worth speaking of. Her dialogue is innuendo and not lines her acting is all in the twitch of her lips as she flirts and that's it. To look at she does the job but i thought we'd gotten past Bond girls that are eyecandy and nothing more. Pike is given a more frosty role and does pretty well despite being very cold when viewed beside the flirtatious Berry. Stephens hams it up as Graves. He starts well but the plot spin on his character esp. the electric suit stuff takes away from his credibility as a bad guy and he ends up as a cartoon type rather than a real threat. Yune on the other hand is a real good villain  a gimmick his face but also presence and real menace without hamming it up. I had hoped he would be the focus but alas no. Dench is good and Madsen is an interesting addition  but perhaps he wasn't the best choice for the head of NSA given the type of roles he is best known for  how many other people could only see Mr Blonde? Cleese does well as the new Q and brings his comedy into the role well making it similar to the spirit of Q without being a copy. Madonna's cameo is as bad and as pointless as her theme song.Overall let me stress I enjoyed this film but couldn't help but see the many flaws. It simply tries too hard in almost every area  plot writing action direction. The formula is all there but it feels like they want to up the ante in every way only at the basic level does the film feel comfortable in it's own skin and relaxes for most of the time you'd think this was a new film desperately trying to start a franchise as opposed to a long running series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Look let's be clear about it...it's the year 2002 not 1962.  This franchise of movies has evolved over the years from a cool and clever spy series to an overthetop slam bang action series.  When you go to see a James Bond film you should EXPECT any or all of the following 1  A completely unrealistic contrived plot 2  Unbelievably cheesy and corny oneliners almost all of which are sexual in nature 3  A supervillain seemingly brilliant and mad enough to quest for world domination but is somehow stupid enough to let Bond get close enough to spoil the whole thing 4  A female counterpart or several that looks good gets captured and ultimately gets saved by our hero 5  Gadgets cars and weapons that do fantastic unbelievable things 6  Action sequences and stunts that defy fundamental laws of physics and logicHaving said all of that and knowing what I knew I was so excited to see this movie and I loved it.  Why?  Because I got to escape for a couple of hours in a fantasyspy world.  Because I've seen the other 19 movies and I got to see what other directions they went with the characters.  Because I love the characters and have gotten to know them over the course of the last 19 movies.  Of course it has its shortcomings the CG was weak in parts but it has everything that makes the franchise successful.  It pays homage to the older films while pleasing younger fans with it's incredible action sequences.Like it or not this is what the series has evolved to.  Personally I like it but having seen Dr. No From Russia With Love etc I know that the newer movies don't really appeal to many of the fans of those movies my dad hates the new movies because they have completely moved away from reality not to mention the novels.  So understand that before you go and see this movie.  If you can just sit back and enjoy the ride you will.  But if you're looking for the magic of 1962 to return than you might be disappointed.  But I will bet on this...judging by the reaction of the theater I was at James Bond isn't going away anytime soon.Oh by the way what's with the comment Look out Bond xXx is taking over. Huh?  When xXx has 20 successful movies under his belt then we can start comparing the two.".

In other words my only knowledge of its reputation is down to the comments I have read on these pages and because many commentators are so loud in their condemnation  Bad CGI  awful title track etc  I was expecting a really bad movie never mind a really bad Bond movie  but DIE ANOTHER DAY wasn't as bad as I was expecting It's interesting to note that the Bond series never really concerned itself with painting communists as bad guys . OCTOPUSSY ties in with the cold war very much as does THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to a lesser degree but in no way can the series be criticised as being right wing or reactionary with GOLDENEYE wearing its heart on it's sleeve that Russian gangsterism is more of a worry than Russian communism so it's something of a shock seeing Bond battle Stalinist commies in North Korea . That is in no way a criticism either .We're then treated to a bizarre title sequence composed of a torture montage with quite simply the worst theme tune ever devised for a Bond movie . I don't know what is about the Pierce Brosnan Bonds but they all have very poor title songs despite having all round superb production values and DIE ANOTHER DAY continues the high production values  a lot of people complain about the CGI and I must admit the cartoonish jet at the end does look like a cartoon but compare this sequence to all the action scenes in the 1980s which were composed of Roger Moore standing in front of some back projection and no matter how much you don't want to say it you must confess we've come a long way since then Some people have also let rip that the film is ruined by post modernist self reference but I disagree . Come on chaps when you've seen one Bond movie since the late 1960s you've seen most of them . Plot wise DIE ANOTHER DAY is very  very similar to GOLDENEYE with a  British  villain in charge of a death ray in outer space with a fair amount of LICENSED TO KILL thrown in . It should be remembered both YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME had the same identical plot with serious hardware being stolen from the USSR and America in order to start a nuclear holocaust . There is a ridiculous amount of humour though involving John Cleese as Q . I know you shouldn't take James Bond movies seriously but did we need an invisible car ?The other thing I disliked was Jinx . Think about it  she's tough and kills without hesitation so how come she needs rescuing from Bond ? She's just a cypher there to create a love interest and it's amazing that the producers seriously considered starting a spin off series with Jinx as the heroine . It would have been as successful as CATWOMEN . There is a problem with a plot twist involving both Gustav Graves and Miranda Frost  the twist is good but unfortunately the surprise only works once which means on second viewing the shock value of the plot revelation is gone therefore DIE ANOTHER DAY doesn't have the same enjoyment second  third or fourth viewing unlike classic Bond movies I'm not a big Bond fan but have been fairly impressed with the standards of the franchise from GOLDENEYE to DIE ANOTHER DAY  they've really come leaps and bounds from the Roger Moore debacles like MOONRAKER and VIEW TO A KILL . One aspect that is over looked in the series is the character interaction between Bond and M  Convincingly played by Judi Dench  and I hope to see this abrasive relationship continue when the series returns with a new actor in the lead role".

You know there's ridiculousness that's enjoyable like in GoldenEye then there's Die Another Day a movie so caught up in its complete silliness it forgets to realize it thinking its overzealous use of gadgetry its hilariously bad Robovillain cut me some slack I couldn't think of a better nickname and Halle Berry. Miss Berry is easily among the very worst Bond girls and the fact that she's alongside Rosamund Pike who manages to do such a good job with what little she's given doesn't really help at all.In Die Another Day there's not a second of humor that works. All the oneliners will have you cringing albeit less than any attempt at actual serious dialogue this pathetic mess makes as the script is completely ludicrous from start to finish which is a continuation of the 'good writers writing terribly' theme in Bond history where genuinely good writers write horrible messes like this mainly because it seems they're lazy. I do find it humorous that the biggest fans of Casino Royale who claim it is by far the best Bond film conveniently ignore the fact that it was written by the same writing crew with the addition of scriptpolisher Paul Haggis which gave us the last three installments of the Bond franchise. Writers do what they're asked to do and my guess is that Die Another Day is as much the producers' fault as the writers'.Lee Tamahori is a completely bizarre choice for director and a terrible one at that seeing how he has never made an especially good film. David Arnold's score is again very good but he can't save the film and though I really like Brosnan's Bond the direction the series was going in at this point was truly dangerous and could've resulted in the end for Bond if allowed to go on. There was no reason to stop Die Another Day was a massive financial success the highest grossing of Brosnan's films and actually about as wellreviewed by major critics as the last two films in the series but audience feedback and hopefully common sense led to the reinvigoration of the franchise in Casino Royale.

	schema:reviewBody "Pierce Brosnan's last outing as James Bond takes place in Die Another Day which finds 007 trying to stop a rogue North Korean general from starting the Korean War all over again with the attending consequences. The North Koreans must have been watching Plan 9 From Outer Space because the gimmick they've come up with sounds remarkably like what those aliens were warning the Earth against developing.The power of the sun itself is brought into play here. There's a giant mirror in space which seeks to focus and concentrate the sun's energy for peaceful power purposes. But it sure can be an effective weapon of war as we see towards the film's end as Brosnan and his American counterpart agent Halle Berry.Part of the charm of the James Bond series is that you don't take it too seriously but there are times that it becomes more like Indiana Jones and his narrow escapes than a modern espionage story. Die Another Day takes this point to the extreme.The year before Halle Berry won her Oscar for Monster's Ball and Die Another Day was her next film. Of course she's forever in the record books as the first black woman to win a Best Actress Oscar. But that's for history. I wonder if film fans remember her better as a Bond girl.There's another Bond girl as well another MI6 agent played by Rosamund Pike. She's one deadly female and most resourceful. Toby Stephens son of Maggie Smith plays a wealthy industrialist with a mysterious past and a cunning adversary for Pierce Brosnan.One thing I really liked towards the end was Ms. Moneypenny fulfilling her fantasy with James Bond. She's engaged in an early version of the Star Trek holograph deck. The poor woman has been carrying a torch for 007 for almost 50 years now you'd think one of the Bonds would have given her a tumble already. Poor lovelorn Lois Maxwell now Samantha Bond ain't that ironic casting.Die Another Day is not as good as some of the other Brosnan entries in the Bond series but should satisfy the cult of fans out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "An outing which represents a first for the Bond franchise i.e. one that fails abjectly in virtually every discernible area. The most prominent one being that of a cut'n'paste dog's dinner of a screenplay that looks as though it was cobbled together by the screenwriters during their dinner break. Previous entries such as 'OHMSS' and 'From Russia With Love' managed to treat their audiences with more than a modicum of intelligence. This is in stark contrast to D.A.D. which seemed to be aiming for an audience predominately populated by XXXloving popcornmunching baseball capped cretins who will demand the right to see as many things blown up as possible with at least as many people being either shot or wasted whilst being assured that such minor trivialities as 'plot' or 'characterization' are not allowed to spoil their enjoyment of proceedings.The standard of acting varies from merely perfunctory to downright dreadful. Brosnan simply goes through the motions whilst Halle Berry tries desperately hard to pass what turned out to be an audition for her own character's franchise but ends up being the most irritating leading lady since Tanya Roberts. In her Ursula Andress homage on second thoughts make that 'ripoff' you can almost sense Tamahori saying 'That's right Halle swivel your hips. A bit more. A bit more. Keep going and cut !!!' Any chemistry with 007 is all but nonexistent with their 'banter' being invariably puerile and tedious.We have a nemesis who is totally lacking in anything remotely resembling charisma threat or menace. Indeed Gustav Graves' only real 'gimmick' appears to be a total lack of need for sleep  watching this drivel would soon change that . The obligatory henchman Zao had mild potential but was underused.Much has been said about the risible CGI sequence involving the ice wave  and deservedly so  but for me the sequence which preceded it was even more ludicrous. Our hero is doing about 300mph in a rocket car and heading for a plunge to his certain death. Don't fret however as a trailing anchor digs a few inches into the ice and over the space of a few yards brings the car to a complete halt causing it to flip over the edge and smash into the side of the precipice without so much as a scratch on the vehicle and 007 left not the least bit shaken nor stirred. It was a scene which was more akin to 'The Wacky Races' with Dastardly  Muttley once again receiving their comeuppance.On the subject of growlers the living legend in her own mind that is Madonna ensured that the title 'song' would by several light years be the worst ever. However Madge's monstrous ego ensured that her contribution to proceedings wouldn't end there and so the unsuspecting viewing audience would then be treated to an equally awful cameo. Did Shirley Bassey Tom Jones or Carly Simon receive cameos ? Of course not. Many would correctly say that none of them can act. However based on the evidence of D.A.D. and a clutch of other bigscreen stinkers neither can Madonna.Pierce Brosnan's outrageous salary demand  24 million  for the next epic appeared to give the producers little option but to announce that it was 'taxi for Brosnan'. Granted this sage and onionstuffed extravaganza managed to trouser over 400 mill at the box office so many might say that it's only fair that he's entitled to be angling for a bigger slice of the pie. Nevertheless it sure as hell wouldn't have just been Brosnan's name that sold tickets for a film which I'm sure would still have made a mint even if Graham Norton had been donning the tuxedo. OK perhaps a slight exaggeration but clearly no individual is bigger than the licenced to kill  and make money  Bond franchise.Allinall a charmless hideous mess that tries like 'Octopussy' to cram too much in. The introduction of Daniel Craig and hopefully a decent script can perhaps inject the series with fresh impetus to help prevent the 007 moneymaking juggernaut from going the same way as the one from 'Duel'.".

For almost half a century from the old generations to the youth it is always advised that the 007Bond movies are the best action  thriller of all. Yet to watch Die Another Day there are so many other reasons! Relying on the protection of its confidence and splendour Die Another Day sight sees some of the largerthanlife and glamorous centres of the earth. In You Only Live Twice and The Man with the Golden Gun Bond has visited HongKong several times and he does once more in Die Another Day. We are going to see Cuba for the second time after Golden Eye and again for the second time we will be in Bond's topsecret MI6 office in LondonU.K after On Her Majesty's Secret Service. We also have a chance to see unforgettably spectacular views from Hawaii's virgin hills and from Iceland. In fact wherever it says it's North Korea it's location is still Hawaii. Some of the North Korean scenes like the elaborate hovercraft chase scene were shot in U.K. as well.It is joyful to catch homage moments in respect to the previous Bond movies like the conspiracy plot at the presidential suite in the Hong Kong hotel with the Chinese masseuse beauty and Halle Berry's first appearance moment where she wore an orange bikini with a white belt attached to an army knife. Best of all the most alluring of all were the gadgets and equipments used throughout the movie  Hovercrafts Electromagnetic ring  Bounding mines Laser cutting watch  Giant Space Laser Mirror named Icarusa satellite weapon that directs a blazing ray of heat at its landed or aerial global targets  Switchblade Jet Gliders The Invisible Aston Martin If you liked the movie you'd better see the Special Edition D.V.D that includes very very precious and confidential technical details DataStream's trivia track with video streaming storyboard comparisons from scratch to the shotthe advisory details on how to choose the best suitable FPS adjusted camera giving samples of multiangle camera explorations the visual effects featurette transcribes the oddsand ends differences between makeups and models and noncomputer based visual effects and CGI based virtual effects and finally Madonna's original uncut edition of 007Nightfire music video that has been banned in some countries of Europe at its time of screening. It is as good as an HDDVD of today's.Die Another Day is Brosnan's fourth Bond movie. Director Tamahori who has gained recognition in his film Once Were Warriors is an awardwinning commercial director and in my opinion he has been influenced by Paul Verhoeven a lot. Die Another has some snoops from Verhoeven mostly Robocop and Total Recall.The title has taken from an A.E.Housman poem. In Housman's poem it is the coward who runs away from battle so that he may die another day. Die Another Day is a perfect choice for a wonderful evening with family and friendsneighboursrelativescolleagues and with all types of crowds.Film 710 DVD 1010one of my favourite DVDs of alltime".

We also have a chance to see unforgettably spectacular views from Hawaii's virgin hills and from Iceland. In fact wherever it says it's North Korea it's location is still Hawaii. Some of the North Korean scenes like the elaborate hovercraft chase scene were shot in U.K. as well.It is joyful to catch homage moments in respect to the previous Bond movies like the conspiracy plot at the presidential suite in the Hong Kong hotel with the Chinese masseuse beauty and Halle Berry's first appearance moment where she wore an orange bikini with a white belt attached to an army knife. Best of all the most alluring of all were the gadgets and equipments used throughout the movie  Hovercrafts Electromagnetic ring  Bounding mines Laser cutting watch  Giant Space Laser Mirror named Icarusa satellite weapon that directs a blazing ray of heat at its landed or aerial global targets  Switchblade Jet Gliders The Invisible Aston Martin If you liked the movie you'd better see the Special Edition D.V.D that includes very very precious and confidential technical details DataStream's trivia track with video streaming storyboard comparisons from scratch to the shotthe advisory details on how to choose the best suitable FPS adjusted camera giving samples of multiangle camera explorations the visual effects featurette transcribes the oddsand ends differences between makeups and models and noncomputer based visual effects and CGI based virtual effects and finally Madonna's original uncut edition of 007Nightfire music video that has been banned in some countries of Europe at its time of screening. It is as good as an HDDVD of today's.Die Another Day is Brosnan's fourth Bond movie. Director Tamahori who has gained recognition in his film Once Were Warriors is an awardwinning commercial director and in my opinion he has been influenced by Paul Verhoeven a lot. Die Another has some snoops from Verhoeven mostly Robocop and Total Recall.The title has taken from an A.E.Housman poem. In Housman's poem it is the coward who runs away from battle so that he may die another day. Die Another Day is a perfect choice for a wonderful evening with family and friendsneighboursrelativescolleagues and with all types of crowds.Film 710 DVD 1010one of my favourite DVDs of alltime";

	schema:reviewBody "For those who haven't seen it yet SPOILERS follow.For me and for many others James Bond is a unique character who was established for decades by Sean Connery and Roger Moore. The producers quickly learned with the first few movies starring Sean Connery that the hard core Bond of the Flemming novels needed some adaptation to survive and they did a superlative job of doing so for quite some time.As such there is or I should say WAS a certain surrealistic magic about the James Bond character which allowed us movie goers to transcend reality and truly escape the headlines we all read daily regarding the heroes who die too young. During this period if you wanted all out action and violence in a movie you went to a Schwartznegger Stalone etc flick.Certain rules which have applied to James Bond for a long time have been stripped away by most of the so called Bond films since Roger Moore's era and were ably and completely done away with in this film such as1 Bond NEVER gets caught. Well OK. He can get caught by the bad guy threatened bragged at by the Bad guy then escape in just the nick of time and foil his plan. Truth be known he could have escaped whenever he wanted to but allowed himself to be held for a day or two just to learn more from the inside.2 Bond NEVER gets tortured endlessly. Maybe roughed up but not tortured for over a year. His quick wit and matchless skills simply won't allow it.3 Bond is NEVER in a situation from which his unmatched genius talent and cool can't save him.4 Bond NEVER gets abandoned by his country or told by his superior that if it were up to her he would still be rotting in prison. He might get a disapproving sneer from a stuffed shirt government rep but deep down he's appreciated and respected for his talents and bravery.Yet in Die Another Day we are presented with a James Bond who gets captured for 14 months ruthlessly tortured by near drowning and scorpion stings with anti venom used to bring him back from the brink of death time and time again. There was no doubt that he was captured was to remain so was completely at his captors mercy and there was no way he could figure a way to escape.At the end of the 14 months when Bond thought he was going to be executed he started walking that last mile out of the prison camp clearly in a hopeless situation in which he was going to be unceremoniously shot in the back with no way out. You could even see the look of broken despair and hopelessness on Brosnan's face as he walked bravely forward. One is reminded of Roger Moore in Live and Let Die when he is being quite literally walked out to a back alley by multiple thugs spots an opportunity and takes out the gun men handily. A good job of acting out the role of helplessness exhaustion and nearly mental collapse by Brosnan but simply not a fit for James Bond.Last but not least when he realizes he is being traded and gets met by the good guys he is injected with a sedative and wakes up in a high tech prison of sorts where M tells him that if it were up to her he would still be rotting in prison that his freedom was bought at too high a price that they suspect he was broken and gave away priceless secrets and that he was to remain in their custody until she deemed it fit to release him.I could go on but the movie does so unfortunately illustrating my point so why bother?In the real world an agent with a license to kill and put on assignments like James Bond would probably not last very long. There are undoubtedly such heroes giving their lives daily in the protection of freedom and human rights which we will never hear about as well as others who we do hear about. But the true Bond character is not real world. Rather he stands unique. He allows us to escaped the carnage of real life and believe for a few fleeting moments that the good guy really can survive AND save the day and do it with suave and cool. What a shame they have ruined the franchise that was so ably established for decades.Perhaps M's words to Bond summarized things best Bond is not England's celebrated priceless treasure anymore not the man who stands head and shoulders above the rest. He does not walk coolly and calmly down the path to certain death only to cheat death yet again simply because he is well BOND JAMES BOND! In fact at this point he can be captured without displaying the wits necessary to escape tortured endlessly and taken out to the back ally and shot in just the same manner as with any other John Doe in the real world. In fact he is not even to be trusted and has been locked away indefinitely.For my part I've given the industry moguls many years to clean up the mess they've made of this franchise and they will not get another dime of mine to see this not even poor excuse for James Bond they have been portraying recently in any future movies.".

He fails in his mission objectives he gets captured he doesn't escape and he remains clueless as to the identity of his adversaries. Sure he can surf and handle a sword but he's a lousy spy.Most Bond movies have relatively weak plots but this one seems totally rambling and inconsequential. What exactly were the scorpions meant to symbolize? Do we care? And why Iceland? Apparently just because it was cool since it had no intrinsic meaning to the villain. Then again this villain is one of the least fleshed out I've ever seen in a Bond movie.In some ways this was almost a retrospective of Bond movies as the director tried to lift a scene from all the previous ones. I was slightly reminded of the homage scenes in On Her Majesty's Secret Service but at least there the retrospectives had a narrative point. Here it just feels heavyhanded.Nobody is going to get any awards for acting in this movie. Halle Barry is miscast as Jinx and serves more as a distraction than a partner. The villain seemed like a pale imitation of John Malkovich's character in Johnny English. Judi Dench can play M in her sleep and it looks as if she's doing so this time. The obligatory Q scene felt forced. And I'm still trying to figure out why they felt the need to humiliate poor Moneypenny at the end.If Brosnan is going to make another Bond film before he retires the role I hope they get a director who understands the Bond mystique because this one seems to think it's all about blowing things up while making jokes about your genitals.".

Well as soon as this turkey Die Another Day was released that discussion became forever and permanently DEAD. Die Another Day contains some of the most IDIOTIC oneliners of all time DREADFULL CGI HORRIBLY unfunny jokes pathetically LAME sexual innuendos a Bond girl Halle Berry that is probably the WORST Bond girl of all time a main villain Toby Stephens that is like Robocop meets a snootishspoiled British brat a main henchman Rick Yune that is like something out of a Star Wars movie for crying out loud and last but certainly not least Brosnan stinks it up as well.Brosnan is now officially the WORST of the five Bonds and this was by MILES the worst acting performance by any Bond ever. This is supposed to be a remake of Moonraker which has often been derided as being the worst Bond movie and as usual the remake is 10 times worse than the original. For any serious Bond fan this is an absolute DISGRACE. Ian Fleming Harry Saltzman Cubby Broccoli Terence Young and Peter Hunt must be rolling in their graves after this joke and poor Guy Hamilton the last of the original Bond creators that is still living probably nearly had a heart attack when he saw this piece of trash.Barbara Broccoli Dana Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson along with MGM should be ASHAMED of themselves. They have completely DESTROYED Cubby Broccoli's legacy. And to top it all off and add insult to injury the only good character in the film Miranda Frost Rosamund Pike is extremely underused and the worst thing of all Madonna who sings a very good Bond theme is not only singing the song but is in the movie. One of the worst actresses ever and she is actually BETTER than Berry and Brosnan are in this and they are supposed to be talented. Berry and Brosnan are so pathetic and lame with their acting in this that they should both have been FORCED to reimburse people who paid money to see this film out of their salaries for the movie. And as far Tamahori goes.........I won't even discuss my feelings on that one because that would not be appropriate for this forum.

Halle Berry looks so bad in this film not having been given the chance to show any part of her that is even remotely sexy. The filming and the music during her remake of the 'Ursulla Andress' original coming out of the water scene in a bikini was so unsexy it is unbelievable. The camera was so bad it managed to show all the negative aspects of her figure rather than the positive ones. Not to mention Rosamund Pike where the only good part of her appearance was that she was named Ms Frost. And the villains... they are funnier than they are mean... for goodness sake where are the Bond villains of the past?All in all a total catastrophe there is not even one aspect of this movie that can be salvaged from direction cinematography acting all the way down to the musical soundtrack the only adjective that comes to mind is... pathetic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Another Day Directed by Lee Tamahori.Starring Pierce Brosnan Halle Berry and Judi Dench.Pierce Brosnan's fourth effort as James Bond turns out to be by far his worst resulting in the overly cheesy and disappointing Die Another Day. Marking a double anniversary for the series twenty films in forty years the movie celebrates the triedandtrue Bond formula by tossing in at least one reference to each previous installment. While it may be fun to play 'Guess That Bond Movie' for a bit there is generally not much enjoyment to be had in this uninspired entry.The pretitle sequence kicks things off in typical Bond fashion. 007 invades a North Korean military base and after an exciting hovercraft chase is captured and imprisoned for over a year. As the credits roll  to the sub par theme sung by Madonna  the audience sees Bond beaten and tortured. MI6 only comes to his aid because they believe that he has cracked under pressure and don't want the North Koreans siphoning important information. The onceheroic secret agent returns to his homeland a disgrace. The intro sets a serious tone for the film duping its audience into suspecting that a similarly themed story will follow. That's what would have made sense but it certainly isn't what occurs.Die Another Day is split into two very different films. In the first half it's a revenge story played relatively straight with interesting plot turns and developments. Bond without the backing of his agency seeks revenge for his betrayal in North Korea following a trail with stops at Hong Kong Havana and Iceland that eventually leads to diamond tycoon Gustav Graves Toby Stephens. Graves is a pretty standard villain at first glance rich eccentric and power hungry. In fact the entire first hour is business as usual for the series nothing new but enjoyable nonetheless.The story takes a turn for the outrageous in its second half starting with Bond's initial encounter with Graves. The two quickly clash egos at a prestigious London fencing club. Their friendly match soon becomes an overthetop sword fight that toes the line between exhilaration and camp. In the very next scene Bond is reinstated at MI6 and Die Another Day simultaneously ditches the revenge theme. Apparently Tamahori was no longer concerned with that aspect of the story instead preferring to prop up his movie with ridiculous gadgets and unconvincing action sequences. The series typically employs stunt men to realize its fantastic feats but this outing amps up the CGI to a disappointing degree. Seeing a computergenerated Pierce Brosnan riding a tidal wave and dodging icebergs on a makeshift surfboard is just too much. Remember just because you can doesn't mean you should.Brosnan's effort in Die Another Day recalls that of Sean Connery in his last 007 feature Diamonds Are Forever. Much like Connery at the time Brosnan has simply lost interest and sleepwalks from scene to scene. His heart clearly isn't in it whether it be due to the corniness of the film or boredom with the role in general. He stars opposite Halle Berry whose Jinx character is set up as Bond's female equivalent. She's an American agent working for the NSA with an appetite for sex and excitement. Despite the good intentions Jinx is just a poorly disguised effort to appease feminist sensibilities not to mention she's just plain annoying. The producers make sure that she kicks butt yet she is still the helpless damsel in distress when the time comes.This twentieth installment means well and in the hands of a more competent director it could have been much better but Die Another Day ultimately fails because of its indecisiveness. The film sacrifices story to make way for mindless action but in order for the audience to care about the action there needs to be a compelling story driving it along I guess those responsible for the movie never heard about the chicken and the egg. It attempts to pay tribute to the past but instead combines the worst bits of the old movies. As a result Die Another Day takes its place alongside Diamonds Are Forever Moonraker and A View to a Kill as one of the worst Bond films ever made.Final Grade D".

While it isn't a dud there's nothing particularly outstanding about it and it emerges as a fairly routine and forgettable film.There are some enjoyable aspects to the film however. I admired Yul Brynner for delivering a lead character that was so uncompromising cold and ruthless  while he was hardly an admirable hero he was believable and convincing and therefore more interesting as a character. I'm sure if this film were made today the character would've had some more 'likable' elements inserted into him during the film.The weakest aspect is Ernie Freeman's dreadful score  cornball and overdone regularly undermining the potential suspense in key scenes.For mine while the film itself isn't particularly noteworthy in a broader context it has a curious interest. Despite being made by a major studio having a major star and a director who delivered many topnotch films in this period especially a certain ape film made the same year it didn't make much impact at the time and is totally forgotten today even for a film made four decades ago. Why is this? I actually think it would be much more remembered if it had been filmed as a flashy goofy spy film that is now considered to be representative of late 1960s film style and culture  the likes of which were spoofed in the Austin Powers films. For example while imo 'In Like Flint' is a dreadful film clearly inferior to TDM because of its glossy and spoofy style I can see how its much more remembered and referenced today.Of course TDM could've still been remembered on the basis of sheer quality but apart from Brynner's performance it just doesn't have enough of it.".

Interesting to note that the director would soon be working on the iconic Planet Of The Apes.Added to the admirable location work are the international cast. There are no stars besides Yul Brynner but there are several actors I have a lot of time for. Clive Revill in particular adds a solid emotional punching bag for Brynner. His intense and downbeat performance is in contrast to his usual extroverted and comedy roles. Anton Diffring was too often cast as Nazi baddies but could easily deliver menace without a uniform. He starred in several classic horror films of the period like Circus of Horrors and The Man Who Cheated Death. A young Britt Ekland amply provides glamour here before she broke it big as a Bond girl.I grew up watching this movie on TV and always tuned in for the cast the twisty plot and especially the music. It's a little OTT in places but frantically catchy pumping up the excitement even when there's little of it on screen. The special effects work is subtle and really convincing in selling the central twist...I'm very pleased to see that at least this is out now on DVD in Germany with an English language voice track option.".

	schema:headline " Exciting spy film set during the Cold War with thrills  noisy action  plot twists and interesting script";
	schema:reviewBody "The film has suspense  tension  emotion  mystery and specially in its final a little bit of violence . Following the death of his son  in the Austrian Alps  The Key Man  a high ranking officer in the CIA called Dan Slater Yul Brynner  has to face off the most daring plot ever concocted by the secret agents of two worlds  East and West  during the Cold War . In Austria he decides to investigate and step by step finds out that the death of his son was no a skiing accident . A retired  prior undercover operative  Frank Wheatley Clive Revill  whom he had hoped would watch out for his son helps Dan seeks out the real killers . By the way  Dan meets socialite Gina Britt Ekland  though Ulla Jacobsson was offered first this role  the companion of rich and mature Mrs. Carrington Moira Lister  who puts him on the alright trails o perhaps fake clues . Eventually  rare inconsistencies begin appearing leading Dan to conclude that Russian secret service led by Col. Berthold Anton Diffring attempting a mysterious kidnapping . Suspenseful movie packs thrills  intrigue  frantic action  twists and turns . This complex piece of espionage is notable for its snowcapped scenery and its thrilling intrigue from start to finish . Interesting as well as amusing screenplay from Alfred Hayes and Frank Tarloff based on Henry Maxfield's novel titled Legacy of a Spy. However  the movie's script was similar to the then recently released Spy with my face 1965 and its TV counterpart The agent of T.I.A.  The Double Affair 1964 . Although the picture has various ingredients for entertainment  the screenplay is also complex  including inexplicable incidents  the plot has gaps  in spite of it results to be pretty fun . Nice acting by Yul Brynner as cold and emotionless agent  a topnotch performance who steals the show and gorgeous Britt Ekland's first major movie role . Support cast is pretty good such as Lloyd Nolan as Major Edwards who assigns him the dangerous mission  Clive Revill as undercover agent  Moira Lister as wealthy Mistress and Brandon Brady as Russian agent . Special mention for Anton Diffring in his ordinary German face and cool  clipped diction  as he replaced an actor who dropped out  here Anton plays magnificently a Russian operative who attempts to substitute starring with a double of its own in order to obtain a mole in the highest echelons of the CIA agency .

	onyx:emotionText "The film has suspense  tension  emotion  mystery and specially in its final a little bit of violence . Following the death of his son  in the Austrian Alps  The Key Man  a high ranking officer in the CIA called Dan Slater Yul Brynner  has to face off the most daring plot ever concocted by the secret agents of two worlds  East and West  during the Cold War . In Austria he decides to investigate and step by step finds out that the death of his son was no a skiing accident . A retired  prior undercover operative  Frank Wheatley Clive Revill  whom he had hoped would watch out for his son helps Dan seeks out the real killers . By the way  Dan meets socialite Gina Britt Ekland  though Ulla Jacobsson was offered first this role  the companion of rich and mature Mrs. Carrington Moira Lister  who puts him on the alright trails o perhaps fake clues . Eventually  rare inconsistencies begin appearing leading Dan to conclude that Russian secret service led by Col. Berthold Anton Diffring attempting a mysterious kidnapping . Suspenseful movie packs thrills  intrigue  frantic action  twists and turns . This complex piece of espionage is notable for its snowcapped scenery and its thrilling intrigue from start to finish . Interesting as well as amusing screenplay from Alfred Hayes and Frank Tarloff based on Henry Maxfield's novel titled Legacy of a Spy. However  the movie's script was similar to the then recently released Spy with my face 1965 and its TV counterpart The agent of T.I.A.  The Double Affair 1964 . Although the picture has various ingredients for entertainment  the screenplay is also complex  including inexplicable incidents  the plot has gaps  in spite of it results to be pretty fun . Nice acting by Yul Brynner as cold and emotionless agent  a topnotch performance who steals the show and gorgeous Britt Ekland's first major movie role . Support cast is pretty good such as Lloyd Nolan as Major Edwards who assigns him the dangerous mission  Clive Revill as undercover agent  Moira Lister as wealthy Mistress and Brandon Brady as Russian agent . Special mention for Anton Diffring in his ordinary German face and cool  clipped diction  as he replaced an actor who dropped out  here Anton plays magnificently a Russian operative who attempts to substitute starring with a double of its own in order to obtain a mole in the highest echelons of the CIA agency . Diffring was a character actor who worked continuously in movies due to his aristocratic style  making him ideal for typecasting in British and later American films as Nazis and other vile  despicable roles  what was ironic about his typecasting as a Nazi is that he fled Nazi Germany in 1939 .Lively and enjoyable musical score by Ernie Freeman  including catching sounds throughout .

	schema:reviewBody "Just like its leading man Yul Brynner The Double Man is a decently lean direct and hardhearted late 60s spy melodrama. A steadfast Brynner simply commands the screen even when no dialogues are spoken his psychical presence and glare can knock you down. Here he plays CIA agent Dan Slater who heads to a ski resort in the Tyrolean Alps after the reported accidental death of his son but he believes it wasn't an accident and unknowingly to him his arrival is actually part of a cunning Cold War ploy. It's a wellhandled and goodlooking thanks to the scenic cinematography of picturesque snowy backdrop presentation as the plot is thick on intrigue and investigation as it slowly builds upon its brooding framework. There's nothing particularly exciting about it as the thrills are few and minor and it's overly talky. However the structure is persistent as the exchanges have a moody intensity and Brynner carries it along nicely with all that chasing and shadowy scheming going on behind the scenes. The ludicrous twist when it comes isn't much of one because of the clues that are given. Really it only complicates matters but this works for its stone cold approach. Franklin J. Schaffner's taut direction is grounded and practical in style as he lets the story's conflicts evolve and the cast take control. The everbeautiful Britt Ekland plays an important piece to the plot's stirrings and there's excellent support from the likes of Clive Revill Anton Differing Lloyd Nolan and Moira Lister. Also dominating was the instrumental music score. Sometimes it worked other times it was on overload.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yul Brynner was an impressive and powerful screen presence moving like a panther scowling like one as well from under his intent brow. He really laid it on and it generally works. But here is the problem this film is about 'duplicating' him. The Soviets aided by the East Germans Anton Diffring not as a Nazi officer this time but as a Stasi officer same thing intend to replace Dan Slater Assistant Deputy Director of the CIA played by Brynner with a double. The double played by Brynner naturally has the same accent and the same walk is the same size and has had plastic surgery to have the same face. But of all the people in Hollywood who could not be duplicated Yul Brynner must be the top. So how silly can you get? This kind of story might work with one of those identikit actors who are especially popular in Hollywood at the moment actually but somebody as weird as Yul Brynner?! And the story gets sillier. Because there is cute 34 yearold Britt Ekland. I had forgotten what a looker she really was in those days. Naturally there has to be 'the girl' in every such story so credulity is stretched even further to fit her in despite the fact that she is not really part of the story and has to be squeezed between the floorboards that's because the story is set in the Austrian Tyrol where all the chalets are wooden so that Anton Diffring and his team can blend in with the locals and also so that some people can combine the film production with a skiing holiday a joke? or real?. Shades of Leni Riefenstahl and the mountain films of the twenties and thirties such as STORM OVER MONT BLANC! This film is made all the more objectionable because of the terrible music score by Ernie Freeman. In the late sixties it was considered trendy to fill every moment of a thriller when people weren't speaking with blaring trumpets and trombones in a kind of hep ersatz jazz the theory being that this would heighten the tension while people were walking up staircases supposed to be ominous with goodness knows what fate awaiting them at the top or approaching looming buildings which might contain goodness knows what villains. More likely it made people hold their ears or run screaming from the cinema in search of a doctor. The film was directed by Franklin Schaffner best known for PLANET OF THE APES the following year 1968 and his next film PATTON two years later in 1971 his film SPHINX of 1981 was no great shakes see my review who should have known better and who at least saved it from being terrible so that it remained merely bad. Moira Lister has great fun being a spoilt rich hostess who throws parties and tries to seduce toy boys. Clive Revill is good at being a hangdog former British spy who can't take it any more and cannot even make himself pick up a gun although finally he regains his courage of course and does pick up one lest he let down a friend. Lloyd Nolan plays the head of the CIA from a wheelchair and whines 'How could Dan go off somewhere without telling me where?' Some CIA! A cable arrives addressed to Dan Slater Central Intelligence Agency Washington DC we see it on screen but no one at the CIA bothers to read it and it is handed to Brynner as if it were a Christmas card. Sure that's how it works in Washington. But this is a serious matter will the dastardly communist Yul Brynner return to America and betray all the secrets of the USA to the sourfaced Russian who has instructed the eager Diffring? Or will the patriotic Yul Brynner save the day by stopping him? As the bad Brynner says to the good Brynner during a gunfight 'There cannot be two of us.' Is a glass half full or half empty? Is a movie half good or half bad? Five stars will leave you wondering about that.".

Someone has to come crashing through plate glass windows destroy mountains of dishes and glassware and demolish a whole kitchen or other room for sensationalism. This cheap addition makes me not like whatever else good story good acting beautiful scenery may be in that movie. Americans are destructive orientated and I guess we thrive on the addition of this junk.";

Douglas and Adams are also terrific as Kedrova's husband and estranged daughter respectively but it is Kedrova who elevates this lastjourneybeforeIdie soaper far above its roots.  The pacing is a tad slow but the terrific photography sensitive score and magnificent performances more than make up for any shortcomings.Warning the first time I saw it the male friend who was with me hated it and wanted to walk out.  When I recently rewatched it off cable a male colleague called it incredibly boring.  Since I and every other woman I know who saw it loved it I conclude that most men I know don't really get the subtleties of what was truly going on.  Because Lila's relationships with her husband and daughter are reflected against the prism of her life the director's artistic brilliance needs to be absorbed rather than spoonfed. So my advice to other women is to see this one alone or with another woman.  Otherwise you may find yourself constantly being nagged to put on something with some action  in it.That being said this is a terrific and sensitive movie.  Enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "You could definitely write a movie of the life of the sweet faced Lila Kedrova all but forgotten outside of a few films and stage appearances. There's something tragic yet triumphant hidden inside the mask of this so real lady a hero through shear survival and a legacy worthy of rediscovery. At only 62 she plays a seemingly much older character facing her mortality with quiet love yet so ready for that eternal rest. Having found love late in life and dying happily even with false illusions on Zorba she is now a longmarried woman on one last quest with husband Melvyn Douglas facing old haunting memories yet trying to retain some amount of self as her mind slips further away from the current world. Douglas on the verge of his own real life mortality had a career upswing with a recent Oscar going out with grace after a six decade film and stage career.A woman's heart carries many secrets a wise lady once said and in the case of Kedrova's quietly wise Eva there's a ton of them. Eva lets the audience into her soul showing us the horrors of her youth and there is definitely a correlation between her reaction to the declining years and her haunting memories. Not wanting to infringe on her overly concerned children Kedrova has a breakdown of sorts when she learns of Douglas's deception to get her out of the house that they can no longer take care of. Of the supporting cast Brooke Adams is the only familiar name playing their troubled daughter but it is 80 year old Lili Valenti as an old friend of Kedrova's who makes the most of the smaller parts.Difficult to watch from the perspective of having an aging mother of my own I saw this as the themes of aging desperation for independence yet a view of a life that can only be avoided by an early death. Even though she looks much younger than Douglas Kedrova manages to convince me that she's much older sort of a curse on itself that time can affect the mind and body even though the physical appears to be less than what it is. The hints of her past through flashbacks could very well be a movie of its own. Excellent heartfelt direction by the Oscar winning actress Lee Grant makes this a definite text to study for film scholars because the themes are so rich and filled with a live for the subject at hand. Made in the same time frame as On Golden Pond it is entirely different almost even more poignant in some ways and certainly reaffirming of what the last years of life should be all about.".
