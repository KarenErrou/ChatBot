	schema:reviewBody "I have a story to tell about this one.  I had never heard of Bud Boetticher or 7 Men from Now when I set out with my mom a cool old lady to Berkeley to see what was going on she's from out of town.  We found a schedule for the Pacific Film Archive and it said they were showing 2 westerns by Bud Boetticher and that he would be there.  Well I'm a sucker for meeting directors very few crawl out to bask in the sun it must be bad for their complexion especially if they directed lots of b movies.  They were showing Bullfighter and the Lady also excellent and 7 Men From Now.  7 Men is one of the best westerns I have ever seen Lee Marvin and Randolph Scott are just terrific and the direction is amazing.  I thought the kinetic energy combined with the extreme tension in the fights at the end were excellent. Now after the show Boetticher and his wife showed up and Boetticher had some illuminating words to say.  After that he met some of us in the audience and I happened to mention how much I liked the scene where Gail Russell is in the wagon and puts out the candle and has a brief but oddly touching dialogue with Randolph Scott who is lying under the wagon.  What Boetticher said was Yes that's a much better way to do a sex scene now isn't it?.  When I reflected on this statement later I realized what seemed casual at first was in fact a profound statement on film expression Boetticher was telling me that what he was showing WAS sex.  Maybe I think he suggested throbbing bodies and dim lights aren't sex at all.  Maybe what so many people in my generation I'm 25 take as naivete in classic films was....... dare I say it TASTE AND STYLE???!!!  Yes is the answer.  And Boetticher's got both of them hats off to him and everyone else involved in this fine film I hope everyone sees and I hope I get a chance to see again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Men from Now is directed by Budd Boetticher and produced by John Wayne's Batjac Productions. Written by Burt Kennedy it stars Randolph Scott Gail Russell  Lee Marvin. Music is by Henry Vars  William H. Clothier photographs out of the Alabama Hills and Lone Pine California.Former Sheriff Ben Stride is on the trail of the seven men who whilst robbing a Wells Fargo office killed his wife in the process. Mentally tortured by having lost his job that resulted in his wife having to work at Wells Fargo Stride is totally driven by hurt and anger. But along the way he helps a married couple who are stuck in the mud who persuade Stride to ride West with them in case of further problems. They are then joined by a couple of suspect characters who have their own private agenda for tagging along with Stride all parties seemingly heading for the day when the truth will out.Director Budd Boetticher and leading Western star Randolph Scott made between 1956 and 1960 seven interesting and genre bending films. This was the first of their collaborations and although it can be said they were merely honing their Adult Western bent here all the traits that would make the upcoming The Tall T Ride Loneome and Comanche Station so worthy of genre classic status is evident here in this film. Tho simple in plot I mean man on a mission movies are not exactly rare are they? Seven Men From Now is boosted by a smartly ambiguous turn from Lee Marvin as Bill Masters while Boetticher's ability to raise his complex and hungry characters above and beyond the standard tale further gives the piece some kudos. Incidents dot themselves throughout the story to keep the film from ever drifting to the mundane while the location work at Lone Pine Alabama Hills in California is gorgeous where we should be thankful to cinematographer William H. Clothier for realising that Boetticher needs his vista to be another character.Originally intended as a vehicle for John Wayne who took producing duties instead when his schedule wouldn't allow him the time to star Seven Men From Now gave Randolph Scott a chance to show just what a fine actor he was. His Ben Stride could so easily have been played as corny and grumpy but Scott gives it the emotional depth that Burt Kennedy's script demanded. Gail Russell Annie Greer is the lady of the piece she ultimately led a sad real life but at least here as the woman caught between two men we get to see that she did have the ability when called upon  even if this didn't relaunch her career in the way that her friend John Wayne had originally hoped for. In fact Gail was to sadly succumb to the alcoholism that blighted her life just five years later aged just 36. Thankfully this film stands up as a fine way to remember her beauty and for the efforts that she put into the Western genre.Lacking the heavy cloud of doom of Boetticher  Scott's best collaborations this one however boasts richly interesting characters that are telling a cunning moral allegory tale. It be an Oater for those who like intelligence over yippee kiyay like histrionics. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got to see Budd Boetticher's superb Technicolor western Seven Men from Now which was long considered a lost classic in 1950s American cinema. The copy I saw was a prerestored version but in excellent condition. This is Boetticher's first of a series of fascinating modest and lowbudget westerns with Randolph Scott. The others include Buchanan Rides Alone Decision at Sundown The Tall T Ride Lonesome and Comanche Station. All of them are superb but Seven Men is really my favorite. As Andrew Sarris astutely observed in his Boetticher entry in The American Cinema Constructed partly as allegorical odysseys and partly as floating poker games in which every character took turns at bluffing about his hand or his draw until the final showdown Boetticher's westerns expressed a weary serenity and moral certitude that was contrary to the more neurotic approaches of other directors in this neglected genre of the cinema. From the stunning opening sequence of Scott coming from behind the camera entering a rocky shelter to the final scene of Gail Russell watching Scott leaving the town Seven Men is an exciting brooding and impeccably constructed western. Boetticher deftly uses the vast isolated landscape to comment on the characters' isolation and entrapment. The screenplay by Burt Kennedy is brilliant and witty. The film also features some extraordinary performances by Scott and his clever nemesis played by the incredible Lee Marvin a role that somehow anticipates his sadistic Liberty Valance in Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Scott plays a morally ambiguous exsheriff who while helping an Eastern husband and wife travel crosscountry in their covered wagon hunts for the seven men shot and killed his wife. The scenes between Scott and Russell are strangely moving and effective. The final showdown between Scott and Marvin is stunning and unforgettable.".

Randolph Scott performs a lonely rider thirsty to revenge the death of his wife and Lee Marvin performs a great villain as usual. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 7 Homens Sem Destino 7 Men Without Destiny";

	schema:headline " Lee Marvin at his most cunning";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite westerns. Since it has been out of circulation until recently few of the new generation have got to see it. Hopefully now that it has been restored on DVD it will receive its just desserts. If at all possible see the widescreen version. Budd Boetticher believed that as many shots as possible should be made outside. His movies have few interior scenes. He shot his best westerns in Lone Pine California second only to Utah's Mounument Valley for natural beauty that fulfills anyone's fantasy of how the Old West should appear on the big screen. Seven Men From Now also contains one of my favorite movie shots highlighting the genius of Boetticher. When Ben Stride Randy Scott draws against Bill Masters Lee Marvin the viewer never sees Stride draw. HisHer imagination must be used to visualize just how fast Stride's draw is. It's sort of like the old joke used on the Steve Allen Television Show by Don Knotts. He never moves his hands and asks the viewer Wanna see it again? These were the early days of Lee Marvin's film career when he was still trying to prove himself as a viable actor. In Seven Men From Now he succeeds beyond one's wildest expectations. Though he deserved the Oscar for Cat Ballou a few years later he is actually better in Seven Men From Now than he was in that awardwinning flick. After Cat Ballou his acting deteriorated somewhat though from time to time he turned in an admirable performance especially in the neglected classic Point Blank. Second only to Lee Marvin is Randolph Scott who never gave a poor performance. He plays to perfection his role as a revenge seeking selfpitying Marshall who still believes in fair play and romance. John Wayne was originally slotted for the role but it is doubtful that even such a great actor as Wayne could have played Ben Stride the way he was meant to be portrayed the way Randy Scott plays him. The finely honed wellwritten script is by Burt Kennedy who would go on to make one of the funniest westerns ever Support Your Local Sheriff. What a team Boetticher Kennedy and Scott made.Though it is good to see the old cowboy star Don Red Barry on the big screen once more his part as Bill Masters' weakminded sidekick does not fit him. He is sadly miscast. A character actor such as Strother Martin would have fit the role much better.This is one of those films not to be missed whether you're a western fan or not. It can be viewed repeatedly and enjoyed more each time.".

According to a book I have about those last three B western heroes Randolph Scott Joel McCrea and Audie Murphy Wayne liked the script and wanted to do it himself but at the time was tied up with The Searchers. He peddled the script which he owned because Burt Kennedy who wrote it was under contract to Batjac and was doing it under Wayne's auspices to a number of people before getting Randolph Scott. When it premiered Wayne cursed himself that he hadn't done it.If he had it would have become a classic like The Searchers. Wayne was at the height of his career at that point and Randolph Scott was doing good critically acclaimed but B programmers that filled the second half of double bills at that time. Hard to see how the Duke would have been better than Randolph Scott. He's a former sheriff out hunting the men who robbed a Wells Fargo express office and killed his wife who was working there. While on the hunt he runs into Walter Reed and Gail Russell who are a homesteader and wife traveling to California. Scott helps them out and rides along with them. Their story and his get enmeshed as the plot unfolds.Gail Russell was a tragic figure who was a good friend of Wayne's. She had a lot of problems both emotional and with substance abuse. Like the Duke was wont to do he gave her a part in this hoping for a comeback. Though she was good it was not to be the case.Her husband in the film Walter Reed got another chance to work with John Wayne this time in The Horse Soldiers as one of the officers on the raid that Wayne was leading. So did Stuart Whitman who has a bit role as a young army lieutenant. Their chemistry in The Comancheros was legendary.Speaking of The Comancheros Lee Marvin is memorable here as one of the villains with some highly mixed motives. And he too would get to work with John Wayne in the future.Seven Men from Now is a fine film which but for a previous commitment could have been an A picture and a John Wayne classic. But Randolph Scott could hardly have been topped for the performance he gave.".

	schema:headline " First of the ScottBoetticher Westerns";
	schema:reviewBody "Seven Men From Now marked the first of seven compact 7580 minute little westerns starring Randolph Scott and directed by Budd Boetticher. This one was produced by John Wayne's Batjac production company. It was originally intended for Wayne but he was busy on The Searchers 1956 at the time so the role went to Scott. One has to wonder what would have happened had Wayne starred. For instance the running time would probably have had to have been lengthened to elevate it to A picture status. As it was it is a compact 78 minute B plus classic with an excellent cast and crisp direction.This picture had been locked away in the Batjac vaults until recently when this and several other Batjac productions were painfully restored to their original brilliance under the direction of Michael Wayne.Ex marshal Ben Stride Scott is on the trail of seven outlaws who robbed the freight office in his town and killed his wife in the process. Stride had been defeated for the job of sheriff and had refused to take the deputy sheriff job thus he carries the burden of blame for not being there to save his wife.Stride catches up to two of the men in the opening sequence with predictable results. Later on he comes upon a young couple the Greers traveling west by way of the town that Stride is going to. When we meet John Greer Walter Reed and his wife Annie Gail Russell they are virtually stuck in the mud. Stride helps them out and decides to travel along with them. Greer seems to be a bit of a milk toast and an attraction forms between Annie and Stride.Along the trail they meet up with Bill Masters Lee Marvin and his pal Clete Donald Barry. Although Stride suspects that they might be a part of the gang Masters soon lets it be known that he too is after the 20000 stolen in the robbery. After a falling out Masters and Clete ride ahead to town and meet the remaining members of the gang headed by Bodeen John Larch. They learn that the gold is being brought to them in Greer's wagon.The gang rides out to try and ambush Stride and Masters and Clete ride after them. Out in the country a showdown ensues and..........This film established the types of characters that would appear in the subsequent six films the solitary granite jawed hero with a past and the likable but lethal villain. The final six films would be produced by Scott's Ranown production company.The beautiful but tragic Gail Russell was fighting her personal demons at this time. Her past relationship with John Wayne no doubt figured in her getting this part which she carries off well. She died at the young age of 36 in 1961. For Marvin I believe that this was the first time that he was billed above the title. He practically steals the picture as the likable but deadly villain. Walter Reed was a staple of the John Ford stock company and has one of the best roles of his career in this film. Watch for Stuart Whitman as a cavalry lieutenant and Wayne stunt double Chuck Roberson as one of the outlaws. Donald Barry was better known as Don Red Barry in the 1940s as the result of having played Red Ryder in the 1940 serial The Adventures of Red Ryder.A great little western.".

Her past relationship with John Wayne no doubt figured in her getting this part which she carries off well. She died at the young age of 36 in 1961. For Marvin I believe that this was the first time that he was billed above the title. He practically steals the picture as the likable but deadly villain. Walter Reed was a staple of the John Ford stock company and has one of the best roles of his career in this film. Watch for Stuart Whitman as a cavalry lieutenant and Wayne stunt double Chuck Roberson as one of the outlaws. Donald Barry was better known as Don Red Barry in the 1940s as the result of having played Red Ryder in the 1940 serial The Adventures of Red Ryder.A great little western.";

	schema:reviewBody "Underrated entry in BoetticherScott cycle of Westerns. Maybe it's because this was the first collaboration between the two that has kept it overshadowed by betterknown entries like The Tall T or Decision at Sundown. Nonetheless the essential elements are already present a laconic embittered Scott the neolithic Alabama Hills a villain with some scruples Lee Marvin and an excellent script Burt Kennedy. There's also a couple of neat surprises that make sense.Note how well that first scene is both conceived and staged. Stranger Scott rides up to campfire where two other strangers sit cozily drinking coffee. It's cold and Scott wants to sit awhile. Naturally there's some wariness since these are strangers meeting in a hostile environment. But soon Scott and one stranger John Beradino start sounding friendly. Now Boetticher could have cut between closeups of the two conversing. But he doesn't. Instead he keeps the silent cowboy in the same frame as Beradino and cuts between them and Scott. This keeps a certain tension alive in the scene because the second stranger looks worried even while Scott and Beradino begin to warm up and we're reminded of that every time the camera switches to Beradino. Thus the undercurrent of unexplained unease never leaves the scene until events climax. It's a brilliantly executed passage that hooks the audience for the remainder. It's also touches like this that lifted the cycle to classic status.Then too there's a chance to scope out a young Lee Marvin about as good an actor as there was at the time. You never know what his talkative villain will do next. Pitting him against the sternly taciturn Scott makes for marvelously contrasting styles. Scott's ongoing role in these movies is a role he apparently was born to play after starting his career in sappy male leads. Then too there's the gorgeous and doggedly loyal Gale Russell as the paleeyed wife. Her scenes with Scott amount to little gems of suppressed desire. But especially qualifying as a classic is the stormy night in the wagon. The tension there builds as Marvin tries to rile Russell's mildmannered husband Walter Reed while Scott and Russell look on. The scene is beautifully played and fairly crackles with crosscurrents of emotion as Marvin exploits the growing attraction between the married Russell and the conflicted Scott. My only complaint is the very last scene where the usually surehanded Kennedy flounders and Russell looks like she just stepped out of a Hollywood beauty salon. Just goes to show I suppose the difficulty Westerns traditionally have when deciding on romantic commitment.Another characteristic in this initial entry is Scott's clear code of honor. It's machobased but also notable for its gallantry. Scott's not too proud to help Russell hang out the wash nor will he get overt as long as Russell's married. But just listen when Russell strays into his private concerns such as that of his dead wife. His voice turns suddenly cold and hard and you know this is a man with a firm code of honor that will not be compromised even by an appealing woman. He may not be as personable as villains like Marvin but there's always that strict code that commands respect and guides his actions.That's the kind of character Scott portrays throughout the cycle and is a major reason why little gems like Seven Men from Now endure.".

At this point I only have THE TALL T 1957  ironically the most highlyregarded title  still to watch from The Ranown Cycle films.SEVEN MEN FROM NOW emerges as a classic Western and certainly a cut above star Randolph Scott's typical vehicle. At a mere 78 mins. it's terse economical and unpretentious  but the script is anything but simpleminded! Scott doesn't exert his acting abilities any more than usual but his presence is quietly commanding proving an obvious influence on Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name persona in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy 196466  and as much an iconic Western figure as John Wayne or James Stewart in a series of 5 films directed by Anthony Mann. He also creates an interesting contrast with Lee Marvin's memorable  and oddly likable  rogue the tragic Gail Russell too is fine in her last prominent role her untimely death occurred 5 years later.The epic and versatile Lone Pine location served Boetticher extremely well in much the same way that Monument Valley did John Ford. The film also features a wonderful score though it includes a couple of resistible tunes a standard practice in Westerns from that era that were disliked even by the filmmakers themselves! and at least three memorable sequences the scene in the wagon where Marvin tells the story of a threeway romance that is full of doublemeaning to the present situation involving Scott Russell and her weakling husband Walter Reed the opening and closing gunfights first in which Scott kills two of the men he's after the seven of the title who robbed 20000 worth in gold and killed his bystander wife and his inevitable showdown with Marvin's overconfident quickdraw  both of which amazingly occur offscreen for a scene to be effective sometimes it's all in the editing! The film's openended conclusion was also not typical of the genre.While the film had languished in the Batjac vault for decades its eventual DVD presentation  along with the rest of their productions I followed this with the 4 John Wayne titles already out  has ensured a quality edition though the Audio Commentary  taken from Jim Kitses' book on the genre Horizons West  while certainly interesting is rather a heavygoing listen and would perhaps best be digested on the printed page! unlike the rest of The Ranown Cycle films  the property of Sony and Warners  which are still M.I.A. on the format and would most probably only be barebones releases if still essential purchases...BUDD BOETTICHER AN American ORIGINAL 2005 the accompanying documentary whose makers are uncredited is basically a reduction of BUDD BOETTICHER A MAN CAN DO THAT with some new footage pertaining to the restoration of SEVEN MEN FROM NOW and recollections about its writer Burt Kennedy. Although it doesn't go into much detail with respect to individual films apart from the 8year inthemaking ARRUZA 1968 which for the director constituted a veritable exile and thus an essential phase in his life and career it's still worth viewing.".

If anything the most remarkable thing about it was the depth of characterisation and how compelling the story was is as good as any film bigger budgeted and twice as long. The modest budget doesn't show either the settings ones that actually look like they're outdoors have much colour and atmosphere and made terrific use of by the cinematography which has a lot of grace but some of the camera work is quite inventive as well. Budd Boetticher's direction is efficient and lean the characters are likable and flawed rather than black and whiteeven the villain has moral ambiguity which I liked and the acting is fine too. In particular Lee Marvin as a villain where you feel the menace and the cunning but you also find yourself caring for him. Randolph Scott is a charismatic lead with a purposefully stoic presence without ever being onenote that is alive to nuances. Gail Russell is touching and like Scott her acting is remarkably subtle and dynamic. Add to that a rousing score that still allows the drama to speak a script that's sharp to the point and surprisingly meaty none of that skimthesurface shallow stuff here blistering action especially that terrific final showdown and a wellpaced and engrossing story that allows you to engage with and relate to the characters and you have a truly great film that makes the most of its budget and much more. Don Barry to me didn't quite fit his role in the same way that the others did more to do with how atypical typewise it was and that it didn't seem in his comfort zone other than that the problems here were barely any. 910 Bethany Cox".

It is a rather short movie with the typical western circumstances to boost it's pace. Randolph Scott was in his 50's when he did this movie. The tiredness and lack of the western lead man charm is visible. John Wayne who is also the producer of this movie was going to play his part. But he didn't because he was busy. I wish he had. Lee Marvin on the other hand is the facesaver. He pawns Scott right left and center. Excellent portrayal of a grey shade character by him. He is slowly turning out to be one of my favorite 'Western Heroes' although mostly he plays the supporting actor. A pretty average western but worth a watch for Marvin.Rating  710".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this the first of the Randolph ScottBudd Boetticher westerns wasn't produced by Harry Joe Brown Andrew V McLaglen is credited as coproducer it was written superbly by Burt Kennedy and it did set a benchmark for those that followed. Indeed the collaboration between Boetticer Scott and Kennedy must rank amongst the finest and most fruitful in all of cinema and the westerns they made together are among the finest we've seen.The plots stuck to a simple formula. Scott was usually the taciturn lone stranger as here more often than not out to avenge the death of his wife. The villains were usually a gang of outlaws and there was always a woman involved but she remained somewhat on the periphery and although there was a romantic attraction between the woman and Scott it seldom amounted to anything. The principal relationship in these films verging at times on the homoerotic was between Scott and the villain.In Seven Men from Now Scott is after the seven men who held up the Wells Fargo office and killed his wife in the process. On route the teams up with mildmannered rancher Walter Reed and his wife Gail Russell as well as 'villians' Lee Marvin and Donald Barry out to take the money for themselves. Nothing is cutanddried the rancher isn't as pure or as weak as he first appears while Scott and Marvin's relationship verges at times on the affectionate heightening the tension between them particularly in the film's superbly staged final showdown. Likewise the relationship between Russell and Scott is far from conventional they obviously love each other but we are are never sure if anything will ever happen between them.This is a complex riveting picture magnificently photographed by William H Clothier and beautifully acted by Scott it is arguably his best performance Russell and Marvin. Like the other BoetticherScott westerns that followed it it clocks in at an economical 80 minutes or so and is simply not to be missed.".

	schema:headline " Some Things A Man Can't Ride Around.";
	schema:reviewBody "An enjoyable Batjac Wester with Randy Scott directed by Bud Boetticher. The two of them turned out a series of minor gems and this is perhaps the best example.Scott is his usual deeply tanned taciturn spoilsport self. He strides rather than walks matching his character's name. The plot has to do with his trying to recover some stolen Wells Fargo money. In the course of the robbery his wife was killed so he has plenty of reason to play the stoic. He's pretty amusing actually. He stands around grimly while people try to talk to him. It's like having a duel of wits with a piece of granite. I won't go into the rest of the plot.John Larch is such a likable actor that even when his role is ambiguous as it is here it's sad to see him get bumped off especially when he's shot to pieces from opposite directions.Gail Russell is a little sad to watch too. A few years earlier she had been both sexy and vulnerable etiolated blackhaired with pale blue irises  slightly pained as if suffering from a calamitous but not disfiguring disease. She seemed radiant with it. And maybe it was a disease after all sometimes called Jellenik's disease named after the guy who tried to medicalize alcoholism. In any case Russell hadn't that long to live.John Ford had two big stunt men in his stock company who were named Chuck. I forget the last name of the other but the one who appears here is Chuck Roberson. Chuck Roberson was known as Good Chuck because he didn't get drunk gamble or become vulgar. The other was known as Bad Chuck. Roberson had become John Wayne's traditional Western stand in. When Roberson's little kid was visiting a shoot he asked Wayne was kind of work Wayne did. Wayne replied that he did Roberson's close ups. Good Chuck retired to a ranch in Bakersfield and lived a reasonably content life monarch of all he surveyed.The outstanding performance without qualification is Lee Marvin's. What a GOOD BAD GUY he was! One of the best ever. He constantly plays with his six guns jokingly kicks chairs out from under people and when he's shot after some fatal words I don't 'spect there's any way to get that gold without going' over you he twirls around balletically before falling to the dirt. He did a great twirl in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and in The Killers as well although in at least the last he was helped considerably by the selfinduced chemical paralysis of his psychomotor coordination.What amazes me in these movies is how CLEAN all the men are. They can ride the range for a month and come out looking pressed and dapper in a way you wouldn't after one day behind the counter. At the end Scott winds up wearing a matching ultraviolet blue outfit with a cowboy hat of the same color and a bright scarf as a contrasting accessory. I'm not sure I got these terms right but you know what I mean.The movie is a lot of fun and Lee Marvin shouldn't be missed. His jaw is always slack his mouth half open. That pendulous lower lip bespeaking calculation contempt and distrust.".

But for my taste there are entirely too much shots of them travelling through the scenery and Randolph Scott does seem to be playing more on a single note than in other films like the Tall T also shown recently. Lee Marvin's character is interesting and well portrayed. But some of the scenes seem to fall a little flat the tensions within the group travelling together are unevenly portrayed and the robbers whose action sets Stride on their trail are barely brought to life at all. The shooting of the husband of Gail Russell's character also seems a rather transparent way of getting him out of the way which will put the robber leader in just as much trouble as the husband's revelations would have done.Overall then I mark this lower than most have done at 6.".

Bushwhacked along the way by two more of the outlaws he kills them both but is shot in the leg. Turns out their wagon he has been escorting has been carrying the loot all along. Scott has it left in the open the last two villains show up to try and get it and of course they are killed. Now Lee Marvin shows up to claim and dies in the shoot out with Scott.

	schema:reviewBody "'China Girl' is easily Abel Ferrara's most conventional and commercial movie to date. Thankfully it improves on his previous movie 'Fear City' which was too compromised and Hollywood to succeed. The story is a basic updating of Romeo And Juliet set against the background of Chinese and Italian gang rivalry. Newcomers Richard Panebianco and Sari Chang play Tony and Tye the ill fated lovers who continue their forbidden romance against pressure from their family and friends. Neither actor has went on to all that much but they are both more than adequate and make a sweet couple. The real action comes from solid performances by James Russo 'Donnie Brasco' David Caruso 'Kiss Of Death' Russell Wong 'The Prophecy 2' Paul Hipp 'Teenage Caveman' and Joey Chin 'Year Of The Dragon' many of whom went on to work with Ferrara on later projects. It was also good to see Judith Malina 'Dog Day Afternoon' and veteran character actor James Hong 'Big Trouble in Little China' in supporting roles. While by no means as flamboyant and confrontational as Ferrara's best known work this is a surprisingly entertaining story which should appeal to a much wider audience than his difficult but rewarding movies such as the stunning 'Bad Lieutenant' or the fascinating 'The Addiction'. This movie doesn't deserve its obscurity and is well worth a rental.".

Unlike orginal play these two poor lovers' death couldn't solve their fmilies' hatred but made it worse. Se la vie!".

	schema:headline " Good updated version of Romeo and Juliet";
	schema:reviewBody "China Girl is a good updated version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The film which centers on the forbidden romance between ItalianAmerican Tony Tony Panebianco and ChineseAmerican Tye Sari Chang is not great but brings this ancient story of starcross'd lovers to new generations. Shakespeare's language is beautiful but in this day of short attention spans among our young people he can come across as old and stodgy. Showing this film along with Brooklyn Babylon West Side Story Rocky Road William Shakespeare's Romeo  Juliet Pretty in Pink Romeo Must Die! and of course the 1968 classic adaptation Romeo and Juliet by Franco Zeferrelli can introduce young people to Shakespeare in school since Romeo and Juliet is one of his most famous stories. Young people can realize how timeless Shakespeare's story is and how it can apply to today's world.The movie Tony and Tye meet at a nightclub and fall in love despite the fact that their ethnic factions are fighting against each other for turf through gang warfare. I agree with previous reviews that the supporting actors are much better than the leads even though Panebianco and Chang are attractive and impressive in their first roles. The movie is actionpacked containing several fight scenes and one particular scene of graphic violence at the end. There is also a lot of profanity so viewers should be forewarned. I felt it was strange however that for a movie with a supposedly passionate love story the sex scene was pretty disappointing and actually unsexy! Despite these caveats though I think China Girl is a good movie and I wish it had done better at the box office. Maybe some cable movie channel can show this film backtoback with other Romeo and Julietinspired films for one day so viewers can see the similarities and differences among the various films. Now that's something that I would like to see! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chinese gangs vs. Italian gangs in NYC in 1987.  Tony Richard Panebianco and Tye Sari Chang meet and fall in love.  Meanwhile Tye's brother hates all Italians and Tony's friends hate Chinese.  If you've seen West Side Story you know how this endsbut a bit more tragically in this movie.  Plotwise it's very obvious but it's beautifully done.  Filmed with energy beautifully atmospheric the sets and lighting are incredible and full of bursts of ultraviolence.  Most of the roles are well acted especially by James Russo David Caruso chewing the scenery and Russell Wong.  As the young lovers Panebianco and Chang are unfortunately not that good.  In a way it's understandablehe was only 16 when this was made and it's the first role for both.  They're both very attractive Panebianco is pretty buff with a baby face Chang is delicate and beautiful but have little to do other than kiss and act like they love each other.  That isn't believable either since they have zero sexual chemistry.  Still they are sympathetic characters.  Also in a nice touch Panebianco shows more skin than Chang in their sex scene.This is really obscure and it doesn't deserve it.  It had almost no release in 1987 there were no stars to sell it and was never a big hit on cable or video.  Also Chang never made another movie and Panebianco disappeared after making a few more films Whatever happened to him?  He showed a lot of promise..  That's too badthis deserves a bigger audience.  Worth watching on cable or renting.".

However these youngguns make it a battleground and caught between it is two lovestruck lovers a Chinese girl TaynHwa and Italian lad Tony Monte. They don't care about colour or race despite what's happening all around them and what it could do to them or even loved ones.There's no real surprises to the old hat if simply lowkey material which was penned by Ferrara's collaborator Nicholas St. John as we pretty much know how this dangerous story plays out and eventually finishes however director Ferrara has a gritty but devoted style and upbeat tempo that's uniquely his own that elevates the conventional framework with his striking eye for a sense of place and powerfully lasting imagery that's uncompromising. He does more than just direct from the screenplay. The concentration on the tough smoky urban setting with excellent location photography of New York's bordering neighbourhoods Chinatown and little Italy helps build a seedy atmosphere where hatred and violence is simply waiting to boil over as obsession and pride becomes a death wish. Ferrara polarises it very well especially the conflict not between which is still quite blistering but within the same races seeking out honour in who they are  this is where it was at its strongest because the forbidden love angle while important to the plot's progression did stall and take away from some of the underlining tension. Although outside of its pushy race card slant it does feel like it's just building up these explosive acts to glorify its foreseeable conclusion. Joe Delia's melancholy score fits in perfectly.The performances are downtoearth and genuinely projected by its cast. Richard Panebianco and Sari Chang are sympathetically touching as the two lovebirds. An admirable James Russo and especially a hotheaded David Caruso bring an unstoppable intensity to their roles. Russell Wong is quite laidback in a sound performance in his quest to please his elders by controlling his gang and that of his wayward sister. Journeyman actor James Hong pops up as well as Robert Miano as heavies.You might call it lesser Ferrara compared to his other works but it's involving and efficiently handled with his trademark raw and brutal edge shining through.".

As Wong an Asian actor I love watching says to her little Sis Thai an equally impressive Sari Chang You don't understand you're nothing but a chink to them. I appreciated Wong's honesty here where honor runs high among this race. Wong was never truer in his words too. Gino's older brother Alby and his friends are racist goons. In particular is red haired Caruso who I loved in this despite playing a d..khead immature character of loathing. One scene has him ordering egg rolls while disrespectfully making squinting eyes at some Asian cooks nearby while also insulting the ones serving him. Now that's a d..khead. Panebianco sets him straight defending the Chinese where a physical fight almost ensues. It would of been good to see how it ended up if Russo hadn't stepped in but we know all too well that Caruso would of one won ending this conversation by getting Panebianco in a headlock simmering him then cutting him loose where Panebianco would of just shrugged him off and walked away.

This is complicated by the arch enemy gangs feuding the main plot of the story which I really liked. China Girl has great pumping music it's finale song I loved after one of the most memorable and tragic climaxes I've seen. It's a simple message told throughout it's story the consequences of hate and racism that we don't just have to view it on screen. The exterior shot settings of Chinatown and the Italian hood are well chosen. This Romeo and Juliet tale minus the happy ending but with stylized violence a plus has some great action sequences one involving a shootout I loved that ended with Caruso's crazed look as he mouthed Mother fu..ers through clenched teeth. China Girl has it all where the actionblood craving viewer will get his three dollars worth. One of the '88 movie treats. One of Ferrara's best.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite films of the 80's.I never get tired of watching it.The combo of the cinematography and the musical score makes it a winner for me.The theme of Chinatown vs Little Italy leaves a bitter after taste but it is somewhat essential for the 'Romeo  Juliet' storyline that it seems to follow.The two young leads as the sweet but doomed lovers 'Tye  Tony' Richard Panebianco and Sari Chang did an OK job. It's I believe their film debuts. They really didn't have any chemistry together but they look good and cute together and they tried. I feel Panebianco was doing his best imitation of John Travolta's Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever 1977! LOL He was portraying an Italian named Tony however so...James Russo as his older brother 'Alby' Alberto did a better job. Even though he was billed the leading star I felt his role was a supporting one. I don't know why but Russo always seems shorter on film but in real life he is 5'11! Man what the camera does to you!David Caruso as 'Mecury' Russo's righthand man is as intense and hyper I had seen Caruso do in acting. Here Caruso just let's go like a pit bull. He really stands out with his red hair. He looks more Irish than Italian but maybe he is a mix. His one scene where they are after the Chinese gang members and they escape he goes 'bananas' and starts shooting off his machine gun just everywhere! He really went 'ape sht' in that moment! Russell Wong as the leader of the Chinese gang and older brother to Tye did a very subdue and great job. I actually could see he and Tye as brother and sister. He really essayed being torn between his loyalty to the gang which includes his hotwire cousin Tsu Shin played by a good and believable Joey Chin and the main Chinese Mob Boss Gung Tu played by the great and wonderful character actor James Hong.Robert Miano plays the head WiseguyEnrico Perit that Russo answers to. he did a good job also. His scene with Russo was all Soprano worthy.Oh and before I forget the one gang member of the Chinese gang who really stood out for me was the bulky and muscular guy. I don't know what his name was in the movie so I can't tell which one he is in the credits but he must have impressed Ferrara because this 'Bolo Yeunglooking dude' had his very own death scene! After being shot in the arm by Caruso he escapes and makes it to his hideout and treats his wound and falls asleep. Where he is awakened by Hong's Gung Tu's henchmen who is there and stabs him in the chest! He is so strong that he gets up and takes the knife out and raises it to use it on the henchmen when another knife through the back finishes him off. It was one of Miano's Enrico Perit's henchmen. So all in all a great end to this muscular but evil young gang member.All in all a great film. Like I said one of my alltime favorites. I highly recommended it. It deserves a least one good viewing in your lifetime.".

Some of the influence is so painfully obvious as to seem like a ripoff the main male character in love is even named Tony and on a more immediate level of the period the good ol' mid 1980's things like hiphop synthdance music and of course Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' are interconnected with the film. I almost expected in some of these gangfight scenes to hear Eddie Van Halen's wicked guitar solo to come up on the soundtrack.Oh Ferrara does have his moments with the material which is very basically about turf war between the Chinese in Chinatown and the Italians in Little Italy with Canal street as the dividing line. There is some interest in how the conflict comes up when a Chinese restaurant pops up on the side of Little Italy  and yet the owner doesn't want to pay the usual protection fee to the Chinese gang just because he's Chinese. This spurs on some major problems violence and of course Tony and TyanHwa at the center.A flaw in the film is that we're never really sure why the two lovebirds are even in love with each other. Again like RobbinsWise's film they spot each other from across the dance hall and have a dance and their curiosity in each other the ol' 'loveatfirstsight' thing. But it doesn't really gel as well with the gritty realism and street toughness of the rest of the picture when Tony and TyanHwa give each other sweet nothings How do you say 'I love you in Italian? How do you say it in Chinese? it's some of the corniest material you've never seen. It's not that the actors are bad in their parts the actress playing TyanHwa has some tenderness to her that is nice for the production.But there's some inconsistency with how the story flows sometimes scene to scene. Here and there a memorable moment happens RUN DMC's Walk This Way is the only thing to never get dated for a great dance number and the fighting scenes are well staged and intense. There's a few fascinating supporting or minor roles like James Hong as Gung Tu the head of the Chinese crime family who most wisely wants just peace and quiet between the rivals. And yet there's also some acting and writing that just doesn't work period what for example is David Caruso a redhaired Irish guy doing with a bunch of Italianos in this story good as he might be and the ending while appropriately tragic and wellstaged doesn't fit the rest of the time Ferrara's after.It's as if basically Ferrara decided to make his comment on West Side Story give it some importance in a presenttime setting of 1987 and the littleseen angle of ChinesevsItalian gangs and make it rougher less cheesy than its influences. But really who wants realism when you've got loveatfirstsight? It's an interesting experiment that is a very mixed bag.".

Even 21 years later with cretinous violence infecting suburban multiplexes this film stands out as a complete failure as a depiction of humanity.

	schema:reviewBody "China Girl presents a theme prevalent in cheap 80s action movies  the Chinatown gangs often with showdowns between the Chinese and the Italians via gang wars. You'll see a lot of this with 80s American martial arts movies in particular.China Girl also seems to prevent a tone from director Abel Ferrer which becomes much more evident and much more forceful in his 1996 film The Funeral which is a sadly underrated movie about the perpetration of gang life through three mafioso brothers. The dismaying realities of gang life are expressed here though less sophisticatedly through a Romeo and Juliet gangland story. Though entertaining for the most part aside from much of the repetition throughout the movie you cannot help but remain unconvinced about the tale as one viewer has already commented because of the extreme lack of chemistry between the two main characters. Yes the sex scene does seem ridiculous.Nonetheless the story is about a teenage ItalianAmerican boy who refuses to participate in the turf wars with his relatives against the ChineseAmericans in Chinatown. Like Vincent Gallo's character realizes in 'The Funeral' the young man Tony likewise cannot see the logic in the continuous fighting especially once he has fallen in love with the Chinese gang's sister. Things do tend to get sappy in this movie and aside from the point about senseless gang violence there is not much else going on. The writers go slightly overboard in bogging down the audience with this point that they forgot to put in some filler unless you're one hundred percent entertained by the fight sequences. It is not a bad movie and certainly one of the better movies I have seen by Abel Ferrer 'Fear City' in my opinion was his worst 'The Funeral' was his best. If you're in the mood for 80s action nostalgia it's a good vice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well... I usually refrain from writing movie reviews for the simple fact that most who do tend to write them in a way that denotes total arrogance as if they are Siskel or Ebert or something and that tone alone usually turns my stomach. Who are you movie snobs anyway? So so picky. Anyway I was trying to find Georgie Girl online tonight and although I've got it on DVD I did not feel like getting up and looking for it so I found this movie instead. Now... my love affair with the old NYC goes back to childhood when my father used to be a truck driver and we were regaled with stories about that crazy town and also my own early memories of it. Suffice to say I'm pretty hot over old flicks that present excellent street shots of the old NY so I figured I'd watch it NO idea what to expect. The description made me leery from the start as it already sounded so corny and unoriginal. It's funny cause I was somewhat embarrassed throughout the entire film sensing the kind of crappy reviews people must write about it. Much to my surprise however not only did most more or less deem it a hidden gem it was compared multiple times to Romeo and Juliet? Huh. Honestly that was the last thing I thought. I love movies and judge the pretty fairly based on whether or not I enjoyed them not on how popular they are how much they grossed at the box office special effects or even in comparison to others made by the same person or within the same genre. I don't pretend to be some film connoisseur and use extraordinary language in an attempt to sound more sophisticated like most reviewers do. As for sexual chemistry for those of you who stated there was none I guess that just means you were wanting boobs and for her to be all over him? Uh no. This is about as real as awkward teens who barely known each other as it gets even if we only ever see them dancing together. This main theme is obscured by all the racial tension surrounding them. In fact the first however many minutes of this movie leads one to think that it's only going to be about the gang wars across Canal St. And then back to them oh yeah we forgot it was about you guys. Anyway... What I can say is that this movie was OK. It fills a niche. Lots of overkill in the bloodbath department. I don't know if they realized after all their editing but in the end all they did in this film was kill each other and make sure we saw lots of blood. Did they think this is what their audience wanted more of? I thought the in your face effort was rather obvious. That made me roll my eyes with embarrassment. The other thing I couldn't help but notice was why are all movies about street gangs or otherwise in NYC involving some other group with or all Italian Americans? NYC is a huge. Little Italy never was. America must think NYC is nothing but little isolated and racially segregated neighborhoods when it's really not. NYC is a huge city and despite the old world culture presence in certain sections it's still a very diverse place and people don't shoot each other in public generally for being on someone else's turf. Not in 1987 anyway. They get on the subway with ppl from ALL OVER THE WORLD and live among them. SO now this film is overkill in 1. bloody violence 2. cultural stereotype did I mention the old county mother in the kitchen in an apron in every scene no matter what time of day cooking from scratch like it's 1930? The movie is somewhat one sidedleaning more towards the Italian community. We see very little of the Chinese community and the inner relationships of those characters. Not saying there is racial preference in this film but it shows what perspective the writer is more familiar with. It's taking some liberties and I'm sure the makers of this film would be impressed by comparing this movie to Romeo and Juliet. When you think of A Bronx Tale yet another clich Italian American mafia theme in NYC but in this story an African American chick on the wrong side of the street not much difference there but not so much Romeo and Juliet. All through this film I'm wondering if these two know how to take the damn subway why aren't they just meeting out in any of the other many many places that exist out of this 20 or so block radius in which they live? Duh. Its NYC. None of them have accents so they've been in NYC and American long enough to not be stuck in their own hood. It's so embarrassing! It's very unrealistic for its time considering how much of the downtown was already being infiltrated by yuppies and artists so they were in reality NOT in some ethnic wasteland. In conclusion there's a larger message here in all seriousness or not Neither of the two households at the epicenter of this film seem to have fathers present. In fact the brother and sister have NO parents it seems. How old are they?? He supports them both on his wages as a waiter? Basically if you have no father this is how you will end up. Jk but did anyone else notice this?? This movie was made for some quick cheap thrills and a quick buck. I'm not surprised it did not do well outside of what little I mentioned in some half competent analysis.".

The movie is somewhat one sidedleaning more towards the Italian community. We see very little of the Chinese community and the inner relationships of those characters. Not saying there is racial preference in this film but it shows what perspective the writer is more familiar with. It's taking some liberties and I'm sure the makers of this film would be impressed by comparing this movie to Romeo and Juliet. When you think of A Bronx Tale yet another clich Italian American mafia theme in NYC but in this story an African American chick on the wrong side of the street not much difference there but not so much Romeo and Juliet. All through this film I'm wondering if these two know how to take the damn subway why aren't they just meeting out in any of the other many many places that exist out of this 20 or so block radius in which they live? Duh. Its NYC. None of them have accents so they've been in NYC and American long enough to not be stuck in their own hood. It's so embarrassing! It's very unrealistic for its time considering how much of the downtown was already being infiltrated by yuppies and artists so they were in reality NOT in some ethnic wasteland. In conclusion there's a larger message here in all seriousness or not Neither of the two households at the epicenter of this film seem to have fathers present. In fact the brother and sister have NO parents it seems. How old are they?? He supports them both on his wages as a waiter? Basically if you have no father this is how you will end up. Jk but did anyone else notice this?? This movie was made for some quick cheap thrills and a quick buck. I'm not surprised it did not do well outside of what little I mentioned in some half competent analysis.";

	schema:headline " One of the Better Godzilla Movies I've Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "So I took a break from the world of Godzilla after MECHAGODZILLA II and SPACE GODZILLA disappointed me and the 1954 original which I appreciated for what it was bored me. But I'm a glutton for punishment and I decided to try again and find a Godzilla movie that's more my speed. My next excursion brought me to GODZILLA TOKYO S.O.S. While it has a lot in common with his runin with Space Godzilla I found that I enjoyed it a bit more. I don't know if I'm just getting used to the genre or it the movies just got better as the years went on. I guess TOKYO S.O.S. was the secondtolast of the Toho series films so I guess it's better late than never. Just because the movie's an improvement over the previous installments I've seen that doesn't mean it's any less insane. The movie opens with the arrival of Mothra heralded by his twin space fairies warning Dr. Shinichi Chujo that Mothra demands that Godzilla's remains which had been used in the construction of Mechagodzilla be returned to the sea where they belong. It never really explains why so I just assume Mothra's a stickler for proper burial procedures. Anyway Godzilla awakens I thought he was dead and his bones were in Mechagodzilla? and returns to Tokyo to exact revenge on Mechagodzilla forhaving his bones? Mothra has offered to defend Tokyo in Mechagodzilla's place if the Japanese government comply with his request and he is summoned to battle Godzilla when the beast arrives. Then human characters step aside and we're treated to an hour of Godzilla Mothra and Mechagodzilla going to battle.So the first thing I noticed is that this movie trades in some elements of crazy there are no psychics in this movie for others space fairies and a giant benevolent moth. Let's go ahead and just get this reminder out of the way. I am not a longterm Godzilla fan and only started watching the series when I realized that I was excited to see Gareth Edwards' 2014 reboot and wanted to get some history on the series. I did not watch them in order and I've only seen a handful of them. So I'm sure there are perfectly logical explanations for all of the weirdness I get such a kick out of but I'm more entertained by just assuming it was the writer's love for LSD. For example why is Mothra's offspring born from an egg more resembling that of a bird than any insect? It doesn't matter. He's a space moth with hot twin space fairies that act as his voice to mankind. I'd always wondered why it appeared that Mothra had such a huge fan base and I think I get it. It's probably the most interesting of the monsters I've seen so far. It's not just some mindless beast rampaging through Japan. It's got personality and it's own agenda. It wants Godzilla's remains returned to the sea again for reasons unknown to me and it's willing to become the nation's guardian in exchange for the disassembly of Mechagodzilla.At the start of the movie Mechagodzilla is in a state of disrepair and the government is weighing the option of shutting down the program. If Godzilla's thought to be gone why continue shelling money out to repair their giant robot? While the government gives it consideration Godzilla decides to pop in for some Tokyo stomping and Mothra steps in quickly proving that his offer to protect Japan was worthless. While I actually really liked the human story element here better than I have in any of the other movies TOKYO S.O.S. suffers from the same issue that really bothered me about SPACE GODZILLA. The movie is 90 minutes long and 60 of those minutes is dedicated to the final battle. No joke. I'm sure all the loyal Godzilla fans out there are shrugging and mumbling to themselves Well yeah man. That's what these movies are all about. Well I need more than just 60 solid minutes of monster vs. monster vs. giant robot. Admittedly this battle was way more entertaining than those in both MECHAGODZILLA II and SPACE GODZILLA and the ending was a nice resolution even if I didn't totally follow it. I was unaware that Mechagodzilla has a history of spirit possession but there it went. Anyways my final verdict on GODZILLA TOKYO S.O.S. is that it's a nice improvement over the other Godzilla movies I've seen. Mothra was way cooler than I thought a giant space moth had any right to be. The final battle while still excessive was pretty cool and the visual effects have gotten much better so if I were going to recommend any Godzilla movie to a newbie it would probably be this one.".

There is less screen time for the child actors but the movie is perfectly fine for children. No discernible death just a lot of good clean monster fun...";

What's really cool though is veteran Godzilla actor Hiroshi Koizumi returning as his character Dr. Shinichi Chujo from the original Mothra movie! He has a prominent role here and it's so nice to see an old face from the original series. The music is also a real treat especially the classic Mothra song sung by none other than the twin fairies the Shobijin.Nothing much to say other than this Godzilla film is a blast. With epic action scenes an intriguing story good cast and a surprise creature cameo this is sure to please any fan and beyond so check it out. All hail the King of the Monsters!".

	schema:reviewBody "Godzilla Tokyo SOS is the only film of the Millennium series that is preceded by another film. Picking where Godzilla X Mechagodzilla left off the Japanese Defense Force is in the process of repairing Mechagodzilla after his last outing with Godzilla. Yoshito Chj played by Noboru Kaneko is an mechanic working on Mechagodzilla and was visited by the tiny twin fairies of Mothra the Shobijin. They warned him that the people must return Mechagodzilla to the sea for the dead must not be disturbed Mechagodzilla was created from the bones of the original Godzilla. If the people do not heed to their warnings Mothra will declare war on mankind which I think is a departure from Mothra because she has always been depicted as a benevolent creature. But without Mechagodzilla Japan has no defense against Godzilla.This film provides many references to previous Toho films including bringing back the two character leads from Godzilla X Mechgodzilla containing footage from the previous movies and even bringing back Kameba the gigantic turtle from Yog Monster from Space 1970. Perhaps the most notable mention is the return of Professor Shinichi Chujo played by Hiroshi Koizumi from the original 1961 Mothra movie. Koizumi reprises the role he did 42 years earlier and delivers drama about Mothra's previous attack on Tokyo and referenced photographs from his trip to Infant Island in the original Mothra film.The movie is filled with drama and heroism. The part where Chujo's grandson made the Mothra sign to call her for help was one of my favorite scenes. Michiru shima gave another brilliant music score and Eiichi Asada did an awesome job on the special effects. Mechagodzilla's rockets and Mothra's wing attacks were among my favorite special effects in the film  all contributed to exciting actionpacked monster mayhem. Some downsides to this movie is that as this movie also serves as a sequel to the original Mothra movie Mothra and her larvae were not emphasized enough. Godzilla was also portrayed as very weak  in some of the battle sequences with the robot Godzilla just stands there as if he is letting Mechagodzilla attack him. And Godzilla rarely gets any chance to do some city stomping. As with most films in the Millennium series this movie focuses on the military  an element that gets repetitive. But on another note the cast of characters are likable for the most part and Mothra's design is this film is my favorite of the monster though she is really overused by this time. Grade B".

The White Heron craft and MechaG are nicely made and this version of Mothra seems much better than in other movies like Mothra and Godzilla the battle for earth. The battle is okay but like in Godzilla against Mechagodzilla Godzilla is a bit too immobile and nonreactive. Though he is better here than in that film. That sense of polish is why I rate it a 7 rather than a 5 as apart from it it really is an average Godzilla film unlikely to convert anyone into being a GFan.".

While I rated both Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and this one a 710 I'd actually rate this one a 7.510 if I could. Why? The human side of the movie but more on that later. Just as an FYI if you already didn't know this is the only sequel in the Millennium series. Godzilla vs Megaguirus for example does not acknowledge Godzilla 2000 or any other movies. Same for G2K or GMK etc. Final Wars is a bit more debatable in that they show footage from each of the three series.Characters are much better than in previous film. True the lead character is the same seemingly depressed military member that we've seen for the third time now in the Millennium series but here his life his just plain carried out better and explored more. It feels like less than an excuse to cut away from the monster action.The monsters look good. Godzilla is the same as last year and with the exception of the replacement for MG's Absolute Zero Cannon Mechagodzilla is the same as well. Mothra looks pretty decent although certainly not as good as she did in GMK. Her larvae look better than they ever have with their mouth movements. Action wise these monsters carry themselves very well and their movements aren't always predictable making for an entertaining watch.So as I said I like this even more than GAMG and if I could I'd give it that extra half point in the ratings. I genuinely am saddened when it is first revealed that Mothra is dying yet she fights on. What courage and selflessness. Then she makes the ultimate sacrifice that much more real to the audience when she saves her offspring at the expensive of her own life. The first time you watch it it might just water your eyes a bit. And these emotions are part of the beauty that make it better than GAMG.As a side note some viewers have suggested that the lab scene postcredits indicates that Toho wanted to follow up this series with a third installment as opposed to doing something new like Final Wars. This is not the case but rather a reminder that sometimes we humans just don't learn even after we've seen the effects of our actions.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only sequel in the millennium series Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. is a very impressive Gfilm. I'm conflicted if it surpasses Godzilla vs. Megaguirus although in the end this film has a few flaws that weaken it a bit. Still Mazaaki Tezuka did generally well here and overall the film is fantastic. I've kind of embraced Kiryu as the 'lead' monster although in this film the two's fates are entwined beautifully. The story by Tezuka himself and Masashiro Yokotani is probably one of the best I've seen so far in a Gfilm. Michuru Oshima scores the film and the music is spectacular. Godzilla's theme is back and the climatic piece as Godzilla's is cocooned up is touching to say the least. On one side none of the characters from the previous film appear except for Akane and the government guys. And she only appears briefly. Apparently she wanted to be with someone who didn't need Viagra. All jokes aside if you're a Gfan you're kind of used to this. New characters show up including Hiroshi Koizumi who we haven't seen since 1984 in Return of Godzilla. Chujo Noboru Kaneko is well played and I love how he's clueless to how much Miho Yoshioka's character likes him. The human characters are put in peril here and this was a very well done aspect of the film I must say.Godzilla returns now with a chest scar a nice touch. In this film he isn't tossed around so much and the battles are much more realistic something I for one appreciated. Kiryu looks better than he did last time sparring some very well done new weapons. His 'backpack' is now two individual missile launchers that have a badass new feature....moving on before I spoil it. Mothra looks incredible and this has to be the most realistic version of the giant feminine moth ever. She throws several attacks that are impressive and fans won't be disappointed I'm sure. The Mothra larvae looked spectacular and their webeffect was quite the effect. Kameba or Kameboas although merely a dead turtle his scene is excellent way to display some CG effects. People are not only next to Kameba but on top of him walking around. Great!! The action is nonstop and Godzilla really gets to show his power. The SFX were probably one of the most incredible I have ever seen thanks to Eiichi Asada. The rescue to save Chujo is one amazing feat that you'll be surprised Toho could afford. The only part I didn't like was how Tezuka punked out with the drill scene. If the blow was so painful to actually cripple the Monster King wouldn't blood and flesh be everywhere? It was hard to believe the severity of the wound if all we see is flakes of Godzilla's skin flying. If Kaneko had done that scene MechaG would've pulled out a drill soaked in blood but I can let it go I guess. The only other flaw is the film's run time a mere 90 minutes. This film has twice the monsters but is somehow only two minutes longer. The characters could've used a bit more time to develop and this would've put this film more on the level of Godzilla vs. Megaguirus and GMK. The Shobijin also return and so does that beautiful song as well. I find it does give a little kind of feeling of awe to Mothra and the film itself. The film does deliver some of the best SFX monster fights and good enough drama. I still find this Gfilm one of the best.".

	onyx:emotionText "The only sequel in the millennium series Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. is a very impressive Gfilm. I'm conflicted if it surpasses Godzilla vs. Megaguirus although in the end this film has a few flaws that weaken it a bit. Still Mazaaki Tezuka did generally well here and overall the film is fantastic. I've kind of embraced Kiryu as the 'lead' monster although in this film the two's fates are entwined beautifully. The story by Tezuka himself and Masashiro Yokotani is probably one of the best I've seen so far in a Gfilm. Michuru Oshima scores the film and the music is spectacular. Godzilla's theme is back and the climatic piece as Godzilla's is cocooned up is touching to say the least.

In all the hoopla of the 50th anniversary last years film has quietly slipped under the radar sure we all know it exists but most don't care most only care about Kitamura's oncoming epic and this is SAD! Sad because GMMG is truly an epic Godzilla film an epic that is good enough to be the 50th anniversary film in fact! GMMG truly is Masaaki Tezuka's masterpiece GxM and GxMG were mere warmups for the exciting romp that GMMG is. I've heard many say that GMMG is just a GxMG retread and is about on par with the previous film in the Kiryu saga how unjust how totally unjust... GMMG takes everything from GxMG and improves upon it it is a MUCH better film but with all the improvements GMMG also suffers from the same flaws mainly character development. GMMG doesn't have time to properly build it's characters and many in the supporting cast seem totally useless the leads are all serviceable though and seeing Koizumi again is a real treat I must say! The lack of character development nicely works into the films greatest strength though the action! GMMG is the most action packed G film probably ever and it features possibly Godzilla's greatest battle yes it really is THAT cool. Honestly this film is about 23rds action and yet it never gets boring which is more than we can say for other films coughSpaceGodzillacough. The monsters themselves have rarely looked this impressive either Mothra is a true sight to behold not since the days of Tsuburaya has the kaiju looked this grand. Asada really nailed the effects I couldn't find a single flaw in them. The music is without doubt Oshima's best G score to date and provides unique and memorable motifs for each monster in many ways her Mothra themes outdo Ifukube's!

	schema:headline " Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. 2003 is not in a whole of distress...";
	schema:reviewBody "The MillenniumEra series of Godzilla features  released over a fiveyear period between 1999 and 2004 in Japan  is an interesting film series to say the least. I have been slow in getting to it having grown up on both the ShowaEra 19541975 and HeiseiEra 19841995 Godzilla film series. The first film I ever saw from the Millennium Era was 1999's Godzilla 2000  which as I remarked in another review  was the last film I ever saw at the nowdefunct Cineplex Odeon at my local shopping mall before it closed down forever in early 2000. I was 14 when that movie came out and when the Cineplex Odeon finally closed its doors.Just yesterday I watched Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla 2002. Today I just finished watching its direct 2003 sequel Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. When I remarked how interesting the Millennium Era is I mean that it's interesting in that like the HeiseiEra Godzilla films it completely disregards all the films that came before it  pretending that they never happened  and instead goes right back to Gojira 1954 the gloomy black  white monster flick that started it all. But unlike the Heisei Era each film in the Millennium series is a standalone feature that not only disregards all previous Godzilla features from different eras but each film in the Millennium Era prior to it is also disregarded. So in other words Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla disregarded the three films that preceded it.Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla is the only film to have a sequel which is Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. Tokyo S.O.S. is a better film than its predecessor and also a unique one. Since Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. are standalone features that started 45 years after Gojira  these two films are unique in that they also include a loose continuity of sorts with other nonGodzillarelated Toho kaijueiga Japanese giant monster films namely Mothra 1961 and War of the Gargantuas 1966 for this sequel Mothra is the film most referenced and shares the greatest continuity and it also includes a few references to Godzilla vs. Mothra 1964  the latter film of which has the benefit of being Godzilla's last portrayal as the bad guy in the ShowaEra film series.Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. is set in 2004 one year after Godzilla ravaged Japan but was thwarted by the Japan SelfDefense Forces' JSDF Mechagodzilla a.k.a. Kiryu meaning Machine Dragon in Japanese. Mechagodzilla as you remember was built around the remains of the first Godzilla that was killed in 1954 and shares that longdead monster's genetic memories. Though Mechagodzilla managed to save Japan from Godzilla the monster cyborg was heavily damaged and needed to be repaired.Now the JSDF is pondering whether or not to deploy Mechagodzilla into the field again being that its most powerful weapon the Absolute Zero is damaged beyond repair and without it Mechagodzilla will not be able to defend the country against Godzilla. Japan Air SelfDefense Force JASDF mechanic Yoshito Chujo Noboru Kaneko is on vacation at his uncle's house when he's visited by the Shobijin Masami Nagasawa and Chihiro Ohtsuka the miniature twin fairies who act as guardians for the benevolent insect monstergod Mothra. Chujo's uncle is none other than Dr. Shinichi Chujo the late Hiroshi Koizumi the Japanese linguist who first discovered Mothra and the Shobijin on their native Infant Island and witnessed Mothra's subsequent destructive rampage in Japan 43 years earlier in 1961.The Shobijin have come to warn them that because Mechagodzilla is built around the skeletal remains of the original 1954 Godzilla that this is why Godzilla keeps returning to attack Japan. If Mechagodzilla is returned to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean then Mothra will gladly take its place to guard Japan from Godzilla's attacks. Meanwhile Godzilla surfaces once again to attack Japan and Mothra joins the fray. Pretty soon though the JSDF also realizes that Mothra alone will not be enough and that they have no choice but to deploy Mechagodzilla once again into battle  but the question remains of whether or not the mighty Mechagodzilla will survive another lethal encounter with Godzilla?Maasaki Tezuka returns behind the camera to direct this stellar followup to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. The greatest thing to be said about this feature is to see Hiroshi Koizumi a regular during the Showa Era in numerous Toho kaijueiga reprising a role he first took on over 40 years earlier. As a supporting player to a younger generation of cast members Noboru Kaneko makes for an effective leading performer who is dedicated to his job and knows every inch inside  out of the cyborg creature that he has been charged with maintaining. He also has a close friendship with Kiryu pilot Azusa Kisaragi Miho Yoshioka  having replaced Akane Yashiro Yumiko Shaku from the previous film and who appears here in a brief cameo. I was a little startled to learn that Yumiko Shaku wasn't going to be the lead in this sequel as I did find her replacement in Miho Yoshioka to not be as engaging or sympathetic as she was in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. This was really my only serious disappointment with this flick.Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. has some stellar monster battles a beautiful reappearance of Mothra and an awesome mix of old  new in more ways than one. This was the last film before the allout monster battle royale that was this series' epic closer Godzilla Final Wars 2004.710".

	schema:headline " Maybe even worse than Godzilla vs. Megalon";
	schema:reviewBody "I think there's an idea among some of the more inbred factions of Godzilla fandom that a Godzilla movie that shows Godzilla as a villian which is apparently all they got out of the first movie Gojira is by definition a good movie and any movie that shows The Big G in a more sympathetic light is bad. There's also an unhealthy focus on technical details which are important but which don't make a good movie in and of themselves.The latest entry in this series is badly written badly directed badly acted badly scored one of the worst film scores I've ever heard and even if I liked seeing movies where Godzilla loses in the end I'd think this movie was crap. Of course I hate every Godzilla movie since Godzilla 2000 which ended the way a Godzilla movie should end with Godzilla triumphant over both man and monster alike. But in the end all I ask in the various interpretations is that they be intelligent fun movies with good stories and thrilling fights. This does not qualify. I'm noticing a trend in the last four films that bothers meevery single one glorifies the military. Though the Japanese Self Defense Force's ineffectual assaults on Godzilla have always been part of the fun I'm getting the feeling the latest generation of filmmakers working on Godzilla who never experienced the horrors of being on the losing side of a big war have an unrealistic and glamorized view of the military. They disguise it a bit by having a lot of female soldiers but if I see one more goofy salute as a finishing flourish to a Godzilla film I may barf. Godzilla first came into being as a CONDEMNATION of militarism.About the latest version of the Shobijin or Infant Island Fairies. Aside from the fact that their singing sucks is it really so hard to find twin sisters to play these icons of Kaiju Eiga? These girls weren't even the same HEIGHT!Those who evoke the first few films with their grim and violent version of Godzilla are offtrack. Those movies are nothing like the last four lacking anything close to the emotional depth of the first HIRE GOOD ACTORS!! and the visual style of the next few. Go back to the approaches that workHonda and Okawara. The new guys can't cut it. And the box office receipts prove it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think there's an idea among some of the more inbred factions of Godzilla fandom that a Godzilla movie that shows Godzilla as a villian which is apparently all they got out of the first movie Gojira is by definition a good movie and any movie that shows The Big G in a more sympathetic light is bad. There's also an unhealthy focus on technical details which are important but which don't make a good movie in and of themselves.The latest entry in this series is badly written badly directed badly acted badly scored one of the worst film scores I've ever heard and even if I liked seeing movies where Godzilla loses in the end I'd think this movie was crap. Of course I hate every Godzilla movie since Godzilla 2000 which ended the way a Godzilla movie should end with Godzilla triumphant over both man and monster alike. But in the end all I ask in the various interpretations is that they be intelligent fun movies with good stories and thrilling fights. This does not qualify. I'm noticing a trend in the last four films that bothers meevery single one glorifies the military. Though the Japanese Self Defense Force's ineffectual assaults on Godzilla have always been part of the fun I'm getting the feeling the latest generation of filmmakers working on Godzilla who never experienced the horrors of being on the losing side of a big war have an unrealistic and glamorized view of the military. They disguise it a bit by having a lot of female soldiers but if I see one more goofy salute as a finishing flourish to a Godzilla film I may barf. Godzilla first came into being as a CONDEMNATION of militarism.About the latest version of the Shobijin or Infant Island Fairies. Aside from the fact that their singing sucks is it really so hard to find twin sisters to play these icons of Kaiju Eiga? These girls weren't even the same HEIGHT!Those who evoke the first few films with their grim and violent version of Godzilla are offtrack. Those movies are nothing like the last four lacking anything close to the emotional depth of the first HIRE GOOD ACTORS!! and the visual style of the next few. Go back to the approaches that workHonda and Okawara. The new guys can't cut it. And the box office receipts prove it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Essentially a remake of the first Godzilla vs. Mothra and the Godzilla vs. Megaguirus which has nearly the same kind of main characters. Apparently Toho has been running the recent Godzilla series as an advertisement for toys and collectibles since three films of the last four have been following a very restrictive formula. Not the best of the new series the plot is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't seen the previous film or hasn't watched the average Ultraman episode from the last twenty years. It was nice to see the actor from the first Mothra film and he actually lent some professionalism to the mostly light weight cast. The SFX were excellent at times but Mothra still looks like a plush toy on wires. The Godzilla suit looked very rubbery like the cheap rubber animals you get at the toy store. Part of the problem is the Toho effect crew overlighting the scenes. I first noticed this in GMKAll Out Attack. The day scenes looked fine but anything set at night was overlit. The new Gamera films never had this problem so I attribute it to the Toho SFX style. The first full shot of Mothra in this film is so flat and phony it's like the FX guys were purposely trying to roll their craft back 40 years. In Godzilla vs. Megaguirus the monster scenes were set almost entirely during the day and overall looked pretty good. Another problem was the stiffness of the Godzilla suit. Compare the puppetry in this film to the Godzilla in Megaguirus and you'll see what I mean.All told the film moves at a good clip and if you don't get too serious it's an OK way to spend 90 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "A direct sequel to 2002's Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla this film opens with Mothra's twinfairy familiars appearing at the home of Shinichi Chujo Hiroshi Koizumi last seen in this role in 1961's Mothra with a warning that unless the original Godzilla's remains parts of which are incorporated into MechaGodzilla are released into the ocean Mothra will declare war on mankind alternatively if the mecha is decommissioned Mothra will defend humans against incursions by Godzilla last seen driven off by MechaGodzilla but still alive. When Godzilla reappears in Tokyo Mothra does indeed attack him in her ineffectual way blowing him about with the wind from her wings and suicidally sprinkling him with the scales that she need to stay aloft. At this juncture MechaGodzilla is dropped into the fray. Both of mankind's defenders are defeated but it is revealed Mothra had laid an egg on a nearby island which hatches releasing twin 'caterpillers' who quickly swim to Japan and attack Godzilla. As usual the larval Mothras are more effective than the adult morph biting the tip of Godzilla's tail which he hates and attempting to immobilize him with silk. What follows is the expected pyrotechnics destruction scenes and monsterhuman heroics as attempts are made to resuscitate MechaGodzilla while Godzilla is distracted by the larva and the intrepid pilots of the White Herons. As Godzilla films go this one is pretty good with great special effects both CGI and modelssuitmation and an entertaining story. Since MechaGodzilla was introduced in the previous film and Mothra is involved in this one the usual kaiju pseudoscience is replaced by pseudospirituality which seems inconsistent at times as despite the fairies' warnings both Mothra's larval and adult stages seem willing to accept MechaGodzilla's help in the fight. The deal the fairies make to Chujo would resonate in Japan as the offer is essentially the choice between defending yourself or 'demilitarising' and relying on a powerful ally issues the Japanese have been wrestling with since the end of the Pacific War in 1945. Once again Toho brings back characters from the early kaiju films which adds a nice touch of continuity of the Godzillaverse although collective kaiju amnesia is still at work as previous interventions by Mothra e.g. 1963's Godzilla vs. the Thing or MechaGodzilla e.g. 1975's Terror of MechaGodzilla have been forgotten. The battle scenes the raison d'tre for everything else in the film are very well done especially destruction of Tokyo the collapse of Tokyo Tower is a standout. The Mothra puppet looks much better than the wooly version in 1992's preachy Godzilla vs. Mothra as does the starkaiju and his cybernetic twin. As usual the mecha has to fire off all of its arsenal of cannon missiles masers etc. before activating the weapon that might actually work contributing to the collateral damage but making the movie more visually exciting. All of the standard Godzilla characters are back and the acting is typically melodramatic and overthetop I was watching a subtitled version but the toughguy posturing and heroic sentimentality is unmistakable. The military mobilization scenes just get better and better as the series progresses compare shots of tanks in this film with the wobbly plastic models rolling up to be melted in the '60's films. Tokyo SOS the 28th entry in the franchise doesn't bring much new to the table but is a well done and entertaining monster rumpus although neophytes to the genre might be slightly put off by the newagey spirituality as personified by the tiny and now scantily clad twin fairies. Unlike the preceding film MechaGodzilla's name Kiryu is not used in the subtitles but is spoken by the actors and plot points involving the mecha's 'connection' with Godzilla and its reluctance to fight at times might seem inexplicable to viewers who have not seen the previous film.".

The films starts with a bang as a minicrimewave is depicted in rapidfire succession the scene with the guy mooning the tourists to divert their attention as their possessions are stolen is a classic! until after seven or eight minutes Milian jumps into action. Like most films of Bruno Corbucci there is a serious political element in the film too while it completely satisfies fans who just want an exciting violent action film. And of course Tomas Milian is brilliant creating an antihero as he does so well! who is unlike ANYONE in US cinema. I'm sure there are copies of this sitting in the 99cent rack of video stores so check it out if you want to see what is so good about the 1970s Italian police film genre or why Tomas Milian is one of the great icons of world film. My favorite film of this period w Milian is SWINDLE where he is paired with David Hemmings. If you EVER see that offered or shown on TV don't miss it!".

Like in his other classic Outlaw of Gor Jack shows up early on then goes from bar to bar then reappears one hour and 12 minutes into it to pick up his paycheck.

This is Tomas Milian as quirky cop Inspector Giraldi a strangelydressed dirtylooking freak who keeps a mouse called Serpico and likes to get the bad guys in less violent fashion than his contempories even those played by Milian himself.The film was a huge success in Italy mainly due I guess to Milian's off the wall performance as Giraldi a crook turned cop who is always trying to track down a bad guy called the Baron plus some other guy who keeps leaving message consisting of nothing but 'Up Yours!' on Giraldi's answer machine. Things are played out lightly enough until the Baron accidentally steals five million dollars from a hard case gangster Palance and starts getting his mates killed while the Mafia try and get their money back. This doesn't stop Milian getting it on with the strangely patient Maria Rosaria Ommagio who looks like Kate Bush a robbery victim who doesn't seem to mind going to bed with Milian even though he wears two pairs of socks three jumpers and some nifty red budgie smugglers because of course no Milian film is complete without him at least appearing once in his pants. He also takes her disco dancing which made me burst out laughing at Milian's moves as well as his getup and the hat he wears that has Tomas Milian written on it in red pen.It has a mainly light tone this film but don't think of it as some sort of Eurocrime 'Trinity' film. The film does mainly stick to the grim plots of before just with a much better character up front than the usual stonefaced killing machines. And his mouse wears a little hat at the end!Oh and all Jack Palance did was chew cigarettes and scowl as usual.".

He also takes her disco dancing which made me burst out laughing at Milian's moves as well as his getup and the hat he wears that has Tomas Milian written on it in red pen.It has a mainly light tone this film but don't think of it as some sort of Eurocrime 'Trinity' film. The film does mainly stick to the grim plots of before just with a much better character up front than the usual stonefaced killing machines. And his mouse wears a little hat at the end!Oh and all Jack Palance did was chew cigarettes and scowl as usual.";

Like with spaghetti westerns there were good and not so good efforts this movie belonging to the latter category. Tomas Milian an actor who's made an impression in other movies seems kind of helpless here thanks to the costume department dressing him up like a homeless person and a screenplay that gives him very few opportunities to show some kind of character. Jack Palance is pretty much wasted  he only makes two very brief appearances in the first hour and not much more in the last half hour. But the main problem with the movie is that it feels oh so tired. There are chases punchups and guns fired but it all feels so mechanical. Maybe that's why the musical score plays the same bars of music over and over ad nauseum. Even die hard fans of Eurocult movies would be better off skipping this one.".

He plays Nico 12 cop  12 excon who is dirty literally unshaved and doesn't like to wash he also wears multiple pairs of socks shirts and an ugly assortment of hats. This movie attempts unsuccessfully to capture exploit various elements of successful American movies and themes. The director definitely enjoyed Steve McQueen in the Great Escape the director loves motorcycles  he put them everywhere in the movie. I'm surprised they weren't listed in the credits and Al Pacino in Serpico a poster hangs in Nico's apartment  and he names his white mouse Serpico. Thats where the similarities end. There are so many pointless motorcycle jumps and chase sequences the sequences are accompanied by Italian spaghetti music  one expects some pizza and sausages to fly in during the sequences and fights that one wonders what movie the director is trying to pay homage to. The criminal element in Italy is quite comical. The bad guys who are indistinguishable from the good guys usually surrender willingly once caught. They actually stand there .. and wait patiently while the cops fumble to cuff them. This movie does have a heavy Hollywood power to the credits namely Jack Palance. If you watch this movie you will be saying the same thing  Where the hell is Jack ? Jack is literally in 4 scenes one scene shouldn't count considering it was mostly a stunt driver and Jack in a stationary vehicle throughout the movie and a total screen presence of about 10 minutes. Out of the scenes he is in he is dealt much physical harm from the spray paint mace to the face to the infamous Nico knee to the crotch diplomacy tactic. In the end this movie is more pointless than going to the corner store to get some smokes. If you want to see a good Milian movie check out Companeros. If you want to see a good Jack Palance movie .. ... keep looking. In the end this is a great movie for insomniacs and those returning from a night of debauchery.".

The first half mainly consists of action as Milian battles and chases various criminals on his trusty motorbike while snapping at people in the way that tough Italian cops invariably do. A wealth of cheesy dialogue wellstaged action and a fastmoving plot make it very easy to take and an enjoyable viewing experience. In the second half evil businessman Jack Palance makes his unwelcome appearance. His hoods beat up and kill a man at a snooker hall in a violent confrontation. After this Milian wages war on Palance and hunts him down events culminating in a crosscountry chase by car.Milian here adopts the persona of Al Pacino in SERPICO as a laid back weirdlydressed cop who looks more like a hippie. Milian has posters of Pacino in his bedroom and keeps a pet mouse in his pocket the mouse turns up unexplainedly wearing a hat in the last shot  a cool but weird surprise!. Milian's growling startlingly athletic role is a good one and the genre veteran acquits himself well with it creating a funny likable character. His opposite  the movie's villain  is played by the evergrinning Palance who does his usual thing smokes cigars smiles a lot and just acts kind of sleazy.Highlights include the flatout action ending which really gets the pulse going a neverending scene where Milian chases a gang first up a flight of stairs on his motorbike and then across a roof a fight in a market plus a horrible '70s disco inhabited by a crudelydrawn homosexual and a cameo dancer who proceeds to put his jacket on back to front !?!. Although the plot is simple in the extreme the cops and robbers idea at it's crudest there are lots of characters and situations to make it seem more complicated than it really is the genre staples of beatings gang fights shootouts car chases etc. are all presented in a stylish way. The twee theme music is annoying at first but soon grows on you too. THE COP IN BLUE JEANS is a solid addition to the Italian crime cycle and worthwhile viewing for all actionorientated fans!".

Now when I venture into that part of the city my imagination will see in my minds eye the ghostly beauty of the buildings that once were there and the people who attended it.

Oddly this made it one year late for the 400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage to the new worldwhich it was to commemorate. The WHITE CITY is a name given to the six HUGE white classical buildings that framed the exhibition space.This documentary oddly is narrated by Gene Wilder. Now I am NOT complainingI just didn't expect to hear this actor narrating a PBS documentary! It consists of many photos post cards some VERY grainy film footage and recreations to make it feel as if the viewer has an insight into the event. This fair featured many amazing things for its day. The most noticeable was the extensive use of electricitywith giant arc lights electric fountains and lighting of the various pavilions. It was at the time the biggest world's fair evereven larger than the Paris fair which featured the great wonder the Eiffel Tower.The fair consisted of many things you'd expectlots of exhibits on various new inventions horticultural exhibits pavilions for various nations and other educational items. However since the fair was paid for by the city it had to make money and so many not so educational exhibits were featuredsuch as nude art which shocked the very straightlaced ladies of the day exotic dancers and LOTS of beer! So I guess the fair was to appeal to both the right and left hemispheres of our brains! Despite having very very little film footage it was amazing how the film managed to recreate the fair for the viewer. Wilder described the various exhibition halls by various US states countries and the modern wonders shown in the main exhibition halls. While it seems impossible for the show to adequately portray what was inside the buildings there were a lot of detailed photos and GREAT narration describing the contents and public's reaction to it. As for the less intellectual stuff seen at the Midway this also is given excellent treatment in the showand is a bit shocking in how lowbrow some of this was. And not surprisingly it was the most popular part of the fair! These were the moneymaking parts of the fairand must have been terrifically entertaining. Recreations of Cairo's bazaars included markets dancers including Little Egypt and her belly dancing choreographed knife fights recreations of a harem and camel rides! There also was a resident beauty exhibit of gorgeous ladies from around the globe African villages with topless folks Irish villages Laplanders and Eskimos in native costumes in the SUMMER!! and much much more!All in all this is a terrific film that is much like being magically transported back to the fair. While I really would love to instead see it using my time machine I don't have one...yet. And I'll just have to content myself with watching this exceptionally well made and thoroughly entertaining film. It's amazing how with such a tiny budget they were able to make such a cool documentary.By the way according to Wikipedia in addition to the extensive use of electricity and the introduction of the Ferris Wheel and spray paint the fair also introduced several new products to the worldsuch as Crackerjacks Hershey's Chocolate Juicy Fruit Gum Shredded Wheat Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Cream of Wheat. Who would have known?!".

Despite having very very little film footage it was amazing how the film managed to recreate the fair for the viewer. Wilder described the various exhibition halls by various US states countries and the modern wonders shown in the main exhibition halls. While it seems impossible for the show to adequately portray what was inside the buildings there were a lot of detailed photos and GREAT narration describing the contents and public's reaction to it. As for the less intellectual stuff seen at the Midway this also is given excellent treatment in the showand is a bit shocking in how lowbrow some of this was. And not surprisingly it was the most popular part of the fair! These were the moneymaking parts of the fairand must have been terrifically entertaining. Recreations of Cairo's bazaars included markets dancers including Little Egypt and her belly dancing choreographed knife fights recreations of a harem and camel rides! There also was a resident beauty exhibit of gorgeous ladies from around the globe African villages with topless folks Irish villages Laplanders and Eskimos in native costumes in the SUMMER!! and much much more!All in all this is a terrific film that is much like being magically transported back to the fair. While I really would love to instead see it using my time machine I don't have one...yet. And I'll just have to content myself with watching this exceptionally well made and thoroughly entertaining film. It's amazing how with such a tiny budget they were able to make such a cool documentary.By the way according to Wikipedia in addition to the extensive use of electricity and the introduction of the Ferris Wheel and spray paint the fair also introduced several new products to the worldsuch as Crackerjacks Hershey's Chocolate Juicy Fruit Gum Shredded Wheat Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Cream of Wheat. Who would have known?!";

	schema:reviewBody "Beware of documentaries that value the producer's fantasies more highly than their commitment to accuracy! At least one INTENTIONAL error in this film makes me question the integrity of the entire thing. The liveaction footage of the belly dancer completely misrepresents how the women at the Columbian Exposition would have dressed and danced in 1893. Although the vintage still photos ALL show the dancers wearing blouses with their midriffs and upper arms covered the modernday footage shows the dancer with a completely bare midriff and a horrid enormous navel jewel.For those who care the bra as we know it was invented in 1913 according to patents issued and the jewel in the navel idiocy was invented by Hollywood after the Hayes Code was instituted in the 1930's. So why did the producer force these anachronisms into a documentary about an 1893 event? I am told that the dancer tried to push for wearing historicallycorrect costuming but the producer Mark Bussler insisted on a 1970's James Bond look. If Bussler knowingly insisted on a 1970's look for one of the elements of his documentary about 1893 what other inaccuracies did he knowingly insert into it? He completely destroyed the credibility of this entire project by depicting the dancer with a look that was 80 years out of context.For a historicallyaccurate description of the dancers at the Columbian Exposition don't view this documentary. Instead see the book titled Looking for Little Egypt by Donna Carlton.".

	schema:reviewBody "My interest in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair was stoked by a read through Larson's recent bestseller ' The Devil in the White City' and abetted by a flip through 'The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 A Photographic Piece'. For someone similarly interested this documentary is well worth the time and effort for the more casual audience it might be worth sticking on a channel should you click by I'm not sure it warrants a purchase or rental. Amongst the pros the roughly 2 hour show presents a wealth of imagery of and about the event primarily period photographs and drawings fleshing out Larson's descriptions of the illusory grandeur of the event and grounds the referenced book focuses on architecture and if I recall correctly is limited to 93 images. In other words the value is in the wealth of imagery. My criticisms echo those of others. I found the period material to be interesting but found the inclusions of modern footage of animals and fish and reenactments shot in brilliant bright color to be jarringly disjunctive. I'll state my prejudice I am not a fan of reenactment to begin with and the ones in this production just don't seem to fit. The narration Gene Wilder is adequate but definitely not as captivating as a Mark Steel James Burke or Morgan Freeman. Or come to think of it some of my better teachers. It does appear that this was an attempt to gain a bit of celebrity panache. There are also way to many shots of beer steins. You'll know what I mean if you watch it.A couple of side notes I listened to some of the commentary and was frankly puzzled. I'm not sure that the concept of a commentary isn't a bit redundant in a documentary and the commentary provided here really just provides an alternative or additional narrative about the fair. It is annoyingly unmatched to the images on the screen additional discussion of the Chicago labor riots are on screen as the commentators discussed previous Paris expositions fundraising commemorative stamps are discussed over unrelated images of Wild Bill Hickok and what appears to be a first hand account of a visit to the fair is recited over the reenactment of the mayor's assassination. I visited the 'Art at the Fair' special feature. My options included 'with music' or 'with commentary'selecting the latter revealed that this is where the producer and writer chose to discuss their sources for material in general. I might have thought that the commentary might have dealt with the 'Art at the Fair'. The 'Art at the Fair' special feature provide without commentary an illustration of how the pendulum swings. This feature is shown as rated PG for nudity and violence. The art on general display at the fair included a lot of fully nude and frank statuary and paintings albeit in a classical style. It amused me to contemplate this brazen display requiring a PG warning in 2009 in this age of morbid horror over 916 of a second of breast exposure. In summary the content of this documentary rates something like 4.5 out of 5 with respect to its ability to satisfy my curiosity. The presentation of the material warrants something like a 2 out of 5 for an overall total of 6.5 or 7.".

Thanks to my avid watching of The History Channel Discovery Channel etc. I know what to expect from a well made historical documentary. This movie if it can even be called that simply doesn't compare.The movie consists of period images artwork promotional material maps and many other visual representations of the Colombian Exposition set to period music. The best part about this technique is the clear organization as we travel across the fair grounds from building to building exploring the varied elements that made up the Colombian Exposition. You really get a good idea of what it must have been like to get off at the purpose built train station and walk into the fair grounds. The flaw in this technique is its monotony. After the tenth building one wonders how long till we reach the exit. The narration by Gene Wilder was clearly an attempt by the producers to add some pizazz to the production values. Why else would they put his face so prominently on the cover of the DVD? So... if you are interested in this specific historical event then by all means rent or borrow this DVD. If not save yourself the 2 hours.Cheers!".

Everything about Blast From The Past was superb from the casting of Christopher Walken Sissy Spacek and Dave Foley to the outstanding performances by everyone made this film so enjoyable.I could not find one thing wrong with this film because it was that good. Everything in this film was a breath of fresh air and I'm glad I saw this film. Through this movie it has given me respect for Walken who has become one of my favorite actors in Hollywood.The performances by the cast were real and honest. Also everyone seemed to enjoy each other's company as well as performing in this movie and it showed furthermore it also showed up in the box office and rental receipts as people couldn't get enough of this great comedy.Blast From The Past is a worthwhile comedy that deserves everyone's attention. Two thumbs WAY up.";

	schema:reviewBody "There surely is a lack of originality in movies now. Romantic comedies always seem to have the girl outwit the guy the guy persisting and then they finally get together. That's exactly the case in Blast from the Past except that the guy has been living in a bomb shelter for all of his life. It's a joke that could work for a five minute sketch or it might just flop overall but that's not the case here. It's a simple romantic comedy with a huge twist thrown in which works to the movie's advantage.Adam Brendan Fraser had lived in a fallout shelter for all of his life because his father Christopher Walken thought a nuclear bomb was dropped on the house. 35 years afterwards Adam goes up to bring supplies and meet a girl which he does. Eve Alicia Silverstone is a feisty typical 90's American but since Adam had never met anyone else besides his parents he just accepts it. Soon he falls in love with her hence Adam and Eve but the reverse is not the same. Will he convince her? Only the clich on romantic comedies will tell us!Blast from the Past is surprisingly lightweight romcom. It never goes to take itself seriously which helps keep the mood light which is what it's supposed to be. At times it gets silly including a Benny Hillish chase scene and the obligatory manwhocan'tdrivecardrivescarwildly scene. A scenario like this could easily descend into heartstringplucking land but thankfully stays on the top and over the top. Director Hugh Wilson whose resum includes such movies as the original Police Academy and The First Wives Club can keep a movie that could turn drastically wrong on the right track.Fraser is great. It really seemed like he was brought up in a fallout shelter. His mannerisms were all from the sixties and the way he acted was exactly on key. Silverstone was okay but nowhere near as good as Walken and Sissy Spacek as Adam's parents. They embody their roles as people who have to live in the same space for 35 years. This movie is everything romantic comedies today don't have no crude humor funny lines good acting and a fun story. People could really learn a lesson from watching Blast from the Past.My rating 710Rated PG13 for brief language sex and drug references.".

After all he's been living apart from society his whole life. We have to give him a break.What sets this movie apart is how it doesn't run scared from what if scenarios. For example in lesser hands this might have degenerated into some sappy forgettable comedy. But everyone involved seems to have been on the top of their game. It's like a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fit together flawlessly. This movie doesn't coldly and calculatingly create warmth and charm it simply possesses it...in abundance like a priceless work of art that seems more discovered than created.I have never met anyone who didn't like this movie. I am really surprised the overall rating isn't higher.

A lot of those people had visions of living in an atomic shelter for the next three to four decades perhaps even longer and not being able to see the daylight ever again. Well it may never have happened but this romantic comedy shows us what it must be like.Blast from the Past tells the story of Adam Weber. In the 1960's during the Cuba crisis his parents locked themselves in the bomb shelter which his eccentric father had constructed for just in case. Having been locked for 35 years Adam has never seen anything else but the confined space of the shelter. He has never seen anything of the world and has become a very naive man. Now the doors are unlocked and Adam must venture out into LA to find food and supplies for his family and a nonmutant wife for himself...Romantic comedies can be found in many forms but this sure was one of the more original ones. And I must say that I liked it. The acting for instance is more than OK. I liked Brendan Fraser as the naive Adam and together with Alicia Silverstone he forms a nice couple in this movie. Even though the entire story could have used a little bit more developing overall it looks good and offers some good laughs and plenty of fun for the people who like romantic comedies. I give it a 710 perhaps even a 7.510.".

The plot does follow the romcom clich where dude tries to woo dudette but here the dude was raised all his 35 years in an underground shelter away from the outer world and that just makes the story funnier. Wilson maintains to sustain the movie's lightness as the screenplay is consistent. Silverstone and Fraser make an odd but fun romantic couple. There's the sweet chemistry. Fraser plays his awkward goofy naive persona that we've seen in a few other films but he still manages to be funny and likable and Silverstone is pretty and charming as she ends up delivering a decent performance. Pity we don't see her much these days. Spacek and Walken are cast against type and I have got to say that they provide some of the laugh out loud moments without going over the top. Of course they play Fraser's parents who have been living underground for the last 35 years. What I also liked about 'Blast From the Past' is that its comedy does not rely on crude humour unlike most American comedies today. The film does have its downside as I felt it was moving a little slow in the beginning but the fun that I had from watching it made that a minor flaw.".

When the president of the United States J.F.Kennedy takes to the airwaves to announce an impending clash with the Soviet Union over the missiles in Cuba Calvin figures this is it! He decides to end the party and he and Helen go to their well prepared and stocked bomb shelter. Little does he know but the falling of a military jet in the area triggers the lock system and before they realize it they are trapped in his own invention.Helen gives birth to a boy who she names Adam. The boy is brought up in their bunker and grows up to be a genius on his own right. Adam grows up listening to old Perry Como's records and can speak several foreign languages his parents have taught him. Adam is a well adjusted young man after thirty five years on his own without the prospect of a woman or love. When the locking mechanism finally frees the family they are still reluctant to go into the world something Calvin doesn't want to do but Helen wanting Adam to be happy decides to send him to replenish their dwindling supplies.Of course Adam in the real world appears to be a monster. With his old fashioned clothes his bad haircut he is a sight not to be believed. Being naive and without malice he has no idea how the man he proposes to sell his valuable collection of baseball cards is trying to cheat him. Enter Eve a young woman at the store who tells Adam the mistake he is making. Adam is lucky to have found his own Eve. Adam doesn't take too long to acquire a taste for everything modern as guided by Eve and her gay brother.Hugh Wilson directed this delightful movie with the right touch as everything has a light ironic feeling to everything we see. Written by Bill Kelly the screen play is one of the best things in movies of this genre of the last years.Brendan Fraser who has played these types of naive characters before is appealing as Adam. Christopher Walken took a breather from his usual heavy characters and is a winner as Calvin Webber the genius who was mistaken. Sissy Spacek also seems to be having fun with her Helen. Alicia Silverstone plays Eve the wise street girl from Pasadena who fell in love with Adam.Blast from the Past is a film that shows the talents of Hugh Wilson at his best. It will not disappoint!".

Written by Bill Kelly the screen play is one of the best things in movies of this genre of the last years.Brendan Fraser who has played these types of naive characters before is appealing as Adam. Christopher Walken took a breather from his usual heavy characters and is a winner as Calvin Webber the genius who was mistaken. Sissy Spacek also seems to be having fun with her Helen. Alicia Silverstone plays Eve the wise street girl from Pasadena who fell in love with Adam.Blast from the Past is a film that shows the talents of Hugh Wilson at his best. It will not disappoint!";

	schema:reviewBody "An eccentric couple named the Weber's hide in a shelter due to a huge bomb scare. The shelter is full off supplies that will last them for years. Adam Weber grows up in this sequestered environment for 35 years unable to see the light of day because his dad is scared of the radiation effects. Adam finally gets to venture out into Los Angeles clueless as can be to try to find a wife and not only that but supplies and food for his family. He runs into a conceited woman named Eve Alicia Silverstone who helps him out. Things get complicated when they start falling each other. I'm a total sap and I'm not afraid to admit that. I'm a guy and I don't see the problem with guys being romantics. Even though they can be very predictable and routine I enjoy chick flicks. I've always been into watching the guy get the girl. I do love it when they put a new spin on the romance genre. This one was made in 1999 but I haven't seen many as original and authentic as this one. I smiled like an idiot and laughed my ass off. I actually saw this in a theater back in 99 with my sister. I remember enjoying it then but I didn't have the mental capacity to really appreciate it as much as I do now. It actually is somewhat thoughtprovoking as well. Adam's predicament forces him to enjoy the simple things about life such as the sky the ocean people. Those are things we often take for granted in life and I am one of those people at times. I really enjoyed the sly nods at famous era's such as the 60's 70's and the 90's. The 60's was especially well done with great costumes and sets. Christopher Walken  Sissy Spacek are absolutely wonderful as the parents especially Walken. His character makes Hot Dr. Pepper which I thought was hilarious. Brendan Fraser has his patented quirky charm that always works. I thought he was perfect for the part of Adam likable and amiably odd. Alicia Silverstone is terrific as the snooty chick Fraser falls for. She's a bit whiny at times but her charisma is undeniable. Her chemistry with Fraser is endearing aside from an awkward kissing scene that they have. I suppose this is a needless carp but she's a gorgeous woman and I felt they had way too much makeup on her. Okay. This movie ends like many romantic comedies. The guy gets the girl in the end but it is very ambitious and creative. I loved this movie and I think any fellow romantics should as well. If you're tired of the same old formula give this one a whirl. You won't regret it. 8.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Tremendously underrated film.  I don't understand some of the negative comments but this is a highly entertaining movie.  I can't name the good actors in this because EVERYBODY did a fantastic job even Alicia Silverstone.The plot is pretty simple.  In 1962 at the height of the Cuban Missile crisis a young Southern California couple heads down to their elaborately designed fallout shelter built by the genius yet paranoid husband Christopher Walken.  They had only planned on staying for a few days but at the same time a military jet crashes into their house above.  They mistakenly think the crash is a nuclear bomb explosion so they seal it up and stay down for 35 years.  The wife Sissy Spacek is 9 months pregnant at the time so she has her baby Brendan Fraser in the shelter.After 35 years the father is ready to explore the world to see if it is habitable but just as he's about to get some muchneeded supplies he has a mild heartattack.  They send their son out instead with a long list and 3000 in cash.  He has also expressed being lonely and says he wants to find a wife.The most entertaining and pleasant portion of the story is how a very nice conservative upbringing with absolutely no outside negative influences can stick out like a sore thumb in modern society.  This is also sad to think how low we've sunk.  But still it's extremely refreshing to see a small sparkle of goodness walk around the Los Angeles area creating positive results everywhere he goes.The only problem that I have with it is that it is not 100 believable. Some of the scenes were overlooked in the making that kept reminding you that it wasn't real.  Even though he had never seen some of the electronics he seemed to pick them up a little too fast TV with remote elevator telephone etc.  The first time he EVER saw the ocean or any large body of water in his entire life he made a PERFECT dive into the water?!But the good far outweighs the bad in this one.  I highly recommend this to just about everyone out there.  Younger kids might not quite understand some of it but other than that everyone should enjoy this.".

After 35 years Calvin comes up to find the rundown neighborhood a foreign world. He wants his family to stay underground but Helen insists her boy Adam Brendan Fraser be allowed to see the sky. He's a fish out of water. He's about to be taken advantage of but Eve Vrustikov Alicia Silverstone helps him out. Together they set out to buy supplies for the underground bunker. Troy Dave Foley is her gay roommate and Cliff Nathan Fillion is her jealous ex.The first 30 minutes is not funny enough and it's better to get to the modern day sooner. Fraser is a bit annoying at first but his childlike exuberance slowly wins me over. Silverstone is good as the tough chick who can't find love. They have a nice romcom chemistry. The dance scene is fun and most importantly it slowly dawns on Eve that she's jealous and in love. The movie is a bit too long the start is too slow and not all the intended comedy works. Nevertheless the couple is good enough and it has a sweet light charm.".

He's a fish out of water. He's about to be taken advantage of but Eve Vrustikov Alicia Silverstone helps him out. Together they set out to buy supplies for the underground bunker. Troy Dave Foley is her gay roommate and Cliff Nathan Fillion is her jealous ex.The first 30 minutes is not funny enough and it's better to get to the modern day sooner. Fraser is a bit annoying at first but his childlike exuberance slowly wins me over. Silverstone is good as the tough chick who can't find love. They have a nice romcom chemistry. The dance scene is fun and most importantly it slowly dawns on Eve that she's jealous and in love. The movie is a bit too long the start is too slow and not all the intended comedy works. Nevertheless the couple is good enough and it has a sweet light charm.";

Happily Blast from the Past refrains from portraying its gullible timewarped protagonist as the butt of every prankster's joke. Although he played the same role in Encino Man Brendan Fraser of George of the Jungle and Airheads manages to imbue this farcical but sympathetic naf with an individuality that makes his character memorable. Costarring Alicia Clueless Silverstone Blast from the Past emerges as an offbeat but uneven romantic comedy about an improbable courtship between Eve Rostokov a streetwise California gal and Adam a nave 35year old guy who has spent his entire life in a fallout shelter. Fearing the prospect of a nuclear holocaust during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis Calvin Webber Christopher Walken of The Anderson Tapes and his wife Helen Sissy Spacek of Coal Miner's Daughter seal themselves up in an elaborate subterranean bomb shelter in their backyard and wait for the radioactive contamination to wear off. Thirtyfive years elapse before the Webbers dispatch their intelligent but immature son out to procure supplies and a wife who doesn't glow in the dark.Blast from the Past opens with documentary footage of the Cuban Missile Crisis and then segues to the Webbers' comfortable suburban home where a cocktail party halts when Calvin hears President Kennedy's televised speech. At heart Calvin is a paranoid Commie hater. When JFK warns that Soviet missiles in Cuba are trained on U.S. targets Calvin breaks up the party sends everybody packing and retreats with his pregnant wife into a steel bunker. Mind you Calvin's fallout shelter is no ordinary cement closet but rather an entire house underground with everything Helen and he need to survive for the next 35 years. An eccentric genius in his own right Calvin gave up his job at California Technical when he found that he could make more money as an inventor. Calvin raises fish in breeding tanks rigs up a kinescope so they can watch TV reruns of Jackie Gleason's The Honeymooners and furnishes the shelter with exact duplicates of their home dcor! Once the filmmakers have the Webbers safely underground they cut to a jet fighter streaking across the evening skies. The plane develops sudden problems that force the pilot to eject. Guess where the jet crashes? Smack on top of Calvin's fallout shelter! The failsafe devices react to the heat from the crash as if it were a nuclear explosion and the automatic timelocks confine the Webbers for the duration. When the authorities arrive they assume that the Webbers died in the accident. While the demolition crews clear away the debris Helen gives birth. Calvin and she rear their son with the misguided belief that everything topside has been toasted.Blast from the Past spends about an hour setting up the plot before Brendan Fraser arrives a number of child actors play him as his character ages and his older parents decide that it's time to see what's happened up topside. Indeed a lot has occurred since they plunged into their hole. Although a nuclear holocaust hasn't turned America into a vast wasteland a spiritual holocaust has exerted roughly the same effect. Wilson and Kelly depict America's decline into decadence in an amusing subplot that charts the rise and fall of a malt shop built on the site of the Webbers' bomb shelter. As the years march past the malt shop turns into a lowlife bar and eventually degenerates into a hovel for the homeless. Calvin wants nothing to do with this bizarre new world. Along the way Adam collides with Eve and she helps him round up his supplies for his mom.Director Hugh Wilson has made a charming social comedy that aspires to be far more than funny. The filmmakers have blended elements of the venerable Rip Van Winkle story and added a touch of scifi writer Robert Sheckley to the mix. The culture clash between the 1960s and the 1990s provides most of the comedy with Adam's wellbehaved polite demeanor juxtaposed against Eve's hardshell cynicism.The comedy is spontaneous with Adam meeting his first female AfricanAmerican mail carrier Oh my star a negro! to staring wondrously at the sky the ocean and the bikiniclad babes on TV who anoint themselves with coconut oil. Never has Adam seen such awesome sights. If the world is one big surprise for Adam Eve Alicia Silverstone finds him just as surprising. When she explains that her roommate Troy Dave Foley is gay Adam thinks mistakenly that Troy is happygolucky rather than homosexual. Blast from the Past never explains why Troy resides with Eve or what impact their living arrangement had on Eve's previous boyfriend.The quirky content of Blast from the Past separates it from the standard Hollywood product. Our twentieth century obsession with law  order compels filmmakers to include cops in virtually every movie. Foreigners must think that America is a police state. The ubiquitous police never appear in Blast from the Past. A movie about modernday life that doesn't use cops as a plot device is worth watching for that reason alone. Moreover gratuitous sex obligatory violence and slimy alien creatures never complicate the plot. Indeed Blast creates a universe of values and beliefs that most movies either ignore or remove because such philosophical concepts would hinder the action. Blast might have been funnier had it not been so preoccupied with such a concrete system of values.Improbable as it is Blast from the Past is nevertheless an entertaining comedy with much to say about the questionable shifts in American culture. The comedy is brisk the dialogue is colorful but the story occasionally bogs down when the characters get a little too preachy.".

Everything about this film was likeable and it is far from teenybopper material.Alicia Silverstone plays Eve a cynical LA girl tired of 90s men and their inconsiderate selfish ways. Brendan Fraser is Adam a 35yearold who's spent his entire life living in a nuclear bomb shelter after his paranoid parents played by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek mistook a 1962 plane crash for the start of World War III. Cocooned in a cosy world of cheesy 50s sitcoms and endless Perry Como Adam is understandably frustrated and so jumps at the chance to get out and resupply the shelter.Almost immediately he meets Eve and from then on the comedy is meant to flow from the clash between her streetsmart twentysomething and Adam's impeccablymannered oldschool gent.The performances in Blast from the Past shine Silverstone providing a performance that overlaps anything she has ever done Fraser also gets the bestofhiscareer' nod. But Spacek and Walken succeed the most as Adam's oddball parents their performances are sparkling and watchable. The script is very original lots of the jokes are knockyoursocksoff funny. But there are many trashy things about this film it becomes a little unimaginative and silly towards the end and it is a touch too predictable but I still liked this film a lot.Blast from the Past is a thoroughly winning film I recommend it for all you people who want to have a good time on a Tuesday night.I rate Blast from the Past 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie plays a lot like FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. So close in fact that you might think it was just a cashin but this film was shot in 2000 and sat on the shelf for years before finally finding distribution. While intermittently funny the film feels like a mess with many disconnected scenes and so much partying that it makes you wonder where the filmmakers' priorities were while shooting this.We get some interesting cameos in the form of Chrisopher Walken Robert Wagner Morgan Fairchild and Rutger Hauer but they're not in the film very much and aren't really on their Agame. This is particularly in the case of Hauer who appears stoned or drunk out of his mind during the duration of the shoot. Walken and Wagner go largely wasted especially a funny gag opportunity they missed. The two could have gotten in a fight on a boat accidentally pushed a girl into the water who drowns and then look at each other and yell oh no not again!. No such luck.Technically the film feels a bit uneven with some occasional poor cinematography followed by some great work. It makes me wonder if two different crews shot this thing. Many jokes fall totally flat but a running gag in which the two leads keep getting mistaken for a gay couple works surprisingly well particularly during the scene in which someone overhears their conversation about scuba gear through a doorway. Fairchild gets in a quick shower scene in one of the highlights of the film.The main showpiece of the film in which several people drink a spiked beverage goes sadly wasted and doesn't really affect anything later on. Things drag and get repetitive but still consider yourself lucky finding this extreme rarity.".

Even so there is some charm in Alex's meetings the disjunction between an apparent tramp and the generally wellheeled lives he encounters.In many ways Alex is a Benjaminian flaneur absolved from social expectations after his responsibilities marital and work are lifted he is free in a way most citizens are not to negotiate a vast sprawling increasingly faceless metropolis to connect seemingly different people and classes to trawl through the unnoticed detritus rubbish bins sewers etc that are in fact the lifeblood of any city.

Many lonely lives pass like this and Serrault the main reason for watching this film suggests the melancholy behind his comic facility. This increasing alienation from one's society one's self even is figured in the doubledetective plot.  The figure of the fictional detective actually arose as a result of urbanisation a reassuring figure who could map out and control the evergrowing frightening city.

This movie is strictly Russian and thats why people did'n like it. In my opinion this movie shows the real greatness of this wonderful director Andrey Zvyagintsev. He could continue making global movies for the world. like Irritu or for the end of it like LvT but he is a Russian and he made film about the moral situation in Russia.In 2009 Zvyagintsev was offered 8 million  from producer Oliver Dungey to make a film for the end of the world like The Sacrifice1986 .I guess that LvT took the money and did Melancholia.Instead Zvyagintsev did Elena and this is the end of the world for him the end of the world as we know it as Charles Foster Kane is saying.Elena' is the end of the moral world as we know it at least for Zvyagintsev.This film is about existential values no other values exist in postcommunist pseudoreligious Russia.There are only TV values.We can only hear the TV preachings throughout the movie and actually see the screen just at the end when the family stays at the apartment of the killed man.So what happens A rich man is killed by his wife who is a former nurse because he do not to put her in his will and the family of her unemployed son with three kids will stay without support.The last will be first. says Elena just before to kill in cold blood his husband. The mother will do everything for her child and grandchildren. Love is evillike Zizek says.In the name of love millions of people has been killed.The love towards one is hatred towards somebody else.The main principle in universe is scarcity Sartr says.There isn't enough love nor yet enough money for everyone.So what we people do? We kill.We kill for moneywe kill for love ...we kill for oil! A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up. like they say in the Bible. This movie is a mixture of The Shop on Main Street1965 Crimes and Misdemeanors1989 Uzak 2002 and Cargo 200 2007 so before to judge Elena please watch these movies first.I think that Elenait is a real 21st century film.It is film about The banality of evil. Evil which is part of us all the evil of everyday life. It is an open question of the moral values of the contemporary society. The question is coming from Russia and from all the former communist countries  How to live now when the evil empire of communism is dead. Where is the moral superiority of the capitalism? In the world with TV Religion is it OK to kill an old and ill man and to take the money in the name of children? GREAT GREAT FILM.THANK YOU ZVYAGINTSEV.".

The question is coming from Russia and from all the former communist countries  How to live now when the evil empire of communism is dead. Where is the moral superiority of the capitalism? In the world with TV Religion is it OK to kill an old and ill man and to take the money in the name of children? GREAT GREAT FILM.THANK YOU ZVYAGINTSEV.";

I only found out later that the movie indeed had been directed by the same director Andrei Zvyagintsev. So he obviously is a person with a very strong and distinctive style but yet I wasn't as intrigued with this movie as I was was with Vozvrashchenie.It's a movie that shows how one event can change everything in a family. That is good all but it's not exactly something that has never been done in any movie before. I did wish that the movie would had done some more interesting stuff at times with its story and characters but it instead makes the choice to be a simplistic and straightforward as possible which adds to the realism perhaps but not to the originality and it doesn't make this the most interesting or effective genre example either.The movie definitely takes the time to setup things but it feels a bit pointless at times. Really the movie too often is showing you absolutely nothing and some sequences are needlessly long. The movie wants you to fill in things for yourself mostly and doesn't just lay out everything. It's the reason why the movie also often has no dialog at all in it. The first part and the final part of the movie is like this. It seemed like things were developing and starting to get interesting in the middle but it doesn't ever push through.Still I can't be very negative toward this movie. It's obviously a superior made movie that is beautiful looking as well with its cinematography that helps to set up a nice mood for the movie. Also nothing wrong with its storytelling.

Zyagintsev has an amazing way of producing a constant tension even when the most mundane acts of daily living are being carried out.Nadezhna Markina is pitch perfect as Elena a retired nurse who is now married to the wealthy Vladimirsuperbly portrayed by Andrey Smirnov. They live in a beautiful apartment is Moscow. Although they are only married two years their relationship apparently began ten years before when Elena was Vladimir's nurse in the hospital.However Elena's son Sergei his wife Tanya their older son Sasha and a baby boy live on the other side of the tracks in a run down area. Each month against Vlkadimir's wishes Elena collects her pension and takes a train and a bus to visit her family and give them money to help support them. Vladimir thinks that Sergei is an idler and is also not happy that Sergei has not returned a loan from three years back.Elena has asked her husband to help her grandson Sasha bribe his way into a university so that he doesn't have to serve in the Army. When Vladimir expresses his reluctance Elena points out that he has no qualms about supporting his daughter who is bitter ungrateful and irresponsible. This of course causes all kinds of friction between Vladimir and Elena although overall they seem to have a loving relationship.One day Vladimir suffers a heart attack while swimming in the gym. He is eventually released and starts recovering at home with Elena acting as his nurse.He tells her that he's meeting with his attorney the following day to draw up a will. He will leave the bulk of his estate to his daughter but that Elena will receive a generous monthly annuity. He also tells her that he's made a final decision and will not help her grandson financially.This sets off a series of events which if I disclosed would be complete spoilers. Let's just say the events take a dark turn and Zyagintsev handles it masterfully. I was riveted to the screen. With the powerful musical score in the background the tension in the final parts of the film is maintained extremely well.I would highly recommend this movie to those that enjoy foreign dramas with a cohesive and strong storyline.".

	schema:headline " Nearing perfection a masterful depiction of a universal trait";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most perfect round films I have seen in many years. Nothing is out of place every scene has a deep meaning in the plot. And the overall result is nearly perfect with a clearcut conclusion.Many have understood this film as a criticismdescription of current Russian society. And they are not mistaken at all it is true. But there is more to it much more a universal trait one that I have never seen depicted previously on film with such precision and cleverness. The central topic of the film can be enunciated by the saying Blood is thicker than water. Some previous reviewers have aptly pointed out this too.The plot is entirely constructed to come to this final conclusion. In the meantime we are also shown aspects of current Russian society such as violence and lack of values in adolescents strained family relations between the old and new Russian generations with marked differences in life values the lavish but often solitary life of old men who have amassed large amounts of money...But the central point is the relation of Elena with on the one hand her aged affluent husband who provides her with a very comfortable life that most women her age would be delighted and satisfied with and on the other hand with her son and son's family from a previous marriage her real family in terms of blood ties. Her son is an absolute opposite to her husband mediocrity vs. intelligence weak character vs. determination and strength idleness vs. diligence failure vs. success poverty vs. richness. One can easily come to the conclusion that her son fully deserves the misery he and his family live in. Elena helps her son and daughterinlaw on her husband's resources but when he says enough!... conflict ensues and here is when blood imposes its biological determining force.The final scene of the film with the little grandson of Elena lying carelessly and comfortably on her husband's bed is at once tender and haunting! one of the best ends I've ever seen in cinema. Now join the opening scene with the final one and you close the circle the whole film is contained there.Don't miss it this is a film you will not forget. It will become a classic for me it is one of them already. The best Zvyagintsev's film so far The Return and Leviathan being both highly recommended too.".

And the overall result is nearly perfect with a clearcut conclusion.Many have understood this film as a criticismdescription of current Russian society. And they are not mistaken at all it is true. But there is more to it much more a universal trait one that I have never seen depicted previously on film with such precision and cleverness. The central topic of the film can be enunciated by the saying Blood is thicker than water. Some previous reviewers have aptly pointed out this too.The plot is entirely constructed to come to this final conclusion. In the meantime we are also shown aspects of current Russian society such as violence and lack of values in adolescents strained family relations between the old and new Russian generations with marked differences in life values the lavish but often solitary life of old men who have amassed large amounts of money...But the central point is the relation of Elena with on the one hand her aged affluent husband who provides her with a very comfortable life that most women her age would be delighted and satisfied with and on the other hand with her son and son's family from a previous marriage her real family in terms of blood ties. Her son is an absolute opposite to her husband mediocrity vs. intelligence weak character vs. determination and strength idleness vs. diligence failure vs. success poverty vs. richness. One can easily come to the conclusion that her son fully deserves the misery he and his family live in. Elena helps her son and daughterinlaw on her husband's resources but when he says enough!... conflict ensues and here is when blood imposes its biological determining force.The final scene of the film with the little grandson of Elena lying carelessly and comfortably on her husband's bed is at once tender and haunting! one of the best ends I've ever seen in cinema. Now join the opening scene with the final one and you close the circle the whole film is contained there.Don't miss it this is a film you will not forget. It will become a classic for me it is one of them already. The best Zvyagintsev's film so far The Return and Leviathan being both highly recommended too.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched six episodes of The Borgias Season 1 in as many days and decided that I needed a break so I turned patriotic and went to the nearest cineplex to watch Elena. Not a good idea although I returned to The Borgias happier than I had left them  Episode 7 looked like a light comedy compared to Elena.The best part of the film was the acting by Andrey Smirnov Vladimir and Nadezhda Markina Elena. Actors who play their children are also very talented. The director uses long shots without single edit quite liberally and it creates almost unbearable suspense.I would recommend this film to anyone who can stomach watching slowmoving horror. It is a scandal that the Russian National Academy of Motion Picture Arts did not nominate Elena for Oscar. The film is brilliant although it does not provide a good respite for watching The Borgias.".

	schema:reviewBody "As one of the most talented directors in modern cinema Andrei zvyagintsev was known for his critically acclaimed debut the return which won as many as 20 awards at major film festivals. Many have viewed his second film the banishment as a letdown given the unusually high standard set by his first film. So many fans of Andrei Zvyaginitsev including myself eagerly waited for his third film elena to come out to see whether this young talented director can overcome his sophomore jinx. Compared to the return in which every second is engaging and serves a purpose elena doesn't quite have the riveting power of the former. I can't pinpoint why but a few minutes into the movie my emotion remains unprovoked and numbed. The long still shots of the interior of the bourgeois house in the city center did not quite convey the sense of alienation that the director intended. As one critic comment it feels rather claustrophobic. It wasn't until 30 minutes into the movie the first meaningful engaging scene appears when the couple starts arguing at the breakfast table about the future of the woman's son. Of course we have to give credit to the director for not making this film into a superficial family drama and for extending into the social and political context where the portrayal of the stark contrast between the woman's son's dingy rundown apartment in the shady suburb and the rich man's luxurious condo begs some deep questions. But it seems to me that the director tried to take on too many important issues and lost his focus. The identity and the background of the man's pretty daughter are not adequately explained. Again one problem of this film seems to mirror that of the banishment. It suffers from being excessively mysterious and lack of explanation. As usual the cinematography of this film is beautiful as his previous films. One shot that is particularly striking is the long shot of the industrial complex under the sunset near the end of film. It is an absolutely beautiful and powerful image. And the subsequent scene where a blackout occurred and the handheld camera follows a group of violent Russian youth gangs including the woman's own son in darkness dimly lit by the distant bonfire is incredibly authentic and powerful. This reminded me of the beginning of the banishment this is where I think the director excels at being able to immediately establish a mood with a few simple sequences. Overall the film elena shows flashes of brilliance that resemble the director's debut the return but ultimately it suffers from inadequately developed characters lack of coherence of scenes and a failure to integrate the different themes it tries to convey.".

Apart from the wonderful cinematography sound and pace the story was a powerful piece of social realism but also an allegory of old and new Russia  not just postSoviet Russia portrayed as displaying the class divisions between the wealthy bourgeoisie and the downcast proletariat the similarities in modern Russia to the deprivations and petty crime of western capitalism and the unthinking privileged status of the wealthy.Partly because of the slow pace and the doomladen symbolism the elderly man in his elegant home with his servile wife at the outset I felt a sense of Chekhov. Maybe it was the theme of property and family of age and inheritance of a new generation growing up but I would be interested to know if the director deliberately referenced prerevolutionary Russia in his film.The pace enabled the audience to absorb the intense sound that characterised this film as much as the wonderful camera work. Not only the hypnotic music by Philip Glass but the repeated brief sharp cawings of an uncannily loud rook the sounds of domestic work a door slamming curtains being gently opened... All this built up a great feeling of suspense almost nailbiting as we were forced to wait for the outcome of Elena's actions as their consequences yawned in front of us.The new Russia is clearly reduced to people down on their luck driven to crime yet strengthened by family solidarity. The workingclass family may be sometimes feckless but there is love among them and the mother's steely determination to ensure a brighter future for her grandson makes her actions seem not unjustified in the face of an arrogant husband who treats her as a skivvy and despises her own children and grandchildren. Even though he discovers that he loves his own daughter their feelings for each other seem to be based on a shared amorality and lack of concern for others.There is also a dark ironic and occasionally surreal humour underlying the apparently bleak tone  not just the Viagra but the woman who keeps getting pregnant the train delayed by a horse the Poeesque crow ...I have not had the chance to see much Russian cinema but this film has whetted my appetite and I shall be looking out for more especially by this great filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're soon approaching the end of 2012. What a fabulous year for films ey? Whilst I'm holding off completing my 'Top Movies of 2012 until Christmas time I'm rapidly trying to cram in all of those movies I've been desperate to see this year but for some silly reason or another have failed to get around to. Elena is such a film. The third feature from Russian modern master Andrey Zvyagintsev The Return The Banishment it's a frosty portentous and oddly beautiful depiction of conflict between contemporary Moscow's bourgeoisie and the humble underclass.Nadezhda Markina plays the title character Elena a sixtysomething former state nurse turned docile housewife to the wealthy Russian aristocrat Vladimir Andrey Smirnov. They met late in life when Elena was once caring for Vladimir in a hospital bed and started up an unlikely kinship. Whether it was a bond formed out of compromise or compassion is unsure but now ten years on their stale loveless marriage is nothing more than a formality.Elena spends her days travelling by tram train and bus to to visit her unemployed son from a previous marriage Sergei Andrei Smirnov. Living in the Projects and overlooking a disused power plant from the old communist days he depends on his mother to support his family and gets supplements from her pension money and sly payments from Vladimir's estate.Vladimir's relationship with his daughter Katya is initially far more hostile but just as parasitic. Begrudgingly labelling her as a hedonist the concerned father has cut off any contact with Katya happy to transfer monthly payments into her bank account but not willing to start up a paternal bond. After a heart attack puts Vladimir in hospital Elena hatches a despicable plan to give her grandson enough money to put him through university a prevention from the harsh life in the Russian underclass.With deliberately slow pacing long takes and a muted quasiapocalyptic colour palette when it featured at Cannes this year comparisons with prodigious Russian auteur were aplenty. But aside from these niggling aspects Zvyagintsev is working within his own socialrealism vein taking the conventions of melodrama and reconfiguring them into an abstemious framework. He manages to present a quintessentially Russian cultural divide but make it universally engaging and cinematic through some incredible performers across the board. Markina is astonishing in the lead. A taciturn character she uses expression and lost glances to perfectly encapsulate the neglected wifeturnedcarer who is on the brink of depression and mania.The finest moment of the entire movie doesn't even include our leading lady. Sitting in a private hospital bed Vladimir's first and only encounter with daughter Katya is unnerving yet deeply poignant. Making up for lost time they share awkward short exchanges at first before the emotions soon come flooding to the surface and the pair are sharing smiles and tears of joy unbeknownst to them for the last time.The glacial cinematography from Mikhail Krichman along with a pitchperfect score from New York's Philip Glass make Elena a film of remarkable modest beauty. Give it a few years to mature and we'll soon be heralding it as a modern masterpiece of some new European cinema movement. What movement? That's up for talented director Andrey Zvyagintsev to decide.Read more reviews at httpwww.366movies.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I find Elena to be a masterpiece and am a bit taken aback that it's not in wider distribution in the U.S. It has aspects of film noir psychological thrillers and tales of city life ...yet it can't be pigeonholed into any of these genres.The one obvious difference with U.S. styles and the one that may doom Elena to niche audiences is the lack of any resolution or even a clear ending. That alone may make it arthouse rather than mainstream.There are plenty of very long slow takes many of them medium distance. The camera tracks dollies and becomes handheld as necessary and there are long shots and even a few closeups but the long slow medium shots predominate. I was reminded very much of The Return. Once again some things are never explained for example the arithmetic suggests an 8year affair before marriage yet the couple sleep in separate beds. In one sense shots are of mundane things but in another sense they're a bit unusual and visually exquisite. The style is somewhat reminiscent of Tarkovsky but a little more ordinary and less mystical.The characters' psychology which is key is shown through their interactions with their surroundings and with other people rather than through closeups of faces. Whenever sophisticated very complex feelings are portrayed through dialog fortunately the subtitles keep up and allow the viewer to get into what's really going on. For example the dialog where the father and his estranged daughter bond over their shared badness sounds unrealistically harebrained but is quite believable when you see and read it.Especially with the sound track quite a bit of the music is by Philip Glass there's a slight sense of foreboding or suspense throughout. However the tiny bit of actual violence that does occur comes at a completely unexpected time and at first doesn't even seem related to the main story line. The film plays with even makes a joke of the conventions of film noir. For example when a character feels guilty about the crime the lights literally go dark because of an electric power shutoff.I found the Russian setting comfortably familiar more familiar to my U.S. eyes than many European movie settings. Some things a different brand of single serving coffee maker a seethrough electric hot water pot were a little different but many things were similar. At one point Elena takes a thick book down from the top shelf and opens it and I saw lots of Cyrillic characters and no subtitles and thought uhoh I'm going to get lost here. But it quickly became clear the book was the Russian version of the PDR Physicians Desktop Reference the book that describes all current drugs and their side effects and interactions in great detail. Even a drug box contained a sheet of fine print with detailed information about the drug virtually identical to what I've seen here.The themes are very modern and very apropos to the U.S. Very large disparities of wealth are shown even within one family. The wealthy apartment is even nicer than anything I've seen here with all the cupboard doors and even the refrigerator door and dishwasher door painted to look like matching roughcut slabs of a big log. Quite a bit of selfdestructive behavior is shown ...but it's not clear there's really any opportunity for different behaviors anyway. Money is king both in the sense of some individuals being greedy one can almost sense Ebenezer Scrooge in the background and in the sense that family money makes such a big difference in the environment it's a major determinant of the children's' personalities. One gets the obvious sense some juvenile delinquent behavior would never have occurred if the opportunities in the wealthy neighborhood had been offered. Money can even buy one's way out of the military and into college even without good grades. Many of the younger generation are to some extent excluded from society and the economy in fact a few are excluded completely not just to some extent. And society often just doesn't have a place for the next generation one can't imagine some of these characters giving their place to their children.The camera's insistent emphasis on a photo of what seems to be the younger Elena looking eager to experience the world back then underlines the vast difference with how things have turned out for her and thus the point that the society is just plain dysfunctional.".

Quite a bit of selfdestructive behavior is shown ...but it's not clear there's really any opportunity for different behaviors anyway. Money is king both in the sense of some individuals being greedy one can almost sense Ebenezer Scrooge in the background and in the sense that family money makes such a big difference in the environment it's a major determinant of the children's' personalities. One gets the obvious sense some juvenile delinquent behavior would never have occurred if the opportunities in the wealthy neighborhood had been offered. Money can even buy one's way out of the military and into college even without good grades. Many of the younger generation are to some extent excluded from society and the economy in fact a few are excluded completely not just to some extent. And society often just doesn't have a place for the next generation one can't imagine some of these characters giving their place to their children.The camera's insistent emphasis on a photo of what seems to be the younger Elena looking eager to experience the world back then underlines the vast difference with how things have turned out for her and thus the point that the society is just plain dysfunctional.";

His relationship with Elena becomes severely strained by his reluctance to help Sergei or his delinquent teenage son who'll be forced to enter the army unless he can get into a college.

I've been waiting forever to see something else by him. This is a huge disappointment though. A very beautiful one but still. It's very thin. Elena is a middleaged woman married to an older man. She apparently stole him from his first wife though their history isn't gone into deeply enough to know for sure. Elena wants him to lend money to her son and his family who are having financial difficulties. Before he makes a decision about that he has a non fatal heart attack. During his hospital stay he reconnects with his estranged daughter from his first marriage. This strengthens his resolve not to help his stepson which leads Elena to make a drastic decision. This film just takes forever with the setup before it gets to any interesting plot development. The characters are mostly unlikeable and mostly twodimensional. Even the lead Elena is fairly uncomplex. Actress Nadezhda Markina does well with her one big scene but that's about it. Elena Lyadova who plays Elena's stepdaughter has a couple of good moments too but she's not in the film enough to make an impression. There's one killer sequence that reminds one of the brilliance of The Return but it feels like it's from a different movie it applies to the main plot only metaphorically. All in all this is a pretty but empty picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Zvyagintsev's first film 'The Return' but have to admit I much preferred this his third film finding it more accessible but still a subtle piece of work.I viewed the film as a comment on contemporary Russia a character study portrait of a morganatic marriage as well as a wider comment on society  the dark side of both the workingupper moneyed classes.At the beginning of the film Elena has already made an accommodation and personal sacrifice in her marriagerelationship with an older richer man Vladimir where she is nothing more than a glorified drudge. She appears a docile a dutiful wife and mother her caring nature exploited by a feckless son and then subject to the caprices of her husband who calls the economic shots but as the film unfolds she becomes far a more complex figure and we view her  her acts with ambivalence and more with an element of sympathy than horror.This is a film where lines reverberate or provide an ironic comment on the story. For instance feckless Sergei gets distracted playing a computer game with his son Sasha as he tries to help him 'get to the next level' a comment you feel more about how to get on in Russian society and perhaps not just Russia but beyond too. The contrasts are slowly built up scene by scene the luxurious spacious flat with a giant modern flat screen TV in contrast to the cramped flat lying on the fringes in the shadow of a disused power station a metaphor for the powerless underclass left behind by postcommunist Russia Elena has to travel by foot  public transport whilst Vladimir travels to his exclusive gym in a luxurious car and the contrast between the 'dowdy' Elena and stylish Katya.The entry of Vladimir's daughter Katya changes the dynamic of the film and provides a fascinating counterpoint to Elena. It is almost as if two different Russias one modern cold  cynical meets its older more traditional counterpart with the younger  older woman barely lacking anything in common. Or so we think on first impression. Katya is a spoilt hedonist existential in attitudes such as a lack in interest in motherhood and continuing 'the disease'. She connects intellectually with her father in a way that he never does with his social inferiorElena and this is because as one perceptive reviewer pointed out both share a similar sense of detachment and lack of feeling for others. Again Katya utters a line which acquires significance as the film unfolds. During a moment of reconciliation with her father a man she doesn't give a damn for Katya remembers the childhood games that 'taught her the harsh realities about being an adult'.But it is Elena who must learn the dark lesson about what she must do to survive the game 'the last will be first'  the law of selfpreservation and how good people are sometimes forced to do bad things to survive  damn themselves  contrast the scene in the church lighting a candle with the flaming basket spouting hellfire as Elena burns her husband's draft will  in order to protect their loved ones in an unequal society.I'm not sure about viewing the film as a condemnation of the Russian male  the lack of a good male role model. What about Putin? isn't he an alpha male who rules the country in a 21st century manner but a continuation of a one thousand years of authoritarian rule albeit now in the media age of TV shows providing indepth reviews on sausages contrast with the sale of reading matter on the train the Russians are known as a nation of voracious readers. And Katerina in her own way is just as feckless as her male working class parallel Sergei. Both drink are indifferent towards their parents  selfish. No I see the film as about how Russia has lost its moral compass with Ukraine now in the role as Elena with VladimirPutin supplying cash  oil if the Ukraine obliges for an occasional bit of rumpy pumpy.If the people at the top are corrupt and Vladimir 'uses' Elena sexually so then must those at the bottom if they are to survive. A bleak message but an honest one. What was that old Marx said about religion being 'the opium of the people'? It's misquoted because Marx did not disapprove of the religious impulse because he saw it as 'the sigh of the oppressed creature in a heartless world.' And that's what Elena has to become heartless to survive because you have to live on this earth.".

People that for money are able to do everything no this film is nothing is empty. So this is a bad film? Yes it is anyway the photo direction is very good as previous films. But this is a film that irritate that is just made without respect of people watching it with music that try to force your feeling. But what feeling? Nothing just empty. After there are some scenes of films without meaning. When light go away and he ask if they have candle. And wife answer why we should have? I think this has some meaning but just for the director.";

It's a brilliant slapstick parody of the spyprivate eye genres with the Baadshah of Bollywood himself Shahrukh Khan hamming it up gloriously as a slightly dimwitted private detective who is innocently drawn into a conspiracy to assassinate the prime minister of India. The hilariously complex plot of mistaken identities and spycounter spy is so twisted it took me several viewings to actually make it all out. The fact that I was having to read subtitles didn't help Surprisingly the story holds together much better than it seemed to at first.Bollywood is notorious for stealing from Hollywood and Baadshah is no exception. For all you other nonHindi speakers Baadshah means King like the one in a deck of cards The opening dance number Main Te Hoon Pagal is clearly inspired by the Cuban Pete song from The Mask and later on whole scenes are copied nearly frame for frame from a couple of Jackie Chan movies Mr. Nice Guy and Rush Hour. The results are just great good fun.The high point has to be the campy outrageous Baadshah O Baadshah nightclub number with Khan strutting his stuff amid a huge chorus of dancers in a whirl of silver lame and pyrotechnics. For a guy who claims to be a very bad dancer he has an easy grace and agility that makes him a joy to watch.Khan's performance in Baadshah is perfect. The comedy is fantastic and there isn't a dull moment. The supporting cast including Twinkle Khanna Johnny Lever if you can stand him and the everessential villain Amrish Puri are wonderful. Like most Hindi films there's a mishmash of everything you can imagine drama slapstick comedy tearyeyed pathos gotta see the Khan cry at least once in every film romance gotta see the hero dance around trees at least once in every film hightech James Bond gadgets hilariously bad special effects Baadshah has it all!".

The songs are pretty good one of my favorites being Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se the scene in which Raj Baadshah Shah Rukh Khan first starts his job to con Seema Twinkle Khanna. The movie also plastered with comedic slapsticktype scenesstrongly represented in the scenes where Baadshah upturns his house to convince Seema that he is blind. I feel these are not overdone though they had the potential because of the clever lines also sprinkled in between scenes.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun funny Bollywood movie with great songs good comedy and talented actors.Now if only I could find that movie again............".

Anyway I love watching this movie on television whenever possible and it has fair audience viewership on TV. It's one of this movies like Andaz Apna Apna which didn't do well at release but rocks the Television screen till date. Except for few glitches and songs the film is one of best comic movies from 90's. SRK has played the comicdetective character bang on! And almost all the costars have played their roles to perfection. Especially the Johnny Lever and gang. Twinkle looks hot and beautiful. The film also has a logical story flow of course you may find some illogical comedy but that's accepted in a comic film. The film successfully touches the elements of humor thrill and bit of romance. Recommend you to watch this movies with you friends you are sure to get some laughter riot.".

After 6 months a veteran S.W.A.T. officer Daniel Harrelson or Hondo is told to assemble a S.W.A.T. team for his division. He chooses other S.W.A.T. officers as well as 3 rookies. However after they pass the S.W.A.T. training they receive a message that a French crime boss known as Alex Montell is trying to escape from prison.

They look pretty good so I guess in that way I can recommend the movie. The story is of course about S.W.A.T. a respected part of the LAPD. We follow a team with leader Hondo Samuel L. Jackson Jim Street Colin Farrell Sanchez Michelle Rodriguez Deke rapper LL Cool J Boxer Brian Van Holt and T.J. Josh Charles. They have to deal with a criminal named Alex Montel Olivier Martinez who offers 100 million dollars to the people who will help him escape from jail.The movie opens with Jim Street and his partner Gamble Jeremy Renner saving people from bank robbers but they do that after disobeying an order. Both are punished but Gamble thinks Street has betrayed him so Gamble leaves the fore while Street gets a job out of action. The movie continues six months later leaving us with the feeling we will hear more from the Gamblecharacter. We feel correct. These facts and may be that Street used to date Boxer's sister are kind of important to know although every event serves the action or the oneliners that are not that impressive.Yes events are implausible but not in a way they become annoying. For actions fans the movie does exactly what we expect and what we want entertaining enough. If you are normally not an action fan only when it is done very good I should skip 'S.W.A.T.'!".

	schema:reviewBody "Thrown into a desk job when his partner Gamble disobeys orders and shoots a hostage Jim Street bides his time waited beside being demeaned on a daily basis.  When the commissioner brings in old school SWAT leader hondo to put together a young outfit Street is offered to chance to retrain with the select team and is soon back on duty.  Meanwhile a man is pulled over by a black and white for a broken rear light but is found to be a drug baron. SWAT are sent to escort the man to a secure prison but as they take him into a holding centre he announces that whoever breaks him out of jail will get 100 million dollars.  SWAT soon have much to content with and must ensure that Montel does not escape.In a summer crammed with more sequels than ever I was drawn to go and see SWAT simply because it offered some hope by not being a sequel to a past film I didn't know at the time it was a TV conversion.  Unfortunately while not lifting it's formula from a predecessor it essentially lifts itself from many other films and lacks anything that really makes it stand out.  The central premise the 100 meellion dollar' bit is interesting but only leads to a big long action scene that acts as the film's second act.  Prior to this we are given the usual training stuff which while not new is still enjoyable.It's weakness is that it is suffering from too much testosterone and therefore has to much of the men banging heads with each other and comparing size!  The second half is enjoyable as it is just noisy action all the way but it suffers from being too overblown.  A scene where several different street gangs attack a police convoy is an example of this but happily the rest is not as bad as this and is actually quite good.  My main complaint was that this second act felt like it should have been the main body of the film and that the training etc was just the introduction.  However the second act seemed very short and I came away with the feeling that this was made with a sequel in mind from day one  just like MIB felt like it was made to get to MIIB!That said it is still fun to watch albeit unoriginal and clichd fun. The overblown alldestroying action probably doesn't do justice to the actual precise and tactical work that SWAT units do and it did make me wonder why someone didn't just take the 100 meellion dollar' idea and put it in a normal cop film setting but heyho.The cast is really good on paper but hardly make much of a splash in reality.  Farrell continues to land on his feet with yet another starring role.  His American accent hasn't gotten any better but he is still watchable with his tough guy charisma would be nice to see him build on this rather than relying on it though.  Jackson is slumming it a bit and doesn't really lift the film by his presence.  He is no stranger to action movies but he doesn't manage to do much here other than add a face to the mix.  Smith LL Cool J now starting to use his real name in credits is OK but again doesn't do much special I found it amusing that both Jackson and LL had actually made Deep Blue Sea more enjoyable by their performances but neither did it here.  Rodriguez is not allowed to show she can act at any point but she is easy on the eye and is good enough.  Martinez's villain is OK but it was never clear where he was from despite the fact he had a French accent  have I missed something was he a French drug lord?  If anything his role marks a sad day for English actors everywhere from now on it seems that due to their actions over Iraq the French will be providing the baddies in American action movies from now on!Overall this is a reasonably enjoyable piece of noisy entertainment.  If you expect anything unique or clever then you will be really disappointed. However if you are prepared for lots of running with guns noise and macho posturing then this should be enough to satisfy you.  For me it didn't stand out from the pack but it was still an OK way to spend a few hours.".

My main complaint was that this second act felt like it should have been the main body of the film and that the training etc was just the introduction.  However the second act seemed very short and I came away with the feeling that this was made with a sequel in mind from day one  just like MIB felt like it was made to get to MIIB!That said it is still fun to watch albeit unoriginal and clichd fun. The overblown alldestroying action probably doesn't do justice to the actual precise and tactical work that SWAT units do and it did make me wonder why someone didn't just take the 100 meellion dollar' idea and put it in a normal cop film setting but heyho.The cast is really good on paper but hardly make much of a splash in reality.  Farrell continues to land on his feet with yet another starring role.  His American accent hasn't gotten any better but he is still watchable with his tough guy charisma would be nice to see him build on this rather than relying on it though.  Jackson is slumming it a bit and doesn't really lift the film by his presence.  He is no stranger to action movies but he doesn't manage to do much here other than add a face to the mix.  Smith LL Cool J now starting to use his real name in credits is OK but again doesn't do much special I found it amusing that both Jackson and LL had actually made Deep Blue Sea more enjoyable by their performances but neither did it here.  Rodriguez is not allowed to show she can act at any point but she is easy on the eye and is good enough.  Martinez's villain is OK but it was never clear where he was from despite the fact he had a French accent  have I missed something was he a French drug lord?  If anything his role marks a sad day for English actors everywhere from now on it seems that due to their actions over Iraq the French will be providing the baddies in American action movies from now on!Overall this is a reasonably enjoyable piece of noisy entertainment.  If you expect anything unique or clever then you will be really disappointed. However if you are prepared for lots of running with guns noise and macho posturing then this should be enough to satisfy you.  For me it didn't stand out from the pack but it was still an OK way to spend a few hours.";

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of lighthearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated albeit as a popcorn fest.The films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street a disgraced exS.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a lovehate relationship with although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film character wise.One scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L.

In the UK where I come from the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it as long as there's a parentguardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine gritty police action. The chase and action scenes although impressive are done in a routine manner with fast talking jokestyle dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rockpop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20 it was very disappointing.The fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really he's European and him and his nonAmerican cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money was a sloppy piece of filmmaking.Despite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it it never gets out of that 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result feels like a rehash of that 1986 film Top Gun only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown respectively. That in itself to some is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.".

	schema:reviewBody "SWAT is an action movie with some reasonable action scenes and lot of posing and running around with huge machine guns. It is not a bad movie per se but neither is it a good movie either. Farrell does well enough with his role as does Jackson but they both look like they are acting the part. I know that is what they are really doing but as an actor they have failed to instill the belief in the audience that they are in fact members of an elite SWAT team. It's not all their fault though as the writers and director don not give them much of a chance to really bring that belief across. The scenes with Farrell that are not action scenes are quite good  and just as you are being lulled into something more meaningful than a street gunfight  the camera whips away to the next action setpiece. As for the street gunfights ? Jees  I've seen more realistic stuff on the cartoon network. For a SWAT team  these guys don't have any qualms about jumping from a truck and spraying the entire street with submachine gun bullets hitting anything in their range. Neither do the bad guys have any problems with standing in the middle of the road  with no cover  alone  blasting at a plethora of cops  SWAT members et al. Certain death just does not come fast enough in this respect.Take the first scene  an opener to the film to follow. Two bad guys stand in the middle of the street spraying all and sundry with bullets. No cover they don't even attempt to hide or protect themselves from police return fire. Yet they still manage to peg a few policemen and continue this ridiculous fight for a few minutes before their inevitable deaths arrive. And as for the SWAT team and their police colleagues  they are unable to kill any of these guys without first discharging several thousand bullets. A kid with a pellet gun would stop one of these guys quicker. Later in the film a helicopter is shot down by a shooter from roughly a mile away  now the cops should recruit that guy and save themselves a hell of a budget in bullets and body bags.Nonetheless I enjoyed the film to an extent that it won't last too long in the memory but it was okay to while away a couple of hours being mildly entertained by it all. However for it's 80M budget  I suspect the makers wanted a bit more impact. The end scene sets up a possibility of a sequel too  but I reckon that will never happen. If it does and there is scope there to make this more interesting then a new director and writer is a must. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "S.W.A.T. is a very routine actioner. It's probably a very good evocation of the show which was a bit before my time although I might've caught an episode here and there  at least the theme song sounds very familiar. Certainly it seems like a good evocation of Seventies cop shows in general. But S.W.A.T. reminds one that not everything on TV in the Seventies was good you've also got incredibly shallow characterizations clichd conflicts very belabored introductions of everybody and an almost fetishistic fascination with cop paraphernalia. The camera lingers lovingly over the suits the guns the vans etc. A French bad guy posts a 100 million reward on whoever can break him out of the slammer quickest just as our heroes get the job of escorting him and of course they're the bad boys the rebels the ones the brass doesn't like. That's actually an interesting setup although it deteriorates quickly into an unintentionally funny sequence where a mixedrace gang alliance only in Hollywood tries to free our boy.The real bad guy turns out to be Farrell's expartner who improbably hasn't gone to seed since being kicked off the force and instead has all sorts of resources to battle our heroes. Actually these sorts of movies always have improbabilities so I didn't really mind that. And there's one great knockout sequence that must've been something to see on the big screen  a chase between a limo and a Lear jet on a bridge. That's something I've never seen in action movies before and I've seen a fair share of 'em. Unfortunately the final fight between Farrell and his partner is photographed far too murkily in a railyard to hide the doubles?.I vaguely remember when this movie came out there was a lot of praise from some people about the realism of the action. Well it's very much like what you might've seen on a Seventies cop show. I'm not sure how realistic that is though. For the most part it's not very visceral which I think is what's really lacking here. On television they have an excuse because it's well television. But even there the action sequences were few in number think how little you really saw of it in one of these shows and probably seem more effective by way of contrast. Stuffing a movie full of them doesn't really work. If you're going to go this route why not make it really visceral and go for the R? Farrell is a bland presence but that suits this movie fine  it's a bland movie for all of the gunfire and explosions. Not distinctive enough to be bad but hard to remember afterwords.".

Ever twist and turn was boringly predictable.  And we have too loud rock songs played over all the action sequences along with earsplitting gun shots.  Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood and gore maybe that's how it got by with a PG13 and a surprising amount of swearing thank you NYPD Blue.  Still the dialogue wasn't half bad the action sequences were quick loud and full of energy and everybody gives a good performance especially Farrell and Jackson.So it's nothing new...but you could do worse.  Not a film for small kids though.".

I am wondering why Steve Forest lowered him self to even be in this movie not to mention Trebeck are there careers in that much Jeopardy that they are reaching for straws? This movie had a lot of hype that died at the door to the theater it relied on using big names that tried to work with a poor script that relied on a lot of action and no story. If you want to see SWAT then get the original series it may be outdated and a bit slow by 21st century standards but it is a better value then this attempt at being a movie I hope that they do not add insult to this by even thinking of making a sequel. If they do I hope the real LA SWAT forces sign a petition banning it being filmed before they get a real bad image worse then they still have since the LA riots. Of course a sequel could set of another set of riots of film goers just getting fed up with horrible movies.".

And Police Departments like this don't behave this way! We see several scenes of the tightlyknit  newly formed five person team working hard then partying offduty then apparently driving home to sleep it off and await another day. The stereotyping is very bad.Example? An international terrorist financier makes a plea for help in escaping and within 2 hours several diverse gang groups devise highlytechnical rescue strategies and attempts bringing the LAPD to its knees! These gang homies apparently have the ability to hire people to pose as City workers homeless people and others to devise their rescue plans against large protection entourages with complex countersurveillance routing through the streets of Los Angeles.So a fiveperson SWAT team is given complete autonomy to conduct transportation rescue and investigation of said terrorist while Federal authorities the people traditionally tasked with such incredible operations show up in the very end to observe!Hundreds of people are hurt in a several seemingly mass casualty shootings and car wrecks yet very few actually die despite carnage from the streets of Baghdad! A rescue of the terrorist is attempted by one of the SWAT team members who apparently believes that he can orchestrate a rescue and fly the terrorist out of the country and that the terrorist will pay him millions of dollars. A chase involving the LA Metro system and a sewer chase stretch even a little leaguer's capacity to believe. Add to that the macho phony images and Jerry Bruckheimerstyle back stories for the cast and well SWAT goes waaaaay over the top!".

	schema:reviewBody "Impressive as some of the later films of Kurosawa are  Kagemusha and Ran for example I have to confess that it is his early work particularly those set in modern Japan as opposed to its feudal past that I find myself returning to with greater pleasure.  He was not one of those artists who necessarily got better and better rather was he one who continued to take on different challenges not always with the same degree of success as Dodesukaden and Dreams were to prove.  I have long regarded the 1952 Ikiru as his greatest achievement with the three modern day day films starring Toshiro Mifune that precede it Drunken Angel The Quiet Duel and Stray Dog fascinating consolidations of his skill as a director. Stray Dog revels in technical accomplishment.  It tells the story of a policeman who after experiencing the theft of his gun while travelling on a bus embarks on an odyssey to retrieve it.  Questions of morality and honour loom large as they do in any Kurosawa film with the quest becoming ever more urgent as evidence is gathered of the weapon being used in criminal activities.  What might be regarded as plain bad luck in another culture is here seen as a matter of shame and dishonour by the unfortunate policeman that has to be addressed forsaking all else.  The search is pursued in a dazzling series of chases encounters and interrogations that leaves the audience like the hero exhausted at times.  The weather is hot throughout characters sweat profusely and sometimes everything erupts in a tropical downpour  no other director uses rain so physically.  Perhaps at over two hours Stray Dog is a little too long to sustain its material.  It sags a little in the middle but the chases at the outer ends of the film are wonderfully done particularly the penultimate sequence where the cop pursues his prey through vegetation where city and countryside meet.  You can almost smell the steamy atmosphere of a morning after rain where everything is about to heat up again.  Possibly the other two Mifune films of the same period have the edge on this.  They are more meditative works their lengths more sustainable.  But for sheer cinematic bravado this is the one.".

Here though Kurosawa permits Sato to espouse a hardcore lawandorder philosophy The cops are the good guys the crooks are the bad guys and that's it. Sato has no patience for Murakami's guilt feelings or touchyfeely philosophizing.That Kurosawa would permit this view which is not Kurosawa's view nor the film's to be given voice by the film's wisest kindest most competent and most likable character is a mark of his confidence and courage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stray Dog 1949An early Kurosawa film made before he came to the attention of cinema enthusiasts with Rashomon. Toshiro Mifune plays a young detective whose pistol is stolen by a pickpocket. Fearing for his job and fuelled by embarrassment he sets out to find his pistol which has been used in two crimes by the thief in Tokyo during a sweltering heatwave...Kurosawa's western influences are as clear as ever in Stray Dog as for all intents and purposes it plays like a conventional American police story. Several scenes reminded me of Orson Welles' later film Touch of Evil particularly an extended montage sequence with a similar feel to the famous opening shot of Welles' film showing a disguised Mifune walking the streets as he attempts to track down blackmarket arms dealers accompanied by a cacophony of street noise and Latinjazzbig band music. Another scene where Mifune and the older cop leading the investigation played by Takashi Shimura stakeout a Japanese Baseball game could've been a Hitchcock setpiece. Elements of this film seem to have been referenced in a variety of contemporary works from the doppelganger criminaldetective idea in Michael Mann's Heat to John C Reilly's desperate search for his lost gun in Magnolia.However despite the references to conventional genre film Kurosawa adds depth to his film with several philosophical themes and ideas. First is the subtle way in which the detective and the robber are shown to be connected. Mifune explains how his possessions were all stolen after the war and that he contemplated turning to crime but decided on the opposite route of law enforcement. The robber who ends up with Mifune's gun commits the crimes exactly because he too had his bag of belongings stolen. Mifune feels a deep sense of guilt that his pistol has been used in these crimes and almost breaks down completely when his boss Shimura is shot and wounded. The idea resonates with Mifune that the life of crime he managed to avoid has returned to his life through this chance occurrence. The robber himself is only seen in the great final chase but he is given surprising depth of character just in the chase alone. The final chase between the two men is a classic Kurosawa scene. In a tense moment there is an instinctive reaction by both men that they've finally found each other. Mifune is shot in the arm out in the countryside as Mozart drifts from a piano in a nearby house. His blood drips onto the flowers below. The theme that the gun only has a certain number of bullets pays off as the robber fires twice and misses leaving the gun empty allowing Mifune to overpower him. The two men wrestle in the flowers falling into a river and get covered in mud. The robber is eventually overpowered and handcuffed and Kurosawa composes a wonderful shot showing the two unrecognisable and exhausted men arranged at either side of the frame in the foreground like a mirror image while a group of singing schoolchildren walk past in the background. The robber suddenly begins to cry and howls in anguish. Identity is blurred the robber is no more evil than the detective just a weaker man who gave in to the difficult environment he was faced with.Although some elements of the technique aren't as well developed as Kurosawa's most famous such as the clumsy flashback intro and narration there are many moments which show the sign of the truly great filmmaker he was to become. The sense of oppressive environment both place and weather is strong and it's possibly the sweatiest film I've seen! The detective story itself is pretty compelling but the final climactic scene alone transcends simple genre filmmaking with something profound poetic and moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early Kurosawa masterpiece arguably his first. Stray Dog grabs your attention immediately with the superbly weird closeups of the mangy dog panting behind the opening credits. Following the credits the director delivers a clinic on the art of montage utilizing quick nonlinear cutting that makes the narrative get straight to the point ashamed rookie cop an impossibly young Toshiro Mifune explaining to his boss that he lost his gun then a jump back to earlier in the day during target practice then a quick cut to a scene on a crowded city bus in which the Colt gets lifted. Properly impatient with exposition Kurosawa has his editor wield the cutting knife with ruthless precision. Only after the premise is established does the movie slow down.Indeed Stray Dog tends to meander during the next two hours. There's a famous 8minute sequence in which Mifune going undercover in search of his gun wanders through the detritus human and otherwise of a blackmarket underworld in bombedout postWar Tokyo. These 8 minutes contain zero exposition containing instead some stunning onlocation montage from 2ndunit guy Honda who directed Godzilla later that unabashedly turns into scathing social commentary and this in the final analysis is far more interesting than the catchascatchcan plot about a rookie detective's stolen gun. Owing stylistic and thematic debts to old Eisenstein pictures as well as thencurrent trends in Italian cinema Kurosawa fashions his own polemic about postWar Japan that can't help but fascinate historians. Those of us in the West who have our own perceptions about what Japan is like the stereotype is that it's a spiffy country inhabited by spiffy people will be shocked at the filthy conditions and depravity glimpsed at in this footage. It's a land in a time and a place where women steal pistols for criminals in order to score riceration cards.The movie is ultimately about how a person maintains a sense of morality in such conditions. Mifune's cop is after all not too different from the psychopath whom he pursues both are veterans in their late twenties who ended up on entirely different paths which have suddenly converged. One reviewer below complained about Kurosawa's facile humanism how can humanism be facile? but I rather call it a heroic humanism. Mifune is an honorable young man who chooses to be a hero after all it would've been easier to quit the force after enduring the shame of getting his gun stolen and it certainly would've been easier to roam the blackmarkets like his antagonist Yusa and generally cave in to psychopathy. Kurosawa is suggesting that if a man or a nation chooses the right path redemption can be found. Not for the last time Kurosawa makes heroism and simple decency thrilling to watch.All in all Stray Dog is a landmark achievement for Kurosawa and for cinema in general. It stands proudly beside his more famous achievements in the decade that followed. 8 stars out of 10.".

I had never had the privilege of watching one of his masterpieces and every time I had the opportunity something got in the way. In May I found myself with a hundred dollars a small fortune to a high school student with no job and staring at Kurosawa's Four Samurai Classics dvd collection at Best Buy. The box set included the Criterion editions of Seven Samurai The Hidden Fortress Yojimbo and Sanjuro priced at 82.99. I saw this as a bargain since Criterion edition dvds usually run around 40 a pop so I bought it without hesitation. After viewing all four films over a weekend I craved more Kurosawa and spent what money I had left on Rashomon thus beginning my foray into Kurosawa's art.I have been extremely satisfied with the five Kurosawa films I have seen and was pleased to receive Stray Dog in the mail today from Netflix. I began watching it within about 20 minutes of getting it and from the beginning I was hooked. The film stars Toshiro Mifune as rookie detective Murakami in 1940's Tokyo. Murakami's pistol has been stolen from him while riding a crowded bus on a hot day. Disgraced at himself for having lost such an important item he sets out to find the culprit and enlists the help of veteran detective Sato played by Takashi Shimura. Together the two detectives hunt down the man responsible. However things get worse and their investigation intensifies as they learn that the weapon is used in an armed robbery. Sato becomes a mentor to Murakami and takes him under his wing as they get closer and closer to their perpetrator.Toshiro Mifune's performance is magnificent. He is not the over confident Kikuchiyo from Seven Samurai or the calm and cool ronin from both Yojimbo and Sanjuro instead he is a rookie detective in 1940's Tokyo. Mifune portrays a Murakami filled with tension and selfloathing. As his gun is used in more acts of violence Murakami sinks deeper and deeper emotionally by placing the blame entirely on himself. Takashi Shimura is equally impressive as the veteran Sato. These two actors play very well off of eachother. Their chemistry alone is enough to make you want to see the film luckily it is not the only reason. Akira Kurosawa tells the story with amazing pacing that seems slow but never boring. The use of forshadowing had little to do with subtilty and added to the tension of the film as the detectives closed in on their suspect until the tense climax which I will not spoil for you. All in all Stray Dog was two hours of intelligent storytelling combined by skillful acting. I would be tempted to give it a  rating solely because it is Kurosawa however he gave me enough reasons to do so in the film itself.".

Their chemistry alone is enough to make you want to see the film luckily it is not the only reason. Akira Kurosawa tells the story with amazing pacing that seems slow but never boring. The use of forshadowing had little to do with subtilty and added to the tension of the film as the detectives closed in on their suspect until the tense climax which I will not spoil for you. All in all Stray Dog was two hours of intelligent storytelling combined by skillful acting. I would be tempted to give it a  rating solely because it is Kurosawa however he gave me enough reasons to do so in the film itself.";

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa's STRAY DOG English title is a riveting poetic vision of a young Tokyo officer Toshiro Mifune who's handgun is stolen from him on a bus.  Driven to obsession he follows the trail of the pickpocket through the seedy underworld of postwar China in an attempt to regain his honor. A rare film of great social and philosophical significance.  The deceptively simple story grows more complex as the man who gains possession of Mifune's handgun begins killing people and Mifune starts to blame himself.  Every single second of this film rings true.  An incredible atmospheric combination of noirish melodrama and dark comedy.  Every bit as good as Kurosawa's celebrated samurai pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa along with his cowriter Ryuzo Kikushima has here something very intriguing a screenplay that really draws the viewer in like opening up a tight tothebone detective story by the likes of Dashiell Hammett an influence on at least one Kurosawa film by the way. His basic premise is deceptively simple a nervous but completely professional and slightly worndown cop played by a young  trim Toshiro Mifune gets his gun pickpocketed on the subway and he spends at least half of the film on his own looking for it. When a pickpocket specialist played by one of the very best Japanese character actors Takashi Shimura comes into being his partner on the case then things then the plot starts to thicken further. But as someone who's read and tried to write a few screenplays I just know watching this how much detail probably went into it the nuances of things that Mifune had to do. It's quite a delicate awesome feat considering the layers of the film's content.Obviously Kurosawa as the director calls the shots in terms of the visuals his true forte though this is him still in a young director mode very confident in his style though only giving minor fluoride's of style sometimes quite well. This works to his advantage when using the motif of hot heat the wretched weight of a summer's day in the more crowded poorer areas of Tokyo. But Stray Dog is more than just a kind of common detective film. That the story is sturdy and good enough to be akin very much to the American films of the time is almost besides the point. Like De Sica to a degree Kurosawa uses the postwar streets and real locations it's not all just Toho this time and it adds that layer of heightened realism for our main characters on the prowl in fact one could look at this film as being like the Bicycle Thief looking for a lost item in the dark places of the city had it been written with a fair amount less sentiment and more grit.When the suspense comes forth it's really a knockout especially when it comes time for he final confrontation with the thief where it becomes such a struggle that the two are like well dogs very primal as it boils down to the law versus the criminal. There's a certain sense of time and structure that sets apart Stray Dog from the numerous 'filmnoirs' of American cinema of the period while it contains the kind of determined edge and wit of those films it also relies on portraying the people in this world as honestly as possible however downtrodden things are like Kurosawa's later film High  Low location adds to the mood greatly. But even through Mifune's cautious and unbending kind of performance and Shimura's typical intelligent laidback way it's the script that pulls everything together that long fascinating sequence of Mifine trudging through the streets looking for his gun was not very likely improvised. Very well done.".

	schema:headline " Early Kurosawa is still good Kurosawa";
	schema:reviewBody "This early Kurosawa effort floats stylistically somewhere between the film noir and neorealism incorporating the best from both worlds to elaborately craft a landscape both physical and social of postwar Japan. It's only been 4 years since the dreadful Abombings and the subsequent defeat of Japan in WW2 and both the country and the people are deeply scarred. War veterans return home to find a country torn by poverty and as the saying goes desperate conditions demand desperate measures.A very young Toshiro Mifune plays the greenhorn detective who has his gun stolen and spends the rest of the movie trying to track down the culprit. As it turns out the culprit is a war veteran just like Mifune's character only where the latter tried to do good and found an honest job the former opted for the easy way out and became a criminal using the stolen gun to rob and kill. This adds an additional layer of motivation for detective Sato. Not only does he have to restore his honour ironically symbolised by the lost gun which he tries to retrieve but also redeem himself by bringing the killer to justice. What makes matters worse for him is that every time his stolen gun is fired someone dies or gets injured which adds another burden of guilt on the shoulders of the young detective.The story might appear too moralistic and convenient both antagonist and protagonist share a common background being war veterans making the distinction of good and bad all too easy but it has to be seen in the context of the times. Mifune says that there are no bad people only bad situations. But as his detective collaborator on the case remarks played by the great Takashi Shimura who also starred in Seven Samurai he faced the same bad situation and made something good out of it. Kurosawa here neatly balances the social climate of postwar Japan and the conditions of the times with personal responsibility.Storywise it's a worthy effort but like Rashomon it sounds a little bit better than it actually is. Not that Stray Dog is a bad movie by any means but clocking in at 2 hours it starts to drag near the middle. There are some nice setpieces that showcase Kurosawa's growing talent like the phone scene in the hotel where he uses intercutting to great effect and the performances are solid all around. There's also a silent 10 minute montage of location footage shot in rundown neighborhoods as Sato searches the black market for his gun which serves as a poignant snapshot of Japanese history.Kurosawa would go on to achieve international acclaim with his next movie Rashomon but Stray Dog already shows that he was destined for great things. Compared to later entries in his filmography Stray Dog appears to be a minor entry but it's still well worth the time to discover.".

However Stray Dog is comparable to quite a few well known modernday crime films like Seven for example although I liked Stray Dog better.The film is very modern in the way the story unfolds the relationships between the two policemen the way the investigation is carried out the way the criminal is revealed etc. However it is also a story unique to late 1940s postwar Japan and is not something that could be recreated in the modern day. As usual Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura once again gave great performances as the main characters in the movie.Highly recommended for Kurosawa fans as well as fans of crime films in general.710".

However Stray Dog is comparable to quite a few well known modernday crime films like Seven for example although I liked Stray Dog better.The film is very modern in the way the story unfolds the relationships between the two policemen the way the investigation is carried out the way the criminal is revealed etc. However it is also a story unique to late 1940s postwar Japan and is not something that could be recreated in the modern day. As usual Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura once again gave great performances as the main characters in the movie.Highly recommended for Kurosawa fans as well as fans of crime films in general.710";

	schema:reviewBody "A longstanding blemish on my status as a film buff has been the fact that I had never seen a film directed by Akira Kurosawa easily the most wellknown and respected Japanese filmmaker. Finally my drought has been broken as I sat down last night to enjoy 'Nora inu  Stray Dog 1949.' A police procedural in the classic filmnoir tradition the film stars Kurosawaregular Toshir Mifune as a young homicide detective whose firearm is pickpocketed while on a bus. When it becomes clear that the weapon has fallen into the hands of a desperate murdering criminal Det. Murakami becomes consumed with guilt and shame and it is only through the experienced guidance of mentor Det. Sato Takashi Shimura that he can overcome his insecurities and track down the suspect. 'Stray Dog' was the director's tenth film and the third in a wealth of collaborations with Mifune throughout an illustrious career. Though it is not quite the masterpiece I had probably unreasonably been anticipating I can only promise that my first Kurosawa will certainly not be my last.Surprisingly 'Stray Dog' is similar in many regards to Vittorio De Sica's neorealist masterpiece 'The Bicycle Thief 1948.' Both films concern a disillusioned man's seeminglyfutile search for an essential stolen object in a city of poor and pitiable individuals where in the aftermath of World War Two widespread economic difficulties have forced many towards a life of crime. When Det. Murakami first begins searching for his stolen gun there is a wonderful extended sequence in which he purposelessly wanders the povertystricken streets experiencing the decadence of society for himself for the first time understanding why a criminal might have been forced to tread a darkened path. A very important theme of the film is the obvious parallel between Det. Murakami and his suspect Yusa Isao Kimura. Both individuals fell on hard times when their knapsacks were stolen while the former took the crucial step towards law enforcement the latter chose the opposite path eventually becoming a thief and a wanted murderer. In the story's climactic chase sequence the two men tussle violently in the undergrowth their faces becoming coated in a layer of mud for a decisive few moments detective and criminal are practically indistinguishable from each other.One component of filmmaking that Kurosawa had evidently mastered by 1949 was creating intensity and in many ways 'Stray Dog' is simply discomforting to watch. The events of the film appear to take place during an extreme heatwave and the perspiration clings to the skin of the actors as though they are practically roasting in their seats. When the story reaches a devastating climax its arrival is heralded by the breaking of a storm the passing of the sweltering drought perhaps symbolising that the dull futile routine of police procedure has come to an end. I was also impressed by the frantic chase sequences at both the beginning and end of the film which aside from being exceptionally thrilling were genuinely harrowing. Watching Murakami and Yusa grapple in the vegetation before both collapsing to the ground in fatigue I don't think I've ever seen film characters looking so utterly exhausted. Despite a masterful opening and closing 'Stray Dogs' tended to drag a lot in the middle with the two detectives moving from one possible witness to the other very slowly gathering the information they require to track down their suspect. Nonetheless I now have the massive undertaking of deciding which of Akira Kurosawa's films I will watch next.".

It's a very surprising noir in many ways. Gritty relentless brutal results of the police work often unsatisfactory. Kurosawa uses the increasingly sweltering heat of the summer to portray the frustration building up in all the various characters.

A good detective story. The characterization is excellent. The story has depth. As always the director leaves a strong sense of realism. Heat wave or heat stroke. Unbearable heat of the early film works incredibly realistic. The real picture is repeated in several frames. Kurosawa was a master of technique and simply seeks to everyone stay focused. The film unfortunately has gaps. Interesting is the feeling after the film. As I looked to the police story that normally happens in a neighborhood. The film is a kind of chase. However this journey from one place to another shows us the postwar Japan. I'm convinced myself that neorealism and noir are great combination.Unbearable heat and extremely hot case. The change in expression is probably a change in Japanese cinema. The similarities between the hero and villain are obvious. These are issues of selfawareness and understanding. They chose different paths in life but basically they are not different. Therefore this can not be described as a classic game between cop and criminal.Toshiro Mifune as Detective Murakami the former soldier is not a strong character. That's the point.

The culmination of this is the film's finest moment a sweatsoaked chase through the woods at the climax. It's pretty heavy stuff.Otherwise this is good but not as gripping as Kurosawa's other works.

Although it's not necessary I'd recommend watching Drunken Angel first as Stray Dog is essentially as continuation of the post war malaise that hung heavy in the atmosphere there to the point where here it actually has important character and narrative implications. Drunken Angel was particularly memorable in its use of a single stagnant pool that as the one unchanging image of the film reminded us of humanity's lingering corruption and on a more national scale the zeitgeist of Japan at the time. This was in the wake of the bomb and here the air is oppressively heavy characters are always marked by sweat and are habitually wiping their foreheads people who populate the streets look by turns untrustworthy and suspicious of passersby many of them are emaciated and seem displaced and in this fetid and feverish air there's a general feeling of a swelling something expanding until bursting in exhaustion. The openingcredits shot of a panting dog captures the nature of the film pretty succinctly fatigue wear and perseverance. What really drives this steady progression of overwhelming heat is the simple act in the beginning of the film of Det. Murakami's Toshiro Mifune pistol being stolen triggering an intense and labouring journey through the city where every moment in which the gun is clutched in the hands of a criminal and every time it's used for some crime the anxiety is increased immeasurably. Paul Thomas Anderson who used this lost gun element in Magnolia one of my favourite films said that we feel every punch of the film and golly is that true. Much of this dramatic urgency is spurred by Mifune who as Murakami is everything his character in Drunken Angel or any other Mifune I've seen is not. He's awkward nave earnest but physically unsure of himself. Gone is the swaggering gangster or rabid bandit or stoic samurai. Kurosawa was an innovative director and has been endlessly influential so it's no surprise that here what we get is an early progenitor of the procedurals and everybody's favourite buddy cop dynamic. Lethal Weapon is like children's role play compared to this though. Before he is paired with Takashi Shimura the other detective we get a lengthy sequence of Murakami tailing a woman across the city that he knows is involved with the disappearance of his gun. This chase has that streetlevel intensity that is a defining characteristic of the noir and as he chases her through the city they pass through alleys and bars and even take a ride on public transport and through all this it's easy to imagine this being Los Angeles or New York. Eventually he corners her to a restaurant which she holes up in. Being the pleasant and patient man he is rather than hounding away at her he waits outside for hours until she eventually gives in and talks to him. All of this was worth it simply for the beautiful composition of this scene in which a harmonica player occupies the foreground as Mifune sits dejectedly behind him face drawn to his legs. After the woman tells him that his gun is lost somewhere in the gun racket of the city's seedy underbelly he knows he'll have to go undercover poor bastard. There's a wonderful moment where they both look up at the stars and not only does this a offer a chance to breathe after being overwhelmed by the gravity of the streets but it's perhaps also something of a ancestor to that iconic shot in Rashmon which stares directly into the piercing sun.The sequence in which a dirtied and ragged Mifune goes undercover and wanders the streets looking for a way into the gun racket perhaps goes on for too long as its point was made as soon as we understand that the people are a combination of suspicious and indifferent towards him and he is having no success. But I think perhaps what Kurosawa is underlining is the actual condition of these people and I think it's no coincidence that we see emaciated and forlorn individuals who all seem so fixed in their places they're like unquestionable parts of the environment. It's a postwar distress and when Mifune is partnered with Shimura their dinner conversation that they have In Shimura's house who as the older experienced cop is obligated to invited Mifune over for dinner because that's how buddycop dynamics work returns to this idea of the war as a generational dividing line. Maybe there are no bad people only bad situations Mifune wonders who despite being a war veteran still has a reserve of optimism which he clutches on to. Leave the writing to the writers Shimura retorts as he's a house of wisdom a man who's seen all there is to see who knows what he knows and has no room left for philosophical changes of heart. Kurosawa loved the masterpupil dynamic and this is employed brilliantly in the police procedural format so as the two detectives scour the city through blood and sweat dirt and shimmering heat from a Baseball game to a Burlesque show getting closer to the man with the gun the final confrontation itself rests purely on the shoulders of Mifune in what is a beautiful unburdening of all that accumulated tension. What ultimately you have here is a police story that is an evocative journey through postwar Japan a gradual peeling back of layer after layer in Kurosawa sidewipe fashion that is no less thrilling than any of its American counterparts.".

Kurosawa loved the masterpupil dynamic and this is employed brilliantly in the police procedural format so as the two detectives scour the city through blood and sweat dirt and shimmering heat from a Baseball game to a Burlesque show getting closer to the man with the gun the final confrontation itself rests purely on the shoulders of Mifune in what is a beautiful unburdening of all that accumulated tension. What ultimately you have here is a police story that is an evocative journey through postwar Japan a gradual peeling back of layer after layer in Kurosawa sidewipe fashion that is no less thrilling than any of its American counterparts.";

It is a little too long and sags in the pace in the middle however despite these debits there is much to admire. Kurasawa's films were always well made and directed even those not so highly regarded like Dreams and Rhapsody in August and with the striking scenery and very accomplished cinematography and direction Stray Dog is no exception. The music is appropriately simple yet lively I am especially fond of the Bengawen Solo while the script gives a certain tension the action is authentic and Toshiro Mifune is as ever charismatic in a role that suits his acting skills to a tee. What is special about Stray Dog is the story in the action you feel the summer heat and Mifune's selfloathing but emphasis is cleverly put on the goodness of ordinary people and the world's beauty. Overall early Kurasawa it is but one that makes its mark without being one of his finest. 810 Bethany Cox".

Sofia Milos did a fine job as Celia Amonte but aren't there any PortugueseAmerican aspiring actresses in Hollywood? The reason my Big Fat Greek Wedding was such a sleeper success is that most of the cast playing Greeks were GreekAmerican. It is obvious that the research of the Portuguese culture language and cuisine was minimal. I'm amazed that this movie was filmed on location in New Bedford MA yet there were so many ethnic fauxpas. Were any authentic PortugueseAmericans advisors on this movie? Why is it that other American ethnic groups can have movies made of them with correct speech etc. and that the Portuguese can not?

	schema:reviewBody "In a Portuguese fishing colony in New Bedford Massachusetts the widow singer of Fado Clia Amonte Sofia Milos has been grieving the death of her beloved fisherman husband for seven years. She lives with her teenager daughter Vicky Emmy Rossum and her motherinlaw is her neighbor next door. The English gambler Charles Beck who is spending some days with his wealthy friends Daniel Vargas Seymour Cassel and Lois Theresa Russell falls in love with her and lies about his past to conquer the love of Clia. Passionada is a nice romance. Indeed it is literally a delicious romance with many Portuguese and Spanish dishes which made me feel hungry. The story is predictable but a great entertainment and the cast is very attractive. I glanced some reviews in IMDb and I really found very funny comments. First of all the Portuguese spoken along the movie is from Portugal. There is a joker who wrote that the accent was from Brazil but only the Portuguese people who live in Brazil has that accent just in time my grandmother was Portuguese and I am Brazilian so I can tell about accents. I do not know Spanish but Passionada is neither a Portuguese nor an English word. I believe that it might be a combination of the English word Passion from Charles Beck the English card player with Apaixonada from Portuguese meaning in love with the author playing with words. Clia prepares many dishes of fish and seafood for Charles and she has never mentioned that they are Portuguese dishes inclusive one of them is from Mozambique. There are dozens of ways of preparing bacalhau codfish and not only ovenmade and the bolinhos de bacalhau codfish cakes are perfect. Indeed Paella is a typical Spanish dish but her intention is to show Charles different meals she was able to cook. In accordance with IMDb information Sofia Milos was born in Zurich Switzerland and not in Greece. At the street parade the song is sang with the Portuguese of Portugal accent. The song when they dance is A Felicidade a Brazilian bossa nova of Vinicious de Morais and Tom Jobim it is not a samba or soft???samba. It is amazing the number of nonsense I read about this movie in IMDb. The alternative end is horrible and fortunately was deleted. My vote is seven.Title Brazil This DVD is not available in Brazil.".

Vicky is just irresistible in this movie so full of life and youth and yet she cares so deeply for her mother. I know Emmy Rossum will be acting for a long time to come. A jewel among actresses indeed! Her scenes were very believable not that any of the other's scenes weren't but I ended up enjoying her performance most of all.Every character proves that we are only human and are prone to fate and bad things but we just need to get that boost right back up onto our feet. The movie tells it's story well with great direction and SUPERB scenery.But there was one scene I had a problem with. The love scene with Celia and Charles. It just came way too soon. They were only seeing each other for such a short time they hardly even kissed yet and then during dinner only THEN do they kiss. Then they end up sleeping together? For a woman who is still mourning over her deceased husband and doesn't want to date again she sure contradicts herself. It came just much too soon. I would have enjoyed it better if it had come much later. True though I do not control the character but still it would have made more sense to me if it came later not when they were almost still strangers to each other.However the music was very enjoyable and lovely and it's not just the scenes where Celia is singing. It's also that beautiful twinkling piano music that just floats around in some scenes and sets a wonderful mood.All in all I'd give it a 910. A very deserving movie indeed! A musthave for romantics!".

Celia has a meddlesome teenage daughter Vickie Emmy Rossum who wants to learn how to count cards by blackmailing Charlie into teaching her but he is banned from all casinos. Vickie wants to hook her mother up with a new man but her computer dating schemes fail. In the meanwhile Charlie's only friends a wealthy couple Lois Theresa Russell and Danny Vargas Seymore Cassel lend him their Jaguar XKE sailboat and home to impress the widow that he is a successful and wealthy entrepreneur.

Love fish and lying to make points with the mother Charlie learns how to turn his life around the hard way through his deceptions which backfire and Sofia tries to forget the husband whose death has left her prematurely widowed yet not dead from the neck down. Through the interferences of Vickie lots of fish as unlikely props and a sappy storyline this is an entertaining film which allows the wonderful character actor Jason Isaac to show another side to his already powerful acting chops. Emmy Rossum is adequately irritating in a prePhantom of the Opera role which suggests her growth from typical teen to ingnue in training. However it is the vibrant Sofia Milos as Celia who gives a rounded performance from cloistered widow to sensuous nightclub chanteuse that surprises and delights.This is a small story about love in all its forms and definitions.

The result is a beautifully shot film with marginally interesting characters and an uneventful story which spends most of its time with Issacs courting a reluctant Milos with his English accent and glib patter. The film wanders somewhere between romantic drama and romantic comedy not taking a firm position thereby diluting its ability to be engaging in either genre. Nonetheless romantics and sentimentalists will appreciate this languorous but pretty film with a cosmopolitan flavor. B".

It is after all Ireland's romantic comedy.

The writers have seen too many soap operas so they throw in a comainthehospital scene and dialog along the lines of If theres anything he'll wake up for it's you. The director even had the never to use a subtitle screen to flash One month later as if time had any significance to this romance. Yikes.

She really is talented and even her minor performances blow me away. Sofia Milos was truly beautiful and had a perfect performance. Her grandmother added humor and charisma. Finally Jason Isaacs gave another great performance in the first movie i have seen where he wasn't a villain or a drag queen. He really shows his range in this film.

	schema:headline " The Sadness Within...";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie's website mentions the sadness within as being a rough translation for the title of one of the film's central love songs the haunting and emotionally wrenching Triste Sina.. The translated words in fact evoke the state of being that heroine Celia Amonte has made her way of life. And moving through the first few minutes of the story one can empathize with her reluctance to step beyond the borders of a life that once was.. She was loved in great measure after all so it would seem a safer bet to live on in grief rather than pretend love of that depth can ever be felt again.. The tale of how she gradually brings herself to open up to do so and how the man who seduces and awakens her also wakes up to his own responsibility and entanglement in her life really pulled me in. I loved it and loved all of these characters even in broadly drawn moments. I just wanted them to be happy .. The scene that sums up the film's title for me is the night Celia prepares a meal for her new admirer Charlie. The way that scene unfolds was as delicious and mouthwatering as I imagine the culinary offerings were .. The overall mood and atmosphere of it stayed with me long afterwards which to me if the mark of a truly effecting story. Well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Passionada is such an unpretentious movie that its unique charm and superb craft sneak up on you and by the end win you over in such a refreshing way that is really stays with you...and for me that's the sign of a wonderful movie!I haven't felt so good watching a movie this simple in a long time. And if its complexity you're looking for I suggest you see Dan Ireland's other film The Whole Wide World. But for me Passionada may look simple but to pull off what Ireland does so successfully here is an almost next to impossible feat. This is a sunny optimistic celebration of love and second chances told with the artistry of a European master. In a world of 'edge' from independent filmmakers this is a welcome and refreshing departure. It's almost like you have been transported back in time to a happier more care free world where the most important thing is family community and personal happiness. Sound unusual?The cast is sublime especially Sofia Milos. What a beauty what a performance! She's a cross between Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren with a little Irene Pappas thrown in for a chaser. Emmy Rossum is going to be a big star and like Renee Zellweger she owes Ireland big time in his brave choice of casting her in a role I read that she was 14 at the time that she wasn't old enough to play but did it so beautifully! Also like what The Whole Wide World did for Zellweger she got Jerry Maguire from it I hear this film brought Rossum to the attention of Joel Schumacher who cast her in the lead role of Christine in The Phantom of the Opera.Jason Isaacs is perfect in a very difficult part but he plays it to Cary Grant perfection. This should open eyes to those that only think he can play a villain.The score by the always amazing Harry GregsonWilliams the intoxicating singing of Fado songs and the sumptuous cinematography by Ireland's long time collaborator Claudio Rocha are nothing less than first rate.If you want to be taken to a world where you've never been before rent this DVD. Such a shame it was wasted in its brief theatrical release. Don't let this one slip by. If you long for a film that will make you feel good here it is. Do yourself a BIG favor.".

The characters felt fresh and the direction the story took them was at times surprising.

The central romance is lacking real heat. This has more in common with an average Lifetime romance except this is supposed to be better. There is a Portuguese aspect to the characters which is not fully exploited. There is food but the movie fails in making food porn. It feels superficial like an ethnic food fair festival.

I believe the art of making your audience laugh a task in which both creators Reppas and Papathanassiou are masters and very well known and appreciated from the Greek TV is not only considerably more difficult than to sell any crap as wrapped art not to be understood by the average audience but it even dares to put a mirror in the face of every spectator and have them encounter their own reality.Many critics didn't like it for it was not artistic enough.

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that the 2 creators famous and successful TV writers  made a personal bet .  Lets make a really BAD film . We will simply cast 20 plus famous TV actors . We will put in 6 or more of the most contrived stories on film history . We will feed it with jokes older than the dinosaurs and more hackneyed than why did the chicken cross the road . We will pitch it in the levels of trash with endless and pointless swearing . We will find a small and commercial title and then we will simply sit back and watch the entire country queue to pay a ticket for watching it BRAVO !!! they managed to succeed in their purpose . 1.2 million tickets in a country of 10 million people is an ACHIEVEMENT . I do not think it is bold to say that if the film was just a PINCH of salt better it would have made 2 millions . As it is it simply can make a man puke with the complete fraud and the brain washing it was made by the marketing system . A really insignificant and unoriginal comedy that noone  NOONE would bother to see if it wasn 't for the all star cast . Most of the actors were personal friends of the writers and probably accepted to play for that reason  not to mention that the roles were small. The film is not exactly bad but it is hopelessly MEDIOCRE  MEDIOCRE  MEDIOCRE . Before I say anything else I would like to point out that the sewing up of the 78 stories was done very nicely . But this was done in the detriment of the film . There is utter unoriginality . For example the boss sexually harasses his cute secretary. She initially resists knowing that every week he changes a girlfriend . When though he starts crying and giving oaths that he loves her she falls like a tower of cards and they screw on the office . After a week he dumbs her and she is heartboken ! A 10 year  old can write this in 15 minutes or less . Their excuse was that the unoriginality was that it was intentional in order to have a good slice of the reality . OK people .We DO know that these stories happen in real life in precisely THAT way . But HAVE MERCY !!!! A person who is paying 2000 drachmas to see a film always wants something different . Not necessarily an original story but a different  original HANDLING of a story . The jokes simply DONT WORK except for a couple of times . SAFE SEX fails as a comedy as well as a social satire as it intended to be. Even worse for the film is the swearing . Oh my God ! WHY ? WHY ? I am not conservative but here it is useless  out of time  irritating  VERY CHEAP and trashes the film to a toilet farse . The only exception is in the scenes where the client of sex phones masturbates . The bad language here is natural  functional and why not ? funny . Pavlos Haikalis is excellent and delivers those difficult scenes uniquely .But the worse crime of the movie is that it finally falls flat . Being bored from a typical movie is bad enough . But being bored from the repetiveness of a film with 8 sublots  30 characters not to mention the 20 cameos from equally known actors  is UNFORGIVABLE .  The same things happen again and again to fill the screen time and you can 't wait for the film to end .Anyway I will have to admit that all the actors are great and really do their best  especially P. Haikalis as Kostas and Anna Panagiotopoulou as the hysterical and jealous Rena . Overall SS is a huge disappointment . If you want to watch a successful satire on sex watch  Poisonous Women   Gynaikes Dhlhthrio  by Nick Zervos which is funny and caustic . Many times I believe that SS is a bad rip  off of that movie For the good acting at least I will give this turkey        5  10".

Countless well known greek actors in the cast. Two of the most popular tv directors. In greece this film had a  massive hype which can only be compared to the hype of titanic!Safe sex my view First of all i would like to say before i write my view that i am a big fan of the cinemai have stopped watching commercial movies a long time ago.I have attended many Movie festivals and the last one was a Kenzi Mizoguchi festival in greece which was truly superb.Then why did i watch the movie? My friends aren't like me they don't watch a movie that's not a blockbaster they are totally tasteless so we have like an unsaid agreement i watch movies they likethey watch movies i like. So it was their turn to choose and they chose Safe Sex... the weird thing was that i really wanted to see this movie cause i heard like many good comments of people who i trust. So we went out and barely found a ticket and bought some popcorn and stuff and started watching the movie... I must say that i was at first impressed by the countless actors that apeared before melater on i thought Why do these people laugh? this comedy had no good jokes but only COUNTLESS bad jokes when i say countless i mean that i doubt even if 20 seconds passed by without another tasteless joke was said.So i was wondering why didn't i laugh and i turned and saw my friends....George who's favorite movie is Fame laughed all the time I wasn't suprised Tina the only friend who has watched almost as many movies as i have seemed sceptical and then there was the Half movie Breakwe spoke of what we thought firstly george said that it was possibly the best movie he has watched this yearthan i said it was possibly the only movie i have seen that had no scriptand then tina agreed with me and added that she hasn't seen worst jokes on a movie in her whole life! Our views wasn't changed until the end because nothing really changed. What i thought after watching the movie? It's a pity that good greek movies don't get more than a total of 110 the tickets this movie got! This movie doesn't mark a new age of good movies in greece but a new age of countless tasteless commercial movies in greece!".

I must say that i was at first impressed by the countless actors that apeared before melater on i thought Why do these people laugh? this comedy had no good jokes but only COUNTLESS bad jokes when i say countless i mean that i doubt even if 20 seconds passed by without another tasteless joke was said.So i was wondering why didn't i laugh and i turned and saw my friends....George who's favorite movie is Fame laughed all the time I wasn't suprised Tina the only friend who has watched almost as many movies as i have seemed sceptical and then there was the Half movie Breakwe spoke of what we thought firstly george said that it was possibly the best movie he has watched this yearthan i said it was possibly the only movie i have seen that had no scriptand then tina agreed with me and added that she hasn't seen worst jokes on a movie in her whole life! Our views wasn't changed until the end because nothing really changed. What i thought after watching the movie? It's a pity that good greek movies don't get more than a total of 110 the tickets this movie got! This movie doesn't mark a new age of good movies in greece but a new age of countless tasteless commercial movies in greece!";

Mike Kellin portrays the inebriated Sgt. McVey and in his way looks like another version of the rubber faced Lewis.

	schema:headline " One of Their Best";
	schema:reviewBody "A bunch of comedic misadventures surround an army training camp office.One of the best of M  L. One reason is a clever script adapted from a stage play. That means better than usual comedic lines and also that Lewis's mugging isn't the only funny element. Unlike his later films Lewis complements the laughs here instead of monopolizing them. Also Martin gets to warble a few tunes in his smooth baritone. I especially like the recordbooth duet with Polly Bergen that's really quite charming. And I wonder what happened to the quite talented Jean Ruth as the befuddled Millie who can't seem to decide where she works or whom she's dating. Ruth shows a lot of comedic spark in the role but appears to have left the industry soon after. Too bad.Not everything is roses. Being an exstage play means the story is pretty much confined to a single set with characters rushing in and out. Keeping up with the diverse lot may require a scorecard. Of course there's nothing new about the comedic potential of misfits in the military and this one was followed by several more ML entries in a similar vein. Anyway the act here in their first film is still fresh energetic and funny.".

	onyx:emotionText "A bunch of comedic misadventures surround an army training camp office.One of the best of M  L. One reason is a clever script adapted from a stage play. That means better than usual comedic lines and also that Lewis's mugging isn't the only funny element. Unlike his later films Lewis complements the laughs here instead of monopolizing them. Also Martin gets to warble a few tunes in his smooth baritone. I especially like the recordbooth duet with Polly Bergen that's really quite charming. And I wonder what happened to the quite talented Jean Ruth as the befuddled Millie who can't seem to decide where she works or whom she's dating. Ruth shows a lot of comedic spark in the role but appears to have left the industry soon after. Too bad.Not everything is roses.

	schema:reviewBody "While getting through the opening credits I was amazed to discover that this movie was 'adapted from a play'. The film not only has the look and feel of a play it also has the look and feel of a bare boned TV test pilot episode of MASH that has gone terribly terribly wrong. However if you've never seen any Martin  Lewis films this film is a good place to start. The reason it's a good place to start is because after this film the films can only get better.While 'At War With The Army' is not a classic comedy it does feature a handful of chuckles that hold a mild interest. You get to see a glimpse of Martin  Lewis' stage act something you would see put to better effect some time later in 'The Caddy'. There are a couple of Dean Martin musical numbers for the fans of Dino and for the Lewis fans there's tons and tons of facial expressions mimicry and cross dressing.Although the film formula for the Martin  Lewis movies never strayed too far from their Straight ManIdiot routine what is a little surprising here is how mean the character of Sgt. Puccinelli Dean Martin is to Pfc. Alvin Korwin Jerry Lewis throughout the film. Because of his attitude towards Lewis Martin comes off mainly as boorish and selfcentered. This doesn't do Martin any favors when he sings his songs at the nightclub or in the recording studio you just want something really bad to happen to him. One wonders if Hal Walker the director forgot he was making a comedy. Making Martin's character such an ahole seems to be a cheap way to make the audience feel sympathy for Lewis' character.Well that would be fine but remember this is Jerry Lewis in 'At War With The Army' not Harpo Marx in 'A Night At The Opera'. Lewis isn't naturally lovable like Harpo Lewis becomes irritating in almost every film he's ever been in that's his charm right? What makes the other films of Martin  Lewis work is that Dean sticks up for Lewis he's even amused by him to some extent. There's no reason for Martin to dislike Lewis so much in this film. I could understand the friction between their characters in 'The Stooge' but here his hatred has no merit. I mean isn't it enough that Lewis is playing this 'Cinderella' type of character can't we feel for him enough as it is? Making Dino such a heavy in the film just to give Lewis some sympathy from the audience was a mistake. Walker should've made them to be best friends that climbed up through the army ranks at different speeds. Dino is on the fast track because he's a likable and able soldier and Lewis is on the longer track because he's a born potato peeler and mop swabber. Remember the title is 'At War With The Army' not 'At War With Pfc. Alvin Korwin'.Pointing out all of the silly forms to sign and army procedures is what works best in the film. It never hits too hard with its army satire but it does effectively point out the wasteful and mindless protocol that has to be followed and how this protocol sets up power structures within the ranks. Again it comes off as a bare boned TV test pilot of MASH.THE MOMENT WHERE YOU CRINGELewis says under the pressure while being bullied by the highranking officers at training camp that concentration camp has got to be better than this. Hmmmwell that's a pretty offensive line. However I think this line takes on a whole new meaning when one remembers that some twenty years later Lewis would try to make a comedy that takes place in a German concentration camp The Day The Clown Cried.The best moment comes when Martin  Lewis do a scene from 'Going My Way' with Martin as Bing Crosby and Lewis as Barry Fitzgerald. It comes off as surprisingly touching if not just a little out of place. You also think to yourself why wasn't the rest of this movie anywhere as good as this?Recommended viewing only for inclusive film collectors fans of Lewis  Martin or very young children. 610. Clark Richards".

The film is an army comedya type of film that was very popular around 19401941 but had a bit of a resurgence in the 1950swith films like this one No Time for Sergeants and Jumping Jacks. Compared to such classic films as these plus Caught in the Draft Buck Privates and Tanks a Million At War With the Army comes up very shortmostly because it just doesn't have the laughs or chemistry the other films had.Before joining the Army Jerry and Dean had been friends. Now Dean's a sergeant and Jerry is a lowly private. And quite often Dean bosses Jerry aboutsort of like some sort of slave. But most of the film consists of Jerry doing his thing and Dean doing hisand not at all like a team. As a result the overall plot isn't particularly good but the viewer instead is waiting for good momentslittle gems that appear here and there. One of the best is seeing Jerry in draghe made a very very interesting and hairy blonde! The reaction of everyone in the bar was priceless! And some of the songs aren't bad.

It just has that feel to it for example the first 30 minutes of the film is in two rooms in a military office. The production values here were moderate at best  it was the first film to be produced by Martin  Lewis' own film company  York Productions. Nevertheless with the restoration it's decent to watch.One of the problems here is that the plot as thin as an anorexic. It's about 20 minutes into the film before any plot at all emerges. Meanwhile there are a few funny lines along the caliber of He used to be a soda jerk but he ran outta soda.About 30 minutes into the film Dean Martin has his first song  Tonda Wanda Hoy a clever romantic song with a Hawaiian theme. Polly Bergen Dean's love interest doesn't come into the film until 50 minutes in. She really was quite lovely. It's about this time when Dean and Polly duet on the best song of the picture  You And Your Beautiful Eyes it's a snappy song with a poor arrangement better to listen to the Capitol recording.As far as Jerry Lewis he essentially plays the same character he played in every other Martin  Lewis picture.In terms of other supporting actors Mike Kellin is along why did he become an actor? as is band leader Dick Stabile who has a small supporting role.Suffice it to say that this film is of interest mainly to Martin  Lewis fans and I am a fan of Martin.

This was their first one as the only stars having previously had to share billing with others on their previous two My Friend Irma and My Friend Irma Goes West. Dean is the sergeant and Jerry is the lowly private who has to endure his commands even though they were previously good friends. Those beginning scenes of Jerry being yelled at aren't funny but Lewis gets some hilarious moments like when he dresses like a woman and fools a drunk Mike Kellin one of his officers in a bar or his dealings with a berserk soda machine. Dean as usual croons some good tunes including one with Polly Bergin who's not such a bad singer herself. The comedy for the most part is uneven though it's worth it when things come to a head near the end. So on that note At War with the Army is worth a look. P.S. Lewis' actual natural voice emerges when the picture ends.".

Dean is the sergeant and Jerry is the lowly private who has to endure his commands even though they were previously good friends. Those beginning scenes of Jerry being yelled at aren't funny but Lewis gets some hilarious moments like when he dresses like a woman and fools a drunk Mike Kellin one of his officers in a bar or his dealings with a berserk soda machine. Dean as usual croons some good tunes including one with Polly Bergin who's not such a bad singer herself. The comedy for the most part is uneven though it's worth it when things come to a head near the end. So on that note At War with the Army is worth a look. P.S. Lewis' actual natural voice emerges when the picture ends.";

	schema:headline " This mediocre comedy is required viewing of course.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is required viewing since it is Martin and Lewis' first movie. As a comedy it's not that great. It's not very funny there's a lot of time wasted on generic dialog and Dean's character isn't likable since he mostly shouts bullies womanizes and lies throughout. The movie is based on a play and it seems that some portions that may have played well in a live setting don't work on the screen. I can't be too sure since I don't know what is new to this movie and didn't appear in the play or what did work in 1950 but doesn't work in 2005.I got a good nostalgic feeling watching the movie. It gave me a feeling of sitting in a playhouse in 1940 with that era of audience and laughing at silly running gags like the half open door. Now that the bar has been raised so many times with comedy superstars like Eddie Murphy Richard Pryor Steve Martin Tom Hanks and Jerry Lewis himself it's fun to watch material from a simpler time.Dean comes across well. His singing is great he dances and does an excellent impersonation of Bing Crosby. This is a good showcase of his talent.Jerry also comes across well as expected with all of his trademarks. Bumbling clowning funny faces pouting mime. His singing was better than I expected. He switches off between various singing voices like his zany voice mock romantic sarcastic etc. He can hit the high notes and he sounds good.The plot is pretty good. The various subplots involving Jerry his wife and baby his former friendship with Dean Dean's two girlfriends and his military career Dean's romantic rival and the captain and his wife make for a somewhat complex plot. The movie builds up to the climax where all of the misunderstandings and intentional subterfuges by Dean's character come together with seven actors on screen at the same time fighting each other to work things out. We're lucky that all seven made it into the TV frame! I was touched by the ending in the same way that I remember always being touched by Martin and Lewis' movies as though they are really good friends and that's heartwarming.I was surprised to see so much polish on Martin and Lewis for their first movie but you have to remember that they had been doing a live act before this so that explains it.I can imagine that a lot of the physical comedy gags like running in and out of doors throwing things around the room jumping in another's arms running around the room turning off lights fighting with the drink machine etc would have worked in a play where the actors are actually doing that stuff live right in front of you. That would have added a lot of action to this play where plays can sometimes be boring. On screen it doesn't work for me. It seems silly but nothing more.Martin and Lewis' act is something like the Smothers Brothers' act. Martin scolds Lewis and Lewis gets meek and pouts.I think most of the value in this movie comes from the performance pieces. The feature songs dances impersonations and large comedy bits like the drink machine scene and Jerry as a woman are good stuff. I'm sorry to say that the rest of the material which is probably the original play doesn't quite cut it.".

Most of what I remembered was the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. In seeing it the second time I'm 24 years older I've worked for attorneys I've had an experience with the justice system. And still what I take away from The Verdict is the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. After Matthew McConnaughey made A Time to Kill he asked his agents if he could meet Paul Newman. I guess someone told him they were similar. Newman said to him This is a time to not take yourself seriously and your work very seriously. When Matthew McConnaughey has a 50 year career you'll talk I'll be gone  but it's evident that Paul Newman takes his work very seriously indeed.The Verdict is an old story  the drunken attorney who takes a case think The People Against O'Hara for one  but this one has a stunning cast which includes Jack Warden James Mason Charlotte Rampling and Lindsay Crouse. And it asks one of life's great questions  what do you do when losing is just not an option? Drunken disillusioned ambulancechasing Frank Galvin takes a slamdunk hospital negligence case thrown to him by an investigator friend Warden. His expert witness tells him he can win. So Galvin doesn't tell his client about a lowball offer takes the thing to trial loses his star witness hires a pathetic expert is reported by his client for failing to give them the offer they would have happily taken  simply put there's no paddle but if he doesn't get down the river any hope of reconstituting his life is over. Gone. David Mamet's script stacks everything against Frank but when you're fighting for your life failure is not an option.Newman is a wonder with his loser posture and hyperventilation and his desperateness. It's in his voice it's on his face it's in his smile it's in his shaking hands. He's up against James Mason and his huge law firm a smug welldressed bunch who will stop at nothing to win. One might think this type of firm is a clich it isn't. One of the characters says it best  You have no loyalty to anyone you don't care who you hurt. You're all whores. Unfortunately in real life all attorneys are pretty much the same but at least in film we occasionally are shown a decent one. When this film was made the public had not yet been subjected to the Dream Team the Robert Blake Case the Menendez Brothers. But even today knowing better you can't help but buy into Newman's frantic sincerity.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent with top honors going to Mason's smooth Concannon and Lindsay Crouse who gives us the most powerful five minutes of the film with her magnificent performance as the admission nurse.Is it a manipulative film? As hell. Is it feel good? You betcha. But take it from someone who knows an unfortunate truth  that justice is for the rich who pull in favors and have the money to fight everyone lies their teeth off and the jury system is sad  if I can be swept away by The Verdict and by Paul Newman's performance another Oscar he was cheated out of  you're gonna eat it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this movie is deceiving.  THE VERDICT suggests a courtroom drama something like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or INHERIT THE WIND.  It does have some riveting court scenes but what happens outside of court and to Paul Newman is the real attraction here.  The title not only refers to the inevitable decision of the important case of the film but also to how the Newman character is going to live the rest of his life. Should he sell out and take the easy settlement or take the highly regarded archdiocese of Boston to court for real justice.  These are the questions Newman must face in this profound drama that seems more like a picture of the 70's than an 80's film.Director Sidney Lumet has dealt with the legal system before in his first film 12 ANGRY MEN.  He takes it to a more personal level and Paul Newman one of the finest actors of the past 40 years is the person to do it.  He is a legend and he bares his soul as attorney Frank Galvin a lonely corrupt drunk whose license to practice law is hanging by a thread.  Jack Warden plays his trusty assistant who gets him a case that could help Frank change his life.  Warden however has had enough.Newman plays an excellent drunk even cracking an egg into an 8am beer to start his day.  This is a dim looking movie shot during a cold winter in Boston.  There are no great shots or even any emotionallyrousing speeches but this is Lumet's style.  It is plodding and we see into the life of a lawyer on the ropes.  James Mason is perfect as the slimy defense lawyer. Newman is constantly underestimated because of past failures. He is a drunk but he still has some tricks up his sleeve.NOTE Look closely at the closing argument given by Newman.  In the background you can glimpse a thenunknown Bruce Willis.".

These are the questions Newman must face in this profound drama that seems more like a picture of the 70's than an 80's film.Director Sidney Lumet has dealt with the legal system before in his first film 12 ANGRY MEN.  He takes it to a more personal level and Paul Newman one of the finest actors of the past 40 years is the person to do it.  He is a legend and he bares his soul as attorney Frank Galvin a lonely corrupt drunk whose license to practice law is hanging by a thread.  Jack Warden plays his trusty assistant who gets him a case that could help Frank change his life.  Warden however has had enough.Newman plays an excellent drunk even cracking an egg into an 8am beer to start his day.  This is a dim looking movie shot during a cold winter in Boston.  There are no great shots or even any emotionallyrousing speeches but this is Lumet's style.  It is plodding and we see into the life of a lawyer on the ropes.  James Mason is perfect as the slimy defense lawyer. Newman is constantly underestimated because of past failures. He is a drunk but he still has some tricks up his sleeve.NOTE Look closely at the closing argument given by Newman.  In the background you can glimpse a thenunknown Bruce Willis.";

Why he didn't get the Oscar for this role but instead got it for the lackluster The Color of Money is beyond me.  The movie is actually about redemption or the attempt to be redeemed.His interpretation of Frank Galvin a desperate conniving downtothelastcase attorney is fascinating and totally convincing.   And he has a fantastic supporting cast  from Jack Warden as his partner Charlotte Rampling as his chance for romantic redemption Milo O'Shea as the corrupt judge Lindsay Crouse as his surprising aceuphissleeve and most of all in a landmark supporting actor role James Mason as the seemingly distinguished and respected defense attorney.And I found the direction by Sidney Lumet to be once again outstanding. Lumet has such a long list of great movies that you wonder why he has never won an Oscar or been given an AFI Lifetime Achievement award.  This is a riveting movie  about the law but mainly about the flawed nature of the human beings who are entrusted with it.   Please hear Newman as Frank Galvin on his last crippled despairing leg give the summation to the case.   It needs to be carved in marble somewhere. David Mamet who wrote the screenplay deserves accolades for how he was able to hand Paul Newman such a moving summation.  The summation is about life not just the law.  It is a masterpiece worth seeing the entire movie for.Most of all it is Newman's Finest Hour.".

Then throw into that his terrific courtroom scenes his arguments with the judge in chambers it is just a sensational performance all around.The level of acting is high all around in this movie. James Mason was Oscar nominated for playing the silky smooth totally corrupt defense attorney. Jack Warden shines as Frank Galvin's worldweary former law partner. Lindsey Crouse has a small role as a nurse but is given the most powerful and dramatic moment in the entire movie. Her crossexamination by James Mason is where the movie really shines and shows that Paul Newman can keep his ego in check. How many movies give the most powerful and dramatic moment of the film to one of the secondary players? How many lead actors would be willing to just sit there quiet in a chair while a bit player and the second male lead share the big moment? It was a bold decision by both Newman director Sidney Lumet and writer David Mamet and it is unforgettable.The movie shows the two extremes of the practice of law.

	schema:reviewBody "This one really isn't to be missed certainly among the best of the courtroom dramas. The acting. Well first of all nobody is bad. The most nearly negligible performance is by Wesley Addy who at least looks the part of the elegant doctor and who is a competent actor. The other principals are outstanding. Charlotte Rampling with that odd face  sultriness imposed kicking and screaming upon boniness  is unusually good and even manages to project a kind of believable guilty remorse which has never been her strong suit. James Mason is almostunflappable as Concannon attorney for the defense. Marvelous the way he puts quotation marks around the word expert while questioning the plaintiff's witness. Edward Binns is stolid as the savvy but moral bishop who wants to wrap things up without making waves. What is the truth? he asks Newman. Jack Warden is plumply likable as always. He's seems to have aged more than Binns with whom he'd worked a quarter of a century earlier in Twelve Angry Men. Lindsay Crouse in a small but crucial role is appealingly Irish. Milo O'Shea is sliminess itself. I don't know why perhaps his impish accent but there is always something amusing about him as if unable to quite shake what Erving Goffman called role distance the knowledge that he's playing a part accompanied by an awareness of the absurdity of doing so. Even Bruce Willis is in this playing a visitor to the courtroom. I was an atmosphere person in a Boston courtroom too in From the Hip  a far superior movie. Ask anybody. Ask my mother. And Paul Newman is flawless. Robert Redford was supposed to play Frankie Galvin but he wouldn't have been up to the part. The role requires the compelling anguish that Newman brings to it and he does it perfectly. Redford is much too cool for that. I will mention just one scene of Newman's that is emblematic. He stands in his darkened office  Warden watching soundlessly from the background  and calls the defendants' law firm about a settlement they have already withdrawn. He paces around talking into the phone hardly able to breathe congested with not just mucous but self hatred cajoling them pounding on the desk with his knuckles filled with an empty bravado. Redford couldn't do it. Practically nobody could do it.Almost everything fits together perfectly in this film. Sidney Lumet opens with a shot of Newman alone in silhouette playing a pinball machine in a Boston bar drinking beer. The pinball game serves as a token for the trajectory of his life during the course of the film. Wardrobe firstrate. How New England. Multilayered dark clothing in Newman's case black woolly and fussy. Sound excellent. Little noises hardly noticeable form almost a background score. The old wooden floors creak when people step on them. An example of one or two good creaks the scene in Concannon's office when he is welcoming Laura back to the law. Twirledup telephone lines squeak when someone pulls on them. The tinkling of ice cubes in liquor glasses. The heavy breathing of nervous or defeated people. The slamming of ancient desk drawers. Garbage trucks groaning and whining in the city streets at dawn. Production design as good as it gets. Everything looks old as if it has been used and lived in for years not shabby but burnished with age all mahogany wood and scarlet carpets. Lighting and photography up there with the best. Most scenes are dark  it's midwinter in Boston  but not too dark cleverly lighted. The snow in the streets is literally blue as if it had just leaped out of an impressionist landscape. Tree branches glisten with moisture on slick nighttime streets. Tinsel draped along a bar ceiling twinkles with fraudulent joy. The weakness? The movie is so good I hate to mention it but the script leaves something to be desired. It almost betrays the characters. I don't mind the legal absurdities so much. Okay so things would never really happen this way. The judge would have to grant a continuance and so forth. It's not so much that as the motivation and the set speeches that are bothersome especially Newman's and they're critical. The banter and small talk are fine. But Newman's conversion from a drunken cynical ambulance chaser to a principled attorney of reawakened morals in the course of twominute photo session with a comatose patient is patently unbelievable. Where did all that conscience if that's what it is? suddenly come from? He flops backwards as if stunned. Why? The script does its best to back up his epiphany. The images of his patient develop as a real person not just a dollar sign on the Polaroid photos a mirror image of what's going on in his mind. But as Warden repeatedly points out his job is to win some money for his clients so they can leave their comatose sister in good care and get on with their lives in Tucson. Instead he turns down the church's offer because he sees a trial as a challenge to his personal pride as a means of redemption. Is that kind of pride a mortal or a venial sin? He loses sight of what the whole legal process is about because of this selfinvolvement. It wouldn't be so bad if he realized this but in fact he never gives it a thought.Finally Newman's summation it sounds as if it had been put together by some high school kid whose homework assignment was to write an essay of at least two hundred words about what life means to me. I believe there is justice in our hearts says Newman more to himself than to the jury. No kidding.None of this criticism can subtract from all the other virtues of the film. It's among the best of its kind.".

Sidney Lumet opens with a shot of Newman alone in silhouette playing a pinball machine in a Boston bar drinking beer. The pinball game serves as a token for the trajectory of his life during the course of the film. Wardrobe firstrate. How New England. Multilayered dark clothing in Newman's case black woolly and fussy. Sound excellent. Little noises hardly noticeable form almost a background score. The old wooden floors creak when people step on them. An example of one or two good creaks the scene in Concannon's office when he is welcoming Laura back to the law. Twirledup telephone lines squeak when someone pulls on them. The tinkling of ice cubes in liquor glasses. The heavy breathing of nervous or defeated people. The slamming of ancient desk drawers. Garbage trucks groaning and whining in the city streets at dawn. Production design as good as it gets. Everything looks old as if it has been used and lived in for years not shabby but burnished with age all mahogany wood and scarlet carpets. Lighting and photography up there with the best. Most scenes are dark  it's midwinter in Boston  but not too dark cleverly lighted. The snow in the streets is literally blue as if it had just leaped out of an impressionist landscape. Tree branches glisten with moisture on slick nighttime streets. Tinsel draped along a bar ceiling twinkles with fraudulent joy. The weakness? The movie is so good I hate to mention it but the script leaves something to be desired. It almost betrays the characters. I don't mind the legal absurdities so much. Okay so things would never really happen this way. The judge would have to grant a continuance and so forth. It's not so much that as the motivation and the set speeches that are bothersome especially Newman's and they're critical. The banter and small talk are fine. But Newman's conversion from a drunken cynical ambulance chaser to a principled attorney of reawakened morals in the course of twominute photo session with a comatose patient is patently unbelievable. Where did all that conscience if that's what it is? suddenly come from? He flops backwards as if stunned. Why? The script does its best to back up his epiphany. The images of his patient develop as a real person not just a dollar sign on the Polaroid photos a mirror image of what's going on in his mind. But as Warden repeatedly points out his job is to win some money for his clients so they can leave their comatose sister in good care and get on with their lives in Tucson. Instead he turns down the church's offer because he sees a trial as a challenge to his personal pride as a means of redemption. Is that kind of pride a mortal or a venial sin? He loses sight of what the whole legal process is about because of this selfinvolvement. It wouldn't be so bad if he realized this but in fact he never gives it a thought.Finally Newman's summation it sounds as if it had been put together by some high school kid whose homework assignment was to write an essay of at least two hundred words about what life means to me. I believe there is justice in our hearts says Newman more to himself than to the jury. No kidding.None of this criticism can subtract from all the other virtues of the film. It's among the best of its kind.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm getting a little older and typing less but I can still watch a film in this case 17 times and know when I see brilliance. Now it's time to share a few thoughts. First Newman is always good...but this is different. This is no Slap Shot or The Sting Newman he is perfect in his role as Galvin and deserved the Oscar. I really can't think of a bad performance or scene in this film. If I had to pick one I'd single out Lindsay Crouse...she always seems to come across as wooden...here she shows some emotion but her timing and delivery take away from it. So Paul Newman is at his best here as is James Mason a devilish best. The movie is about redemption reward conscience power money The Church the system...and how a hopeless lawyer somehow has his lightbulb moment...and against all odds does the right thing. That Lumet went with the original scriptscreenplay makes one wonder what the OTHERS were like but everything in this film the story the characters the lighting the underlying plots come together to make one of those perfect movies. After 17 viewings the only bad thing I can say is that I felt the titling though perfect in its sense of movement and delivery could have been better the Old English Script seems overthetop. But even the TITLES demand watching...Newman nursing a beer playing pinball dark lighting all we see and hear is Newman and the sound of the pinball machine as the opening credits roll...then we fade into the film. You've got to see this movie at least once go back again and catch some of the other things going on. This is what filmmaking is all about an excellent cast script and situation. They don't make them like this anymore although The Shawshank Redemption comes close. I give this one 10 stars it should be required viewing for aspiring attorneys so that they never lose the human side of things. THAT cause may be lost but The Verdict is very close to perfection an excellent film. Peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Lumet reaches into a certain style in this film that took me a few minutes to if the word is right adjust to. One might almost think the way he keeps the camera on a character or goes for the shots keeping the characters far away longshots or in dark spaces when not in the courtroom or seemingly small in the scope of the areas around then as detached. It is but therein lies his talents as a director by letting the acting slow but very sturdy and all based on David Mamet's script also not one of his very best but then again different from his plays. It's not a great film by the director as some have gone to lengths to write about but it is one that is resonating further as I write this and does successfully dig into further what it means to be a lawyer or just trying to live when odds are stacked against you. I'm almost reminded of a European director here searching under the obvious in the story points of which in the case that could just as well be on an OK episode of Law  Order doing more of a character study than a fullon courtroom drama.It helps however that Paul Newman is at the top of his game here giving a performance that is textured if that's a word to use as well and kind of sad. He's playing Frank Gavin as much of a tragic figure as a real human being here and there's a scene where he is in his office at a big moment of doubt there is no other case there is no other case. Newman is able to tap into what Lumet and Mamet have in the material superlatively as if he knows how this character thinks. The early scenes show him as a lowlevel guy ambulance chaser who gets a case of a malpractice of a woman. In one of the most crucial and successful scenes in the film for both director writer and star Gavin takes a couple of Polaroids of the girl in the hospital seemingly just doing his work but then has a pause and the photos come into focus. This kind of changeofthought has been done in other dramas to be sure but here it really clicks with the pace the mood and timing from Newman and how this situation is given room to breathe.If the rest of the film doesn't follow this same pattern it's not necessarily a fullon crutch. The courtroom scenes themselves are very good with James Mason among other British character actors convincing in their roles of the more 'weighty' side of the court. Jack Warden adds some presence too as Gavin's partner and adds a memory of Lumet's own classic 12 Angry Men. Only the subplot between Newman and Rampling seems just slightly off. Her character is necessary for the film and there are one or two excellent scenes with her in it particularly the one with him feeling most shaky before the trial. But her part is that of a more conventional picture and her motivations are only made so clear as to not be totally believable. The final scene between her and Newman is maybe the best out of all of them but it goes without saying that it's mainly a credit to him and Lumet a kind of catharsis that is laid on that does add a fine point.The Verdict is not really one of those films that is overrated in the scope of things and it's possibly more of the deserved Oscar nominated turns for Newman when compared to The Color of Money good not great there. It's worth seeing again even as it is a different kind of courtroom picture where the good and evil in man is not as revealed as in Lumet's first feature but there are some poignant scenes of the need of redemption for a broken person.".

While the plot itself remains rather grounded and straightforward without any particularly groundbreaking elements Paul Newman's masterful performance as well as the great supporting actors and actresses are what helps this drama in succeeding at depicting what it aims to depict.Newman plays an attorney who needs to pull himself together from his drinking problem in order to win a lawsuit surrounding the case of a woman suffering severe brain damage at a hospital. It should come as no surprise that Newman completely immerses himself in the role in a way only Paul Newman can be expected to. The dialogues are another main part of the movie's most intriguing aspects flowing so well together that it's almost impossible to lose attention of what's happening. At its heart the movie is not just a courtroom drama it's about humans dealing with their personal conditions and problems and it's a movie which knows how to form a bond with viewers and keep them connected to the characters.Sadly the movie has not reached a status as a classic of the 1980's. Perhaps it simply was not memorable enough to most viewers or perhaps it is too fine a movie in a decade remembered mostly for action movies horror flicks or comedies.

With 30 years of acting under his belt Paul Newman gave an outstanding performance as a drunk washedup lawyer that was handed a cakewalk that he proceeded to screw up. He managed to come out smelling like a rose through luck and skill as a lawyer. Newman was superb! He should have gotten an Oscar for this film and I am not saying that just because I like seeing someone stick it to the high and mighty.Sidney Lumet was also great as director as should have been rewarded for this and not just given an honorary Oscar.Bruce Willis has another walkon role.".

But if you want to enjoy Jack Warden who brings it all on or Milo O'Shea another veteran and of course James Mason his pauses his mannerisms don't miss this gem. The script tight seamless. Terrific film and I won't give any of it away. I own this film and as far as I am concerned this is one fine movie to have in your collection.There are many quotable quotes I don't think I am talking out of school . . . The scene picking the jury with Jack Warden in the background. The camaraderie between these two is something that you want to believe they took home off the set. Newman you want me to go wee wee wee all the way home.".

	schema:reviewBody "The man is a failure ... he's a failure because circumstances made him so. He's no different than you and me. He's just unlucky. And you know how it is. Adversity calls adversity. You lose your job your wife leaves you you start drinking you can't have another job back and like that you're labeled as a failure a loser. Frank Galvin played by Paul Newman is one of them. A loser. A Boston lawyer he became what they call an ambulance chaser. A man who gives you a card during your father's funeral to tell you he was a friend of him. The first scenes of Lumet's The Verdict clearly announces the character as a man who's not your typical Paul Newman's character he's no Hud no Cool Hand Luke no Eddie Felson yet it's one of the most brilliant and masterful performances from the late actor.Frank Galvin hasn't solved a case in years. He hasn't won anything. He developed a 'brilliant' reputation that totally discredited him in the profession. Obviously something must change in his life and Galvin although not much appreciated has one true friend  Mick played by the late Jack Warden who manages to get him a golden case to get back on the rails. A guaranteed win if Galvin accepts. He does but for selfish reasons at least at first. He cares for people he cares for the case but something is burning inside him he cares for himself. There is a profound desire of redemption calling from the bottom of his soul he tries to find the right way and this case is the promised land for him. A young mother condemned to coma for the rest of her life for what appears to be a medical error. Obviously Galvin can't fail.BUT. What is failure? and what is success? That's the genius of the film. When Galvin takes snapshots of the poor victim he realizes one thing he didn't quite get at the beginning. She's a victim of a criminal injustice. It's clear. Any other thing is a lie any other attempt to silence the truth is criminal and anyone who accepts that is accomplice. Anyone who accepts anything he believes against whether because it is untrue or unjust is a weak. The weak is the one who doesn't believe in his own principles by not following them. The weak can win if he joins the liars the cheaters the winners to win by default but he'll always be weak because he doesn't believe in himself and will forever live with that. There's no salvation for the weak even if he wins. Galvin might be a loser but he's not weak. Galvin is flawed indeed. He has many weaknesses alcohol being the biggest one but his evolution all through the movie is a great example of an inspiring character study from the brilliant director Sidney Lumet who in 1982 had an already impressive and qualitative filmography. Galvin shows how justice is an abstract but powerful idea that can only live through our deep faith in our success in the quest for truth because what is true implies justice. Justice's blindness is a noble concept except when the blindness is deliberate. That is corruption blinding justice disguising it using influence to silence it. Galvin despises this kind of corruption refuses the generous offer from the opposite side who like the people he defends doesn't want a trial and prefers an outofcourt settlement. But HIS mission is personal though he doesn't fight for selfish reasons anymore but for his idea of justice. And hell yes they'll go to trial.It's quite ironic that the movie lost the Best Picture Award to Gandhi when Galvin is almost a Gandhilike figure when you examine his ideas and beliefs. Everything is against him yet he believes he's right. Gandhi said Even if you are a minority of one the truth is the truth this is Galvin's spirit. He believes in himself he's given a mission that will redeem him by bringing justice to the unfortunate couple to a family devastated by the loss of a young woman. In this case the opposite side is defended by the powerful suave charmingly villainous Ed Concannon brilliantly portrayed by James Mason. Concannon practices law with such perfectionism and obedience the case is like David vs. Goliath. Evertyhing seems lost everyone is against Galvin including a memorable onesided judge. But he goes on despite his fears his mistakes his clumsiness the way he seems so unsure of his words ... Frank Galvin doesn't have the phlegm of Atticus Finch nor the flamboyance of Hans Rolfe or the charisma of Arthur Kirkland but his weaknesses make him 'strong' and the case 'personal' in the noblest sense of the word. This movie is probably one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever directed because it gives its true meaning to the word 'justice'. Justice is not about values it's about faith it's a blind faith which makes us take all the risks because ironically justice can only be accomplished through 'illegal' ways when the opposite side buries important elements under obscure judiciary concepts and in these cases when the system is against Justice. Frank Galvin was against the system and believed in Justice. He's a hero. Frank Galvin fought for an idea of Justice threatened by the system men like the judge or Concannon who make justice sometimes unfair. The Verdict is the greatest courtroom drama because it is the one that gives you the greatest faith in justice ...".

	schema:reviewBody "This the utmost example of people involved in making a film who truly know exactly what they are doing tells the story of a pathetic alcoholic lawyer scraping the bottom of the barrel who presses on with a medical malpractice case which has left a girl braindead in a permanently vegetative state in order to improve his own situation but discovers along the way that he is doing the right thing crusading in the interest of justice for the wronged girl.Paul Newman is entirely persuasive as the boozing attorney who beneath his morose impotence is a relentless force. We are surprised by how strict he can be in his behavior and belief systems during the case he takes. He is intently alert always putting his own needs ahead of any responsibility to others. A lonely man he stays far from the maddening crowd. For him life is a burdened practice not to be wasted away idly which is precisely what is happening to his life as the film opens finding him going from funeral to funeral attempting to con the bereaved into believing that he knew the deceased loved ones and wants to make sure they're represented by someone who cares. Every day he gropes drunkenly to apprehend it and wring as much profit as he can.The reason such a premise works so well is because of the wisdom and mechanics of David Mamet's writing. The internal problem that begins the story which is an adaptation of a bestselling novel by American trial lawyer Barry Reed Newman's hopelessness is succeeded by the external predicament the highly lucrative case which embodies all the murky details of medical clerical and legal procedure. Jack Warden Charlotte Rampling and James Mason are introduced and our hero Paul Newman finds himself with the decision to fight all encompassing immorality for which he is no match or to accept it which screams with the practical leverage he needs to get his life back together. He rejects to take the juicy settlement which compels us into the upsetting second section of the film.Like many traditional stories after the turning point this one splits into two parts the arrangement and the decisive moment at which the outcome seems to be clear. Mamet constructs his scenes so that they correspond to the arrangements for the trial juxtaposing the enormous legal cart James Mason is mounting under whose wheels devotees would throw themselves to be smashed counter to the disorganized hit or miss undertaking Galvin's running. Characteristically the stronger the opponent and the weaker the hero the more pungent the drama and the more severe the ascending friction.At the point at which things are at their lowest the scenes have amassed in a callous inescapable direction. The only element that seems to come from left field is the signature Mamet revelation which is held back from Newman but not from the audience. It's delicate letting the audience ahead of the hero because it takes the big chance of making the hero out to be misunderstood by us as stupid but Mamet had no other place to set the scene one that if you are familiar enough with his work can clearly see that he could not help but use and skillfully uses it to make things seem even gloomier to us than they do to the protagonist. It generates sympathy for him not condescension.The Verdict is a tribute to classic structure which determines that character is plot. Ideally if you're going to have a character arrive on the scene in a story long enough to tell someone how to go to the bathroom this individual had better be full enough that we can almost assume where they were before the story happened upon them.Not one scene is needless or redundant. It is film composition at its most succinct with each scene leading crisply and unavoidably into the next with a story development that is hardnosed in its importance. Sidney Lumet's oldfashioned sense of being a movie director has served him well especially early in his career as he hides the presence behind the camera and manipulates what is in front of it and how long it takes to show it. He leaves the gist of things to the screenwriter. His masterpiece Network was one of the few films one can truly say was a writer's movie. Frankly I think The Verdict is also a writer's movie because Lumet's perspective of film direction is letting the writer create the story so that the director can tell it.A true testament to this is that Lumet conserves the essential task of a movie a succession of images contrasting so that the difference between them triggers the story to broaden within the position of the viewer. Once we get the point of a scene whether the action within it is finished or not the film moves on. This is precisely what Mamet would come to do when he began directing his own films.".

It's methodical building up our sympathy making the characters believable. It's not filmed with any real panache but visually the job gets done and so we focus on the events and the acting. Indeed we often focus just on Newman who is intense without overdoing it pulling out some of his best subtle moody brooding and even angst. Boston as the backdrop is refreshing.

As it seems to me this film from the category of stylish and very thin.In a conversation with a Frenchman never touch upon the theme of the Second World War and especially the fascist occupation  because we are taught by the French experts.It is known that almost every Frenchman lives with the awareness of his national exclusiveness. This feeling was brought up for many centuries. Therefore to shoot a French movie about the events that are associated with the defeat and surrender without a fight of entire cities is a very delicate matter for the filmmaker.Probably I will leave not far from the truth if I assume that the French were waiting for such a film. They were waiting to again justify themselves first of all before themselves once again skillfully revenge and prove that even during the years of occupation they remained real Frenchmen  the cleverest the strongest and able to truly love.On the other hand the authors of the film needed to withstand a certain political correctness and if possible not to abuse the demonstration of the cruelty of the German invaders. The fact is that during the filming of the film twoyear talks ended in Europe concluding with the signing in 1975 of the Final Helsinki Act the birth of the OSCE. In fact this meant a great European truce and the beginning of a new life together. And during the truce it is known what happens to the eye of someone who remembers the old ...All this complicated the task of director Robert Enrico but he masterfully operated with all the film tools coped with it perfectly although in an ordinary French manner in a florid manner.One of the director's finds is the combination of flashbacks that is the memories of surgeon Julien about prewar life his acquaintance and love with Clara and the real situation where the Nazis have already occupied his country and the doctor's hands have to take up his gun. At the same time transitions to flashbacks do not create an acute contrast and the romantic soundtrack of the composer Francois de Rub helps the protagonist to swim in the waves of his memory. These memories as it were zombie Julien so that his revenge is not troublesome filled with confident and prudent actions. It is much more interesting to observe the revenge when it is performed by an ordinary person. It excites and makes the viewer to empathize.Another director's luck is the successful selection of actors. Philip Noiret and Romy Schneider seem to be created for each other a great duo. Frames flashbacks are covered with a light haze and this only emphasizes the grace and beauty of Romy Schneider.In 1976 the film was awarded the CESAR award immediately by categories Best film Robert Enrico Best actor Philip Noiret Best music Francois De Rube and more ...

There are some similarities especially the revenge motif but other than that 'Le vieux fusil' is quite a unique film on its own.Philippe Noiret is perfect to play the this character who becomes instantly obsessed with revenge after he finds his wife raped this is shown in a flashback but his character can only guess and burnt alive with a flame thrower and his daughter shot in the back. His character Julien is a respected doctor who tries to go on with his life in spite of the war even joking about a nurse's sex life and not putting up much of a fight when the enemy comes into his hospital to take some suspects away  what could he do?Well what he could do we see later on but only when his close family is involved. Like a trained soldier he works out a plan in which he continuously manages to keep the upper hand over the Germans who at some point are sure they are surrounded by many Partisans  his extensive knowledge of the castle and its architectural secrets being his great advantage.The film switches back and forth between sweet and sour memories of Julien his wife and his daughter and the brutal attacks he embarks upon to exact revenge  in the end it becomes clear how much he lost his mind. It did go back and forth a little too much for my taste but it's still a pretty unique and intense piece of film immersed in blood sweat and tears.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Le vieux fusil by Robert Enrico in 35mm at the cinema unfortunately dubbed into German and it was a hell of a strange film. Philippe Noiret is great in the lead role though totally unbelievable. First he marries Romy Schneider and then he kills a dozen trained German soldiers one after the other singlehandedly. The whole film basically knows only one sombre mood and doesn't really add any melodrama to what is happening. Incredibly this film won a Csar for best French film of the year what the heck!?  in a year where Zulawski's L'important c'est d'aimer was eligible!!! and was nominated for numerous more. While it was an interesting and worthwhile film I can't possibly see why this Rambotype revenge story was considered so greatimportant at the time it was made. At least I might have become a Noiretfan through this. The film is all about Noiret and Romy is only there as eyecandy or to explain the emotional turmoil of the lead character. She has to play her usual slutty role of a person with bipolar disorder and I can't help but wonder why she regularly chose those similar roles. Despite being a great actress Enrico really doesn't give her much to work with he is clearly no Zulawski... but maybe she was eager to do a more lighthearted role after her phenomenal and deservingly Csarwinning performance in L'important c'est d'aimer. I watched the edited version that was released to German theaters in the 70s and was missing at least the full scene of Romy's death. Will I watch more Enrico? Possibly. Am I intrigued? Yes. But is this really a remarkable film? I don't quite think so. Nevertheless very much worth seeing because of its utterly peculiar and bizarre vibe.".

If you are interested in movies that star the icon Philippe Noiret that most people would know from the Italian classic cinema Paradiso then you should watch some of his earlier work like this French master piece.

It took weeks to shake off the image of the grizzly and sadistic way Romy Schneider met her end. I'm sure these kind of atrocities took place in occupied Europebut it is another matter of having to put up with it on the screen. Noiret going Rambo style against the Germans is thrilling though a bit overthetop. Lots of style well acted but too grizzly for me.".

Robert Enrico dealt with War memorably in Au Coeur de la vie and here he does so again different war ageold tragedies. Superficially this comes under the 'last straw that broke the camel's back' heading crossed with what may be described as the Destry Rides Again syndrome the protagonist finally driven to take up the gun once cast aside. Enrico begins with an idyllic sequence as the Dandieu family complete with dog cycle through a countryside in which God is in his heaven and all's right with the world. The image freezes and a caption supplies the date 1944. We then meet the family again in wartime Julien Phillipe Noiret Clara Romy Schneider and young daughter Florence. Even in wartime this is a HAPPY family and unprepossessing men everywhere are thinking they could do with a dropdead gorgeous wife like Schneider whilst kids in the wake of mild chastisement wish they could belong to a family like THAT. Indeed Julien is so laidback he makes Bing Crosby seem riddled with tension and the film hinges on what makes this worm turn. With the Germans advancing Julien prevails upon a friend to drive wife daughter and dog to a country retreat he owns in a fairly isolated spot. When he gets a minute he drives up there himself just in time to see his daughter shot and his wife incinerated by a flamethrower making a full set of dead villagers. This of course is when he feels the need for revenge and so breaks out his old hunting rifle. This is where we may wonder why it has taken so much to rouse this peaceful man it is after all 1944 the fifth year of a world war and one in which France has been occupied for most of it surely even as a civilian he has seen sufficient horrors and as a surgeon has dealt with them at first hand. The next question we find ourselves asking is why he is content to go up against men armed with pistols riflesmachine guns grenades and flamethrowers with only a shotgun rather than picking off one man and appropriating his weaponry.If we don't dwell on these logical questions it is because the performances are so compelling as is Enrico's narrative style which switches back and forth in time but not necessarily chronologically and keeps well in reserve such relevations as the fact that Schneider already had the daughter when she met Noiret and was well aware of his plainness. This is nothing short of superb beautifully written directed and acted and more than worthy of its Best Film Cesar.".

He's a big fat man with white hair a white beard and blackrimmed glasses. He's probably the only guy like that who wouldn't be mistaken for Santa Clause. A couple of the other actors are decent mostly because they have expressive faces.The script though is very weak. It should have been killed long before it arrived on the screen. Half of it is a decent drama about an old man coming to terms with his past. That's always a potent subject. It doesn't even really have to be done well to make a good film. But the other half of the film is pure evil Guiseppe has a granddaughter whom he dearly loves. She is blind and Guiseppe wants to get her an operation to repair her sight before he dies. Yuck. The whole beingcuredfromblindness thing has been tired for decades. We can forgive Charlie Chaplin for doing it in City Lights. That film is too charming to criticize that much. Douglas Sirk did a pretty good soaper with a blindness angle in Magnificent Obsession. And we can look past it in Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. He was experimenting with the melodramatic genre and it was of interest. But Azzurro is playing the melodrama so cheaply. It's even too stupid to keep the music from swelling to all hell which makes the already embarrassing moments more so. Besides that little girl Francesca Pipoli is far too annoying. They play the cute angle all the time and it hurts my head. To boot they give ol' Guiseppe a heart condition just in case the movie wasn't affecting you enough.There is like I say some pretty good material concerning Guiseppe's coming to terms with his past. They really should have scrapped the entire blind girl stuff and concentrated on that. It's not everyday we have a big plump whitehaired man. He's so awesome! I would cast him in a movie in a second if I were making one. 510.".

This was so campy that I almost strayed i realized this was intentionally campy. This seems like a hybrid story told as a rise and fall film and this morphs into something unique. Some of the film was so cheesy stereotypes and scenic exploits that it was hard to endure while the human element was very true of love family marriage friends life happyness sadness and food. A lot of insight to the strained friend relationship of the older man younger man and the girl seemingly between the two mens age.What fascinated me most about this film is how much this film must've inspired Moonstruck there were many parallels in those two films. I note this was released the same year as Leo The Last both were post World War 2 visible societal change films with Marcel Mastriani.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched this at first because i'm a Marcelo Mastriani fan and i enjoy an old school Italian Comedy Romance the pacing is fast enough to hold my attention and its rich with emotions and minimal dialgue. This was so campy that I almost strayed i realized this was intentionally campy. This seems like a hybrid story told as a rise and fall film and this morphs into something unique. Some of the film was so cheesy stereotypes and scenic exploits that it was hard to endure while the human element was very true of love family marriage friends life happyness sadness and food. A lot of insight to the strained friend relationship of the older man younger man and the girl seemingly between the two mens age.What fascinated me most about this film is how much this film must've inspired Moonstruck there were many parallels in those two films. I note this was released the same year as Leo The Last both were post World War 2 visible societal change films with Marcel Mastriani.";

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Paul Frees seems to do all the men's voices except for Marcello Mastroianni's and Giancarlo Giannini's seems to add a certain sameness to all the other men in the dubbed version of this film. Mastroianni is a communist bricklayer in love with Monica Vitti and she with him. He's best friends with Giannini a Communist pizza maker who's in love with Monica Vitti and she with him. It's like a dirty joke about them commies they share everything. Except being human they can't. It drives everyone crazy and the movie is very funny.There seems to be enormous amounts of real subtextual commentary lost in translation. Mastroianni has his middle left finger in a sling throughout the movie and is occasionally found on trash heaps. Given that his character's name is Oreste I think there's a reference to the classical legend but it's not the Homeric Pindaric Sophoclean versions but the bogus Robert Graves YearKing fighting over Monica Vitti. Mastroianni does have flies buzzing around him a lot indicating he's the Old King.Given three screenwriters including Age and Scarpelli and Ettore Scola directing he had given Vitti her first screen role almost two decades earlier there is obviously a lot in this movie that is both precisely of its time and of its place ill suited to the sort of random translation that an Italian sex comedy got in the 1970s. Unless someone is willing to go back and do a more careful translation there's little more than a funny and bizarre comedy here. However it certainly is that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pizza Triangle is a cute enough Italian romantic comedy with some really outlandish touches around the center and a nicely scuzzy character played by the normally smooth Marcello Mastriani. These last two things would probably be trimmed tho including its ending would it have been a bigger hit in Italy and then remade for America so maybe its good it wasn't remade...but then again most people would have also heard of this and it'd be much more widely available to watch today as well so maybe that's not a good thing then.Monica Vitti wildly overplays the fun lovingfast living woman at the center of the love triangle. She spots Marcello Mastriani not as the handsome man you normally see but as a drunk guy passed out on the street and instantly falls in love with him i know but its a movie! each one is sure they've seen each other before in a shop and were attracted to each other then so when she spots him laying in that gutter he's certainly pleased to wake up and see her standing over him. Unfortunately for herhe ends up being a wildly jealous boar who is prone to fits of both the drinking and temper kind and is soon turning her attentions to the swooning pizza maker in the little eatery that Mastriani keeps taking her to. The pizza maker played by a rather youngish Giancarlo Gianni woos her right under Marcello's nose with a slice of pizza in the shape of a heartits a very cute scene when Vitti gets the heart shaped slice of pizza looks up and sees Gianni staring at herits one of those meet cute scenes that would totally be at home in a big Hollywood romance which is why i'm surprised this wasn't redone quite honestly and while Vitti and her pizza maker start cuddling up Marcello starts questioning himself and his ability to hold a relationship and generally being a mopeexcept for when he's throwing one of his fits. Eventually he and the pizza chef who already knew each other cause well Marcello eats his food decide to try and share Monica Vittiand as anyone who's ever seen Vitti in her prime can attesthalf a Vitti is better then no Vitti at all.The attempts at Jules and Jilm like comedy don't really mesh with the kind of angry self righteous character that had been Mastriani's character up to that point and you can pretty much guess where the film goes once the 2 guys decide to try and share Vitti. The movie doesn't quite live up to the first 5 or 10 minutes as a whole. When you see that sequence of Vitti at the fair and spotting Mastriani and then Mastriani seeing heryou think OK this is going to be very well filmed and is going to be passionate as all get out. It doesn't really pan out that way and not because of Mastriani's rather bitter characterits more because the film's attempts at humor are just too over the top to take seriouslyMastriani and Vitti share a fly together mastriani's character is so filthy at the beginning that he keeps doing battle with the same flywho Vitti then calls our fly and indeed whenever she starts to feel Mastriani's presenceyou hear the fly buzzing on the soundtrack and sometimes see it actually flying around the screen as wellits a neat touch but one that's also irritating the more times it happens Vitti's character herself is so over the top and so ficklei personally stopped caring about which of the 2 suitors she's going to end up with long before she actually makes a decision and then promptly changes her mind a couple more times for good measure The film was enjoyable enoughits certainly pretty to look at for the most partbut the character's behavior and the fact that everything is done in these big broad strokes makes the rest of the film not as good as it could've been....the way Vitti carries on i would've thought that this was a role that Sophia Loren had turned down quite honestlyit wouldn't be hard to see why Loren would of turned this one downthe character that Vitti's playing is nowhere near the head strong self sufficient larger then life characters that Loren had come to fame playing and that's part of the main problem of the movie itself.".

The film follows the American Western models but also in Spaghetti style . An ItalianSpanish coproduction with outdoor sequences filmed in Colmenar Viejo  La Pedriza and Manzanares Del Real  Madrid .

In fact if you compare the beginning of 7 Winchester for a massacre which would direct the next year and the end this one seem to be similar direction . It's full of action  exaggerated characters shootouts and loads of violence . Alambradas de Violencia or Pochi Dollari per Django is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist a bounty hunter gunfighter  Anthony Steffen  and a band's leader  Alfonso Rojas  and his hoodlums as Ennio Girolami . Anthony Steffen is fine  he ravages the screen kills  shoots  hits and runs . There is plenty of thrills and action in the movie  guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . The film blends violence  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . Nice score by Carlo Savina  including an enjoyable leitmotif and catching song . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the ending gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion . This Western all'Italiana was produced by Marino Girolami  father of Enzo G. Castellari and Ennio Girolami being middlingly directed by Leon Klimovsky . Leon was a craftsman who directed all kind of genres  as Terror for Paul Naschy Marshall of hell Rebellion of dead one  Orgy of vampires  Werewolf shadow Dr Jekill vs. the werewolf  Warlike June 44 attack force Normandy  A bullet for Rommel  Bridge over Elba and Western Badland drifter  Reverend Colt  Torrejon city  Death knows no time  Two thousand dollars for Coyote  A dollar for Sartana . Rating 5  regular but entertaining .".

There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the ending gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion . This Western all'Italiana was produced by Marino Girolami  father of Enzo G. Castellari and Ennio Girolami being middlingly directed by Leon Klimovsky . Leon was a craftsman who directed all kind of genres  as Terror for Paul Naschy Marshall of hell Rebellion of dead one  Orgy of vampires  Werewolf shadow Dr Jekill vs. the werewolf  Warlike June 44 attack force Normandy  A bullet for Rommel  Bridge over Elba and Western Badland drifter  Reverend Colt  Torrejon city  Death knows no time  Two thousand dollars for Coyote  A dollar for Sartana . Rating 5  regular but entertaining .";

Note the song there will come a morning by Carlo Savina.it is movie I would recommend to a friend and a foe for a change!".

	schema:headline " The other Django movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The first confusing thing about this movie is it's title. It's clearly mark on the title card 'Pochi dollari per Django' but in the America version it was reprinted as 'Some Dollars for Django' and in others as 'Django a bullet for you. It's just a Django picture a ripoff of Sierre Leone's Clint Eastwood type 'Man with no name' character returns to a Spagnetti Western type town named Mile City when a band of crooks lead by Jim Norton Frank Wolff rob a bank. A bounty hunter named Regan Anthony Steffen AKA Django is hired to capture them. Regan has no cost but to pose as the sheriff to get close to the gang so he can retrieve the large sum of cash. The silent gunslinger works effective even before the audience see the opening credits action comes to play. I wouldn't mind it but I would rather see a big epic opening music number then cutting to the action so the audience can at less get ready for it. It seem rushed. To collect some evidence and capture the ring leader he wents to see Trevor the twinbrother of Jim Norton who is reportedly murdered in the meantime lives as a farmer. Django is leery and supposes that peaceful Trevor in fact is Jim Norton. However he is in the grip of an escalating conflict between the farmers who want to erect barbed wire fences around their land and the ranchers lead by Bransbury Alfonso Rojas whose villain credentials are cemented by the way in which he regularly twists the ends of his moustache in a caddish fashion in a cartoony pose who want the right for their cattle to roam freely. The farmers suffering from his unpleasant habit of burning down their property have formed a resistance group led by Trevor . Trevor despite appearances believes in peace and seems to be an essentially good man only willing to fight when pushed into having no options. The plot about the perplexities around the two Nortons love and sheriff's honor is overloaded especially there's no tension around. There is barely any slow parts in the film it's full of action from beginning to end. Norton daughter Sally Gloria Osuna plays his love interest that suppose warms up Regan. His true metamorphosis from a bounty hunter to a straight sheriff to me seems quite unbelievable with no character development between the action scenes. He killed people left and right without asking. There just way too much going on in this story and I would rather have them stick to one. The scenes are somewhat witty and action pack full. Still the one shot kills are kinda out cheesy and unlimited bullets for a six barrel hand gun get annoying for a way. The English dub is laughable but watchable. Carlo Savina music is just a step away from getting mistaken from Ennio Morricone. Carlos Savina theme A Deadly Morning or there will come a morning fits the film but it comes off more than a Dollar Series knock off. Vocals by Don Powell is just awesome. This movie Some dollars for Django is a classic one. Music by Carlo Savina a much underrated composer. I would recommend this movie to all Spaghetti Western fans".

	schema:reviewBody "This is said to be Enzo Castellari's debut film and it's for that reason I tracked it down. Sadly it doesn't quite become a great film but does have it's saving graces.There's a town in Montana where ranchers and farmers are having a land dispute which about to become all out war and while on his way there bounty hunter Regan Antony Steffen happens across the murdered body of the town's sheriff. Adopting his persona Steffen breezes into a town that has got a whole heap of warring factions going on...and he's caught right in the middle.On one side are the farmers reluctantly led by Frank Wolff who believes he can settle the business peacefully. Frank's problems are plentiful  his daughter is getting harrassed in town by ranchers his land is being threatened by ranchers the farmers want to go to war and there's the slight problem that Frank may well be a hunted criminal with a bounty on his head who is impersonating his own twin brother. That's what Steffen thinks is going on but then he's impersonating a sheriff so it's a case of pot calling the kettle black.The head of the ranchers just wants to wipe the farmers off the face of the Earth and get on with so he brings in some outlaws who reckon that the fake Frank might be the real Frank too and after a lot of talky bits we do get an all out gun battle at the end but is it too little too late?Possibly. The film is almost devoid of Enzo's patented crazy camera angles so the dramatic scenes where Steffen falls in love with Frank's daughter and there's a lot of talk about taking land people threatening each other that sort of thing drag on a bit but then there's a good chemistry between Steffen and Wolff because you're not quite sure if Frank is impersonating his own brother or if he is whether or not he's a reformed character or still a violent outlaw. Things do kick into gear when the action arrives. Maybe it just took a film or two to realise where his strengths lay.Enzo himself turns up as a gunman who gets a cap popped in his ass. I wouldn't put this anywhere near the top of a 'mustsee' list.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to catch a screening of 'Superbad' last night in NYC and I was very pleased with the movie. I'm sure most will compare this to an 'American Pie' like comedy but it's so much more than that. There were some shock value moments but very well done to tip the scale more to funny than to gross.It is a teen movie so 'Superbad's plot is obviously basic. It's the performances of the 3 friends Seth Evan and 'McLovin' Fogell that really make it great. I am big Michael Cera fan thanks to the brilliant TV series Arrested Development and other fans will be delighted to see his equally hilarious performance as Evan. The movie has the sexually driven banter and gross outs that will appeal to 'American Pie' viewer and the smart timing and acting that will appeal to the 'Arrested Development' viewer. What was really surprising to me was the touching platonic relationship that Evan and Seth have. Also 'McLovin' Fogell is an absolute nerdy delight.The only negative thing I noticed that it was a bit drawn out toward the middle but it really picks up after. Overall it's a great time and might just be a success at the box office. Bad teen comedies are a dime a dozen but 'Superbad' is a shiny golden egg!".

I figured this movie could go either way especially when you consider 40 yearold Virgin and Knocked Up were funny and entertaining but they weren't exactly loved by all.I am happy to say this movie was wonderful. The jokes are crude but dead on and unlike recent movies with a similar style like Clerks 2 the plot moves on without any real downtime you know where the plot slows the progress of humor and you find yourself checking your watch. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have that best friend chemistry that this movie required as well as being dead on with their jokes. The real star of the movie however was newcomer Christopher MintzPlasse who took the role of Fogell and OWNED it. I got the chance to chat with the actors and I was not only surprised to hear that both MintzPlasse and Michael Cera are 18 and 19 respectively.For the type of movie this is and the brilliant script that Seth Brogen has presented there is no reason why anyone young or old can't relate to this offthewall comedy. See this movie!".

My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!! I have a feeling it is going to go off the charts once the buzz gets around about how hilarious it is.".

It has that same element of transporting you back to your high school days that the original American Pie had. Michael Cera does great as the awkward teenage kid basically a reprise of his role as George Michael on Arrested Development. But it is Jonah Hill who absolutely rules this movie! He had me laughing from the beginning to the end. His silly fatkid character is the only one in the history of movies that shows what it truly feels like to be the funny fat kid in high school. I should know I was one! Gosh I just can't believe how well he portrayed the unmitigated hell that was P.E.! Emma Stone and Martha Maclsaac also give very realistic depictions of teenage girls. None of that fake over the top nonsense. The most overthetop character was McLovin himself Christopher MintzPlasse who did a great job of having us laugh with him as much as we did at him.All in all I think that everyone should be sure to watch this movie when it comes later this summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superbad may look like a typical highschool movie on the cover but its actually much more. It follows a trio of highschool seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college and one last shot at grabbing a girl. The trio consists of Seth Evan and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer its classic slapstick comedy.The plot is definitely a strong point unlike many comedies today. Most of the movie follows two distinct plot lines that join up at the end. Interweaved in the plot are countless jokes that kept me laughing almost the whole time. The plot itself involves booze partying and law enforcement and somehow works these in to make a very absorbing story. Also the particularly close friendship between Seth and Evan is an element that surpasses the comedy genre. The plot as a whole has plenty of unrealistic details but manages to successfully meld comedy with some deeper meaning.The comedy aspects are some of the best ever. Some of the jokes were a little disgusting mainly the part about Seth's childhood but I gotta admit they were hilarious. The beer aspects were pretty cool and the sexual jokes did their thing. The law enforcement spoofs and McLovin gags were probably my favorite.The movie as a whole is among the better comedies ever. I liked it more than Knocked Up 710. It still suffers from some of the weaknesses inherent in the comedy genre but has a lot more value than most movies nowadays. Highly recommended for people in high school or college and also recommended albeit to a lesser degree for everyone else.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed The 40YearOld Virgin but didn't feel it was entirely worthy of all the enormous acclaim it garnered. And for all the praise Knocked Up received I thought it was fairly average. So I wasn't expecting much from Superbad. However I'd have to say it's the smartest and funniest Apatow film yet. I know he didn't direct it but his influence is distinct. And in the past I've felt indifferent towards Apatow's brand of humour but combined with Rogen's sensitivity towards the teen condition here it works really well.People have compared it to John Hughes' better teen comedies but I don't think the approach is entirely similar. Superbad is cruder ruder a bit more focused on the sex  alcohol jokes. But it works really well because it captures that dynamic  better than American Pie because it invests more care into its characters. One of the strengths of Pie over other films in its genre such as say Slackers has always been its characters and Superbad similarly relies on its characters for support. Plus it's just really funny.The performances all around are pretty funny even if the FogellMcLovin pop culture references are ruining a good joke kind of like Yeah baby!! ruined Austin Powers when 20yearold frat boys around the country thought it would be funny to shout the phrase every five seconds.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have great chemistry and another one of the strengths of this film is that its teenage characters actually do look their age even though Hill is in his early 20s he still passes as a senior. But it was Bill Hader and Seth Rogen who stole the show for me as the clueless cops.Overall this is just a funny wellmade film with heart. It doesn't mock its characters or their predicaments but casts a knowing eye on the high school experience. It captures all this very well and was certainly in my opinion far superior to Knocked Up.".

	schema:headline " One teenage comedy with extra wit and soul";
	schema:reviewBody "Superbad is a parable of values and friendship reminding us that a good and earnest moral upbringing will be able to safely glide us through life and make us achieve happiness much easier. Its characters are wellmannered and sweet not to mention inherently likable as well as everything being morally correct and admirable.Now onto the real review. Superbad is a shamelessly raunchy Rrated comedy with more four letter words than a Webster dictionary. Again this sounds like the introduction I'd give a poorly rated film. By no means is Superbad a bad comedy. It is a smart witty and factual teen movie sidestepping clichs and underwritten primary characters while at the same time remaining funny and entertaining until the end.2007 was the year where Judd Apatow took off. He gained attention in 2005 with The 40 Year Old Virgin but pretty much garnered a household name with this and Knocked Up both starring Seth Rogen. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that Superbad is an autobiography since the writers of the film Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg share the same names as the lead actors. Maybe that could be why this feels so sentimental and close to home. Or maybe it's because Superbad is aware what kind of unsettling situations high school can put you through and knows how to document them in a fun way.The film centers around loudmouth pervert Seth Hill and selfconscious paranoiastricken Evan Cera as they endure their last few weeks of being high schoolers before they are shipped off to separate colleges. Seth and Evan have been friends for years and are tired of the fact that their separate ways have been the talk of their parents and friends.Seth has a crush on the recentlypopular Jules Stone a beautiful redhead who trusts him with supplying alcohol for her party. Evan has a crush on Becca MacIsaac a sweet and simple girl who agrees to meet up with him at Jules' upcoming party as well. In order to purchase the alcohol both Seth and Evan trust their pal Fogel MintzPlasse who plans to acquire a fake ID. Because of this ID Fogel now becomes his fake name McLovin a name that has garnered much fame on the web.The night unfolds into a chaotic spectacle of unprecedented stature so much so that I won't go into explaining the routes and acts of desperation the characters take in order to be liked admired or even noticed. Fogel winds up teaming up with two police officers Hader and Rogen who act more like the bad guys rather than good guys. This setup and sort of topsytursvy treatment of character roles create limitless comedic possibilities most of which are well utilized.But what truly makes the film work is its level of realism and intelligence. It has wit and puts it to use. The writing and acting captures the awkwardness of the teenage lifestyle with pinpoint accuracy at the same time makes it fun and painful to witness. I can think of quite a few films that allow their characters to thrive on ego and selfinterest with no redeeming qualities. Here the characters in Superbad just want to fit in and achieve the girl of their dreams but shallow stereotypes and one stutter too many prevent this goal from happening.Superbad is quite a rarity a funny goodnatured comedy focusing on things of the immoral nature. Just like with American Pie too many people believe these films are just raucous sex comedies with no substance soul or charm. The characters are likable and charismatic and lack the ohsotypical nihilistic I just want to have sex with anything that moves mentality. Some may be surprised at the level of nuanced emotional instances the film reaches. The performances are fun the writing is polished and witty and the antics never seem to go over the top. It's too bad the women roles in the film feel a tad underwritten. Hopefully we have something like Supergood to explore that angle sometime soon.Starring Jonah Hill Michael Cera Christopher MintzPlasse Bill Hader Seth Rogen Emma Stone and Martha MacIsaac. Directed by Greg Mottola.".

All the plot is about male virgins who want to have sex and talk about it about alcohol and strange cops who are kids in mind. That's all. Yes sometimes some jokes about vomiting or drunk people are funny but they can't be the only content of a movie. Yes the story and the stereotype characters are entertaining on a low level but there should be more than the average plot of American Pie to fill 90 minutes and more. Critical oder serious elements I hadn't found during looking the movie and so I wished that this teentrash is over soon. Maybe other people would be found that this movie is very funny and brilliant. But Superbad only repeats elements of earlier puberty comedies without vary the gags oder the story. Only weak this movie.".

It's like watching a Kevin Smith movie with the profanity but without the comedy. If you want to see a great buddy profanity comedy watch Clerks. Most of the dialogue by the 2 best buddies is very gay. Sure everybody knew someone like the fat guy that mouthed off in high school but they weren't these characters who are practically flaming homos.The whole police chase was downright lame. Finally I actually felt creeped out when the buddies meet a possible pedophile. Hey are you guys on MySpace? I recommend watching the first ten minutes then walking out.".

I guess it's not very PC but then again the movie itself isn't very PC which is one of the reasons I liked it. It wasn't afraid to be a bit edgy. In addition to being edgy the film is also quite overthetop at times. While some may be bothered by the overthetop scenes I enjoyed them.

I know that I might be clashing with some of your beliefs about this movie but your comments made this out a lot worse than it was which is just a funny teenage movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "She Gets What She Wants also known as Slap Her She's French this little movie is about a solipsistic Texas highschool cheerleader named Starla Jane McGregor whose family takes in a foreign exchange student from France named Genevieve Piper Perabo. The plot then devolves into a less subtle version of Mean Girls 2004 with the Genevieve becoming popular at school stealing the affections of the family and taking Starla's place on the cheer leading squad. Will young Starla be able to take her social life back or will the conniving Genevieve successfully ruin her future.This movie was released overseas mere months before the invasion of Iraq and wasn't given a TV release in the United States until 2005. By that time freedomfries were all the rage and Francohatred was on the rise. The creators probably felt there was finally a market for this unfairly shelved movie. Thing is this movie is less about Americans hating on France's stance on Iraq than it is a sardonic and satiric look at American culture told from an outsider's perspective. Starla our protagonist is so insulated to the trappings of American life that she doesn't realize there's something very off about Genevieve. The final reveal at the end of the film only reinforces that idea that our culture as a whole conditions us to be selfcentered confrontational and petty. Even if that comes at the cost of our reputation. Now in 2015 we've stopped eating freedomfries but there's not a chance in hell we're eating humble pie.".

	schema:reviewBody "When my girlfriend picked this movie it was called She Gets What She Wants and I had never heard of it before other than Piper Perabo Coyete Ugly was in it. So basically I didn't have any expectations going in but I like teen comedies. I was pleasantly surprised it didn't blow me away but it also didn't suck. It was just in the middle somewhere with decent acting a soso plot and some genuinely funny lines.Slap Her She's French AKA She Gets What She Wants is the story of Uber Popular girl Starla Grady. She dreams of being the next Diane Sawyer and is doing everything she can to get known. She wins at everything head cheerleader beauty contests the popular boyfriend and sets all the trends at school. In order to beat out the competition at a beauty contest Starla announces to her town that her family will be graciously hosting a foreign exchange student from France. When Genevieve Le Plouff arrives she seems like the perfect opportunity for Starla to impress everyone. Slowly with some very sly moves Genevieve begins to move her way into Starla's life and her position in the social ladder. Starla begins to realize that Genevieve is purposely overtaking her and it's working. With the help of a former adversary Starla will discover a disturbing secret about the supposed French foreign exchange student and give it her all to overcome her.Lead actress Jane McGregor who plays Starla does a great job at being the bitchy Clueless type girl obsessed with only herself. Throughout the course of the film she manages to learn a little about being a little nicer but overall she keeps her character true to herself. She's spoiled and kind of an anti hero but fun anyways. Piper Perabo does a decent job at playing the faux Foreign exchange student even at 27 years old!! She plays wicked pretty well but never really gets down and dirty which you kind of expect her character to get. Most of the comedy is either physical comedy or one liners surrounding sexual comments and mistaken English which is still pretty funny. The humor doesn't get really dirty like some teen comedies go with. It's not a bad movie and you won't necessarily be disappointed with it but it's mostly forgettable offbeat and very low key. 610".

I'll be honest when I saw the trailer in the cinema it was given theatrical release in Britain I'm not sure about anywhere else! I though 'Oh here we go another brainless American sexcomedy.' This isn't completely removed from the truth but my first thought was certainly very unfair. This is actually quite a smart movie. The plot in a nutshell is as follows  Starla the popular head cheerleader has her 'perfect' life picked apart by the conniving exchange student that ironically Starla became involved with for her own selfish reasons. As you might expect mayhem ensues. Contrary to the title there is very little mockery of the French  no all the mocking is aimed squarely at American culture particularly that of the 'popular' high school student. This culture is lambasted parodied and ripped to shreds at every turn with hilarious effect  the Beef Pageant full of grinning dancing cowgirls Starla's refusal to see the usefulness of learning a foreign language Karl Fuller the meatmunching quarterback no pun intended with a head full of steak rather than brains and of course Starla's dippy acolyte friends who loudly demand of Genevieve 'Do you speak American?' The characters are all wonderful and played surprisingly well considering none of them are massive 'names'. Jane McGregor does a wonderful job of Starla making her likable despite her flaws. It's a shame McGregor is not really given more of a chance in mainstream Hollywood as she played this role very well indeed. Perabo is fine as Genevieve bringing across a smug innocence even if her accent is a little bit 'Music Hall' shall we say. Starla's family are great  Brandon Smith is good as Starla's wholesome pursuitstype father and Julie White is really funny as Mrs Grady who is rarely seen without her Thermos flask of Long Island Iced Tea. Jesse James is brilliant as Starla's precocious little brother Randolph and Starla's trashy galpals are also played to a tee. One thing you can say about this film is that it never glamorizes the stuff it pokes fun at. An obvious comparison here is Mean Girls that came out 18 months or so later  another sharp pastiche of teen culture and the stuff that goes with it  but come on be honest. In the aftermath of that movie how many girls did you know who suddenly wanted to become 'lip gloss chicks'? Apparently at my school particularly in the new Sixth Form thank God I'd left by then! there was a sudden surge of 'clique' behavior as well as some stupid misguided girls who insisted on calling themselves 'The Plastics.' This is why I think Slap Her... is superior to Mean Girls though I'd be stomped for saying it out loud. I can't imagine anyone wanting to mirror shallow selfish oblivious Starla bigmouthed stupid Tanner or twofaced spiteful Ashley. This movie was so good at skewering the object of its main mockery it has rendered its target as completely unappealing. Slap her...is a surprisingly smart comedic gem with an agenda and deserves far more recognition that it gets.".

Regardless of the quality of the movie Slap Her.She's French is simply a brilliant and completely unexplained title.  So after worshipping one of the funniest film titles of all time is the movie any where near as good as the name promises.  Well no.  But then the title is a lot to live up to so its not to say that the film isn't any good at all.  A French foreign exchange student comes to stay with a stereotypical hicksville Texan family and their beauty pageant winning daughter.  The French girl however is not all that she seems.  Essentially this film abuses the French and the Texans so far its appealing to most Brits.The story is pretty predictable as are most of the jokes.  The characters are all stereotypes conforming to tried and tested formulae.  Slap Her. sets itself up as an inferior version of Drop Dead Gorgeous. The narrative is slow to start and when it eventually does has plot holes the size of the Lone Star State.  Not all the jokes miss the mark though.  For every couple of missed funnies there is one laugh out loud moment.  Some of the set pieces are neat and will appeal to the audience with a slightly more discerning tastes but these moments are rare and unappreciated by the film's creators.  You can't help but feel that had this been made by a British team the humour would have been that bit more subtle and consistent. The narrative itself is incredibly slow to start something which could have been avoided had the director Melanie Mayron realised that we already knew everything she was telling us about her characters.  A montage sequence would have been far more successful method of exposition.The performances are varied.  Perabo as the obviously French Genevieve is either wasted or just plain useless we can only hope its the former. McGregor's Starla even the name's obvious is over the top but appealing. The supporting cast often fair better but are hideously underdeveloped. The entire lesbian relationship sub plot of Starla's two best friends comes and goes without rhyme nor reason.  Starla's mum Julie White and her alcoholic ice tea habit could have been a thread worth developing but there is no reason for it being mentioned at all with the script the way it stands.  Even Starla's consumption of an entire flask of her mum's favourite tipple fails to create any humour from her inevitable drunkenness. Starla's saviours are her brother Jesse James and school newspaper photographer Ed Trent Ford.  Neither of whom are used anywhere near as much as they should have been.  These actors and their performances suggest that this movie could have been so much more than it is had the actors been given the script that you get the impression could have existed.Many of the movies problems stem from the sensation that there was originally a much larger and more complete script that followed through some of the story lines suggested in the final piece.  It is almost as if the makers didn't want to offend anyone too much and therefore removed lots of the superior narrative.  This all leads to an average movie that could have been so much more.  Never quite reaching straight to video levels this is never going to be a classic in the vein of Ten Things I Hate About You which it easily could have been.  As a Sunday night diversion Slap Her.She's French is acceptable.  There are enough laughs to prevent you feeling cheated and a slightly warm fuzzy feeling that you just can't help getting in your stomache.  This is simply a teen comedy which missed the opportunity to be a classic of the genre and you just can't help feeling that it really could have been a contender.Mark  510 Who to go with  Your girlfriend or younger sister".

There are enough laughs to prevent you feeling cheated and a slightly warm fuzzy feeling that you just can't help getting in your stomache.  This is simply a teen comedy which missed the opportunity to be a classic of the genre and you just can't help feeling that it really could have been a contender.Mark  510 Who to go with  Your girlfriend or younger sister";

Its a light hearted teen comedy aimed at a struggle between two girls over becoming popular in high school. Piper Perabo was great throughout the movie using her sexy french accent to woo the boys at school. Jane McGregor was equally as impressive as the rich snob who is always used to getting her way and is suddenly upsurped from the limelight by the french foreign exchange student. All in all the girls were hot the story was entertaining and humorous and I feel that the movie portrayed its message without French Bashing anyone. The only AntiFrench part is the title which I'm sure is from Jane McGregors character of Starla trying to get back in charge of her life. 810 Highly Enjoyable.".

Confused genres you're watching it thinking is this supposed to be like Mean Girls? Is this supposed to be like Napoleon Dynamite? on a level not seen since Cool As Ice. Moreover every time Piper Perabo was on the screen I wanted to punch her in the face. She is a terrible actress and should contemplate killing herself.

Kennedy was shot although I had to leave the hotel to perform my own job as a wire service journalist before the Senator came down to the ballroom so I was not there after midnight when the shooting took place. However my wife at the time was there and for one moment was one of those standing over Kennedy's body. I was back at the office working on the Kennedy victory story when word came though of the shooting. It was devastating even more so for me because we learned very quickly that a woman was among those shot but there were no ids available and in the days before cell phones I had no way to reach my wife. It was hours before she was able to get to a pay phone to call me and let me know she was alright.That all made watching the last few minutes of this film very difficult for me even though the incident took place nearly four decades ago.The assassination segment is gut wrenching to say the least as are the newsreel clips of Kennedy on the campaign trail.Other positives of the film are the acting and overall direction from Emelio Estevez.The problem for me with this film was I could not get a real handle on what it was saying. About 90 percent of the movie gives us capsule glimpses into the lives of people either working or staying at the Ambassdor before the shooting.We find out the hotel manager is having an affair with a switchboard operator a bus boy has Dodger tickets he will not be able to use two college age nerds drop acid for the first time and a comely young lady is going to marry a boy to keep him from being sent to Vietnam. I'm not sure that actually worked as many married men I knew wound up getting sent to Nam in that era. And I met many others while I was in the army. Okay the idea was to show us not just a cross section of 60s culture but also a glimpse into the lives touched by the assassination. Trouble is we got a lot of their back stories but since the film ends with the shooting we never get to see what impact this terrible night had on them other than that some but not all of them are among the wounded.Consequently it is never clear to me what all these stories add up to. For instance Anthony HOpkins and Harry Bellefonte play a couple of retired hotel doormen who are apparently allowed to spend their retirement years hanging out in the hotel lobby playing chess. Cute but irrelevant to the story since they don't even talk about politics on this California primary day.Again some of these people are apparently fictionalized versions of those wounded but they all survive and what we never find out is was this incident life changing for them. And if it was is it any different for them than it is for any other crime victim? For me the assassination was and I eventually dropped out and went to Europe for a while. I don't know what happens to the people here and since I got so much back story I feel cheated. Did the hotel manager and his wife reconcile? Did the boy who got shot get sent to Nam anyway? Did the two college boys become hard core stoners? Did either of them score with the hot lunch counter waitress?I think this script needed some major adjustments to make the film work for me.".

I was lucky enough to catch Bobby at the Toronto Film Festival  its North American premier  and what I got was an incredibly beautiful story cinematically gripping to say the least.Like in all great ensemble movies Bobby offers a stellar cast none of whom disappoint. From the neurotic and selfconscious character of Samantha played by Helen Hunt to the outspoken confident Edward Robinson Laurence Fishburne there is a vast mixture of personalities that work to provide a complex interwoven plot line. But the most notable performance and the most surprising is that of Virginia Fallon. Brillianty portrayed by Demi Moore Virginia is a foulmouthed insecure alcoholic who sways around on screen in delicate form both heartbreaking and beautiful to watch.Directorwriter Emilio Estevez put his heart into this project. The direction is without a doubt highly impressive. The subtle colorful hues reflect the emotional grip of each scene and extenuate a modern feel to the film. He puts us headfirst in the crowd that witnessed the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy on what would seem to be one of the most heartbreaking moments in American history.But what really stands out in this movie is not the screenplay nor directing nor acting. The emotional intensity is brilliantly brought out through the use of sound. An actual audio footage of RFK is heard in the background as the tense score sways by over the muted dialogue. And what works for this type of filmmaking is the amount of anticipation it builds up and even after pivotal scenes the impact it leaves on the audience.There is a key scene in the movie in which all the characters prepare to greet RFK when the energy of the entire screen seemingly drips with positivity towards the American society. It's as though we forget the fatal tragedy and give into the thought of this story having a happy ending. We are reminded of classic ensemble films such as Short Cuts Magnolia and Crash and immediately juxtapose that feeling.Though I do fear that politically this movie may not hit home for a lot of the critics once it hits a wide release it is definitely going to leave a lasting impression on the majority who sees it. It's a movie that presents a magnificent cast superb directing and flawless scriptwriting. An undoubtedly obvious ingredient for the Awards season.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bobby which tells the story of the assassination of Robert Kennedy the little brother of the late and also assassinated President John F. Kennedy and what was going on 16 hours before it happened. We are thrown back and forth between 22 extraordinary characters and stories. Emilio Estevez writes directs and costars he has truly elevated his level of direction and writing. This is coming from the same man who brought us hit and miss films like Men at Work and The War at Home. He parallels us through a journey of injustice racism prejudice adultery and more. This film much like Crash with its unsubtle undertones of encroachment could be the multicharacter film that has the Good Night and Good Luck feel that speaks assertively to America. This film leads an allstar cast of some A and Blist actors. William H. Macy plays the manager of the famous Ambassador Hotel which the Oscars were held at a few times and Sharon Stone plays his wife and hairdresser of the hotel. Heather Graham plays one of switchboard operators whom Macy is having an affair with. Demi Moore plays Virginia Fallon the alcoholic lounge singer who is set to introduce the doomed candidate of the presidency. Estevez portrays Moore's husband and manager being tormented emotionally by his wife's addiction. Lindsay Lohan who has a step now to bring herself into more serious roles depicts Diane a young bride to be who is marrying her boyfriend's brother to keep him from going to Vietnam. Elijah Wood plays the future and very grateful husband. Freddy Rodriguez known for his role in Six Feet Under and Jacob Vargas known for his supporting roles in Traffic and Jarhead play Mexican kitchen staff members who are working a double shift and are in search of equality. Laurence Fishburne is Edward Robinson an older black kitchen staff employee who is teaching his fellow compatriots about offering more to life than anger. Joshua Jackson and Nick Cannon are campaign managers for the infamous Bobby. Real life father of Emilio Estevez Martin Sheen is Jack a depressed older man who marries a younger woman portrayed brilliantly by Helen Hunt. Christian Slater is Timmons the very racist kitchen staff manager who is not subtle about his feelings towards minorities. And veterans Sir Anthony Hopkins and Harry Belafonte are John Casey a veteran worker of the Ambassador and Nelson an old friend reminiscing of the old days. And at the end we have a little Ashton Kutcher Shia LaBeouf and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.The movie races against the clock to bring us into all these characters lives and show us about Old America and where we've come from. The film has it all some comic relief coming from Kutcher your strong political message the dramatic elements and the emotional punch that lays the icing on the already multilayered cake. This is one of the most important films of the year and if justice is served this will be on many critics' top ten lists of the year. I can't explain too much about the film without giving away vital parts but it speaks to America. It shows a history of grave transgressions and how that may seem all behind us it is lucidly vigorous. The mention of Dr. King and his impact on people fighting for equal rights is mentioned quite of a bit and leaves in discernment. Bobby Kennedy was the light at the end of a lot of citizen's dark tunnel. People believed he was going to do some amazing things for us and we'll never know if he would have lived up to those expectations but I am now very informed of his life legacy and how much he meant to so many individuals.Emilio Estevez could very well be the Paul Haggis of the year with his excellent writing and direction of the film. I never would have thought he had it in him to pull off this passionate and affecting drama out of him. The performances are amazing and utterly mind blowing but to be honest with 22 different characters as oppose to Crash's ten or twelve it's hard to pick a standout. If critics go crazy for the film I'd place bets for Laurence Fishburne who has already received raves for his Akeelah and the Bee Helen Hunt's haunting and powerful performance very reminiscent of Julianne Moore's performance in The Hours and possibly Harry Belafonte as the veteran of the year to make it to the short list for the first time. With these bets my favorites differ by far Freddy Rodriguez as Jose who brings a sense of humanity to his role which mirrors Michael Pena's Daniel in Crash went home with me postexperience. I wouldn't even be hesitant to say Christian Slater was great as a racist who also mirrors Matt Dillon's Oscar nominated performance. Sharon Stone also left a beautiful impact on me to make long forget about Basic Instinct 2 Risk Addiction.With all of these key components and sides of The Constant Gardener and JFK this is the film of the year. Undying gratitude can be expressed to cast and crew involved in such a passionate masterpiece of filmmaking. The technical aspects of the film are eyecatching. The recreation of the Ambassador Hotel by unknown Colin De Rouin is beautifully constructed and is alone worthy of viewing pleasure. The cinematography always keeps the smooth flow of the film moving along with excellent editing coming from Richard Chew the Oscar winner of a little bold masterpiece called Star Wars. Even the Mark Isham score definitely sampled from Thomas Newman adds to a melancholy yet invigorating memoir. A review such as this cannot begin to encapsulate the consciousness of Bobby it can only be a fishhook with enough thrust to get a viewer into a chair and enjoy respect knowledge and background of one of the most notorious and resourceful men in the history of politics.".

And at the end we have a little Ashton Kutcher Shia LaBeouf and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.The movie races against the clock to bring us into all these characters lives and show us about Old America and where we've come from. The film has it all some comic relief coming from Kutcher your strong political message the dramatic elements and the emotional punch that lays the icing on the already multilayered cake. This is one of the most important films of the year and if justice is served this will be on many critics' top ten lists of the year. I can't explain too much about the film without giving away vital parts but it speaks to America. It shows a history of grave transgressions and how that may seem all behind us it is lucidly vigorous. The mention of Dr. King and his impact on people fighting for equal rights is mentioned quite of a bit and leaves in discernment. Bobby Kennedy was the light at the end of a lot of citizen's dark tunnel. People believed he was going to do some amazing things for us and we'll never know if he would have lived up to those expectations but I am now very informed of his life legacy and how much he meant to so many individuals.Emilio Estevez could very well be the Paul Haggis of the year with his excellent writing and direction of the film. I never would have thought he had it in him to pull off this passionate and affecting drama out of him. The performances are amazing and utterly mind blowing but to be honest with 22 different characters as oppose to Crash's ten or twelve it's hard to pick a standout. If critics go crazy for the film I'd place bets for Laurence Fishburne who has already received raves for his Akeelah and the Bee Helen Hunt's haunting and powerful performance very reminiscent of Julianne Moore's performance in The Hours and possibly Harry Belafonte as the veteran of the year to make it to the short list for the first time. With these bets my favorites differ by far Freddy Rodriguez as Jose who brings a sense of humanity to his role which mirrors Michael Pena's Daniel in Crash went home with me postexperience. I wouldn't even be hesitant to say Christian Slater was great as a racist who also mirrors Matt Dillon's Oscar nominated performance. Sharon Stone also left a beautiful impact on me to make long forget about Basic Instinct 2 Risk Addiction.With all of these key components and sides of The Constant Gardener and JFK this is the film of the year. Undying gratitude can be expressed to cast and crew involved in such a passionate masterpiece of filmmaking. The technical aspects of the film are eyecatching. The recreation of the Ambassador Hotel by unknown Colin De Rouin is beautifully constructed and is alone worthy of viewing pleasure. The cinematography always keeps the smooth flow of the film moving along with excellent editing coming from Richard Chew the Oscar winner of a little bold masterpiece called Star Wars. Even the Mark Isham score definitely sampled from Thomas Newman adds to a melancholy yet invigorating memoir. A review such as this cannot begin to encapsulate the consciousness of Bobby it can only be a fishhook with enough thrust to get a viewer into a chair and enjoy respect knowledge and background of one of the most notorious and resourceful men in the history of politics.";

He saw war and tried to stop it.There are some icons of that time and one is the election poster of Robert F Kennedy from 1968 httpwww.rfkmemorial.org .Bobby is written and directed surprisingly by Emilio Estevez and features an amazing cast of stars. It is a fictional account of the lives of several people affected by and during the final hours of Senator Robert F Kennedy's life on the 6th of June 1968 as he attempted to become the Democratic candidate for President of the US. The film includes Anthony Hopkins playing the former doorman at the hotel where Kennedy was killed other stars include Elijah Wood Demi Moore Sharon Stone Christian Slater Heleb Hunt Harry Belafonte and my favourite TV President President Bartlet Martin Sheen.Our gross national product does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worth while. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. 1967 RFK For a generation it was Bobby who represented dashed hopes and dreams of a better world we might have had which was cruelly taken away. At the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4th 1968 he left the ballroom after having won the all important California and South Dakota Primaries. He went through a service area to greet supporters working in the hotel's kitchen. While moving through a crowded kitchen passageway Sirhan B Sirhan a 24yearold Palestinian fired a .22 calibre revolver directly into the crowd surrounding Kennedy. Kennedy who was shot in the head at close range and also six other people were wounded. Although wounded he remained conscious for about 20 minutes where his concern was about others he was heard to say Is everybody all right? He was taken to Central Receiving Hospital and then Good Samaritan Hospital for emergency brain surgery. I was at school at the time in Melbourne in Derbyshire and the school put a room aside for any children to watch the news throughout the day to see if he survived lessons were put aside. He died there at the age of 42 in the early morning hours.With his death the darkness seemed to descend having lost Martin Luther King already that year.A revolution is cominga revolution which will be peaceful if we are wise enough compassionate if we care enough successful if we are fortunate enoughBut a revolution which is coming whether we will it or not.

He had helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty stricken Bedford Stuyvsant in New York City bringing business back into areas of New York they had left years before.He had an ability to speak to people across divides in US society of the time which were strong. He managed to pull together a coalition of poor  black and whites middle class he spoke forcefully in favour of what he called the disaffected the impoverished and the excluded.The film gives a wondrful feeling as if you are really still living that hope.Few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation ...

The characters are clear enough that we remember what they were doing the last time we saw them but we never feel like they are merely onedimensional. Emilio Estevez really hit the jackpot with his cast  they all are 100 committed to their roles and the audience simply gets lost in the era.The cast is phenomenal  the standouts include Sharon Stone who has a a chance at a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination if the Academy can overlook Basic Instinct 2 Nick Cannon as a young BlackAmerican working on the campaign and Freddy Rodriguez as a young Latino working in the kitchen. The later two combined with Lindsey Lohan as a woman marrying to save a man's life serve as the heart of the movie and bring a wellbalanced view of many of the hot issues of the day.The movie has an incredible emotional climax that is enhanced by an actual speech of Bobby Kennedy. The audio and visual clips of Kennedy serve as snapshots into his life and the work he did during his short time in the public eye. You can read whatever you want to into the political agenda of the movie but in the end this movie is a tribute to Robert F. Kennedy and his time.".

	schema:headline " One of the most profoundly disappointing movies of the year";
	schema:reviewBody "Another movie that was even more of a disappointment than The Fountain is the magnum opus from Emilio Estevez better known as Martin Sheen's son and Charlie Sheen's less talented brother about the life and times of the late New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy.Well actually it's about 10 minutes in the life and times of Robert F. Kennedy the rest of the movie's 112minute running time is filled with boring unnecessary fictional vignettes about idiots working in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel where the senator was assassinated in 1968.Why on Earth would someone name a film Bobby proposing it to be a homage to the brother of a recently assassinated president coming into his own and then stuff it with the most banal and uninteresting stories? I have no idea friends.All of these tales take place on June 6 1968 the day of the California primary in which Kennedy is battling another antiwar dove Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and LBJ's conservative vicepresident Hubert Humphrey.This little description is about the only real history you will get from this mishmash of a film which soon meanders off into a wildlyspinning series of unrelated concoctions very loosely tied to the upcoming assassination. In fact had it not been for several actual newsreels of Kennedy on the campaign trail this picture would have had nothing whatsoever to do with his life and death.I only wish they would have just spliced these images together and we would have a film to remember.

Yeah I really care that Helen Hunt forgot to buy shoes or that Anthony Hopkins once met FDR or that a waitress from Ohio dropped acid once.And speaking of that the LSD freakout scene was one of the most insipid and embarrassing pieces of trash ever slopped onto celluloid.

I actually though I was hallucinating while watching it.Finally however after almost two hours of nothing happening even I was almost ready to take a few shots at some of these people.In fact when Sirhan Sirhan finally arrives at the hotel most of the audience was relieved to see the only likable character who could end this colossal mess. Sirhan should have first gone after Estevez who seems to direct this film with a circus mallet though and spared us from an intellectual and cinematic assassination we may never get over.Bobby Kennedy was one of the most unique and compelling men of our generation.

	onyx:emotionText "Another movie that was even more of a disappointment than The Fountain is the magnum opus from Emilio Estevez better known as Martin Sheen's son and Charlie Sheen's less talented brother about the life and times of the late New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy.Well actually it's about 10 minutes in the life and times of Robert F. Kennedy the rest of the movie's 112minute running time is filled with boring unnecessary fictional vignettes about idiots working in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel where the senator was assassinated in 1968.Why on Earth would someone name a film Bobby proposing it to be a homage to the brother of a recently assassinated president coming into his own and then stuff it with the most banal and uninteresting stories? I have no idea friends.All of these tales take place on June 6 1968 the day of the California primary in which Kennedy is battling another antiwar dove Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and LBJ's conservative vicepresident Hubert Humphrey.This little description is about the only real history you will get from this mishmash of a film which soon meanders off into a wildlyspinning series of unrelated concoctions very loosely tied to the upcoming assassination. In fact had it not been for several actual newsreels of Kennedy on the campaign trail this picture would have had nothing whatsoever to do with his life and death.I only wish they would have just spliced these images together and we would have a film to remember.

The Player Short Cuts Crash...Emilio Estevez makes a hamfisted attempt to fashion a memoriam to the illfated brother of JFK using the multistrand plot and character technique associated with Robert Altman. But Estevez clearly lacks Altman's ability to maintain interest and build character through the use of trivialities revelations and encounters as the film progresses.The premise is the 'last day in the life of' Bobby Kennedy as he campaigns in the California Primary of 1968. Except it's the goings on in the Ambassador Hotel where he will be shot that evening that feature rather than the character itself. It's a structural device perhaps even influenced by the obvious and somewhat alienating reverence that Estevez has for Kennedy.Excerpts of speeches and public reactions to his visit are intercut into the movie that almost portray him as this Ghandilike presence on the cusp of commencing a national transformation that will not only end the war in Vietnam but apparently bring an end to 'hatred and violence' and a new sense of community. What is overlaid across the film with the intent of being inspirational often comes across as simplistic. Estevez simply does not have a sufficiently detached critical sense to connect to more sceptical viewers. L.A liberals and ageing hippies will of course by weeping into their popcorn buckets.However there are a couple of nice turns which you inevitably get in a film with such a cast.

Other than the inspiring actual quotes and clips of Bobby Kennedy this movie is a disaster of fiction and Estevez's political agenda. Why not just tell the real story Emilio? Is it too hard to do the research to get the story right? Your fiction makes Oliver Stone's conspiracy theorybased JFK look like a Pulitzer Prize winning documentary. The only chance that this movie has is that younger audiences may not care that there's no basis in truth in Estevez's story about RFK and what happened at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4 1968. If you ask me Estevez should NEVER be allowed to direct a movie again. He is a hack as a writer and director who didn't even care enough about Bobby Kennedy to get the story right. What's the matter Emilio the actual five people including RFK's friend Paul Schrade who was shot in the forehead directly behind Bobby weren't interesting enough characters for you to base your story on? Or were you just too lazy to research their real lives. So you just made up people to get shot including pretend characters two Kennedy college volunteers who dropped LSD for the first time that day? Or a kid who wanted to avoid the Viet Nam war by getting married to a school friend to get a fake marriage certificate? Or a honorable Kitchen Manager who was kind to illegal immigrant Latino's who was fired that very day by his boss who was cheating on his marriage with former Austin Powers hotie Heather Graham? Gee Emilio what terrific characters yeah right. It's beautifully filmed and edited but this entire film is a big lie designed to promote Emilio's political agenda to a Get out of Iraq and b to promote amnesty for oppressed Latino illegal immigrants. The only actual real people portrayed in the film are Sirhan Sirhan on camera for less than a minute and Latino bus boy Juan Romero... who Emilio calls Jose'. Shame on Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen and the ultraliberal Hollywood elite who helped bring this work of leftist propaganda to the big screen masqueraded as a true story of the events at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4 1968. Shame on you all. I can't even watch a true documentary about Bobby Kennedy without shedding tears but your film except for the actual clips of RFK disgusted me.".

Furthermore there was little in the way of a cohesive story or narrative. Scene after scene started to play like a vignette in an acting class and the vast majority rang falsely due to the atrocious writing.I found myself waiting for Bobby Kennedy to be integrated into the story in some meaningful way but that never happened. Whatever you do don't go to this movie thinking it has much to do with Bobby Kennedy.Finally towards the very end of the movie when Robert Kennedy the great orator and only charismatic character in the movie starts to speak  the director decided to mute Kennedy's voice and play the Simon  Garfunkel song The Sounds of Silence over his speech! The last movie that Emilio Estevez wrote and directed was Men at Work an unsuccessful comedy about garbage men. He is completely out of his league with this material and misses the mark by miles. I contemplated walking out of the theater several times as this mess unraveled on the screen.Bottom line avoid at all costs.".

The first is a narrative about a bunch of truly uninteresting and useless personalities who work in a hotel. The other is a collection of film clips from the RFK campaign. Putting the two of these together could have been a good idea. In this case it results in nothing less than a disaster and travesty which insults us the audience and even worse it immerses RFK into the worst kind of soap opera trash. It's an insult to all concerned.I gave this film two stars instead of zero because of the film clips and Laurence Fishburne's acting which almost saved the character he was playing. In all honesty it's been a long time since I've seen a film this bad. Furthermore I lived thru the 60's and this film does nothing whatsoever to capture the atmosphere of the times. The doper scenes are caricatures. There's no tension whatsoever either between the characters or about the politics of the day. Believe me 1968 was anything but a dull year. People were truly freaking out. The whole country was falling apart. From this film we're led to believe that the biggest crisis of the day was a dullsville hotel manager cheating on his wife and an alcoholic lounge singer.What were the people who made this garbage thinking?Well that's the review I wrote immediately after seeing this film. However upon further reflection I'm having a very different take.Particularly irksome was the casting in this story. It's all big names. In fact it's totally topheavy. This is most annoying. Oh there's the Hobbit! Oh there's the West Wing! Oh there's Morpheus! If a Hollywood film has two of these people that's normal they're balanced by the lesser known actors.But these are not stupid people. So it dawned on me this is exactly what they wanted to do. This is not really a film about RFK or the assassination or the Ambassador Hotel. It's a political statement from Hollywood. Laurence Fishburne's Uncle Tom routine has nothing to do with the story line it's seriously out of whack with the politics of race of the day. That's clear. This also explains why none of the subplots ties in at all with the assassination. They're not supposed to. I kept wondering what the heck the Czech reporter had to do with any of this. Now it's clear. She was there to show that tho the message is antiright establishment but they're not Commmie Pinkos the traditional retort of the conservative right. And that stuff about the CHADS! obvious in retrospect.This film is an in joke. It's a message from the Hollywood elite about how little we've progressed and how off track politically and socially we've become how we're still embroiled in stupid wars racism poitical duplicity etc. That's the only explanation that makes any sense to me. These are not stupid people. Taken at face value this film is nonsense.".

Lets get every actor and actress in Hollywood a popular historical figure to base the movie on and add many disjointed uninteresting stories into it and see what happens. What happens is you get a very bad movie. The historical value of the movie is next to bill so I was at least expecting a decent story but it does not deliver there either. How this has a composite score of 7 is beyond me. Stay away from this garbage. Has Hollywood really run out of ideas? I hope the talents that brought us this severely lacking piece of cinematic sewage stay far away from directing and cameras in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Bobby Kennedy was the reincarnation of Nostradamus instead of the reincarnation of Jesus that this movie makes him out to be and knew this movie was going to be made one day he would have done a Matrix move that night and dodged those bullets. Headlines around the country would have read BOBBY DODGES ASSASSIN'S BULLETS BECOMES AWESOMEST PERSON TO EVER LIVECHUCK NORRIS ROUNDHOUSE KICKS SELF IN DEFEAT. Emilio Estevez attempting to make a Robert Altman movie about that tragic night when Kennedy did not dodge those bullets while forgetting that Altman makes well made rest his soul movies about real people as opposed to symbolic mouthpieces for misguided speechifying and transparent heavyhanded periodevocation has made what some might call this year's Crash a big ensemble drama that is About Things with all the subtlety of one of Charlton Heston's climactic outbursts at the end of almost every movie he was ever in. But Crash was competently written acted and directed and is a fairly interesting and lucid piece of thoughtprovocation regardless of its contrived sledgehammer tactics. I'm not sure what Bobby wants to be about. It would appear to be an attempt to explore via crosssection what was probably the most turbulent passage of 1960's American history but the writing is so awkward and the interconnected stories so hamfisted that the final product seems to suggest that the second Kennedy assassination of the decade was simply the only thing that wasn't boring and ridiculous about the day on which it occurred.The final passage in which the characters shut up and the event the whole mess has been building up to finally occurs has an undeniable power but all that's left after the smoke has cleared is inept pseudoliberal pornography saying nothing in particular with anything approaching actual eloquence. The most laughable passages involve two campaign workers doing acid with possibly the most glaring and unintentionally hilarious hippie stereotype seen on film since the antidrug propaganda of the day played perhaps fittingly by master thespian Ashton Kutcher. His performance suggests a degree of selfawareness that the more respectable actors in the cast let's see...that's all of them barring perhaps Christian Slater fresh off his performances in Uwe Boll's apocalyptic semimasterpiece Alone in the Dark and the directtovideo Hollow Man 2 miss entirely in their desperate flailing grabs for emotional resonance in Estevez's graceless prose. While Kutcher's possibly unintentional aura of selfawareness is perhaps the only thing that sustains his career here he seems to be the only one who realizes that he's being Punk'd by this wellmeaning garbage.It also has been made with a disrespect for nonKennedyrelated history and plain old facts. A large part of it tells the stories of the other people who were shot that night but their stories here are entirely fictional. The subplot involving Elijah Wood marrying Lindsay Lohan to get out of the draft is completely worthless not just because Lohan is a bad actress and every subplot in this mess is worthless but because even the users of the IMDb apparently knew more about this than the filmmakers did and have God bless them pointed out the fact that the marriage loophole was closed several years before the events in the film. The film traffics in fauxliberal truthiness like Stephen Colbert's fauxconservatism does. While I can get behind artistic license being taken when it makes a true story more cinematic here it just allows the creatively bankrupt but morally righteous Estevez to drag the proceedings into a mire of clichs that might not have been there in the first place.The whole cast even the talented portion William H. Macy Anthony Hopkins Morpheus does work ranging from mediocre to outright embarrassing. It's hard to tell whether Demi Moore's horrible performance as an alcoholic singer was just because of Estevez's script or the fact that she should be kept as far away as possible from a camera at all times. There's also some inexplicable rambling from the inexplicable Helen Hunt whom within her first minute of screen time I wanted to reach through the screen and sucker punch in the ovaries. It gets so bad that her husband Martin Sheen grabs her and says YOU ARE NOT YOUR SHOES! This isn't what I would have done but it makes about as much sense as the rest of the script.Bobby is the worst film I've sat through in a theater all year. This might say something about how choosy I am with which films I see but here the writing is so bad and the storytelling so misguided that I was squirming in my seat for long stretches of the film and I never do that. That it's been nominated for Best Drama at the Golden Globes says more about the relevance of the Globes than it does about the quality of this abortion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most articles on this film tend to overlook the intrinsic qualities of the film as film though of course these are connected with the propaganda aspect. The opening scenes the board meeting and subsequent meeting are strong and the key to the propaganda in a very short time it is effectively made clear what the point of view of this film is and what follows is an entertaining and propagandaeffective film. From the moment we are on the ship until the collision the film is drama routine but one of the better sort. Really exiting is the film from collision till sinking i.e. when the real drama emerges and the splendid special effects do their jobs not one aspect of the outlined drama is forgotten it is fastpaced and very well directed.Of the cast it is Sybille Schmitz who excels while other members also do a very good job they must have done so otherwise the whole propaganda aspect would not have come across. There is one exception here it seems that Hans Neilsen playing the German officer is very good but he is not. It is often said that he speaks his lines as a Wehrmacht officer on duty but for me his machine gun like delivered lines sound more like the staccato of the regular commentator of the Deutsche Wochenschau compare this when you have the possibility.Though this film is obviously antiBritish it is rather anti English capitalist establishment and their decadence than antiBritish per se  an anticapitalism not so much based on to generalize theoretical arguments but as most of fascist ideas on the petty bourgeois middle class mentality and jealousy towards others who are better off. The crux for this is in the strong opening it is here when Ismay remarks that he cannot take into account the interests of the small investors they must bend to his need and of course greed. As such the focus of the propaganda is established on the ship we meet very wealthy people playing with money e.g. the gamblers and people preferring money above people Lord Astor well played by Schnbock these being decorum for the propaganda and an elaboration of the already established focus. Money large sums bidden for almost everything plays the major part in this film it should have received first credit. Lord Astor even worries about stolen jewelry while the ship is sinking money makes decadent. Compare for instance the cynic way of life upper deck and the more natural and spontaneous life lower deck. Noteworthy is that after its rerelease in 1950 it was quickly banned again in the Western zones while in the Soviet zone it was screened without a problem the anticapitalism might have done the trick.The proGerman aspect and the answer to everything is German officer Petersen. He not almost single handedly saves a part of the passengers he also shows the right spirit when it comes to human feelings. Only when the Baltic countess says she has no money anymore he gives room for his feelings towards her what a fine chap he is! And it is from that point on that she does her duty as a human being and starts helping out with the rescue money makes cynic.There is also a hint of Durchhaltefilm here. Take for instance that schematic and ideological German rural couple not a couple of flesh and blood they seem to have walked straight out of a Nazi rural painting. Men and women are separated for the rescue but this couple stays together in an almost religious shot they hold hands expressing that nothing can separate them. They are separated by force of the panic but reconciled again in the end. No catastrophe can undermine the simple German life.This Titanic has its influence on film history as well. It has been ripped off at least twice first in 1958 for A Night to Remember a story widely known and recently by James Cameron who for his Titanic but boring endeavour stole quite some story ideas and complete scenes check this when you have the opportunity.It is often written that this film was not released in Germany cause of the death suicide murder? of its first director Selpin. Wetzel  Hagemann in their survey of censorship in Nazi Germany book 1978 claim that this is not so. It had its unnoticed premiere in 1943 in unimportant cinemas only to be banned in December 1944 for the wellknown reason the audience was not to be confronted with catastrophes.Beware which version you see as I understand it there are 2 versions. The longer one the one I saw includes a final scene in court Petersen is the German J'accuse of Bruce Ismay but there appears to be no British justice.".

	schema:headline " A Dramatic Effective Telling of the Titanic Story  From Nazi Germany";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not that common in movie history that a director angers the producerdistributor of his movie so much that the latter has the former murdered.  That's what happened to codirector Herbert Selpin in 1942 before the release of Germany's film contribution to the Titanic saga.  Dr. Josef Goebbels Hitler's propaganda minister and selfanointed arbiter of culture in the Third Reich had the Gestapo arrest Selpin who was reported dead in his cell the day after.  Suicide?  Ridiculous.The Titanic story has been told many times on film both as documentary and as drama.  Interest currently appears to intensify with the same speed as the overvisited wreck rapidly succumbs to a final ballet of disintegration.Years ago The Film Society of Lincoln Center ran a retrospective of movies produced during the Third Reich.  For most attendees it was a revelation and a disturbing one at that.  Many are familiar with the late Leni Reifenstahl's documentary paean to the Olympics propaganda aside one of the greatest films of that genre and the odious Jude Suss is the iconographic movie symbolism of Nazi antisemitism. Few were aware how much genuine creativity free of obvious dogmatism emerged from that twelveyear period of German darkness and depravity. The retrospective made many think about the complexity of life in 19331945 Germany.One of the films I saw was the 1943 Titanic which had a small premiere followed by an order from Goebbels pulling the movie.  Ostensibly Germans were not to be exposed to seeing the panic on the great liner as it foundered actually most Germans especially those in urban areas had more visible frequent reasons to panic by 1943.Selpin with codirector Werner Klingler turned out a sumptuous ornate and dramatically compelling movie.  Largely using the known facts Titanic tells the well worn tale of a ship driven to unreasonable and dangerous speeds in order to set a record.  There are some significant deviations. Here the English first officer  seized with some malady  is replaced by a German seaman named Petersen a model of experience and rectitude.  J. Bruce Ismay whose social life was justifiably ruined because of his escaping the sinking behemoth is unrealistically portrayed as a grasping cad whose crudity was not found in the selfabsorbed rich and supinely confident real shipping magnate.  The vessel's master Captain Smith is overly subservient to Ismay but he responds well to the disaster.This movie wasn't made on the cheap.  Given the deteriorating wartime situation a lot of marks were expended for terrific sets and fine attire. There's no real Nazi propaganda.  The movie ends with a comment that English greed occasioned the loss of so many lives but very many books and articles from Old Blighty and the U.S. echo that view.Because of its antiBritish utterances the Allies banned the movie in their sectors in Germany at first while it was freely available in the Soviet zone.  Hardly a surprisethat movie maven Stalin probably loved this capitalistbashing film.KINO VIDEO has performed a real service by releasing the film on DVD.  There are two versionsthis release is the shorter one without the trial scene in which survivor Petersen rails against the British in court.  Actually the movie is stronger for that omission.  After she goes down what else is there really to say?There are some interesting special features on the disc including an early commercial short made by the White Star Line showing the amenities of RMS Olympic another luxury liner built before Titanic technically Olympic wasn't a sister ship of its more famous and briefly triumphant successor but the differences aren't important.This is an important release for Titanic buffs but also for those interested in filmmaking in Nazi Germany.  There were movies made that deserve current viewing for reasons apart from their historic association with a barbaric regime.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Too many just dismiss this film outright as Nazi propaganda and don't examine the film as a film.  Certainly when compared to the 1953 Hollywood TITANIC it's a far better made and less sappy piece of drama. And if it has a lot to be desired as history  well then so did the Hollywood film. The performances direction and special effects are all excellent for the time. In fact it's very surprising that the German film industry was able to mount such a first class production as this in the midst of the war.Which brings me around to the propaganda aspect of the film to my mind it's been very much over stated in accounts on the film that I've read. Apparently the most vicious part of the film's propaganda content a trial scene and end title which condemned Britain as a country driven by greed have been omitted from all current prints.  Still were it the Hate the British film it's often dismissed as it's truly amazing to see the propaganda aspects in the film that are missed.  The Third Class are never shown being locked below decks as the ship sinks indeed when the ship's engines stop they march up to First Class to demand an explanation from the Captain and the crew and officers to a man are shown being skilled efficient and brave.  How could the Nazi's miss so many easy targets and ones that have been included in almost every Titanic film to this day? And while it is true that Bruce Ismay is turned into a first class villain driving his ship without regard for safety straight into the iceberg  it's also been that way in every other Titanic film in which he's been portrayed for example the recent TV miniseries TITANIC  which shows Ismay down in the boiler room screaming at the stokers to make the ship go faster  like that really happened!.  It's all just a question of degree.  And if the film portrays the rich millionaires like John Jacob Astor as people who will use money class and power to achieve anything  well it's no worse than some of the stories  printed amid all the bravery and selfsacrifice slop  that appeared in 1912 newspapers.  Remember after the disaster Ismay and the White Star Line were acquitted people were led to believe all the First Class men died bravely Captain Smith was blamed for everything and the poor souls who lost everything when the ship went down never got a penny in restitution.  Thus in the end considering all the untruths and legends that have sprung up around the Titanic story I believe this film plays a lot less like a Nazi film and more like an anticapitalist one.  Little wonder it played in East Germany after the war with no problem.  There's certainly enough Hate the Rich sentiment here to have warmed Stalin's heart.So to me anyway it's almost refreshing to see a Titanic film that treats the whole affair as the monument to stupidity that it was.  Since it has nothing to do with history one must examine it as the first example of film makers trying to come to grips with the Titanic Legend. One could also award that place to the 1929 British film ATLANTIC  but for some unknown reason that film tried to pretend it was fiction.  Looked at from that prospective it's a fascinating piece of film making and history that deserves to be seen without the vicious Nazi film tag hanging over it. Certainly James Cameron must have seen a lot to admire in it why else would he have copied shots and plot ideas unmasse.  He also coped shots and dialogue from every other Titanic film ever made. Thankfully he didn't copy the film's greatest abet fictional moment wireless operator Phillips releasing his pet canary into the night as Nearer My God to Thee plays in the background.  Did director Herbert Selpin crib this bit from von Stroheim's GREED?  We'll never know as it's said he was murdered by the Nazi's before the film was completed.  So much for the benefits of creating a Nazi film.".

It uses the sinking of the Titanic as a vehicle to criticize the avarice of capitalist England their enemy at the time.

In truth it's not a bad film. But in truth it's not something you need to bother with unless the political propaganda aspects sound appealing. Or unless you are just curious about different film versions of the events. The effects here are vivid and often very realistic until they show the ship from the water. The interpersonal acting is uneven and a bit stiff going usually with some caricaturing used as a way to avoid character development.If you want a classic older Titanic film for the pure drama of the disaster I suggest the 1958 A Night to Remember a British production over the American 1953 Titanic which has star power but is boring by comparison. Of course there is the 1997 version in color which has its own problems and dazzlements. But stop to at least imagine what the Nazi regime could possibly have been thinking spending a ton of money on an unlikely movie just as the tide is turning against them in the war.

Director Herbert Selpin and Werner Klingler made an European classic with this film vehicle. Forced to include some unnecessary propaganda which the film could do without this does not overshadow the artistic merits of the film. The special effects are so so but the filmmakers do make you believe you are onboard a sinking ship. Everybody on the screen pulled off a gripping and believable story in glorious black and white.

One would think it was more a communist propaganda film than a Nazi one since all of the villains of the piece are the rich while the poor workers are the heroes. Its a film that has a definite point of view and right or wrong is certainly one that keeps things interesting to watch. Centering on the rich owners of the White Star Line and the rich passengers on the ship this film is in large part about how the greed of the rich led to the destruction of society. A large portion of the early part of this film has to do with manipulating stock before the Titanic breaks a speed record allowing the owners to get even richer. The plan seems to backfire and as the rich try to pick up the pieces the ship hits an iceberg. There are also several other story lines running through this film including a healthy dose of romance so don't think its all business.While some of the interior model shots of the sinking are obviously models the scenes of panic and the real human drama makes this a film to watch. Its understandable why the Nazi's banned this film as upsetting these people are in panic mode. I read somewhere that this film showed the ship breaking in half. Kino's DVD doesn't appear to show that although the final slide under the waves is really too dark to see.While not a perfect film its a good one. Certainly its one with enough talking points that you could very well talk about the film on every level for many hours after its finished running. Frankly There is so much to discuss that I'm having a hard time keeping this entry brief.If you love film if you love Titanic stories if you love seeing something different then see this movie.7 out of 10 but you'll be talking about so much more than most other movies you've seen in years.".

Ismay was all too happy to leave New York City after Smith got through with him.So yes the story is truthfully full of social unfairness and bigotry and selfishness.

The villain of course is Ismay the head of the British White Star Line who is looking for the stock in White Star to go up if the much ballyhooed Titanic makes a record crossing in its maiden voyage. Peterson as portrayed by Hans Nielsson is as Aryan as they come while Ismay looks vaguely like those people we're eliminating as played by E.F.Fuhwanger.John Jacob Astor is here to represent American capitalism. Such folks as Captain Harry Guggenheim and Mr.Mrs. Isidor Straus who died in the sinking are eliminated from the story. So is the plucky Denver millionairess Molly Brown. For a movie that's supposed to show and criticize the British class distinction very little time is spent on the huddled masses in steerage who were the bulk of the people killed. James Cameron in the recent Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet spent more time with them than this production.

	schema:reviewBody "I mean here it is 1943 and the Nazis make a movie about a great disaster that befell their chief enemy Great Britain.So do you expect a movie loaded with stereotypical Colonel Blimps English incompetence and general disorder or what? If you do that's not exactly what you get. I'm surprised that in the midst of a war they were losing the German film industry could put together an expensive disaster flick. True the model work is a little clumsy but there are hundreds of extras and lavish sets.It's not badly done. I tuned in for a travesty of historical events but stayed until the end caught up in what is basically a compelling story. The acting is stiff the direction unimaginative and some of the drama is obviously fictional but the narrative sweeps you up willy nilly.Probably it isn't as well done as A Night to Remember a British retelling of the tale that appeared about ten years later and which closely resembles the 1943 version. At the same time it has to be admitted that it's a BIG improvement over the 1950s American version with Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb basically a soap opera with a tackedon ship sinking.Is there any propaganda value in the film? A little. A German officer aboard repeatedly clashes with Ismay President of the White Star Lines over the heedless speed at which the ship is traveling. Ismay is the major heavy and he looks vaguely Jewish. Some sympathy is shown towards the Astor family. And there was also a wealthy and prominent elderly Jewish couple aboard whose name escapes me but who aren't mentioned in the film at all. Nor is Molly Brown the usual fun figure. The third class passengers are treated with respect but are not sentimentalized. At the inquiry Ismay gets off and all of the blame falls on the hapless now drowned Captain Smith much to the German officer's disgust. An epilogue mentions something about the English greed for profit or something. I was so busy trying to translate the German crawls that I didn't realize there were subtitles.It's still amazing isn't it after all these years that so many lives were so needlessly lost. The SS California was in sight but was unable to hear the Titanic's distress calls and misinterpreted her distress flares. There were thousands of people aboard and lifeboats enough for only a few hundred. As it was some of the lifeboat took off half empty. Everyone knew there was dangerous ice around and yet the ship was kept traveling at speed despite immediate warnings. Not enough planning and too much imprudent hoping that it wouldn't happen. As I write this New Orleans Louisiana is being evacuated after 80 percent of the city was flooded by a thoroughly expected hurricane. Preparations were inadequate because manpower and supplies were not available and there was not just a lack of organization but actual conflict over who was in charge. This is known as history repeating itself.Well not exactly repeating itself except in the most general terms yet there are parallels. In both cases it was the poor who suffered the most as is almost always the case but the sinking of the Titanic exhibited the effect of not one variable poverty but two variables poverty and genderage. A statistical analysis would probably call for analysis of variance. What I mean is that aboard the Titanic as everyone knows the rule was women and children first. But the rule was confounded by social class. Most of the women and children saved were firstclass passengers. The next greatest percentage of women and children saved were from second class. And only a small percentage of thirdclass women and children were saved.Well enough rattling on. This is worth catching not just because it is an historical curiosity which it is but because it's a gripping story as well.".

The acting is stiff the direction unimaginative and some of the drama is obviously fictional but the narrative sweeps you up willy nilly.Probably it isn't as well done as A Night to Remember a British retelling of the tale that appeared about ten years later and which closely resembles the 1943 version. At the same time it has to be admitted that it's a BIG improvement over the 1950s American version with Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb basically a soap opera with a tackedon ship sinking.Is there any propaganda value in the film? A little. A German officer aboard repeatedly clashes with Ismay President of the White Star Lines over the heedless speed at which the ship is traveling. Ismay is the major heavy and he looks vaguely Jewish. Some sympathy is shown towards the Astor family. And there was also a wealthy and prominent elderly Jewish couple aboard whose name escapes me but who aren't mentioned in the film at all. Nor is Molly Brown the usual fun figure. The third class passengers are treated with respect but are not sentimentalized. At the inquiry Ismay gets off and all of the blame falls on the hapless now drowned Captain Smith much to the German officer's disgust. An epilogue mentions something about the English greed for profit or something. I was so busy trying to translate the German crawls that I didn't realize there were subtitles.It's still amazing isn't it after all these years that so many lives were so needlessly lost. The SS California was in sight but was unable to hear the Titanic's distress calls and misinterpreted her distress flares. There were thousands of people aboard and lifeboats enough for only a few hundred. As it was some of the lifeboat took off half empty. Everyone knew there was dangerous ice around and yet the ship was kept traveling at speed despite immediate warnings. Not enough planning and too much imprudent hoping that it wouldn't happen. As I write this New Orleans Louisiana is being evacuated after 80 percent of the city was flooded by a thoroughly expected hurricane. Preparations were inadequate because manpower and supplies were not available and there was not just a lack of organization but actual conflict over who was in charge. This is known as history repeating itself.Well not exactly repeating itself except in the most general terms yet there are parallels. In both cases it was the poor who suffered the most as is almost always the case but the sinking of the Titanic exhibited the effect of not one variable poverty but two variables poverty and genderage. A statistical analysis would probably call for analysis of variance. What I mean is that aboard the Titanic as everyone knows the rule was women and children first. But the rule was confounded by social class. Most of the women and children saved were firstclass passengers. The next greatest percentage of women and children saved were from second class. And only a small percentage of thirdclass women and children were saved.Well enough rattling on. This is worth catching not just because it is an historical curiosity which it is but because it's a gripping story as well.";

In the true story of the 15 April 1912 tragedy in which 1503 people lost their lives Goebbels saw a grand opportunity to denounce British opportunism stupidity and greed. Goebbels had the script written by a fanatical Nazi Zerlett Olfenius. Direction was entrusted to Herbert Selpin who had successfully handled movie versions of other maritime disasters despite the fact that Goebbels was well aware that Selpin had little love for the Nazi regime. However ZerlettOlfenius was entrusted with shooting the second unit work on location in the port of Gdynia in Poland. In May 1942 whilst Selpin shot the interiors in Berlin ZerlettOlfenius was detailed to direct the matching exteriors in Gdynia. When no footage at all arrived from Gdynia the frustrated Selpin journeyed to that port to investigate. He confronted Zerlett Olfenius and the two men had a bitter quarrel during which Selpin made many insulting references to the German armed forces. Zerlett Olfenius reported Selpin to the Gestapo. Selpin was arrested and thrown into jail on a charge of treason. Unwilling to delay shooting and bring the matter to trial the evil Goebbels ordered the prison guards to murder Selpin in his cell on the night of 31 July 1942. The propaganda minister then gave out that the treasonable Selpin had admitted his guilt by committing suicide. Werner Klinger was contracted to complete the film.However Selpin had the last laugh after all. When Goebbels viewed the completed picture he had enough wit to realize that its propaganda effects would be the exact opposite of what he and ZerlettOlfenius had intended. Not only were the scenes of panic among the passengers uncomfortably akin to the contemporary reactions of German civilians under Allied bombing raids but the instigator of the whole tragedy Ismay was shown to be a corrupt selfseeking leader reckless of people's lives in his own lust for power money and glory. A Hitler figure in other words. Titanic was shown in Paris in order to recoup at least part of its enormous cost but in Germany it was not released at all until 1950.COMMENTThere are a number of movies dealing with the Titanic tragedy but for sheer entertainment zing and gusto this version is hard to beat. Not only are special effects absolutely marvelous and the scenes of shipboard panic and mayhem absolutely riveting but the sets are superb the costumes startling and the acting dazzlingly charismatic. Nielsen hugs audience sympathy as the harassed Petersen Miss Schmitz despite a long dark wig that is a trifle disconcerting transforms realistically from richesinto rescuer while the stunninglygowned Heiberg limns the most decorative of highclass vamps and the evilvisaged Wernicke makes a human figure of the luckless Captain Smith. And a special clap to Jolly Mare who performs the sexiest dance number by which all others will now be measured.Selpin's driving pacey direction boosted by BehnGrund's splendid camerawork nails home every hideously fascinating detail of this most terrible of maritime tragedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't mind movies changing history or taking various different variations on a story but this movie is nothing more but a piece of Nazi propaganda used to especially make the English look bad this time. The did the story in such a way that it seemed as if the greed and lust for money was the reason for the Titanic to sink.But of course this angle could had also been taken years later in basically every other Titanic so I'll judge this movie as a movie rather than a propaganda piece.At this point I have seen every relevant Titanic movie. As far as Titanic movies are concerned this version is not amongst the best ones. The movie feels rather rushed and in terms of its look and style it also isn't the most impressive version around. It must had been far from the costly Titanic movie to make which can be really seen in the movie. It doesn't ever use big establishing shots of the ship or its interiors. Also the actual sinking is done quite simply as we get to see very little people actually dying or struggling to survive. Still I must say that they did a good job with its available resources and little money they had to spend. They used some creative solutions.Also its story aside from its underlying main plot is a quite well done one. The movie has many different characters in it and it decides not to have really one or two main characters. So what we have now are many different characters with many different stories and backdrops.

	onyx:emotionText "I don't mind movies changing history or taking various different variations on a story but this movie is nothing more but a piece of Nazi propaganda used to especially make the English look bad this time. The did the story in such a way that it seemed as if the greed and lust for money was the reason for the Titanic to sink.But of course this angle could had also been taken years later in basically every other Titanic so I'll judge this movie as a movie rather than a propaganda piece.At this point I have seen every relevant Titanic movie. As far as Titanic movies are concerned this version is not amongst the best ones. The movie feels rather rushed and in terms of its look and style it also isn't the most impressive version around. It must had been far from the costly Titanic movie to make which can be really seen in the movie. It doesn't ever use big establishing shots of the ship or its interiors. Also the actual sinking is done quite simply as we get to see very little people actually dying or struggling to survive. Still I must say that they did a good job with its available resources and little money they had to spend. They used some creative solutions.Also its story aside from its underlying main plot is a quite well done one. The movie has many different characters in it and it decides not to have really one or two main characters. So what we have now are many different characters with many different stories and backdrops. It ensures that the movie also remains interesting and the movie doesn't really ever have any slow moments it. It's also a quite short movie so that also surely helps.It could had actually been a much better movie had it not felt and looked that much rushed.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

This story angle is an interesting one as the focus is not only on the human drama and several sensitively portrayed love stories but also on placing blame for the loss of 1500 human lives on a few greedy men.I can highly recommend this version of the tragic yet fascinating story.

Once one gets past the oddity factor of having a German hero and hearing these Britons talking in German the end result is a very interesting version of the Titanic disaster my rating veered between 12 and  all the way through the film and though it definitely has its faults I decided to go with the higher rating because of its undeniable artistic qualities  not to mention the singular and decidedly fresh viewpoint offered for this oftfilmed shipset drama.The characterizations offer a microcosmic dogeatdog world in which various financiers and other uppercrust members of British society teeter on the edge of bankruptcy and are further tensed up by petty jealousies a theft of jewelry and finally the sinking of the ship itself the stock market element a major plot point recalls another disaster film THE END OF THE WORLD 1916 which I've just watched. Still the most interesting character is perhaps the female lead played by the beautiful and tragic Sybille Schmitz  she had appeared in Carl Dreyer's VAMPYR 1931 and her life story would eventually be fictionalized in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's VERONIKA VOSS 1982.To get now to the cons I mentioned earlier the ship only sinks at the very last minute although while one shouldn't expect much spectacle the special effects are very well handled for the period and the courtroom epilogue is somewhat anticlimactic as it reveals that many of the despicable protagonists survived the tragedy which was perhaps a mistake. The overt critique of the British as snobbish egocentric and moneygrubbing and especially the concluding statement seems fairly hilarious now  but one wonders if it was actually so unrealistic given the unmitigated and misguided optimism that was clearly felt by all back in the day with respect to the entire Titanic venture! It's been quite a while since I watched A NIGHT TO REMEMBER 1958 and I've yet to check out the 1953 glossy Hollywood version still even in comparison with the latest 'definitive' though actually overblown and exceedingly commercial version the 1943 film practically covers all the various angles  including the plight of the secondclass voyagers the robbery and even the impossible central romance  in less than half the runningtime! Alarmingly director Herbert Selpin was arrested and subsequently executed by the Gestapo sometime during production and Werner Klinger who went on to dabble in Edgar Wallace Krimis and the revamped DR. MABUSE films of the 1960s stepped in  but the results are quite seamless!

In one scene where a young woman is dancing to entertain her fellow passengers in the lower class section it is very obvious that the bra had not yet been invented...wow! I wondered how that scene could have slipped past the Nazi censors then I remembered that it would not have been anything remarkable back then as prior to the 1950's women in general just didn't wear those things.

	schema:reviewBody "A stunning and original film. This is the second film by Alain Tanner I've seen. I watched his Jonah Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 last summer and it sticks with me as few films have. In the White City might not but who knows. It's already getting bigger in my mind and I only turned the VCR off about five minutes ago. This film concerns a drifter of sorts Bruno Ganz in a role very different from others of his that I've seen who finds his job as a sailor too tedious and unfulfilling. When his ship docks in Lisbon he quits without a word and moves into a small hotel. There he meets a cute bartender who works downstairs Teresa Madruga she's a strong personality which attracts him. The mystery surrounding the sailor pulls her in and they become lovers. Meanwhile Ganz wanders around Lisbon with a small handheld camera shooting random things. He also writes brief letters and throws them along with reels of film that he has shot into the mail. We then see another woman this one in Switzerland who is apparently Ganz's abandoned wife. We find out very little about her she never has a name. All we know is that she's upset about her man's absence and he seems to be cruelly hurting her. Is he doing this on purpose? What exactly is the deal with this guy? I was just as curious about this guy as Madruga was. But the more she finds out about him the less impressed she is. Perhaps he's not some romantic adventurer. Perhaps he's just a loser. I just found this person so fascinating. Many will find the film a bore I think but it was amazing to me. Even if you don't care for it you must admit that the jazzy musical score by JeanLuc Barbier is exceptional one of the best I think and that Accio de Almeida's cinematography is breathtaking. To me it's all around a masterpiece. 1010.".

This film concerns a drifter of sorts Bruno Ganz in a role very different from others of his that I've seen who finds his job as a sailor too tedious and unfulfilling. When his ship docks in Lisbon he quits without a word and moves into a small hotel. There he meets a cute bartender who works downstairs Teresa Madruga she's a strong personality which attracts him. The mystery surrounding the sailor pulls her in and they become lovers. Meanwhile Ganz wanders around Lisbon with a small handheld camera shooting random things. He also writes brief letters and throws them along with reels of film that he has shot into the mail. We then see another woman this one in Switzerland who is apparently Ganz's abandoned wife. We find out very little about her she never has a name. All we know is that she's upset about her man's absence and he seems to be cruelly hurting her. Is he doing this on purpose? What exactly is the deal with this guy? I was just as curious about this guy as Madruga was. But the more she finds out about him the less impressed she is. Perhaps he's not some romantic adventurer. Perhaps he's just a loser. I just found this person so fascinating. Many will find the film a bore I think but it was amazing to me. Even if you don't care for it you must admit that the jazzy musical score by JeanLuc Barbier is exceptional one of the best I think and that Accio de Almeida's cinematography is breathtaking. To me it's all around a masterpiece. 1010.";

But still for those who find it in their heart and will actually read on let me elaborate.It is not the idea that I don't like. Nor the fact that this movie has a pace that if adapted by a heart pacemaker the person who'd be carrying that pace maker would probably die. No that's not it. And I understand why some people like that theme of emptiness. Or can relate to it for that matter. But the inner conflict of our main guy is played out in a way that leaves you cold.Bruno Ganz character is almost emotionless only topped by his wife who cannot even deliver convincing voice over work which btw. is another one of the movies downfalls in stark contrast to the bar woman. She lives her emotion. And within their relationship there would be so much potential but you almost get nothing out of it. You instead keep wondering why this woman would keep falling for a guy who has no mystery at all which she discovers kind of late. A man who quit his job as a sailor to stay at a place forever. The irrationality of choosing this place stays hidden but does not matter that much either.The fact that you get episodes of his boring life even minutes of him in his room alone is a constant test of your patience and endurance. An idea like that quite likely works better in a book. Where it doesn't matter if you hear read the characters thoughts. Where you can imagine things. And the second best way this would work? No not in a movie especially if it is done this way but if you experience it yourself. But this is something most people wouldn't even think about doing ... and quite frankly even those who liked this would be rather punished before they experienced what Ganz was doing or going through even if there is a little bit of character development in the movie. In the end maybe the movie achieved something ... making you realize to live your life because it can get very boring.There is no passion here apart from the scenes of intercourse maybe and maybe just maybe Ganz's search trip at the end ...

Those who make money almost seem to apologize for their actions but on the other hand don't really feel guilty because that's the way it is.In a very simple and direct way the foundations of the current financial crisis are explained and even I kinda understood how this disaster was made possible now. Yes it is very frustrating and it just shows how irresponsibly our money is being treated by the banks or whoever else we negotiate about our money with. Unfortunately there is something wrong with the flow of this movie. I don't understand a lot of segments particularly the impression scenes. This seems to have become typical for Austrian documentary filmers  to just let the camera roll catch whatever just happens which is mostly nothing and edit it together as an eternal misery scene. Whereas in documentaries of the last years the statements are edited together so obviously to save time Let's make money takes its time to let people talk and THIS can be nerve wrecking. Some interviewees are very old and therefore talk VERY slow so it might take some time until the full sentence is over and when it's said it's very likely that you forgot how it began. As much as I treasure the content of the film I must admit that I found it extraordinarily boring and hard to watch. I don't know why directors or editors want to test their audience by presenting a film that appears half done. But I am sure that this one will earn tons of prizes for the very hot topic and the unconventional filmmaking. I for myself have seen way more accessible documentaries that are more informative and don't appear like they would try to be a piece of art.Conclusion Great topiccontent very poor presentation!".

It was made back in 2008 and director Erwin Wagenhofer made a film on the food industry before that and more recently a brilliant documentary on the education system. So this one here is his take on economy. as always with his works there is no narrator but the entire thing is told us from interviewees. There is a Leonard Cohen movie that includes the lyrics the poor stay poor the rich get richer and that is a perfect summary for this film here. I did not understand all the financial context given here but even with as little interest in and knowledge about economy as myself it is not difficult to understand the core issues that this film deals with.One of these would be greed. The fact that a very low percentage gets richer and richer results in a very high percentage getting poorer and poorer. Morals are also a central point here and it is sad to see how hardly anybody in the business seems to have them. I will not go much further into detail about the specific aspects that Wagenhofer elaborates on in here but one of them would be tax havens for example. Basically the entire film is about how rich people make use of almost illegal practices and possibilities in order to become even richer. In my opinion this documentary gives a good insight into the financial market right now but even more into the abyss of humans wanting more and more. A sad state of affairs and I agree with the last words from this documentary that we have a dark future ahead of us if we keep going like that. Recommended.".

It is THE best concert i have every seen helps that i think Freddie Murcury is very hot! Its very entertaining and keeps you stuck to your chair even after watching it about 50 times i cant get enough Freddie. Such a shame that such an attractivetalentedsmart man like Freddie isn't around today. But his music lives on i don't think a day goes by that you don't hear a Queen song on the radio or TV. I think this DVD is priceless knowing that Freddie didn't give may interview i feel lucky to have a copy of it. Freddie still lives in my heart!".

Every member of the band gave excellent performances including Freddie Mercury's vibrant arena rock voice will make the hair at the back of your neck stand up. Too bad I was too little to witness any of Queen's concerts when Freddie Mercury was still rocking the Earth. But now with the magic of DVD and the power of digital remastering you can almost feel as you're there among the other Queen fans. Great DVD for anyone getting into Queen or hardcore fans who do not own this instant classic yet. One of the minor concerns I have that really has nothing to do with the way they made the DVD but the actual concert itself. The song Flash was an intro and was not really a live performance and I would have liked to have seen it get performed live. Instead they fly in on the helicopter when the concert starts.".

He makes Roger Daltrey sound like an angel. And please tell me what is so great about Brian May's guitar? I mean sure he made it himself and everything but it's so screechy it just makes you want to hurl! Many of these songs performed are from the notorious 'Hot Space' album which has got to be the worst album ever recorded with exception of 'Sgt. Peppers'. Full of mindless disco beats these songs have no meaning at all and will most likely give you a migraine before they even start. In conclusion if you want to be mildly amused for a couple of hours this should do the trick. For some real entertainment I recommend The Spice Girls movie. Now that's entertainment!".

And where else can you find the uncredited Three Stooges with Ted Healy and Laurel  Hardy under the same roof? With Mickey Mouse? And there's a very surreal color Disney cartoon right in the middle with an odd song by BrownFreed.Use your fastforward button to get through some of the tedious musical numbers but make sure to catch the wild set with the orchestra members each on his own minibalcony and four pianists. There are some interesting special effects here and there along with a heavy usage of swipes between scenes.Robert Young and Arthur Treacher are in here along with many others whom I suppose I would have recognized if I had been a moviegoer in the 30s. And there are a number of lines that must have slipped right past the censors like Velez saying something about someone's cook being goosed or the closing barb by Durante's wife. He asks if he looks like a horse's head based on an earlier dream sequence. She says No not like a horse's HEAD very knowingly.It's a hairbrained silly plot but worth it just to watch all the stars go by.".

Polly Moran as a sex object and her trying to sing!!! They're all making fun of themselves and each other and all seemed to be having a whooping fun time doing the picture! But its savinggrace scene which makes the whole thing worthwhile Is Lupe Velez with Laurel  Hardy the eggsinthepants unspoken piece of shtick with only the body English performing is just hilariously beautiful! And when She starts laughing and socks them both they all start breaking up the camera cuts away to the next shot I'm convinced they adlibbed the whole thing just for the hell of it and broke down when they couldn't't hold back any longer it's that funny! This is a true comedy classic a welcome relief from the heavy dramas of the day a real keeper in my book!".

However Hal Roach did distribute his films through MGM thus the boys do show up in a couple of MGM films of this era. Also Disney's Mickey Mouse shows up for a comedic bit. I'd love to know how MGM ever worked that out with Walt.The jist of the plot is that Schnarzan Durante is losing his audience for his jungle jaunt movies since the death of his original lion. People think that the subsequent lions he wrestles in his films are flimsy excuses for courageous carnivores and box office receipts are beginning to drop. His producer says that he can guarantee a hit if Durante can procure one or more of the lions of the famous Baron Munchausen who is a renowned hunter of wild beasts. Durante decides to wine and dine the baron at his mansion and give a big party in his honor.There are a couple of very good precode musical numbers in this film including the title song featuring scantily clad chorus girls in various states of undressingdressing and singing and dancing telephone operators dressed up in weird metallic outfits. At the party Lupe Valez spars with Laurel and Hardy the Three Stooges put in an appearance back when they were still with Ted Healy and there is an early musical cartoon number involving chocolate soldiers with music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. Finally there are Charles Butterworth and Polly Moran as a wealthy oil magnate and his wife who have some hilarious moments.If you don't know who any of the people I just mentioned are you are probably not going to like this film. If you know who all or most of them are you are sure to enjoy it as one of the last pre code films made released just one month before strict enforcement of the code began.".

Lupe is also Jane to Durante's Schnarzan which audiences today might not get the whole gist of that joke since she was married to Johnny Weissmuller then.All in all it's great fun and at the very end you'll see why the film has the surreal quality it does.

In that the man eating lions he uses in his Schnarzan movies aren't at all believable as man eaters. In an effort to get back on top of the charts Durante is determined to get famed big game hunter Baron Munchausen's real ferocious man eating lions to be in his latest movie to make his role as Schnarzan the fearless come across as the real deal. The one problem Durante has is that his biggest rival in the movies fellow jungle man Liondora is also interested in getting the Baron's lions for is movies as well! It's now a battle of the two jungle men to get the Baron's lions and Durante jumps the gun by throwing a big Hollywood Party in the Barons honor. But the cagey Liondora has other ideas.

In that the man eating lions he uses in his Schnarzan movies aren't at all believable as man eaters. In an effort to get back on top of the charts Durante is determined to get famed big game hunter Baron Munchausen's real ferocious man eating lions to be in his latest movie to make his role as Schnarzan the fearless come across as the real deal. The one problem Durante has is that his biggest rival in the movies fellow jungle man Liondora is also interested in getting the Baron's lions for is movies as well! It's now a battle of the two jungle men to get the Baron's lions and Durante jumps the gun by throwing a big Hollywood Party in the Barons honor. But the cagey Liondora has other ideas. He's planning to crash the party disguised  with only a mustache as a Grand Royal Duke and steal the Baron's lions from right under no pun intended Jimmy Durante's nose.Wild and crazy fun at the party to end all parties which in fact in being one of the last Hollywood movies released before the Hayes Commission came into power in laying down the law of what to and not to in regards to sex and moral related scenes put into movies it got away with things that the American movie going public wouldn't be expose to in almost 30 years.

Sounds like enough material to make a fun and good movie with. The movie however isn't that much fun as you would expect. It's totally uninteresting to follow with a bunch of characters and different love stories you just don't care about. The movie gets still fun and is somewhat saved toward the ending of the movie when Mickey Mouse and Laurel  Hardy appear in the movie yeah a weird combination I known.The movie also features some horrible and typical signing and dancing routines that don't seem to end and at times go on for over 5 minutes. You know songs that always sound the same and are about cheerful things with lines that don't even sound musically. Thank goodness for the fast forward button.It's a real waste of some good potential and some good actors. Obviously Laurel  Hardy are underused also because at the beginning of the movie they are falsely presented as two of the main characters. Jimmy Durante is a good and fun actor but it just isn't enough to spice things up in the movie. Guess that the highlight of the movie really is the animated chocolate soldiers sequence presented by Mickey Mouse himself who also gives a pretty good Jimmy Durante imitation.The move could had been so much more fun to watch but it still definitely has some moments in it that makes this movie a still perfectly watchable one.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood Party 1934  out of 4 Jimmy Durante plays an actor best known for his wannabe Tarzan character known as Schnarzan. People quit going to see his jungle movies because the lions look fake so Durante decides to buy some new ones by throwing a Hollywood party to get the lion owners to his house. This is a very hit and miss film from MGM which was suppose to have been a film full of Alist cameos but instead had its budget cut to the point where we get mostly second hand actors although The Three Stooges and Laurel an Hardy show up. There are several musical numbers as well but they're all rather cheap and boring as are the dance numbers. Durante gives it his best but doesn't really have any good scenes until the very end when he must fight a lion. It's obvious that it's a double doing the fighting but this scene is rather shocking at how brutal and realistic it is. The Three Stooges have a fairly funny bit as three scientists debate on which one is closest to a neanderthal man. Laurel and Hardy also have a funny bit with actress Lupe Velez where the three break eggs on one another. Velez is actually the main reason to see this film as she walks around in an extremely provocative dress that shows off the best curves in her body. These scenes certainly got in just before the Hayes Office took over as she comes off very sexy in her role. There's an earlier scene that features some tease nudity sequences with women undressing and getting ready for the party. Mickey Mouse also shows up to spoof Durante and after saying all of this you'd think it was a good movie but it's not. The majority of the film is just endless skits with the majority of them not working. Even at 68minutes the film seems overly long so in the end only fans of any of the stars should check this out.".

Anyway he introduces himself to people getting his hand kissed including by a man Charles Butterworth. But those kinda jokes in those days were played as more wacky and ridiculous rather than gay. Charles' wife Polly Moran who plays I've had my moments on piano very well later on in film is there and pretty daughter June Clyde. June meets Eddie Quillin in elevator right after humorous moment of Polly trying to get Charles to remove his hat.

Many more guys pretty girls come in and dance sing display comical andor raunchy comments andor visuals throughout two more songs  Hollywood party and Feeling high. Many young people having a wild fun time. Even though some things have changed a whole lot since the 1930s there were always people who loved to just drink and have a good time. Even so many people were still more mannerly and with values than people today are. Further funny hygincs in this film include real lions being wheeled in in cages outside the house which leads to a crazy hilarious scene later in film the stooges showing up a curious cameo from Micky mouse including Micky hilariously impersonating Durante a rare off beat yet amusing cartoon Hot chocolate soldiers and then a funny slapstick sequence with Laurel and Hardy and beauty Lupe Velez involving eggs.

There's not a sequenced plot but rather a number of musical and humorous sketches each directed by a different always uncredited director and with a different combination of actors appearing. There's even a short Technicolor cartoon presented by Mickey Mouse!Both the musical numbers and the jokes presented would probably be entertaining in 1934 but in this day and age seem rather outdated. The clever portrayal of Hollywood paranoia and great performance by Jimmy Durante as Schnarzan save the day however and movie fans who have a thing for classic and preCode films might enjoy it.The main reason I watched this movie is because I'm a Laurel and Hardy fan and I thought the boys were the stars. No such thing however as they appear only in two notsofunny sketches including one with Mexican bombshell Lupe Velez and their screen time is about a mere ten minutes.The film is hard to find nowadays and you should just skip it unless you are a fan of similar pictures and in general films of this particular era.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this film reminded me of the story of Buster Keaton's descent as an actordirectorproducer. His stock company was dissolved in the late 20s and he eventually went in all softened up with drink and signed a contract with MGM who promised him the moon. He managed to make one great picture with them The Cameraman before succumbing to MGM's comedy machine. They surrounded him with funny producers directors and production workers who ignored Buster's natural comedic genius. He became depressed due to drink personal problems and MGM's incompetence with comedy to make one sad picture after another through the 30s and 40s and even appeared drunk on film. MGM almost ruined his career if it wasn't for a resurgence having to do with television and film in the 50s and 60s.Before launching into my critique and utter confusion as to what the rest of the commentators found funny in Hollywood Party I'd like to make an observation about comedies in general. They are very very hard to make. That is why there are so very few memorable comedies. Many of them fall flat and are soon forgotten. In my opinion there are less than 5 funny films that are truly funny per decade.With that in mind MGM's comedy touch is on full display with Hollywood Party. That is they have none. Their comedy by committee led by LB Mayer falls incredibly flat here. That no director actually took credit for this excessive putrid mess signals the genesis of the Alan Smithee idea.It seems this film attempted to make a star out of Jimmy Durante by solely featuring him and his antics. He is very annoying. His Schnarzan onejoke character falls flat and like in the picture the public and the audience quickly tires of his fake lions and what follows. Schnarzan MGM's selfpromoting spoof on its Tarzan series turns out to be nothing but a dream...a sure sign of the producer throwing up his hands and copping out.This Lollapalooza film with no comic material wastes talent like Laurel and Hardy and Ted Healy and The Three Stooges although the LH sequence with the illfated Lupe Velez was outstanding in comparison. Many have made light of an allstar cast but most of the cast was actually anonymous. A clip of Greta Garbo was thrown in to add star power...Marie Dressler and Joan Crawford were mentioned but didn't appear in the film. The rest of the stars included Jack Pearl Polly Moran Charles Butterworth Arthur Treacher and Robert Young. The color Walt Disney short The Choclate Soldiers is well done but incredibly weird and sick. It has to do with a bunch of soldiers made out of chocolate going to war. In keeping with Disney's bizarre obsession with death and mayhem many of them come back at the end of the short in a parade many with broken off limbs.I love comedies and especially films from the 30s. But this was an overblown stinker and it shows MGM's complete lack of a comedic touch.".

You give her a good role and she will just knock your socks off. She has mastered comedy and drama in a way that I haven't quite seen before. She does not play the role of Judith in this film. She IS Judith Hearne in all her depressing desperate lonely and passionate glory. I could've cried my eyes out at her devastation over the spilling of the whiskey....and that's all I'm giving away. She simply reaches through the screen grabs your heart and rips it out of your chest. There is NO WAY you can see this film and not feel SOMETHING. It is one of the best if not THE BEST performance by a female actor recorded.....and I've seen a lot of films.I have no idea how this was missed by the Oscars with practically zero moneymaking films like Monster Monster's Ball Vera Drake and Million Dollar Baby being recognized for the performances and not the commercial success nowadays. Maggie's performance CRUSHED the nominees that year and the winner Cher for Moonstruck... Find this buy it or something. My GOSH if you love a great performance you just have to see this film!!

While it's a bit depressing I am totally captured and inspired by Maggie Smiths astonishingly deep portrayal of Judith Hearne.  I'm sure I'll watch it another dozen times or more. What's SO compelling is the scope of the private look we're afforded into this beautifully drawn character. There are lots of glimpses of her alone interacting with just her thoughts or with cherished photographs or with herself in the mirror.This peek behind the private door is touching to the extreme. Its a pity this film is not better known because of all the films I know it most plainly shouts about what the ART of acting is all about. One sees FAR more deeply into the soul of a character by WATCHING the non verbal facial expressions. This face language cant possibly be done in a novel without ludicrous verbosity. Smith is an utter master at this subtle yet profound art of letting a thought show in the face. It's these deeply human feelings that all of us exude when we KNOW no one can see us that make this character so universal.I actually think this virtuoso performance is better even then Her Jean Brodie.All the other characters are very well delineated and extremely well played. Bob Hoskins also gives an extremely good performanceIf you LOVE great ACTING where subtle deep profound feelings show clearly in an expressive face..this is the very best I've seen to date.".

The screenplay had been fought over for years by actresses of every stripe with for a while Jane Fonda leading the pack of actresses trying to get Judith onto the screen. It's a good thing Maggie Smith won out.The ensemble cast of actors led by Bob Hoskins is fully up to Smith's standard and the emotional wallops this movie packs are big ones indeed.George Delarue's score is simply perfect underlying with the exact weight and gravity  and sweetness  of every situation.When is this thing coming out on DVD? It's simply ridiculous it hasn't yet appeared.Highest recommendation.".

In this film you will also see one of the very rare times where Dame Maggie really lets rip with a nerve shattering screech of a shout. It is quite unsettling when she does unleash this roar full of pure emotion completely in character and without the need for false theatrics. Ian Mcniece is too theatrical in his accent for me and Bob Hoskins is very good but gets acted off the screen by Dame Maggie. Really this turns into a Dame Maggie vehicle. Not because its written for her the book was published before the film came about and not because she hogs the screen it is simply because you become so enthralled with her character you see Judith Hearne as a real person and Dame Maggie as arguably the greatest actress of our time.".

Not to mention that Maggie Smith's performance is so powerful so moving.  The film was directed by Jack Clayton who directed a total of 7 films including The Innocents Something Wicked This Way Comes and the 1974 Great Gatsby. He was along with Robert Wise and Stanley Kubrick one of cinema's few perfectionists and craftsmen.  Like Clayton's other films The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne is a character study a motion picture about people and relationships.  Along with The Innocents and Persona the film is the most intimate portrayal of a women ever put on the screen.  Ultimately the film is about alcohol.

This was because like Miss Hearne I had no siblings and where she had only an old aunt who later died I had my parents  but they were also old and I knew that half my life I would live without them...Miss Hearne's sad and lonely life waiting for Mr Right who she as a young girl pictured as tall dark and handsome well  what girl hasn't..? in time lowering her expectations more and more and seeking comfort in religion as well as the bottle  is only too common also in real life.The acting was excellent all around as was the picture of the time and the melancholy mood created by bleak photo and classical music both beautiful and sad.I really recommend this movie but with one exception if you are yourself in the same situation as Miss Hearse  then maybe you should not watch it.

	schema:headline " Unlike Miss Brodie she never had a prime.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been trying to find this movie for years remembering the acclaim at the time of its release that Maggie Smith got playing a character far different than anybody she's ever played before. She's an Irish Catholic devoted to the memory of her abusive dead aunt Wendy Hiller who keeps moving from boarding house to boarding house with two pictures one of Aunt Wendy the other of Jesus and desperately searching for romance. She doesn't pick the proper boarding house for an aging spinster with nosy landlady Marie Kean and her extremely perverted son Ian McNeice an obese slob who is seducing the 16 year old servant girl and pretty much harassing every tenant with his slimy manner. Reminding me of Charles Laughton in Sign of the Cross he is an effeminate but straight donothing who can be simply referred to as a waste of human space. Poor Judith has to put up with his innuendos from rubbing a book of poetry on his crotch upon their first meeting to his attempt at blackmail upon learning of her friendship with his very American uncle Bob Hoskins.Judith has been spending time with Hoskins who has no romantic interest in her only trying to convince Judith to invest with him in an American hamburger stand in the middle of Dublin. His rejection of her passion sends Judith to the bottle and from there her descent into degradation and alcholism is more shocking than everything you've ever seen the fabulous Dame Maggie play. She gives her all to making this character beyond pitiable yet you can't help but like her. Obviously verbally abused by her wealthy Aunt Judith has absolutely no self esteem even if she finally gets to stand up to her aunt and remind her that nobody else is around to take care of her.As for Hoskins he's no angel either obviously raping the 16 year old out of pure resentment towards his nephew. The first quarter of the movie is almost unbearable to watch because of its perverseness but once Maggie's plight takes over you can't help but be hooked. She's got a huge heart as evidenced by taking a bottle to the hospital where a dying woman in pain needs some comfort and her embarrassment over being caught. She then sinks further into desolation and like Catherine Sloper in The Heiress is revisited by Hoskins who makes one last plea to get her back into his life. This is Dame Maggie's film all the way and while the depressing aspects of the film are sometimes very hard to take her performance never is.What is also very important to notice in this film is the character's devotion to her faith and her feeling that God has betrayed her for not bringing love into her life. For her love is more than just finding companionship it is her only bearable lightness of being. Her relationship with God and Jesus are so precious that when her lack of passion explodes into anger it is a frightening scene of Why have you forsaken me? How many people even those of strong religious faith have not questioned the existence of God? Her attack on the alter of the Catholic church is as prominent in Dame Maggie's career as when she screamed Assassin! at the teenage girl who ruined her career in Miss Jean Brodie.".

The book deserved some major award possibly even a Nobel price for its portrayal of a lonely spinster living in the world of fantasy and her delusions until a moment when truth comes like a thunder but doesn't crush her but like in real life  makes her only stop for a while gather emotional debris and continue on her usual way to oblivion. Like in real life she accept the sad reality  the fact so often forgotten by other writers who always long for happy end. There is no happy end if you are old poor lonely eccentric forgotten... The movie certainly captured the basic plot and dreary atmosphere of Dublin or was it Belfast can't remember of the fifties. The author tried to show what character in the book thought and how interpreted situation  quite a novel approach in art of writing. In book it was awfully important as they all saw themselves and everything differently  another human habit which causes conflicts and wars. We really do have different minds which meet only sometimes and when that happens there is a lot of denial temporary confusion but at the end running away back to the comfort of our own thinking. The truth as objective is the most painful thing in the world to swallow. Unfortunately the movie couldn't show this the way book could. And about the actors. Maggie Smith and Bob Hoskins are certainly good performers though typecast too often but they were not the best choice for the movie. Judith is a mousy slightly eccentricnot in tune with reality and hidden alcoholic which despite the best effort of afflicted would manifest itself in behavior. And Maggie is too rigid and dignified like all her upper social characters. The real Judith also tries to behave like a lady but something always gives her away. As to Bob  he is too sophisticated for the part unlike our hero  primitive sort of a chap with ugly motives. Much better are secondary characters the housekeeper and her creepy son  the couple worth of a separate story. So watch the movie but read the book first. It will show you how the real world works which will be sort of discovery after watching sentimental products of TV or reading books recommended by our guru celebrities where everything always has some higher purpose. But life as we see in the movie  often doesn't but is just a pointless journey towards nothing.".

Just like walking down a busy urban street anywhere with your ears and eyes open. The film made me wake up to the fact that so much American film perhaps all contemporary film is composed mainly of close ups with two or a few people. Not this film. There is a sequence with airplanes overhead that is absolutely dizzying without any fancy 3D or pyrotechnic effects. Mr. Tornatore brilliantly uses silent stares pairs of eyes and silly dream sequences with amazing effect. The male lead an adolescent boy is portrayed with great empathy by Giuseppe Sulfaro without schmaltz or sanitizing so typical in American films about puberty. The title role played well by a dazzling Monica Bellucci could have been written for a young Sophia Loren. My dream sequence I guess My favorite character was Renato's father hilariously played by Luciano Federico. A must see.".

The title role played well by a dazzling Monica Bellucci could have been written for a young Sophia Loren. My dream sequence I guess My favorite character was Renato's father hilariously played by Luciano Federico. A must see.";

The two leading actors Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie. Apart from her truly majestic elegance Monica Bellucci invests her character Malena with an aura of tragedy of some profound and unrelenting emotional trauma and pain which remains unspoken throughout the film and reaches its climax at the very end. Malena's stunningly beautiful eyes remain constantly downcast and her face  tense and pierced through by psychic pain she rarely raises her face let alone speaks words. Renato the teenage boy wins his audience by his incredibly pure and valiant love for Malena this affection he carries in his heart for several years. She becomes his muse his courage his sense of honor his whole rationale for confronting difficult and disruptive life of the wartorn Italy. I agree completely with another commentator who said that the ending of the movie is perhaps one of the most genuinely melancholic moments in modern cinematography. Simply brilliant. Superb music! This movie should be watched several times to be fully appreciated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Malena is a film that gives the impression that there are no innocent parties. The men are guilty of dirty lustful thoughts and some of more than just thoughts the women are guilty of gossip violence and probably more than a little envy and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker. But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things  gossip and something like insecurity.Roger Ebert wrote probably the most idiotic review I've ever seen him come out with about this movie. He missed the point of this movie even more than he missed the point of Memento and his review of that movie was like a blind man describing a shooting star. He describes Malena as a schoolteacher of at least average intelligence who must be aware of her effect on the collective local male libido but seems blissfully oblivious.Roger seriously are you joking? BLISSFULLY?? Did you sleep through this movie?She almost never speaks at all and never displays even the slightest hint of a smile. Given the extent of her depression and stifling sadness it is astounding to me that anyone in their right mind could attach the word blissfully to any element of her character.I know what that's like though because sometimes I completely miss something about a movie and I think that something else is the stupidest thing in the world because of it at least until someone explains what I missed and then it all makes sense. Watch Malena for example walking through the central square in town at any point in the movie. If you think she keeps her eyes on the ground directly in front of her because she is in a state of pure ignorant bliss then trust me. You are missing something.I don't know if Malena was actually unaware of the effect that she had on the townspeople but I find it nearly impossible to believe that she did. That thought actually never even occurred to me until I read Roger Ebert's gem of a review. Her behavior struck me much more like someone who had been dealing with such behavior from the men around for her whole life. I doubt very much that she doesn't understand the concepts of human physical attraction.Moving on. Set against the backdrop of World War II reminded me of Life is Beautiful especially given the uncertain mix of comedy and tragedy. It wasn't as powerful on both sides here as in Life is Beautiful but it was truly heartbreaking to see Malena suffering and trying to ignore the increasing tension that was being generated around her.It's hard to say that she was a victim of her own beauty but it was really what drove all of the conflict in the story. The women at first seemed to be upset with their husbands because of their stares and things got worse and worse because of the endless gossip which seemed to monopolize the talk of the entire town. If anyone was talking about anything it had something to do with the latest sexual escapades of Malena.Women would not sell her good food at the town market so she had to get it from men who expected things in return. There was a scene where an officer was at her home but I don't think there was any indication that they had sex. It was clear that he was more interested than she was and later it was her that wound up in court for having an amorous relationship with a married man in uniform. The courtroom performance of Malena's lawyer by the way is one of the highlights of the movie.I'm not really sure how to feel about the women involved in the climax of their collective hatred of Malena because surely Malena did not sleep with the husband of every woman involved and of those whose husbands committed no crime other than looking at a beautiful woman what did they then think of their wives who would do such a thing out of pure jealousy and envy? I'm a man myself so I can't speak from a woman's point of view but if your husband cheats on you take it out on him. Don't go and beat up the subject of his affections especially if it is nothing more than a beautiful woman that he looked at. Imagine all of the attractive women beaten up without knowing why.Weaving his way throughout all of this chaos is Renato a 12yearold boy who has conceptualized Malena as the ideal woman in all ways. He sees himself as her protector desperate to save her from the tension that he sees growing around her the unfair antagonism that is being leveled at her for really no fault of her own. His identification of Malena as the subject of his developing sexuality reminded me of another great film The Hairdresser's Husband. If you liked this see that one too. Oh and if you're Roger Ebert maybe watch this one again.And stay awake this time.".

In Giuseppe Tornatore's Malena the young woman at the center of the story suffers that kind of sexual predatory practice from all the men in the little town in Sicily where she lives. It appears Italian men then as well as now can express anything at all especially for their big friends' benefit their opinions of how they feel about a woman.

But contrary to what they might take Mr. Tornatore its director like most film makers in Europe are influenced by the politics and the history of their country. In here it appears that Malena stands for the way Italy was manipulated by Mussolini in transforming the country into a fascist paradise. Also Malena like Italy is turned into a prostitute in the eyes of many Italians who watched their beloved country invaded by the Germans who were supposed to be their allies.Malena is a film that is blessed by the presence of that amazingly beautiful actress Monica Belucci. Ms. Belucci is perfect for the title role and runs away with the film. In one of the most hear wrenching scenes in this movie we watch in horror as the other women in town have their revenge in punishing Malena for what they perceive are her sins and her collaboration with the enemy.Young Giuseppe Sulfaro is seen as the appealing Renato Amoroso the young man awakening to his own sexuality. He lives just to spy on the woman that has captured his imagination and even in his solitary gratification she plays a large role in his vivid imagination.Malena owes a lot to Giuseppe Tornatore for what he has been able to accomplish.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I got to watch this utterly beautiful film I knew nothing of the awesomeness of Giusseppe Tornatore Cinema Paradiso or the ethereal beauty of Monica Bellucci.Well all the needed knowledge flooded my mind within the two hours I spent watching Malena. It's a comingofage film set in the World War 2 years in a small town of Sicily. The main lead is a young boy named Renato and through his perfectly understandable obsession of a married woman named Malena there couldn't be a more perfect cast than Monica Bellucci in this rolewe get to see him maturing over a few years time. Most of the team focuses on Malena of course but it's all through Renato's eyes he's stalking her all the time and his affection for her. It's no wonder that all males in the town even teenagers mostly view her as a hot piece of meat but this boy's pure love is what eventually makes the difference in his and her life.The ending credits will leave you with the life goes on aftermath and possibly the strongest feeling of melancholy you ever achieved from a movie.Great cinematography excellent performances from Monica Belluccithough she barely speaks throughout the film and the boy playing Renato amazing score by the grand Maestro Ennio Morricone nominated for an Oscar this film has become my absolute favourite and Monica Bellucci my most recent and strongest obsession! A perfect 10 though it might seem over the top to a few of you.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I got to watch this utterly beautiful film I knew nothing of the awesomeness of Giusseppe Tornatore Cinema Paradiso or the ethereal beauty of Monica Bellucci.Well all the needed knowledge flooded my mind within the two hours I spent watching Malena. It's a comingofage film set in the World War 2 years in a small town of Sicily. The main lead is a young boy named Renato and through his perfectly understandable obsession of a married woman named Malena there couldn't be a more perfect cast than Monica Bellucci in this rolewe get to see him maturing over a few years time. Most of the team focuses on Malena of course but it's all through Renato's eyes he's stalking her all the time and his affection for her. It's no wonder that all males in the town even teenagers mostly view her as a hot piece of meat but this boy's pure love is what eventually makes the difference in his and her life.The ending credits will leave you with the life goes on aftermath and possibly the strongest feeling of melancholy you ever achieved from a movie.Great cinematography excellent performances from Monica Belluccithough she barely speaks throughout the film and the boy playing Renato amazing score by the grand Maestro Ennio Morricone nominated for an Oscar this film has become my absolute favourite and Monica Bellucci my most recent and strongest obsession! A perfect 10 though it might seem over the top to a few of you.";

After reading so many critical reviews I just wanted to note that Tornatore describes this film not as a coming of age picture that in essence is what Paradiso is but rather an allegory of Italy's foray into war and fascism as seen through the eyes of an innocent in this case Tornatore himself.  Malena represents all that Italy was and is to him both beautiful easily misled and misunderstood and the climatic scene in which she is beaten down is in essence what happened to the country post Mussolini and WWII.  Watch it again with this concept in mind and your view of the film will dramatically alter.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this movie was released the buzz was huge... Mostly because it starred the walkingtalking male fantasy Monica Bellucci. It did the rounds around various Film Festivals and even the most skeptical critics were won over. They were won over by many things... The scenery is stunning making you feel like you're really in Sicily. The acting is subtle but superb. And it's this that is most shocking. Monica Bellucci was when this film was released a modelturningactress. Noone expected her to actually be good and we were right she wasn't good... she is amazing in this film!! Bellucci has very little dialogue she has to use body language and facial expressions... most people would agree this is much more difficult. Since this film she has gone on to be Italy's most successful acting export for years. With roles in Matrix 2  3 Tears Of The Sun and the truly groundbreaking Irreversible she has proved herself time and time again! What her character goes through is heartbreaking and through Bellucci's acting and the wonderful performance given by protagonist narrator Renato Giuseppe Sulfaro we experience everything she does.At times the movie is hilarious particularly when detailing the lengths the men of the village will go to just to catch glimpse of Malena. Mostly though the film shows how jealousy and subsequent hatred can destroy anything and anyone. This movie will stay with you for a very long time!!8.510".

Monica Bellucci is indeed a feast for any male's eyes. She is almost beyond description lookswise. What happens to her unfairly near the end is not pleasant. Otherwise it's a pretty humorous film in segments especially with dialog between the young kid and his dad. Some of the lines there and at other places made me laugh right out loud. Some of the language is not really profane but it's certainly crude. The kid is not that likable nor are his friends. There is a such a mixture of genres in here that is makes the movie fresh almost every time I see it which has been three times so far.".

Malna however is much more than just a celebration of Bellucci's sinuous body which on the other hand admittedly is most effectively used when photographed by a capable director. But Malna has other things to offer as well. For one it is an exquisite coming of age portrait masterfully narrated and shot marvelously scored by Ennio Morricone in many ways a companion piece to Tornatore's better known and critically acclaimed Cinema Paradiso. It's also nostalgic endearing funny touching daring at times erotic is a given yet beautiful and innocent but then also tragic sad and even unexpectedly shocking  the film is a symphony of all those emotions brought together through two very strong characters the boy and the desired woman. Not to be neglected is the often overlooked allegorical aspect very prevalent in Malna The action takes place with WW II as backdrop where motherland Italy prostitutes herself for Hitler and becomes a mere satellite of Nazi Germany with the once virginal beauty being brutally ravished. How fast things can change...Finally a warning The film's international release version was cut by no less than 17 minutes reducing many of the scenes laden with enticing sensuality  which represent the core of the movie  to an absolute minimum.

	schema:reviewBody "Like his memorable Cinema Paradiso Giuseppe Tornatore's Malna is a coming of age story set against a rich nostalgic backdrop of midtwentieth century Italian history and small city culture. The setting in this instance is Southern Italy during World War II. On the day that Mussolini declares war on Great Britain and France the film's young protagonist Renato is given a bicycle that represents the first stage of his passage to manhood. Although still too young to wear the long pants symbolic of sexual maturation he joins a group of somewhat older youths whose principal occupation  seemingly like that of every male in town  is gawking at Malna the voluptuous daughter of their dotty deaf Latin teacher.Played by the miraculously beautiful Italian model Monica Bellucci Malna a newly wed whose husband has been shipped off to war and later reported dead is a focal point of male desire female envy and general gossip. Innocently charged in a sex scandal she succumbs to the initial nearrape advances of her operatically bombastic lawyer and begins an affair with him. The lawyer one of the Tornatore's familiar comicgrotesques proves to be a mama's boy who abandons Malna at the mother's insistence. Increasingly alone desperate and hungry Malna heeds the siren call of a seedy pimp and begins a rapid descent into communal disgrace. Ultimately she sets up shop with another notorious local prostitute servicing the occupying German officers. When liberation day comes Malna is dragged into the streets by a group of outraged women and  in a scene worthy of Kosinski's Painted Bird  is horribly beaten stripped shorn and hooted from the town.Throughout Malna's exploits are viewed through the sometimes literally voyeuristic eyes of Renato whose feelings for Malna Tornatore suggests stem not only from pubescent sexual urges but from a deeper 'purer' romantic longing the force of which drives Renato to become Malna's only champion in the town reeking minor vengeance on her enemies and detractors and lighting candles for her protection in the church. In developing Renato's complex attraction to Malna Tornatore constructs fantasy sequences that often blend ambiguously with reality in the manner of Fellini's 8  and sometimes invoke the imaginative power of the cinema. These fantasy sequences culminate in a technically adventurous kaleidoscopic montage that bring to a crescendo the whirring sexsaturated images of Renato's subconscious.After Malna's brutal banishment two things happen Renato is taken to a whorehouse by his father for sexual initiation and Malena's husband shows up minus an arm but very much alive. When no one will tell him what has become of his wife except to suggest mockingly that he look in every brothel in Sicily Renato mails the husband an anonymous message exonerating Malna and informing him of her whereabouts in Messina. A year passes. Renato is next seen walking the square with his first girl friend. Suddenly all eyes turn to witness the reemergence of Malna on the arm of her husband. Confronted with the courageousness of her return and reassured by her safely married state and the few wrinkles now tempering her still beautiful face the townswomen accept Malna back into the community. Her redemption is capped by a brief encounter with Renato who helps pick up some fruit she has dropped from a shopping bag. As Malna walks away Renato rides off on his bicycle the voiceover of his adult self relaying that many women have since asked him to remember them but that only Malna the one who never asked remains unforgettable.If all this sounds sentimental to the point of mawkishness I suppose it is. Nevertheless the film is a visual treat and the lush soundtrack by Morricone doesn't hurt in the slightest either. Malna doesn't reach the heights of brilliance that the first half of Cinema Paradiso does nor is Renato as appealing or as well developed a character as Salvatore. On the other hand Malna doesn't overstay its welcome. Its tightly constructed screenplay is sparse in dialog yet filled with warm humor. Overall the film merits a solid 8.".

These fantasy sequences culminate in a technically adventurous kaleidoscopic montage that bring to a crescendo the whirring sexsaturated images of Renato's subconscious.After Malna's brutal banishment two things happen Renato is taken to a whorehouse by his father for sexual initiation and Malena's husband shows up minus an arm but very much alive. When no one will tell him what has become of his wife except to suggest mockingly that he look in every brothel in Sicily Renato mails the husband an anonymous message exonerating Malna and informing him of her whereabouts in Messina. A year passes. Renato is next seen walking the square with his first girl friend. Suddenly all eyes turn to witness the reemergence of Malna on the arm of her husband. Confronted with the courageousness of her return and reassured by her safely married state and the few wrinkles now tempering her still beautiful face the townswomen accept Malna back into the community. Her redemption is capped by a brief encounter with Renato who helps pick up some fruit she has dropped from a shopping bag. As Malna walks away Renato rides off on his bicycle the voiceover of his adult self relaying that many women have since asked him to remember them but that only Malna the one who never asked remains unforgettable.If all this sounds sentimental to the point of mawkishness I suppose it is. Nevertheless the film is a visual treat and the lush soundtrack by Morricone doesn't hurt in the slightest either. Malna doesn't reach the heights of brilliance that the first half of Cinema Paradiso does nor is Renato as appealing or as well developed a character as Salvatore. On the other hand Malna doesn't overstay its welcome. Its tightly constructed screenplay is sparse in dialog yet filled with warm humor. Overall the film merits a solid 8.";

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen and loved Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso I had high hopes Malena but instead I was disappointed by this sentimental manipulative piece of cinematic caricature.A coming of age film is difficult to pull off without sinking into cliche. Unfortunately this film goes face down in every pitfall.  The freshfaced boy making wideeyed sexual discoveries.  The cruelly indifferent parents. The misunderstood heroine.  The denouement of selfless sacrifice.  The only way these ingredients can be put into a film that doesn't make you want to throw up at its saccharine sincerity is if it has other ingredients which temper it twist it change it into something that makes you think Ah this is new.  I've never thought about it this way before.Tornatore puts the stock ingredients in and exaggerates them almost beyond recognition but he adds nothing else.  It's true the performances are fine and the cinematography and music are beautiful I too love Morricone but with a story that never rises above the level of the cliche none of that really matters.  What comes across is a goopy string of scenes that alternately tug at your heartstrings and the corners of your mouth and I don't mean that in a complimentary way.The ironic thing is that I think Malena could have been a very good movie if it hadn't gotten the vaselinelensed treatment.  It would have been far more wrenching if the story had been told as it actually might have happened harsh and unadorned.  Women have been driven into prostitution and then humiliated for it throughout the centuries and coupling this with a boy's struggle to understand his budding sexuality would have been an affecting twist.  But told in this mawkish eagertoplease style it degenerates to the level of the cheap.".

	schema:reviewBody "A small italian town in the early 40's. Renato  a sensitive teenager who is eager to be accepted amongst the adults  falls in love with Malena  the local beauty. Malena seems to be the center of all townsfolk's attention. She is an every man's dream but also the object of hate of all the women who envy her for her beauty.  Renato keeps following her and he begins to realize how much pain she takes because of her appearance.That seems like a nice basis for a story about the human relationship life in an italian town during the war and about the problematic maturing of a teenager. But there is the main problem of the film  it simply doesnt get any farther. The characters are too flat  they do not develop throughout the film except the fact that Renato starts to bear the Malena's suffering in the beginning of the movie. The 'evil' crowd just gets meaner the 'suffering' Malena just takes more portions of pain and the 'sensitive' Renato just gets more moved by Malena's fate.It surely is an interesting point to start with but the authors will beat it into your head for two hours instead. As the film advanced I was just wondering what more cruelties did the writers prepare for the poor girl and how far will they let her fall untill she finally reaches the bottom  whatever it will mean to her. The monotony of the characters is also the reason why I couldn't hang on empathising with them although they were described sou beautifully in the beginning. The cast is a problematic topic for this film. Monica Belucci did a fine job presenting Malena  she managed to give a lot of depth to a character which is rather flat in the script. Through the way she moved and talked you could really sense her essence. She is pulling the movie very much from the misery. Unfortunately the other actors were not so successful with this almost impossible task. You could describe Giussepe Sulfaro's expression throughout the film as 'caring face number 7' and the males surrounding Malena are crippled into slobbering hornies just like the women into jealous and cruel vixen.This movie will quickly describe the scene and then it will try to squeeze out the last drop of compassion from you. If you like this kind of entertainment then it is a good choice for you. You might also like to see some nice acting performance by Monica Belucci. Otherwise don't bother yourself with this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an Italian coming of age film about a young man who was entering his teen years when WWII began. In some ways it reminds me of a combination of AMARCORD and THE SUMMER OF '42as at least in the beginning the film focused on ordinary small town folk during the war like in AMARCORD and a bunch of very horny boys like SUMMER OF '42. The problem is that while the film began well it seems to have lost its focus and charm. While WWII isn't exactly a charming period the likability of ANYONE in the film was a problem. The townspeople turned out to be quite vile and the leading character seemed to have some serious sexual hangups such as voyeurism and fetishismplus he spent so much time masturbating. Now they didn't show masturbation explicitly but the little goomer was clearly playing with himself again and again with great gusto! In hindsight I would have dropped all the sexual hangups the kid had because it tended to deflect the focus in the film. The film was at its best when it showed human nature as the townspeople gossiped about and mistreated a decent lady just because she was so beautiful. Then when she was apparently widowed and broke with no one to help her she slept with the Nazi occupiers to survive. This and the peoples' reaction to this after the war was really fascinating but unfortunately so much time was spent on this horny kid that the significance of the rest of the film was lost.Oh and if you want good parenting advice just look to the boy's father. To cure his chronic masturbation and wearing the lady's stolen underwear on his head while he slept his father took him to a prostitute. Now THAT'S something I don't remember reading in Dr. Spock!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Malena is the most beautiful and touching film I have ever seen. I have watched it countless times yet it continues to enchant me every time and I never grow tired of it's story.People never cease to amaze me with their cruelty and pettinessmost which stems from that green eyed lady JEALOUSY. We as human beings always seem to resent those who have attributes we have notwhether it's money power beauty etc. Jealousy is why Malena suffers so much through out this film. That is the simple truth. I won't deny that the men in the movie don't help the situation much as they get carried away with their story telling and boastingas they all WISH they could sleep with her. The fact is the MEN are jealous too. Not jealous of Malena but of each other jealous of her husbandas all of them are competing with each other to be Malena's potential man.However the women in this movie and in real life in many ways are the main crux of the problem. It seems to me that in every facet of life whether it is in the workplace or the family etc. women are always dead set on destroying each other out of jealousy. There seems to be only one or two women in this movie who show any kindness towards Malena excepting of course for at then end when they are all afraid of going to hell for what they did to her...It's ironic how as soon as her husband returns and Malena is no longer a sex object how the women warm up to her and begin to treat her with dignity and respect. While she was alone she needed their friendship the most but she was all alone suffering in so many ways. This happens so often in real life and it actually hit home for me as I have known women in the past who have been abused because of being attractive.I am a woman and I am not gay at all but when I see a beautiful woman I don't automatically HATE her just because she's beautiful! That behavior and emotion is so primitive and stupidand it's a shame that we women don't have better control over our jealous minds. We could accomplish so much in this world if we were able to get our heads out of our you know what's and stop being so petty and jealous all the time of women who happen to be prettier than us!!! I admire Malena or any other beautiful woman as a lovely creation by God to be admired and likednot to be hated and victimized. Women need each other we need each others friendship. But ironically our competitiveness with each other over men keeps us separated and lonely. This is the case with Malena. She does absolutely NOTHING wrong yet she is humiliated and abused by the entire societyand yes all because of her beauty. She is guilty of being beautiful GORGEOUS actually. None of the women in this movie come even CLOSE to her. Even our American Angelina Jolie looks like a plain Jane compared to her...No offense but it is true as pretty as Angelina isshe's TOTALLY overrated!! Monica Bellucci may truly be the most beautiful woman in the world since Venus.Another point this movie demonstrates is how age has nothing to do with the capacity to experience true love. Renato is only 12 or 13 yet he loves and cares about Malena more than any of the older men in the village. People have prejudices about women dating younger men but when love is concerned age should not matter. I am glad she found her husband in the end but given a few more years to grow up I think Renato would have been the ideal match for Malenadespite their age difference! As long as he was legal of course!!!In any case this is truly the best movie I have ever seen and it has a wide range of emotions that will cater to most people's diverse tastes. The soundtrack is wonderful and emotional. The only people who may NOT like this movie would be jealous and insecure women of any age group who don't like being reminded of how mediocre they are compared to Monica Bellucci. All women want to be beautiful but if they were this pretty they would see how hard it can be. And for all you jealous petty women out there who have nothing better to do than to gossip and make trouble I say you should watch this movie because it may give you an idea of how hard it can be when the grass seems greener on the other side and show you how being a beautiful women can be a very difficult and lonely thing sometimes...WONDERFUL movie all in all. Makes a very good point which applies to every society.".

Shortly thereafter Wade is captured by the law in Bisbee and Evans finds himself one of the escorts who will take Wade to the 310 to Yuma train in Contention for the reward of 200. Evans's effort to take Wade to the station is in part an effort to save his land but also part of an inner battle to determine whether he can be more than just a naive rancher in the eyes of his impetuous and gunslinging son William Evans. The transport to Contention is hazardous and filled with ambushes by Indians pursuits by Wade's vengeful gang and Wade's own conniving and surreptitious demeanor that makes the ride all the more intense.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last night at a preview in the lead up to the Toronto International Film Festival. Having never been a big western fan with a few exceptions  Shane High Noon The Wild Bunch and having been rather indifferent to Walking The Line James Mangold's last directorial effort my expectations were modest despite the hype that the film has received. But I was duly impressed. The action and tension remain constant throughout but more importantly the plot is compelling and the acting is terrific. No doubt many will be impressed by Ben Foster's affected performance as Russell Crowe's loyal but psychopathic sidekick think Johnny Depp in the Pirate movies but to my taste it was much too over the top in a cast that offered a number of subtle and well thought out performances.Russell Crowe is brilliant as the arrogant amoral outlaw Ben Wade and Christian Bales infuses his role as a beleaguered rancher and Civil War veteran with just the right mix of pathos and dignity. Iy was wonderful to see Peter Fonda be given a role in which he was allowed to demonstrate his genuine talent much too long hidden away. In my view though it is Logan Lerman who most deserves the accolades that will certainly come his way. He plays Bales' teenage son who comes of age in the course of the film. Initially disillusioned with a father whom he sees as drudge and a failure he eventually recognizes his father as the hero he is or at least becomes.Cinematically this film ranks up there with the best westerns of all time. It is consistently beautiful to watch and captures the expanse and majesty of the American west as well as any movie I've ever seen.In many respects this is a traditional western it is a remake after all. They really don't make movies like this much anymore and it will be interesting to see whether it finds an audience in this era of dumbed down teen comedies and quirky slices of dysfunctional modern life. I wish it well.".

The supporting cast are all wonderful and in particular Ben Foster Fonda and Logan Lerman as Bale's oldest son.The action is virtually nonstop which makes for a compelling exciting story. But what really drew me in were the stellar performances particularly that of Crowe. He is the bad guy you actually might end up rooting for. He goes from charming to deadly and back again all in the blink of an eye. He carries the film on his very able shoulders but Bale gives him a good run for his money in the acting department.This is one movie that any lover of westerns or anyone simply longing for a good movie with good acting will not want to miss.

	schema:headline " Shades of gray. The measure of a man and what price he is willing to pay for justice";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of westerns from a young age I really wanted to like this movie and I did. I just didn't love it because of a few too many plot holes and inconsistencies. If you are willing to suspend belief and enjoy the ride it is a very satisfying movie filled with action suspense and terrific acting showcasing the intricacies of complicated men. As most westerns ultimately are this was a movie about the measure of a man. When faced with extraordinary circumstances how far will a man go to do the right thing and what price separates good and evil. It is a story of youth with a riveting performance by a young Logan Lerman as a rancher's son who doubts his father's worth and struggles to come to terms with his expectations of what makes a man great and who he will idolize. Being a fan of the TV series Jack and Bobby it was great seeing Logan again and enjoying his work. He gives a sensitive nuanced performance and holds his own against some powerhouse acting from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.Russell is the perfect actor to play Ben Wade bringing a depth and humanity to a character who is established early on as a dangerous ruthless outlaw. There are indications from the start that Ben isn't your standard villain and Russell does a great job at showing the shadings in this character while maintaining the threatening nature of Ben Wade. There is a hint of gentleness and sensitivity and even though you suspect childhood damage might have produced a man capable of such evil you never doubt the viciousness this character is capable of.Christian Bale turns in another intricate portrayal as the rancher Dan Evans. Slowly the layers and truths of Dan are revealed until he is laid bare with all his regrets and failings threatening to define him. As a man trying to provide for his family and gain the respect of his older son he gives a captivating performance as an average man struggling to do what is right while faced with overwhelming obstacles. The interaction between these two fine actors and how their characters end up on the continuum between good and evil is the focus of the movie. 310 to Yuma is an interesting merging between the oldfashioned westerns of long ago and the new psychological metaphors of modern moviemaking. There are lots of dead bodies littering up the landscape but the blood and guts movie style of Peckinpah is thankfully missing and we are left with a character study wrapped up in an action chase flick.Peter Fonda has a wonderful role as a grizzled old bounty hunter and even though I knew he was in the movie it took me forever to recognize him. I kept thinking the character reminded me of Richard Widmark but perhaps there was a touch of Henry in there too. Alan Tudyk has a nice turn as a quirky doctor and Ben Foster is mesmerizing as the big bad sidekick of Ben Wade. Many will think Ben goes overboard on the characterization but it was difficult to not watch him as the crazy vicious killer Charlie Prince. I think he held back just enough to make the character believable in an intensely crazed vicious oldwest world.Ultimately the bad guys were more believable to me than the good guys. There were several instances where I wanted to yell at the screen and tell the good guys they were doomed because of their inept actions but perhaps they just haven't seen as many westerns as I have and didn't realize these bad guys were truly vicious animals and no mercy would be offered. Towards the end is when the stretches of believability most disturbed me and the movie lost some of its sheen. I just didn't buy all the contrivances they threw at me and for me that made the ending less than satisfying. My sister on the other hand loved the ending and was actually crying but don't let the crying scare you off. She tends to get overly emotional when she buys into the story and she had no problem suspending belief and taking the ride they offered.If you love westerns as I do then you owe it to yourself to support this western at the theater in hopes the box office receipts will encourage more westerns to be produced. If you enjoy great acting and character development and the wider framework of what makes a man a hero and what forces drive a man to despair then this movie provides ample fuel for further discussion. 310 to Yuma could have been a great movie if they would have cleaned up some of the plot holes and reined in the ending but all in all it was a nice time at the movies and it certainly offered up some lively discussion afterward. The entire cast was stunningly good the movie was beautifully photographed and the direction kept it moving at a good pace with no lulls or boring moments. It offers a glance back at the oldtime westerns with a few nice improvements. Even if you don't normally appreciate westerns the acting and action should be enough to make the time spent enjoyable. And if you never appreciated westerns before then maybe it will be enough to make you want to check out some of the greats like High Noon and The Searchers. Westerns have always been a fertile ground for examining the complexities of man what makes a man great and the shades of gray that resides in all of us.".

I kept thinking the character reminded me of Richard Widmark but perhaps there was a touch of Henry in there too. Alan Tudyk has a nice turn as a quirky doctor and Ben Foster is mesmerizing as the big bad sidekick of Ben Wade. Many will think Ben goes overboard on the characterization but it was difficult to not watch him as the crazy vicious killer Charlie Prince. I think he held back just enough to make the character believable in an intensely crazed vicious oldwest world.Ultimately the bad guys were more believable to me than the good guys. There were several instances where I wanted to yell at the screen and tell the good guys they were doomed because of their inept actions but perhaps they just haven't seen as many westerns as I have and didn't realize these bad guys were truly vicious animals and no mercy would be offered. Towards the end is when the stretches of believability most disturbed me and the movie lost some of its sheen. I just didn't buy all the contrivances they threw at me and for me that made the ending less than satisfying. My sister on the other hand loved the ending and was actually crying but don't let the crying scare you off. She tends to get overly emotional when she buys into the story and she had no problem suspending belief and taking the ride they offered.If you love westerns as I do then you owe it to yourself to support this western at the theater in hopes the box office receipts will encourage more westerns to be produced. If you enjoy great acting and character development and the wider framework of what makes a man a hero and what forces drive a man to despair then this movie provides ample fuel for further discussion. 310 to Yuma could have been a great movie if they would have cleaned up some of the plot holes and reined in the ending but all in all it was a nice time at the movies and it certainly offered up some lively discussion afterward. The entire cast was stunningly good the movie was beautifully photographed and the direction kept it moving at a good pace with no lulls or boring moments. It offers a glance back at the oldtime westerns with a few nice improvements. Even if you don't normally appreciate westerns the acting and action should be enough to make the time spent enjoyable. And if you never appreciated westerns before then maybe it will be enough to make you want to check out some of the greats like High Noon and The Searchers. Westerns have always been a fertile ground for examining the complexities of man what makes a man great and the shades of gray that resides in all of us.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a scene near the end where Christian Bale is clearing the air so to speak between himself and Russel Crowe's character that suddenly made clear to me what the entire film was about. It also dawned on me that Bale is a bit like this generation's Gregory Peck only better. He seems able to explore other ways of being on screen without losing sight of reality. That's quite a trick and key in this film as it's really all about his character Dan Evans a struggling exsoldier with a family and a marginal farm to take care of.Courage is the central preoccupation of this film so it's more than welcome to see it in the film's production as well. There's a sensibility for weapons dirt wagons injuries even clothing of the period on display here that's more than just admirable. It makes you wonder why old westerns didn't explore these elements more thoroughly though I suppose it had to do with expense. But in having spared that expense these older flicks also failed to pull off the kind of true to life drama that this movie manages to delve into.I also enjoyed the interaction between Crowe Bale and his teenage son William. Though the focus is constantly moving including generous episodes with a wonderfully nuanced badman played by Ben Foster and some quality time with Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol most of the story is in what happens between the exsoldier his son and Crowe's gang leader Ben Wade. Talk about art imitating life Crowe is pretty much flawless as the intelligent but amoral Wade.Don't expect a conventional ending. Think about it after you've exited the theater. Aren't we all a mix of good and bad?".

Then you can praise the movie to high heaven feel you have done your penance and content yourself with the ingenuity of your expansive insights. This is the case with 310 to Yuma.So what's wrong with this movie? Well let's just look at the last 20 or so minutes of the film 1. Apparently the bartenderhotel clerk in Contention AZ whom we've not been introduced to until this point in the movie is in cahoots with the bad guys because he make a point of surreptitiously and eagerly directing the bad guys to the location of the incarcerated Mr. Crowe. Why does he do this? Who knows. The filmmaker never lets us in on the secret.2. Apparently the Neanderthal menfolk of Contention AZ are a simpleminded lot who at the thought of earning 200.00 by murdering the the folks holding murderous Russell Crowe in custody just can't wait to start throwing lead. Mabel Whar's mah raffle? Ahm gonna keel me sum lawmen an geet myselves 200.00 dollah cash on that thar barrelhead! 3. Apparently no one in Contention has a problem with watching their unarmed police force viciously gunned down in broad daylight. After this atrocity folks continue to wander the streets go in and out of stores and continue their daily lives as though nothing has happened. Except for of course the menfolk who are hiding in wait for a chance to earn that 200.00.4. Apparently no one bothers to theorize that when you are firing dozens of rounds of ammunition at two men who are as close together as they can be without being Siamese twins you just might hit the guy you're trying to rescue.5. Apparently when Russell Crowe's psychotic gunslinging heroworshiping gang member finally realizes the implications of the above he figures he better start shootin' them menfolk he'd promised that thar munny to. Of course none of the surviving menfolk think to start shooting at him.6. Apparentlywell you get the idea. In other words this excuse for moviemaking is quite frankly stupid! In order to take this seriously you must convince yourself that the type of behavior exhibited by many of the characters in this film is the way people really act. Whether it be the above examples or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach at close range having the bullet removed and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him much of this film is just plain ludicrous! By the way I'm no gun expert but I do know this If you are shot in the stomach at close range you ain't gonna be going' nowhere and you certainly ain't gonna be trottin' around on a horse! The bigger problem with this movie is its message which is this People who do the right thing because it's the right thing to do are fools. Good people don't thrive. As Christian Bale says I've been asking God to help me for three years and he hasn't done it yet. For those who would attempt to live a righteous honorable life there is nothing but despair and hopelessness. In fact at the end of the movie the true hero of the piece is the psychopathic vicious murdering Russell Crowe character. And by the way this film does NOT retain the ending of the original so if you were hoping it would forget about that.If you see this film you might recognize material from other Westerns. You have an iron clad stagecoach reminiscent of John Wayne's War Wagon quotes from the Bible reminiscent of Randolph Scott in Ride the High Country the psychological bantering between the Crowe and Christian Bale characters reminiscent of not only Ride the High Country but also of The Tall T an Elmore Leonard story with Randolph Scott and Richard Boone and Christian Bales's cursing teenage son reminiscent of Ron Howard in John Wayne's The Shootist. Your better bets All of the other movies I named above plus the original with Glen Ford and Van Heflin.".

I won't waste time repeating a lot of the films other irregularities but that run through town with the citizens and gang now trying to kill them I mean let's get real.

And were the town people who were after the money who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town just terminally stupid as well?As for the last scene  total in its absolute ridiculousness. Crow was a psychopath. Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.I could go on but I'll leave it with this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. This movie wasn't even worth the time wasted making or watching it even if you got to watch it for free. I like the main actors I like Westerns but the potential for quality that these things offered was absolutely absent here.".

And were the town people who were after the money who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town just terminally stupid as well?As for the last scene  total in its absolute ridiculousness. Crow was a psychopath. Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.I could go on but I'll leave it with this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. This movie wasn't even worth the time wasted making or watching it even if you got to watch it for free. I like the main actors I like Westerns but the potential for quality that these things offered was absolutely absent here.";

	schema:headline " Thoroughly Enjoyable Remake of a Classic Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Long ago I saw the original 310 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford but I don't remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold's new remake. Instead my review will focus exclusively on the new film.Mangold's film is a tense traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold's film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are respectively Dan Evans Bale and Ben Wade Crowe. Evans is a wouldbe rancher and familyman whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan's eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison while Wade's crew of murderers dogs their every step.Two performances stood out for me  Bale and Ben Foster Charlie Prince. Crowe was good but it's not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely Alan Tudyk Logan Lerman Gretchen Mol Peter Fonda and others. The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.More often than not good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are 'shootemups'. After all it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story's development and the cinematography. For a western there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protg Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite and Dan's son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn't being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gunfight it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising ambiguous and more than a little ironic.Highly recommended for western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best western since Unforgiven. Every aspect of this film is great. The acting was superb. Russell Crowe continues to give great and much overlooked performances. He delivers a great performance as outlaw Ben Wade. Crowe just keeps on putting me in shock with his spectacular performances. Crowe brought a mystique to his role that would of fit in with the old westerns. He seems as if he play anything and was a joy to watch here. He needs to be given much more and was definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Christain Bale also gives as a surprise to me a great performance as Dan Evans. He is on the verge of losing everything he's got. Bale displays his desperation and his willingness to feel that he has a purpose in life. He is definitely turning into a very good all around actor. I think he also deserved an Oscar nomination. Peter Fonda and Ben Foster also give very solid performances in their supporting roles. I have heard some people say that this western was to talky but I don't believe so. I think this was filled with great dialog and was engaging for the length of the movie.The directing by James Mangold was probably the best I have seen from him. He was able to bring back the old western style but yet mix it together with a modern effects and etc. He did not fall into the trap of making it boring or to violent. He carried the movie all the way through keeping the viewer entertained. The cinematography was amazing. The sceneries were spectacular and many of the shooting scenes were delivered with such excellence with the acting directing but the cinematography brought those scenes and this movie to another level. The music was great as well. It did not become clich but instead made you feel like you were back watching Clint Eastwood Gary Cooper or John Wayne. It just captured me like no other western has in a while. This movie is truly a modern classic.".

It's full of violence cruelty lies treachery profanity sex and worst of all improbability. The good guys can't even deter the bad guys with a Gatling gun but one lone Mexican sharpshooter shooting from miles away fells the good guys. When the bad guys see the good guys with a Gatling Gun they just laugh because they know the good guys can't hit the broadside of a barn with anything. The good guys can't even hit a horse with their Gatling Gun! And Ben Wade the toughest smartest most ruthless outlaw of all times remains in town in a hotel room with a girl with his horse tied up outside the bar until the Sheriff and his men ride back into town and easily take him into custody. He has to be taken into custody early on in the movie in order to start this parody of getting him on the 310 to Yuma! In one scene toward the end the gang offers the townspeople a 200 per person bounty on the Sheriff and each of the good guys and the townspeople go crazy in their desire to make 200 or more. And in the end Ben Wade who himself or through his gang has dispatched everybody who matters to their eternal rewards is so impressed with the truth and courage of the opposition that he voluntarily gets on the train to go back to the Yuma Prison for his third time and most likely to a date with the hangman. And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible some Bible verses and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle. Yep it's SOME movie. Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from.".

Yuma ends in something so contrived it's laughable. You know they say movies are made for an eight grade educated audience and even with grade inflation no one in middle school will be insulted by this film.All the killing was great. I mean I love bullets especially the ones fired at point blank that don't blow the guts out of Peter Fonda's character. Was he wearing body armor or is he just so old and leathery that it stops the molten hot projectile from penetrating his subcutaneous fat and peritoneum. Pretty soon he's 'good to go' and up in the saddle and fighting Ben. And when he gets flung over the cliff his posse pales show great restraint. OK Mr. Wade that'll be enough now get back on your horse we have a train to catch. When Butch in Butch Cassidy gets mad at his gang but only kicks the big guy in the nuts. Crowe does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces. A nice parting gesture after they ride 80 hard miles to rescue him. The very last icing on the cake was Roy Roger's horse Trigger doing a cameo and responding to a whistle from Crowe. If you loved this movie don't watch The Good the Bad and the Ugly Unforgiven Open Range or Dances with Wolves.Filmmakers PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE THE WESTERN!".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the 1957 oater that's movie talk for western is serviceable largely because of the earnest craftiness of its two leads who skillfully play off each other in a battle of wills if not morals. Unfortunately while the motives of the good guy playes by Christian Bale are both noble and realistic some of the actions of the bad guy Russell Crowe may leave you scratching your head and while nebulous intentions can make for wonderful mystery in the end you're still not sure why Crowe's dastardly Ben Wade has done what he's done and what it all means.Dan Evans Bale is a dirtpoor farmer who lost a leg in the Civil War. His farm's about to be foreclosed by an unscrupulous land owner who's taken to damming a river and burning down Evans' barn to force him off his own property. So when stagecoach robber Ben Wade Crowe is captured and needs to be escorted to the nearby town to get on the titular train Evans volunteers both to gain payment to help save his farm and to save face in front of his two kids one of whom is sick from tuberculosis and one who thinks his old man is a spineless failure. Saddled by debt and ungrateful kids Evans' decision and motivation is easy to understand.Ah but getting the nefarious Wade to Yuma is going to be a complicated trick indeed because the rest of his gang led by Charlie Prince Ben Foster isn't going to let their fearless leader be trundled off to Yuma to die. Luckily bounty hunter Byron McElroy a gritty Peter Fonda gets the idea of using a decoy stagecoach to lure the varmints off the trail while he and the rest of the posse including Evans schlep Wade in the other direction. The gambit works for a while allowing the good guys to place precious geographical space between them and the bad guys it also allows the movie to continue unabated. Because after all there are more people in Wade's gang then there are trying to bring him to justice  all they'd have to do is find him shoot the hell out of the place and grab him.Although there's plenty of gunplay and death by bullets this is much more of a psychological drama than anything else. Wade as played coldly but not charmlessly by Crowe has two goals in mind gain the mental upper hand on Evans an untrained rancher and gain his escape from the clutches of law and order. Meanwhile although Evans' intentions are less murky he's not some squintyeyed sharpshooter whose aim is always true he's not an iconic hero who you just know is gonna save the day. Bale is terrific you can really see the anguish he feels as a supposed failure in the eyes of his sons. In the hands of lesser actors these two complex roles would have seemed less symbiotic and therefore less sincere. For example apparently Movie Guy Tom Cruise was initially supposed to have Wade's role if that had come to fruition we would have been distracted by Movie Star Tom Cruise and the movie would have suffered terribly as a result.But despite the wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe the movie's shortcoming is that Ben Wade's intentions seem rather inscrutable. I don't mean that they're simply ambiguous is he going to flee or help the good guys fight off Navajo Indians? I mean that they don't make much sense. One minute Wade is all set to get away from Evans and escape to the safety of his gang but in the next he's actually fending off his gang as it attacks Evans. There's no explanation given for this change of heart but the new attitude is gone as quickly as it arrives leaving the viewer a little puzzled. Sure some may explain this as Wade comes to respect Evans and so doesn't want to see the rancher killed but Wade's actions were much more than that. He wasn't just trying to save Evans you see he was actively trying to knock off members of his own gang and the reason for that escaped me completely.Still 310 to Yuma is firmly entertaining benefiting from two gritty believable performances by Crowe and Bale although it's marred by some unexplained actions on the part of its charismatic villain.".

	onyx:emotionText "This remake of the 1957 oater that's movie talk for western is serviceable largely because of the earnest craftiness of its two leads who skillfully play off each other in a battle of wills if not morals. Unfortunately while the motives of the good guy playes by Christian Bale are both noble and realistic some of the actions of the bad guy Russell Crowe may leave you scratching your head and while nebulous intentions can make for wonderful mystery in the end you're still not sure why Crowe's dastardly Ben Wade has done what he's done and what it all means.Dan Evans Bale is a dirtpoor farmer who lost a leg in the Civil War.

Great evil theatric posturing by Ben Foster. The cinematography is great and it's based on one of the great thinking man's cowboy movies ever made. So how could they screw this up. Simple by deciding at the end to pander to the audience that likes action and is either too lazy too think or finds attention to concentration bothersome to the base pleasure of being led by the nose.SPOILER Up until the last twenty minutes the movie does fair homage to the original and in some ways fleshes it out satisfactorily. To keep up interest there is way too much escapingrecapturing going on. Crowe gets captured initially not by some fluke but by his own stupidity which puts a crimp in the notion that he is a fiendishly clever sociopath. Then he escapes way too many times from supposedly hardened men who never seem to get it that the best way to transport a sociopath is heavily bound.

Bale must take Crowe not only past them but half the town that has been offered bounty money. So how does he do it? The Director decides to turn the movie completely upside down and have Crowe aid and abet Bale in running the gauntlet. Not only aid and abet but kill off every last one of his own gang for pissing him off and shooting Bale. I am so tired of having to sit through movies and suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the movie. I'm willing to do it when the movie doesn't take itself serious but this one tries to pass itself off as a morality play and Crowe's latter day conversion to Robin Hood simply insults probability.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a Western film buff and don't claim to be so I had some reservations going into this film however I was also expecting something great even though it's not my particular genre. With Christian Bale Russell Crowe and James Mangold directing I knew the screenplay had to be good. I knew the film was going to be good. I just didn't know how much I would love it. Christian Bale plays Dan Evens a poor rancher who's struggling during the drought to protect his family. He happens to stumble upon Ben Wade Russell Crowe as he's robbing a coach full of money hauled by the Pinkerton's. After a gun battle erupts Wade collects on his 22nd robbery. Dan Evans oldest son William Logan Lerman ignores Dan which happens a lot as William tries to see the action from atop the ridge as Wade and his gang spot him after Wade shoots one of his own men for putting the rest of the gang at risk. Evans oldest son is in awe of Wade and has a sense of admiration his father wish he had for him.Wade is caught in Bisbee and the Railroad Company is offering to pay three men to bring Wade to Contention and put him on the 310 to Yuma and send him to the Yuma prison. Evens tells him that he was the best shot in his regiment and Evans youngest son who sees his father as a hero tells Wade that he can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards which is sayin' something. Evans is paid 200 dollars to help bring Wade to Contention.During the journey we start to see a transformation from both Wade and Evans. Evans tells him that he will bring him to justice. He believes it's right to stand up to people like Ben Wade. By the end of the journey as they make it to Contention they wait for the train to come and this wait becomes the films strongest act. Evans is watching Wade in a bridal suite waiting for destiny to come. As the wait comes closer to three o'clock Wade's gang arrives in Contention. The gang's current leader Charlie Prince Ben Foster is the only one who wanted to travel 80 miles to help Wade. Prince makes an offer to the towns folk of 200 dollars to anyone who shoots one of his capturers. The odds now seem insurmountable and since everyone in the town has guns cocked and drawn ready to shoot the Marshall and two of his best deputies decide that they're family men and this is an unfair fight and they will not die like this so they bail on Evans. Mr. Butterfield also says that he won't be helping Evans put Wade on that train. Evans is found standing alone.Now when all the bullets start flying reality goes right out the door with them but the message and purpose for Evans leading Wade to the train makes it all worth it. The ending is controversial and a lot of people aren't going to find it realistic but they haven't noticed the character change. Is it a little unreal how Wade seems to turn in the blink of an eye? Sure. Maybe. But the reasons for their turn is exhilarating to watch. Seeing Wade brought to justice was not Evans intention at all as it was at the start of their journey. Evans does something incredible. Wade does something incredible. The actions during the final minutes with nothing but the sound of the chugging train engine like a slow heartbeat in the background is emotionally captivating. It is some of the best work of any genre you are going to find.Christian Bale is great in this film and this may very well be his greatest acting achievement to date American Psycho The Machinist The Prestige and Russell Crowe is also phenomenal and this is one of his better performances as well A Beautiful Mind Gladiator American Gangster.This film is not about the gun battles or the wild west. It's about the characters. These characters are so deep and as we become so involved with them we are left rooting for them and hoping something doesn't happen that seems inevitable. The final lines of the film are said by Dan Evans' son and Charlie Prince. Both said to Dan Evans. We can get a sense of joy during these final moments because we know everything that happened up until that point went exactly as planed by Evans and we get a sense of triumph in an odd way. This is a great film regardless of genre. It's also the best Western I've ever seen.".

However none of the performances lack not Bale's not Foster's not Fonda's. There is really an old school Western here with a modern edge to it. 310 to Yuma is also quite stunning when it comes to cinematography and set design but these elements merely help tell the story they do not distract from it. It's definitely worth seeing. James Mangold Walk the Line is definitely a very talented director.

But then I saw 310 to Yuma this afternoon to be honest I don't know who could have done a better job! Christian and Russell clicked so well and brought together an awesome western film probably the best since Unforgiven. James Mangold captured the perfect feeling of a classic western film and brought together this great cast. This is one of the first films of the summer that I'm giving a perfect 10 rating I couldn't find one complaint about 310 to Yuma. The casting the picture the whole surrounding of the film was just incredible. To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if this is going to be nominated for a couple Oscars.Ben Wade is an outlaw killerthief who is on the run with his gang but he is captured one day. The problem is that he has a reputation for being the fastest gun swinger in the West so the policemen ask a man Dan Evans if he brings him to the 310 prisoner train to Yuma for two hundred dollars. One problem Ben's gang wants him back and will chase him his son Doc and Butterfield throughout the West. Ben is just charming his way through the journey Dan's son William is convinced that maybe Ben isn't all that bad but Dan knows better and is willing to do anything to get Ben onto that train.310 to Yuma is one of the year's best to be honest I'm thinking about the films this past year and I would probably rank this as the number one movie. I was never really into western movies except for the good the bad and the ugly and unforgiven but 310 to Yuma is a guaranteed classic. I am very much recommending this film to anyone even those who are not into the Western films because this is just all together a terrific film.

They just kept giving him chance after chance after chance. These guys were not idiots. He was cold blooded killer. The way to transport him is to tie him up gag him and lead his horse for him.

Has he got rocks in his head. Sit him in a corner or in another room with a gun to his head and then give him food.All throughout the movie they treat him like he's their buddy not their prisoner.

They encounter a village under attack by a monster and soon learn who the monster is. Broly becomes resurrected and takes on all four on his own.Although short this film is quite epic as well as funny. It is rather ridiculous at times though like when Trunks pees on Broly's face. Its mostly just child play humor with Goten and Trunks but when Gohan enters the battle it gets really intense. Has awesome music just like the first one and gives us exactly what we expected. The Legendary super saiyan fighting against Gohan for the fate of the universe. The way he's defeated is pretty decent and the fighting scenes make the movie seem longer.In conclusion its well made and continues the Broly series on a high note!".

This probably due to the fact that when a saiyan recovers from a near death injury they gain a tremendous powerup. Goku's fist tearing through his stomach likely fitted into that category. Amazingly enough he appears to have power that is now beyond a super saiyan two's seeing as Gohan could barely stand against him during their fight. To some disappointment Broly has gone insane to some extent his only dialogue other than Kakarot being I will not stop until you lie dead at my feet. Other than that Broly is just as menacing as he was in the first film. But this film is far shorter and neither Piccolo nor Vegeta get a second chance at the Legendary Super Saiyan what?!! Instead the story relies on Trunks Videl and Goten to fuel the action. A more or less bad decision.Less actual rock but an excellent ending leaves with me the decision to give this one an overall good review for the most part.".

I love the way the creators of this show have so much fun. I mean the idea that a Super Saiyan of astronomic proportions is so angry is because Goku kept crying as a baby? Proper tongue in cheek there!The second movie picks up 7 years where the first left off. Despite his apparent destruction Broly is indeed alive although he is 'inactive'. It is only when Goten's loud cry bearing resemblance to Goku's crying as a baby rings through the ice do we see Broly wake up. Boy oh boy was he angry! Without the controlling headband Broly is unleashed from the start and unlike many Dragon Ball movies the action starts very early on into the movie. I felt this was somewhat rushed. Perhaps we could have had a bigger buildup. A further glimpse into the back story of Broly would have been great too. I just felt something was missing here that the creators failed to capitalise on.The action sequences that ensued Broly's reactivation were very different from the first movie. Unlike the serious nature of battle captured in the first movie the involvement of Goten and kid Trunks adds an element of humour here that I felt was great fun. Others may feel that Broly is one the villains in the Dragon Ball series who had so much potential but was given a storyline that failed to meet it. To me I loved the fact that the creators matched one of the strongest fighters in the universe with such a comedic storyline. It was a tale of polar opposites! The only thing I wanted to see was more of a fight from the younglings before teen Gohan came into the picture. When the story came to an end it felt a bit anticlimactic. The story was just so basic that I thought there would have been more to come after the battle scenes. Perhaps the creators could have involved a further subplot of Saiyans who tracked Broly's reactivation and they could have also come to fight. Anything would have been welcomed here but I suppose when you only have 50 minutes to play with there is only so much you can do.If you liked the first Broly movie you will enjoy this. It is very different from the first but it is still enjoyable. However don't expect a deep story because this is as basic as fisticuffs in Fight Club.".

Unfortunately this movie made the mistake of being too short which is what made the original so good. I also missed Piccolo Future Trunks and Vegeta. The end credits actually show stock footage from the first movie. Couldn't they even show stock footage from their own movie? Of course this was by no means terrible. It helps that we have all the great action that the series is known for. It's just great to see Broly back.There were so many Dragonball Z movies I'm glad they had a recurring character as part of it. We really do get some nice bits with Goten and Trunks here too. Congratulations on them for their first movie appearances. Maybe that's why they were featured so much. Goku does in fact appear but only for a few minutes at the end! I missed him for a lot of the movie but it was pretty interesting to see some other characters take the spotlight for once and to see Goku and his two sons fight together. 12".

	schema:headline " Broly returns just do not expect the super fight he had in his previous movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This Dragonball Z movie was a bit weak. They return one of the best movie villains up to that point in Broly and proceed to waste him. He would sort of reappear later in another movie but it was not the real Broly there only a clone so I am willing to forgive his weakness a bit in that one. This one features the young Trunks and Goten as they along with Videl are searching for the Dragonballs. So right away you are stuck with basically all newer characters instead of the ones we really enjoy no Vegeta sorry to say. Well Broly appears and proceeds to track down Goten and Trunks as Goten's crying reminds him of Kakorot's which really ticks Broly off. Well Gohan soon appears and though at this point he has the power to go Super Saiyan 2 he instead stays level one. Why you ask? Perhaps because they make Broly so weak in this one that he does not need to ramp up his power for the fight in this one. This raging mass of hatred for Goku reduced to an easily dispatched foe really kind of sucks. Another thing that is bad here is that the first movie featuring Broly could actually be referred to as a movie as it had a decent run time and so could develop a rather good plot. No such luck here as there almost is no plot way to much comedy and a weak fight. Its like the makers are saying Remember that great fight in the first film? Well here we are not going to make it quite as intense. It is not all bad as I enjoyed the appearance of the one Z fighter but overall this one was just weak.".

I enjoy the fighting scenes and humor but sometimes the plot leaves something to be desired.  One thing I can't stand sometimes is that the characters always use the dragonballs in the aftermath of a battle but never to help with the battle but if they did then the fighting wouldn't be as goodoh well.  This movie features my favorite villain Brolly and he is seriously tough as usual.  I enjoy the humor that Trunks and Goten bring and seeing Gohan grown up is cool.  If you are any kind of DBZ fan then check this out now.  If you like any anime then I also recommend this movie.  NOW FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE.  SERIOUS PLOT SPOILER It was kind of old stuff with Brolly I admit but damn he's cool. For some strange reason he couldn't think or say anything not about kakarot. If Brolly had to meet his end I'm glad the writers decided to use the dragonballs to beat him and not any specific character.  It was a cool ending with the family all firing at the same time and throwing Brolly in to the sun.  Whether or not Goku was really there or he was an image to inspire Gohan and Goten is up to us to decide.  I think Goku was and image that Shenron made and Shenron also weakened Brolly and that's why his blasts had no effect after Goku showed up.  I think I might be dissecting it too much but that's what's fun about these types of endings in movies.".

Don't watch it even if you are paid to do so.Kareena's friends are the most interesting part of the movie. Please that does not mean its good. It only means compared to other parts of the movie that is good.Anyways if you are going to watch this movie keep a good dosage of aspirin handy.".

The best acting in this movie is by Abhishek Bachchan who plays the introvereted Prem to Hrithik's Extrovert.The supporting cast was adequate but nothing too special. I liked Pankaj Kapur's rendition of the long suffering Dad.The music was actually quite good. Few songs too many. Many of the video's have Hrithik Roshan SANS shirt prancing aroundI swear sometime he just looked plain Gay! and Kareena Kapoor wearing her signature strappy top and tight pants!The best song was Bani Bani accompanied by a nice dance from Kareena.I also liked the songs Aur Mohabat Hain and Kasam Ki Kasam.From a director like Suraj Barjatiya this is a HUGE disappointment. The story could have worked with a better script and a more tight reign on the performances. But that didn't happen! Too bad!The best thing about this movie was the scenery but then I would say that.

	schema:reviewBody "Time marches on inexorably the latest example of this truism comes in the form of Rajshri Productions' newest release Main Prem Ki Deewani Hoon'. Under the Rajshri banner the Barjatya clan has been dishing out family fare for well over thirty years melodramatic tearjerkers chaste love stories moralistic family dramas that were sensitive and inoffensive if overly simple.  With the arrival of Sooraj Barjatya the clan's output took on a veneer of modernity that imparted a certain slickness to their somewhat regressive family values' agenda and also introduced a new element cheesiness.Maine Pyaar Kiya' Sooraj's directorial debut was loud kitschy and launched a new romantic pair with great fanfare Salman Khan finally had a starring vehicle and a starlet from Indian TV Bhagyashree was catapulted onto the big screen.  Though there was much to crib about in this film it had a bizarre anachronistic charm as well.  Everyone other than the villains was sweet enough to bring on a major case of diabetes especially the heroine.  The characters were monodimensional the hoary plot simple in the extreme but what saved the film was that its lead pair truly was young and looked genuinely lovelorn.  What appealed to me was that the film kept scrupulously to all the ageold conventions of Hindi cinema though it was made in the late eighties it could easily have been passed off as a product of the 'forties or 'fifties.  The public adored it and the Barjatyas made a ton of money.  Salman parlayed the success of this film into a booming career but Bhagyashree foolishly stipulated that she would only appear in films with her supremely untalented husband and soon vanished never to be heard from again.Sooraj Barjatya then went on to make variations on this theme in the form of Hum Aap Ke Hai Kaun' which I found insufferable and interminable! despite the presence of a gorgeous Madhuri Dixit and Hum Saath Saath Hain' which was just as dreadful but had a pleasing pair in Saif Ali Khan and Karishma Kapoor.  The millions in India however loved these films and the Barjatyas once again laughed all the way to the bank.Now with Main Prem Ki Deewani Hoon' Sooraj Barjatya displays a brand new awareness of the changing times.  Somebody has recently clued him in about the birds and the bees thus though there is love galore beginning with the title of the film there is also a fiery exhibition of raging hormones and the unmistakable frisson of sex!  Mind you the heroine still remains chaste but now she actually lets the hero kiss her and the screen steams up with this novel willingness to indulge in the pleasures of the flesh. Kareena Kapoor plays Sanjana a maiden who is winsome sexy in a wholesome mangolassiandkulfi kind of way and of course the apple of everyone's eye.  She has a noble but browbeaten father and a beadyeyed mother who the minute Sanjana completes college starts scouring the world for a suitable moneybags husband for her darling daughter.  The three of them reside in a town called Sundernagar.Sundernagar merits a paragraph of its own so unusual and geographically baffling is it!  Within its city limits are gently undulating Alpine slopes so that the family can go on healthy bicycle jaunts snowcovered peaks and daring ski runs for the hero to demonstrate his snowboarding prowess pristine white sand beaches and clear blue oceans filled with myriad tropical fish existing once again merely for the hero to exhibit that he has welldeveloped amphibian skills as well.  Sundernagar boasts of an entire spectrum of ethnicities living harmoniously together for kindly white helicopter pilots take the lead pair bungeejumping the florist shops are similarly staffed by Caucasians the local college with plump brown nuns while the family's retainers are decidedly from some unnamed village in Bihar.  The gospel of the Spice Girls has somehow made it to this geographical and anthropological marvel for the college has a girlpower themed musical show complete with miniskirted pompom wielding cheerleaders a phenomenon that was unknown in Indian cinema until the advent of Karan Johar's Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'.  Sanjana our leading lady even has four best friends who are the Hindimovie equivalent of the nowdefunct Spice Girls.When Sanjana's parents get an email from their older married daughter who lives somewhere in the USA announcing the imminent arrival of an almost impossibly eligible bachelor in Sundernagar they make tracks for the local airport find a young man named Prem Hrithik Roshan there and promptly bring him home.  They do everything short of hurling Sanjana at him to let him know that he'd be more than welcome to take their daughter out.  Of course it being springtime the young couple's hormones run amok and they fall in love and a kind of primandproper lust.  The cherry blossoms are in full bloom once again I scratched my head and tried in vain to figure out the coordinates of Sundernagar so it's the perfect season to sing duets which they do under the gentle voyeuristic gaze of the ubiquitous desi local Spice Girls.  Prem Hrithik finds every pretext to shed his shirt while Sanjana swoons ecstatically at the sight of all those manly muscles.Alas the family has goofed up in a major way.  Another email arrives which informs them that they've brought the wrong Prem home so much to the distress of our leading lady her beadyeyed mother loses no time in turfing the ineligible Prem.  Mummy also pragmatically suggests that her daughter speedily transfer her affections to the correct young man.  The real moneybags Prem Abhishek Bachchan shows up with a glamorously attired mother in tow and in short order falls in love with Sanjana.  Of course he is the antithesis of the gregarious wellmuscled Prem so what's a young leading lady to do?  Sanjana sheds many pretty tears and sings sad songs none of which have any effect on her determinedly upwardlymobile mother. How does it all end?  Does this terribly sad mess get sorted out at all?I must stop my narrative here or there won't be any reason for you to see the film and further fill Sooraj Barjatya's coffers.  This movie like all its recent Rajshri predecessors is strident trashy with a few absolutely hideous elements like a CGI talking parrot and cocker spaniel but strangely fascinating nevertheless.  The three leads are nice to look at and take all this nonsense very seriously so we too end up buying into it.  Kareena is a polished performer a wellschooled practitioner of the guiles and wiles of a Hindifilm leading lady.  Her suitors in this film acquit themselves well too with Hrithik chewing the scenery and nibbling on Sanjana in equal measure as the flamboyant extrovert Prem and Abhishek managing to hold on to his dignity as the pensive introvert Prem.  None of the supporting performers merit special mention but I did like Reema Lagoo's glamorous new look.  See this movie at your own risk and millions no doubt will to give the Barjatyas yet another blockbuster.".

	schema:reviewBody "MILD SPOILERS I am always remember that a Rajshiri Production was something to always look forward ever since I was introduced to the Indian cinema by Maine Pyar Kiya. This banners movie though not as polished as the Chopra's or Ghais's movies they were very family orientated well developed had a good blend of comedy to serious moments and delivered good performances from actors.However it seems that this time around Rajshiri specifically Sooraj Barjatya has decided to break their triedandtested formula and go for a more modern movie. In doing so he has given us a movie that is unrealistic far too long not properly developed and annoying to watch.Something that we had come to expect from this banner was the availability of pure family entertainment movies but it seems that the director really wanted to go ultra modern in this flick and push the boundaries even further then other movies. First up there is the unnecessary under dressing of Kareena and friends hey I do not mind seeing it but what conservative Indian parent is going to let the daughter wear tank tops strapless  backless tops and mini skirts? then there is openness to talk about sex it also seems family culture is thrown out the window like any parents will let their daughter stay out till 23 am with a stranger and finally there is the onscreen kissing not that interesting when you watching it with elders!!Carrying on with the annoying bits there are so many  where does one being what is the deal with the animation? Was it really needed? The parrot was so annoying and not really needed. To make matters worse for the parrot the subtitles that were being provided in the UK were so off the mark an example because the parrot quotes Indian movie titles he said 'Raja Hindustani' and the subtitle said 'Mr Wonderful' ? Moving on  then there is the dog Mr Johnny again a reincarnation of the dog actions from 'The Mask'. One final annoying bit was that Sarooj decided to dump Alok Nath from this movie  he would have really suited the role of the father.Drawing to the boundaries of idiocy was the wonderful town that the characters lives in. It is meant to be a small villagetown but it seems to boast a modern airport infrastructure and hang outs of a city. In trying to develop modern characters it seems that director has created a town that is something found in a fiction novel. It would have to be considering that it has quick access to mountains for skiing ocean for deep sea diving mountains for climbing rivers for river rafting long white sand beaches and ability for bungee jumping! Wow!!Starting on the movie. It's a love story triangle with a new twist? Well not really its same formula for two guys who have admiration for one another falling for the same girl. The Girl in question is Sanjana Kareena Kapoor. She is meant to be modern feisty strong headed girl who lives in a small town in India. Her parents are looking for a suitable match for their daughter with the typical requirements of being rich rich and rich. Sanjanas sister living in the US informs them that a well respected and rich boy who she has dealings with is coming to their town and he is interested in seeing Sanjana. Enter Hritik Roshan as Prem.  Over a period of two weeks he manages to smitten the mum dad parrot dog and friends. Also in this time he changes Sanjanas view from hating Prem to loving Prem. Then disaster strikes. It seems that this loving Prem was not the intended Prem. Enter Abishek as the intended Prem. Who just happens to be the boss of the loving Prem. Of course the loving Prem decides to abandon his love for his boss and runs away when he finds out that his boss also loves Sanjana. Ahhh. but don't worry all ends well as expected in Indian movies.The cast and characterization would be described as mediocre at best. Karenna acting is what we have come to expect from her the immortalization of Po from K3G. Her expressions are the same her shocked look her annoyed look and crying look. She really falls flat on her face when she has to act emotional. Then there is Hritik who so wound me up with his acting that I would cringe every time he came on screen. His over the top acting reminded you of Salman Khans acting in Hum Aapke Hai Kaun but at least it suited him then. It also seems that being so desperate for a hit Hritik is desperate to draw on the female appeal by shedding his clothes for the first time in this movie. Finally there is Abishek. To be honest his character really grew on me and really thought he was good. It could be because placed next to the other two his was the only one that seemed good.This movie would have been so much better if the right cast had been chosen. Sanjanas role had would have been better played by either Pretty Zinta or Rani Mukerjee. The love Prem would have been perfect with SRK and intended Prem with  Aamir Khan. Then that would have been a movie worth watching.I guess we can only hope that the next Rajshiri movie is worth waiting for.".

Hritik's Prem has had 12 too many Red Bulls and for the first half of the movie he is a live wire that loves everyone and aside from the fact that he can annoy the crap out of you he is the perfect good boy. Kareena's Sanjana is also a daughter to be proud of. She dresses in skimpy clothes and prances around at the school function to which her parents have been invited but other than that she gives her parents a lot to be proud of. Sanjana's family owns a parrot that talks unnecessarily and a dog whose face becomes animated when angered.Abhishek's Prem enters and really saves the day for the movie because he is the only sober performance in an overexcited cast.The music is pretty good and the movie is shot well... the storyline isn't bad either but the cast mess it all up.By the way did anyone notice that Hritik keeps whistling an unknown tune through the movie. It was a tune he kept whistling in K3G as well. Absolutely useless information but true none the less.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly cartoonish but enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a tough one. While Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon does have some problems and I can see why some people would hate at least some aspects of it for me the film ended up workingI was completely wrapped up in the story by the climax getting appropriately annoyed with some characters crying at other moments etc. If that's the case the film can't merit too low of a score. The film did one of its jobsnamely it transported me to another world so to speak where I care what happens to characters.The story is centered on Sanjana Kareena Kapoor. She's from a family I'd call wealthy based on their home and such but her mom thinks they're not so well off. Sanjana has just finished undergraduate school it seems this point was not so clear to me but it could have been a translation problem in the subtitles and for the graduation celebration at the school she and her friends perform a song asserting their modernity independence and their conscious break from the tradition of arranged marriages. Naturally Sanjana's mom has a different idea and so does Sanjana's married sister Roopa Tanaaz Currim who is living in New York. Roopa calls to say that she has the perfect suitor for SanjanaPrem a very successful wealthy business acquaintance. He's going to be coming to India. Roopa has arranged for him to stay with her family with the goal of arranging a marriage between Sanjana and Prem. Of course Sanjana balks at this and she's initially ill mannered and sarcastic towards Prem. But will Prem grow on her? Making things even more interesting there's a big twist about halfway through the film.Like a number of other recent Bollywood films Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon begins at least by selfconsciously trying to seem very modern. The first song Papa Ki Pari has a kind of Disneyfied MTV styleSanjana and her four best friends are on stage in relatively skimpy clothing something like a cross between an Indian Spice Girls and five Hilary Duffs. There are flashing lights lots of affected attitudes Sanjana is posing with a guitar there are graffiti backdrops dancing cheerleaders and so on. Unlike most American schooloriented films everyone loves each other in this opening scene. Teachers dressed like nuns are in the audience grooving to the music holding signs that they love the students. Students are holding signs that they love the teachers. The parents act very moderately shocked by some of the things they're hearing and seeing on stage but just for a moment then they're back to smiling and being proud.Taking something of a left turn director Sooraj R. Barjatya mixes the typical Bollywood romancecomedy mode which is rooted in realist inclinations with a kind of bizarre cartoonishness once the setting changes to Sanjana's house. Sanjana has an almost purely CGI parrot who squawks commentary by reciting movie titles. She has a dog whose head is occasionally drawn over in a Saturday morning cartoon style. The interior of the house was constructed in a studio and in some scenes it looks like there was supposed to be exterior scenery composited into the windows but it wasn't completed so it's just left as bluescreen. This mood lasts up until Prem first appears. Hrithik Roshan plays Prem manically but comedically overthetop. At this stage Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon feels more like a crazy sitcomthe overall mood isn't that different from the early sitcom segment of Natural Born Killers 1994 although there's obviously less of an evil undertone here.This is probably the point where a lot of people decide that they really hate Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. We know that a lot of people hate CGI. A lot of people hate departures from realism whether conscious or not and so on. I didn't hate the film at this point but I was having problems adjusting to it. Especially given the mood change that follows it seems as it does in too many Bollywood films that perhaps Barjatya didn't know exactly what mode he was shooting for at first. From MTVish glamparty to surreal absurdist sitcom to Bollywood comedyromance is quite a shift in gears. But I like both surrealist and absurdist stuff so the sitcom section didn't bother meI even admired the insanity of putting the crude and corny CGI and animation in the film. It was just too weird not to like.And after that point I began being drawn into the film more and more. It doesn't hurt that from the beginning Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon is full of beautiful people including the women and especially including Kapoor. It also doesn't hurt that Barjatya fills his exterior shots with breathtaking scenery filmed in New Zealand and Mauritius. After the sitcom stuff there's an extended sequence that's part travelogue part extreme sports promo. This whole section is beautifully shot beautifully edited and the sports are beautifully choreographed. On a purely visual level Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon is often worthy of a 10.The love story kept getting more interesting from that point forward as well and the film also remains humorous for most of its length. By the time the twist arrives I was completely into the film. Yes the performances remained almost consistently overthetop but as the film always has a cartoonish undercurrent it worked for me. And although some people might find comic reliefman Johnny Lever annoying he makes me laugh.Finally I loved the songs. Since this is a Bollywood musical that's important. Composer Anu Malik smartly abandons clichd Bhangra rhythms and gives us something much more sophisticated rhythmically harmonically and melodically that manages to both be very modern and retain its traditional elements while being catchy at the same time.Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon is no masterpiece but it's not a disaster either. Still exercise caution if you're only looking for realism and you dislike cheese.".

	schema:reviewBody "Talk about a movie getting bad reviews on the IMDB. I am kind of surprised. Cause this movie did NOT suck. Let me first start with the story. Sanjana Kareena Kapoor falls in love with Prem Hritik Roshan a man chosen by her parents to marry her. After he has finally won her heart her parents find out that they mistook him for his boss. Meaning the boss has money he doesn't. So her mother and her sister encourage her to get along with the boss also called Prem Abhishek Bachchan. Now start the woes. Does she choose the man she loves? Or does she obey her mother and marry the boss who has fallen in love with her?The first half of the movie was annoying at best. Both Kareena and Hritik indulged in overacting. Their childish behaviour was enough to wanna make you throw the remote at the tv. This all however made the second half an even bigger surprise. It showed us a Kareena that can actually act provided she isn't cast in the role of dim lightbulb or bimbo cheerleader. I found her performance very moving. I actually felt for her. Hritik unfortunately remained annoying not for his childish behaviour this time but for acting like a total spineless jerk. As for the other characters. The mother you wouldn't wish on anyone. I'm surprised her husband didn't throttle her a long time ago. And well Abhishek Bachchan. This is the first movie of his I have seen. And I swear when he gets out of the car he looked like the spitting image of his father. I found him quite adorable.So let's recap. The movie isn't original. The acting isn't the greatest you have ever seen. But... it's a nice moving story. To be honest I even cried a little. Well worth the watch.And the movie quoting parrot was NOT annoying he was funny. Just like the cartoon dog.5 stars".

I went in with an open mind to make up my own decision about the movie and i feel everyone should do the same. So the story is nothing new but who cares? I don't think any bollwood movie concept is going to be new nowtheres so many bollywood films! However I think the movie is made exceptionally well. It's a movie so many young teens and adults can relate to. Its good how the movie is made to look so modern especially since the storyline is about modernising and how tradition is not always the best way to do something. Also who cares about the reference to sex in this movie??? I think it's about time I mean how many of you have seen a hollywood film. I'm pretty sure theres nearly always a scene which refers to something sexual so why can't they incorporate this in a bollywood film.Good on them! All the characters were very believable. Take Sanjana for instanceKareena Kapoor her character likes to look her best and attract male attention but when it comes to actually being with a guy she is very restricted. This film tells the truth and shows that not everything has to be done in a traditional manner. If you ask me this makes the film different and interesting. So what if this film hasn't exceeded all expectations  its still done well and is a good movie!".

Some movie scenes were very unrealistic with terrible special effects yet this opinion may differ to others. With the harsh reviews given for this movie I think its a average rated movie and of course there are a few laughs here and there and Kareena actually provided most of it!

It's neither ambitious nor technically brilliant in fact the cinematography somehow manages to NOT capture the inherent scenic beauty of a series of Hawaiian and Australian locations. But the casting and directing are solid and the story has so much charm that you don't mind it being corny and predictable. Halle Berry and James Belushi play teachers at a Hawaiian technical high school who reluctantly sponsor a team of students building a solarpowered car. Race the Sun was inspired by a group of Hawaiian students who actually entered the World Solar Challenge in 1980. The film would have been better if the cartoonish corporate villain had been replaced by some actual scientific explanations and a bit of background on the race itself. Speaking of cartoons the solar cars look like something out of Wacky Races but there is no sign of Penelope Pitstop in this entertaining race.The school is in Hawaii which makes for some interesting cultural details as does the race's Austrialian setting but for viewer identification purposes the settings could be anywhere.Thankfully the film avoids a couple of obvious traps. Berry and Belushi end up liking and respecting each other but there are no obligatory romantic sparks between them. Likewise for Casey Affleck and Elisha Dushkuwho plays his stepsister.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

But Ms Beecher who takes the lead in the first quarter of the movie tries to inspire the kids and butts heads with James Belushi's Frank Machi. The experienced engineering teacher.The rest of the movie really belongs to the kids. After a clash between a rich school at a science fair Ms Beecher makes the kids go to they are inspired to build a solar power car to race in and earn their school a better rep. Leading this pack is outcasted because he's white ambitious Daniel Webster superbly played by Casey Affleck and the heartwarming Gilbert a standout character played by J. Moki Cho who unfortunatley does not have much of a filmography at this point. Roped in is the troubled sister of Daniel Cindy with a solid peformance by Eliza Dushku and a whole host of other characters each one memorable and stand out. Together they build their hopes learn from each other and not too sound cheesy but they really do race the sun.This would have been a great family film had it not been for the language. But if that doesn't put you off then I would suggest watching it with them. It really is a a good solid movie. I watched it over a week ago at 3am because i couldn't sleep but it still has stuck with me.".

I left the theater halfconvinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role even though I knew that was not the case.  The performances were generally excellent with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner I believe that's his name as the young Christy Brown.  Christy is talented brash arrogant at times vulgar and petulantin other words human.  This film along with Gaby A True Story and the documentary King Gimp are excellent portrayals of life with CP.

The TV was on  there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to. Then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not clink the forks did not move the food was getting cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs  the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character.Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot is an riveting unsentimental biodrama about Christy Brown the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life.I like every one of Day Lewis's performances I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in My Left Foot".

	schema:reviewBody "'My Left Foot' is the remarkable story of Christy Brown born into a workingclass Irish family with cerebral palsy. Growing up in a life full of poverty and extreme prejudice Christy defied everyone's expectations. Using his left foot the only part of his body he had proper control over the young man learned to write and paint.I could spend this review talking about the film's excellent portrayal of working class Ireland and the working class Irish family specifically. I could talk about how the film does a good job of showing how the attitudes towards Christy Brown changed as Ireland's own political landscape changed. I could probably also talk about the role of women in Christy's life from his mother and sisters to the loves in his life. All of these things are worthy of mention.However when talking about 'My Left Foot' there is one thing that stands out above everything else that being Daniel DayLewis. DayLewis had already proved his acting chops in the excellent 'My Beautiful Laundrette but it was this movie that put him on the map globally. And rightly so he is absolutely fantastic as Christy Brown.Acting is difficult at the best of times when you're playing a fullyfunctioning human being. What DayLewis achieves therefore is even more admirable. It is an extremely effective and realistic portrayal of someone suffering from cerebral palsy and the actor goes gungho with both the physicality expressiveness required for the role. It is a joy to watch.An honourable mention also needs to go to Hugh O'Conor who plays the younger Brown. I can only assume that it is even harder for a child to go through the rigours that the role requires but O'Conor is brilliant. What makes the character difficult to play is that in trying to make it look real physically the emotion required can be lost. Both actors avoid that problem with what seems like relative ease at no point does the efficacy or emotion of the moments falter.All the other stuff mentioned above are worthy of talking about if I intended to write a longer review. But for this small thing I think it is more than enough to say that 'My Left Foot' deserves to be seen just for this landmark Daniel DayLewis performance. Whatever you may think of the film as a whole or whether you care about the story of Christy Brown or not it is secondary to the simple appreciation for an actor at the top of his game.".

	schema:headline " An amazing debut";
	schema:reviewBody "I can still remember the fuss that was made when this movie was first  released. Everybody was applauding it. 14 years down the line the film  is very dated but still very enjoyable but more importantly very  powerful.  The story centers around Poet artist and author to be Christy Brown.  He suffers from Celerbal Paulsy I hope that is spelled right which  means to be all three of the above occupations is some feat that should  not go unnoticed. He lives in a large family 13 children not all who  suffered in a small terraced house in Dublin's City Center. The movie  begins with his birth and the late great Ray Mc Nally being told by a  nurse that there were complications during the birth. We move forward a  couple years to where we see a young Christy played by Hugh O'Connor  being helped around by his mother. It is a sad sight to see him  underneath the stairs of his family home watching his brothers and  sisters all Abled bodied living a normal lifestyle despite being  poor and knowing that he is just as well able to communicate. The  finest scene in this early stage of his life is when Christy writes for  the first time. In front of his family. His father is sceptical at  first however his opinion is reversed when Christy finally proves that  he is not the idiot that everybody thinks him to be.  We then move to Christy's later teenage years where he meets a nurse  with whose help he begins to learn how articulate his words. However  Christy becomes infatuated with this lady. His mother is delighted that  her son is happy however his father is once again the sceptic but this  time he has good cause to as Christy's heart is broken when this woman  announces that she is engaged to an Art dealer.   This film is brilliant and I have a massive amount of praise for Daniel  DayLewis who portrays Christy as an angry young man who is coming to  terms with everything in his life. He is disturbed by womens reluctance  to accept him and his condition He is fed up of his fathers treatment  of his mother and his siblings. DayLewis is totally immersed in his  character and it is one of his finest roles. I have seen old interviews  with the real Christy Brown and I can safely say that it is hard at  times to distinguish is it Christy Brown or Daniel DayLewis on the  screen.   However the show is stolen from him by the finer performances of young  Hugh O'Connor and Ray Mc Nally. Both of whom should have got Oscars as  Best Supporting Actor O'Connor and Best Actor Ray Mc Nally.  O'Connor definitely proves himself in the role because he portrays the  same qualities that DayLewis does as a frustrated youngster. Mc Nally  defines the typical Irish Father role that would be made humorous by  Colm Meaney in a number of films. It is such a great pity that he died  shortly after this film. Brenda Fricker must also be mentioned as the  doting mother who does everything that she can to help Christy reach  his full potential. Again she is life like to Christy Browns real life  mother however I think there were more deserving people for that Best  Supporting Actress Oscar.   This film is an amazing piece of independent film making and it really  does so the potential of Jim Sheridan as a director and actor. He would  further develop the themes of family Irish society loyalty in his  other films.  9 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I can still remember the fuss that was made when this movie was first  released. Everybody was applauding it. 14 years down the line the film  is very dated but still very enjoyable but more importantly very  powerful.  The story centers around Poet artist and author to be Christy Brown.  He suffers from Celerbal Paulsy I hope that is spelled right which  means to be all three of the above occupations is some feat that should  not go unnoticed. He lives in a large family 13 children not all who  suffered in a small terraced house in Dublin's City Center. The movie  begins with his birth and the late great Ray Mc Nally being told by a  nurse that there were complications during the birth. We move forward a  couple years to where we see a young Christy played by Hugh O'Connor  being helped around by his mother. It is a sad sight to see him  underneath the stairs of his family home watching his brothers and  sisters all Abled bodied living a normal lifestyle despite being  poor and knowing that he is just as well able to communicate. The  finest scene in this early stage of his life is when Christy writes for  the first time. In front of his family. His father is sceptical at  first however his opinion is reversed when Christy finally proves that  he is not the idiot that everybody thinks him to be.  We then move to Christy's later teenage years where he meets a nurse  with whose help he begins to learn how articulate his words. However  Christy becomes infatuated with this lady. His mother is delighted that  her son is happy however his father is once again the sceptic but this  time he has good cause to as Christy's heart is broken when this woman  announces that she is engaged to an Art dealer.   This film is brilliant and I have a massive amount of praise for Daniel  DayLewis who portrays Christy as an angry young man who is coming to  terms with everything in his life. He is disturbed by womens reluctance  to accept him and his condition He is fed up of his fathers treatment  of his mother and his siblings. DayLewis is totally immersed in his  character and it is one of his finest roles. I have seen old interviews  with the real Christy Brown and I can safely say that it is hard at  times to distinguish is it Christy Brown or Daniel DayLewis on the  screen.   However the show is stolen from him by the finer performances of young  Hugh O'Connor and Ray Mc Nally.

Cerebral Palsy is something people should know about this and while not a propaganda piece this film does a good job on giving the audience information about this disorder.Jim Sheridan's film tells the biography of a man named Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy the story goes from his tough childhood to his even tougher adulthood where he becomes an expert writer and painter despite the fact he only has mobility with his left foot.Now on to Daniel DayLewis. I think people would agree with me on where I stand with him as an actor. He puts every ounce of effort into his roles and he acts as if he is actually the character he is portraying. After his roles in In the Name of the Father Lincoln Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood I can honestly say he is the best actor ever. Also I must single out Brenda Fricker in this role as Christy's mother because she does such an amazing job.Overall My Left Foot is a wonderful film that tells a story of a condition that many people must suffer through. I am glad there is a film that brings proper awareness to the condition and hence much emotion is provoked. On technical terms this film not the best since I felt it could use just a little better editing. But storywise yes it is perfect. I rate this film 910.".

The film covers his upbringing in a poor family his daily struggles discovery of new passions  also his stint with love.Wonderfully directed by Jim Sheridan the film is heartwarming  heartbreaking at the same time and is an inspiring insight into the life of Christy Brown that makes the viewers go through various emotions but pity isn't one of them. The technical aspects are finely executed  have nothing special going on but it's in the performances where the film manages to make the most lasting impression.There are three key performances that are worth noting here. First is Daniel DayLewis who delves into his character like never before  plays him from insideout. Next is Brenda Fricker who strongly chips in as Christy's mother. And last we have Hugh O'Connor who is as good as DayLewis for his portrayal of young Christy Brown sets up a perfect stage for DayLewis to take over.On an overall scale My Left Foot is a touching tale about the indomitable will of the human spirit to triumph against all odds and succeeds mainly because of the unforgettable performances from its highly committed cast.

Both Fricker and DayLewis won Oscars but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy.Summing up Elmer Bernstein's music is an added plus factor.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I never got around to seeing this movie when it came out but finally had the opportunity thanks to my public library and its DVD collection. DayLewis is crippled author and painter Christy Brown and he won the Oscar for best actor. It is easy to see why. In addition Brenda Fricker as his mother Mrs. Brown won best supporting actress. The DVD extras include some 1960s footage of both Christy and his mother and it reinforces how well done this movie is. The story is simple  Christy was born with cerebral palsy a brain disorder which didn't allow normal motor controls of arms legs mouth etc so that he had much difficulty moving and speaking. The only unaffected part of him was his left leg. He could kick pretty well as demonstrated twice in playing street ball and in a pub brawl and eventually learned to write paint and type with his left foot. Thus the name of the movie. He became a successful painter and author in spite of his severe physical disadvantages.The movie shows us both the young Christy and how he grew up as a fairly normal member of his very large but poor Dublin family as well as the mature Christy. It shows his determination and it shows his temper tantrums usually borne of frustration at not being able to be normal. His main loss as an adult seemed to be the inability to find someone who could love him in a committed sense. As his biography tells us in 1972 at the age of 40 he married a nurse Mary. The movie also contains a depiction of how they met and went on to begin their romance. Christy Brown died at the relatively young age of 49 in 1981 but his life is a great example of what can be accomplished if you don't let obstacles shackle you. A superb movie and a superb portrayal by DayLewis.".

	onyx:emotionText "For some reason I never got around to seeing this movie when it came out but finally had the opportunity thanks to my public library and its DVD collection. DayLewis is crippled author and painter Christy Brown and he won the Oscar for best actor. It is easy to see why. In addition Brenda Fricker as his mother Mrs. Brown won best supporting actress. The DVD extras include some 1960s footage of both Christy and his mother and it reinforces how well done this movie is.

	schema:headline " A Great Performance from DayLewis";
	schema:reviewBody "A noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of Oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped. The first was Marlee Matlin's award for Children of a Lesser God in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another Best Actress award Holly Hunter for The Piano in 1994 and no fewer than five Best Actor awards Dustin Hoffman in 1988 for Rain Man Daniel DayLewis in 1989 for My Left Foot Al Pacino in 1992 for Scent of a Woman Tom Hanks in 1994 for Forrest Gump and Geoffrey Rush in 1996 for Shine for portrayals of the disabled. Matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are ablebodied. This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting. When Jodie Foster failed to win Best Actress for Nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal. My view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. I thought the 1992 award should have gone to either Clint Eastwood or Robert Downey rather than Pacino but apart from that the only one with which I disagreed would have been Hanks' and that was because I preferred Nigel Hawthorne's performance in The Madness of King George. In that film of course Hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill. My Left Foot was based upon the autobiography of the Irish writer and painter Christy Brown. Brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a workingclass Dublin family. He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well. He was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title. He learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet. Life in workingclass Dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city Jim Sheridan himself a Dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the Emerald Isle. Sheridan and DayLewis were later to collaborate on another film with an Irish theme In the Name of the Father. Against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the Brown family. Much of Christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings. We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a speciallymade cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard. The film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heartwarming triumph over adversity movie. That it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting. In the course of his career DayLewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent There Will Be Blood is his best. He is never less than 100 convincing as Christie his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that DayLewis is ablebodied. The other performances which stand out are from Fiona Shaw as his mentor Dr Eileen Cole from Hugh O'Conor as the young Christy and from Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother which won her the Best Supporting Actress award. The other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character. Christy Brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait. He was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage. He could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character. Of course it also shows us the positive aspects his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour. DayLewis's acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of Christy's character. His Oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of Robin Williams and Kenneth Branagh but it was well deserved. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "My Left Foot was the film that broke Daniel DayLewis into the spotlight giving him his first of three Oscar wins and labelling him as one of the finest actors in the world. DayLewis is the focal point in a movie that doesn't get enough praise in its other aspects. Why doesn't it? It is a Cinderella story about perseverance and rising about the tough times. This general premise has been done but My Left Foot does it in a completely different way and has more to offer than crippled man.My Left Foot is based on the biopic of Christy Brown. Brown grew up in an overly crowded family in the slums of Dublin but it was his extreme cerebral palsy that was the family's biggest burden. The only regular functioning part of his entire body is his left foot. His family comes to realize that he is actually smart as he is able to write and paint with his left foot. He becomes a success as a painter poet and writer ultimately writing the book in which this movie is based on.What I like about this and what separates this from other similar films is that it is less of a rise story and more of a comingofage biopic. The Browns try to make ends meet and accommodate Christy's disability to everything. Mr. and Mrs. Brown are very admirable. Brenda Fricker does a dynamite performance as Mrs. Browna role which earned her a welldeserved Oscar. She is very loving and supportive of her son and can see beyond his disability. When Christy first writes it is touching and inspirational. As Christy becomes more of a success and the Browns get out of poverty it is such a joy. 1989 was an excellent year for movies. Believe it or not Daniel DayLewis' Oscar win was not much of a stretch. Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July and Kenneth Branagh in Henry V were just as deserving as DayLewis. But it was DayLewis that was the victor in what is still his best performance. As I said earlier Brenda Fricker also won but she was a deadlocknobody in the Best Supporting Actress category was close. These two are the acting highlights but the entire movie as a whole is so perfect. We have the real Christy Brown to thank for that.".

I don't think I may have been interested in this kind of film but who knows I did watch 'Rainman' when it came out and loved it. It made me have a sense of awareness  compassion for what the disabled go through at a young age... and I had never heard of Autism before that. I now have a nephew with Autism and I myself have developed a severe case of epilepsy which is also a disability. Considering I have a disability I have a taken an interest in watching any film on the disabled.However... the fact that Daniel DayLewis was in this film REALLY HELPS... because I think he's absolutely fabulous! I don't think I've ever seen a crappy movie with him in it!  The fact that Jim Sheridan was responsible for this and the fact that I thought In The Name of The Father  The Boxer were absolutely superb films despite how aggravating the scenarios were in the films... but thats just what made them fantastic... the fact that they were so realistic and gave you some incite of what the hell goes on in Ireland! Take it from Sheridan... someone who is Irish... don't let some Hollywood piece of rubbish tell you a bunch of fallacies.  The fact that Sheridan uses nontraditional actorsactresses in his films also adds to the realism. And the fact that Daniel DayLewis isn't overrated and the man can actually ACT and by his stunning performance in this film I was really blown away by him.  I fully understand why he had gotten the Academy award that year and the same goes for the woman who played his mother.The story of Christy Brown was told in a very tasteful informative compassionate  nonexploitive way.  It is a triumphant story of his accomplishments... and I also being an artist... and having epilepsy and the fact my medication gives me tremors I have an extremely hard time doing my artwork... but Christy... made me feel like I was being lazy!  His artwork was beautiful... It made me happy! It was so aesthetically pleasing... and so personal.  I would love to read his writings to get a better incite on him.Another individual I became interested in after watching the film based on his accomplishments is the pianist David Helgoft. The movie Shine was based on him and Geoffrey Rush was EXCELLENT in that as well. Both films were as good as one another... and I would definitely suggest that to anyone who liked My Left Foot.Rating 1010".

The direction is superb the script never feels rushed and the wistful tone of someone looking back to their yesterdays to get on with their today is rare in its realisation of artistic vision.There's no big finale but that's not to say that the conclusion is anything less than perfect in its mood and its timing. A literate film that is there to relish on a quiet afternoon Flashbacks of a Fool feels more typical of a book by Ian McEwan though thankfully it bears little in common to the cinematic version of Atonement than a film starring the current Bond.

The person that's got everything has nothing and this movie kind of explains one way of looking at it in my opinion.In a materialistic influenced world we live in it can be easy to fall into how believing happiness and wellbeing comes only from having all the things wealth can bring i.e. the clean cut minimalist house walking out onto the white sand overlooking a beautiful serene sea a selection of gleaming new sports cars the tailored clothes etc etc. But I guess for some people who have reached this placegoal in their life have focused on the goal so much that they've forgotten where they've come from and what they may have been running from.Now what this gem of a movie does is carefully and meticulously unravel the story of a troubled man in this very situation dealing with the daemons of his past the spontaneous difficult decisions he had to make as a boy which has carved this stone cold embodiment of a man on the edge of existence.Now I'm not going to break down and dissect this film and give a whole rundown on how and why I think this is a great movie but I will say this. The story of a nasty main character amazing job from both Daniel Craig and Harry Eden and showing the world that he lives in and lived in by slowly letting the viewer past his metaphorical protective wall while allowing the viewer to piece together how and why he is the way he is is presented exquisitely.I don't want to give anything away on the plot and story but I have to say there where two parts that absolutely blew me away and I'll just give you a vague hint. One involving a shot of artwork with intention of displaying a contrast of relation between the background and foreground giving an artistic viewpoint on the real subject matter works on so many levels and the other being a close up shot which encapsulated a lot of emotion and made my heart just drop.all in all the whole production was done well especially the editing even though it's obviously apparent they had some great content to work with and did for me what all great stories do kept me entertained through demanding my full attention and rewarding that attention in the form of an emotional rollercoaster.Last note please try not to second guess while trying to predict what's coming next and how it ends. Just enjoy the story that is being told because it's been executed very well.PS I would have given this a 10 but wanted other readers to take this review seriously as I do love the art of storytelling especially a good movie and it's unfortunate that there's too many marketing teams pushing up star ratings here on IMDb.Thanks for reading my first review and I hope you enjoy Flashbacks of a Fool as much as I did.".

The film was not what i expected at all. I was expecting a load of drug taking scenes and thought the whole film would have a dirty feel to it such as Blow or Pulp Fiction but it actually turned out to be a very sensitive film. I was moved by the emotional story of this guy's messed up childhood. I was extremely impressed by Claire Forlani's performance even though she's not in the film for that long. This film will give you goosebumps and a trembling lip from the emotional rollercoaster that is this Flashbacks Of A Fool. Good film. Girls in their 30s to late 40s will prefer it to guys. Great 70s Soundtrack and that's coming from me a 23 year old! The soundtrack album should be really good.Thanks for devoting 2 minutes of your life to read this! I really appreciate it.".

There was something incredible for me in the way the whole film was shot but especially the flashbacks to the seaside  it awoke something for me from that era that I had forgotten about from my childhood and I found it strangely comforting. Not that I grew up near the sea but it struck a chord deep inside. How great to be able to capture something so brilliantly and bring it to life for others. I am envious of Baillie WALSH for this but thank God for him also. I look forward to seeing what else can be done.Daniel CRAIG was stunning in the role and brought it to life by showing us something we haven't seen in him too often  the saddernastier character  although his physique was maybe a little too perfect to make the decadent fast living hedonistic junkie completely believable  although I will forgive him for this! Harry EDEN who played the young Joe showed us all the awkwardness of youth and adolescence along with the desperation to grow up and all it's pitfalls. He was stunning on screen and oozed fragility. I would have liked to see the link showing how young Joe became an actor but understand there is a limit to how long a film can reasonably be.Similarly to NOTES ON A SCANDAL and THE MOTHER  this for me was the kind of film that I could enjoy over and over and each time still feel that I am a seeing something I shouldn't  like a secret  and watching every delicious moment without being noticed myself.".

FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL suggests by its title that the story may be different that there may be some redemption at the core of an abusive life. Writerdirector Baillie Walsh sets his story in opening frames of intense sexual drug accompanied debauchery.

A wealthy Hollywood star whose lifestyle has hastened his aging Joe is 'managed' by the stern Ophelia Eve who is tiring of Joe's wasted lifestyle. Her warnings as well as Joe's agent's confrontation that Joe is too old looking for a new screenplay is compounded by a telephone call that Joe's boyhood friend Boots Max Deacon has suddenly died leaving Joe's old first girlfriend Ruth Claire Forlani an early widow.

At the request of Joe's mother Olivia Williams he flies back to England where he is forced to confront the early damage he caused in the lives of his family and friends. Daniel Craig and Harry Eden are excellent in their mirrored roles of the young and the older Joe. In fact there is not a weak member of this fine British cast. Though the story takes place in England the film was shot in South Africa cinematographer John Mathieson and the rickety beach houses on the small bay where Boots and Joe spend their time is picturesque and adds the right sense of isolation to the story. At 114 minutes the film goes on a bit too long with areas for editing a bit too obvious. But the overall effect of FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL is a satisfying journey through a memory that holds a light to the incidents of youth that can alter too many lives if not mended. Grady Harp".

The SA location fooled me completely and looked great. A refreshing change from the usual gritty rowhouse environment in which many British movies of this type are set. The film Wish You Were Here pushes similar buttons as this flick. Loved Ruth's 1970's wardrobe and the arcade that was apparently the center of life for these teens back in the day. Loved the director's economy of actors. Most others would have had that arcade FILLED with extras cluttering up the scene. But in a memory are there any extras?".

	schema:reviewBody "How far do our decisions in life take us and how long do we eventually live by the ripples that such choices create? Flashbacks of a Fool the debut feature from writer and director Ballie Walsh takes it upon itself to divulge in such questions and the answers that it gives although extremely simplified and a little underwhelming in scope nevertheless pack a resounding and emotional punch. Taking its time to develop rounded characters that stay within the confines of real life whilst managing to retain a sense of compelling relevancy the feature tells a story that most audiences should be able to take something from. Sure it sometimes moves at a snail's pace and suffers from an extremely incoherent third act yet despite the movie's biggest problems it's the things that Walsh does right that makes Flashbacks such an enjoyable drama for anyone that likes to explore the darker sides of human desire.A story with three distinct crudely sewn together acts Flashbacks of a Fool tells the story of a hasbeen actor now spending most of his days drinking doing drugs and paying women to sleep with him. Opening with current day Joe Scott Daniel Craig the movie introduces us to the waster in a very poignant and effective first act that details Joe's incessant need for indulgence at the expense of everyone around him. This in turn then sets up the real meat of the story which in turn is set a good twenty or thirty years in the past back in Joe's teenage years. Through this lens we observe Joe as he chooses the paths that eventually lead to the character we have so far been introduced to. Of course we know instinctively where it's all going to go and Walsh's script sometimes gets caught up in details involving this development but in turn it is these details that give Flashbacks its heart and soul.The details I'm referring to of course are little things called characters Walsh makes sure to keep Flashbacks of a Fool rich in characterization by using only a minimum ensemble. Through this the film manages to convey both the character of Joe and his decisions in an objective light we see the decisions he makes and the people that those decisions affect most of the time without him realizing. Coming full circle with a scene that capitalizes on the real selfish nature of both his and another character's choices the movie achieves its resonating moment of poignancy through a death that is built upon drawing tears. From here on in Flashbacks never quite reaches the same height and the pacing and overall structure is bothersome particularly during a mostly useless third act which staples itself to act two as a kind of conclusion that fails to offer much if any resolution.Such is Flashbacks of a Fool's biggest problem its framing and structure. Although each segment is finely told and expertly shot the script always comes across as being informant but incoherently so. As a result the middle act never truly feels connected to the two that bookmark it and obviously certain characterisation is null and negated as a consequence. The performances from Craig and standout Harry Eden who plays Joe as a teenager are solid enough and play to the same grounding personality traits to offer a sense of progression from A to B yet the script's slapped together and undeveloped feel often distracts away from these highlights. Nevertheless with a wonderful ensemble cast mostly comprising of minorstar English talents Flashbacks isn't just a powerful and relevant story told with three dimensional characters the cast themselves embody their personas effectively and with great consistency at least until the third act. But then again you can't blame them for getting confused with such a massive leap in narrative.Perhaps one of the standout features of the film however lies in its aesthetic design. From the magnificent onlocation settings to the retro costumes cinematographer John Mathieson has the wonderful job here of capturing it all as best as he can and that he does. Not only does he frame his wideangle establishing shots with a serene sense of natural beauty but there are also many instances of remarkable angles lens effects and framings of much closer shots that embody similar moods evoking both emotion towards the characters on screen and at the same time capturing moments usually punctuated with a song from the nostalgic soundtrack with much needed simplicity. And yet this is essentially what Flashbacks of a Fool comes down to it's simplicity. Detailing the paths of a young man and how he came to be the wasted indulgent hasbeen that he is Flashbacks is a simple but highly compelling and emotive tale about humanity our desires choices and companions that travel with us along the way. It may not be a smooth journey by any means but it's got enough heart to make it a memorable and rewarding one.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Imagine the effect of what he and Evelyn were doing when her daughter died as he was growing up? Would that have messed him up about sex and forming close human relationships i.e. when he does someone dies? He should have been with Ruth but he was taken advantage of by Evelyn and wasn't old enough to make the right decision. As it happened the innocence all came to an abrupt halt and he never got a chance. I thought Harry Eden did a fantastic job a boy on the brink of becoming a man but just so so innocent albeit mixed with some flashes of the more selfish Joe to come. We didn't see what happened to Joe in between the time he ran away and the grown up Joe  we can only surmise. I loved the cinematography of the flashback the soft summer light inside the house the use of sea waves to link 70s England with modern L.A. The Roxy Music lipsync was worth the price of the ticket alone. The ending was a bit abrupt but I think it worked. It was painful to watch Ruth cry finally.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to love this film. I liked the concept the fact that it was a personal film to the cast and crew and the underhype that was going on about it  Brit film at its best perhaps. To be honest I didn't love it. I maybe liked it in some parts enjoyed it but certainly didn't find it the soulachingly poignant drama I think perhaps it was meant to be.If I'm honest I think that maybe too much attention was paid to the cinematography of the piece and that maybe Baillie Walsh's previous career directions affected the finished article  the opening sequence was more like Tales of the Unexpected than a feature film and I think a couple of the songs were overused thereby lessening their effect. We all have a soundtrack to our life but life is more than a music video which I feel this had overtones of. The 'scrambled' looking scenes and cut aways did nothing to add to the drama of the moments nor the progression of the story itself.I found it watchable but I think had there been slightly more meat on the bones of the script it would've been vastly improved. The performances of the actors were on the whole outstanding and without such convincing characters this film would've been a disaster hence the reason I gave this a 6 and not a lower score.Would I watch it again  probably not.

	onyx:emotionText "I really wanted to love this film. I liked the concept the fact that it was a personal film to the cast and crew and the underhype that was going on about it  Brit film at its best perhaps. To be honest I didn't love it. I maybe liked it in some parts enjoyed it but certainly didn't find it the soulachingly poignant drama I think perhaps it was meant to be.If I'm honest I think that maybe too much attention was paid to the cinematography of the piece and that maybe Baillie Walsh's previous career directions affected the finished article  the opening sequence was more like Tales of the Unexpected than a feature film and I think a couple of the songs were overused thereby lessening their effect. We all have a soundtrack to our life but life is more than a music video which I feel this had overtones of. The 'scrambled' looking scenes and cut aways did nothing to add to the drama of the moments nor the progression of the story itself.I found it watchable but I think had there been slightly more meat on the bones of the script it would've been vastly improved. The performances of the actors were on the whole outstanding and without such convincing characters this film would've been a disaster hence the reason I gave this a 6 and not a lower score.Would I watch it again  probably not. Would I heartily recommend it to a friend  probably not. Why? Not because I think it's a terrible film just because its only a tenth of the film it could've been.";

And that is what this movie seems to want to convey.There are gaps in the plotting and unexplained situations but that is more the norm in books and movies than most people would like to admit. That is why we depend on such things as emotion good music good cinematography etc. to smooth over those rough edges and that is what we get here.Some scenes are so memorable that they would be difficult to ever forget especially the scene where young Joe dances as the girl he wants to date sings. You can see that this is a wonderful moment for both of them. Unfortunately it is spoiled by subsequent events. But in the end there is redemption of a kind.There is not really much more to say without spoiling the movie except that I highly recommend this movie.

Second surprise is a very extended Flashback which turns out to cover the majority of the story. The young adulthood drama in this Flashback is full of teenage love and dreams and utter drama. But it's done so well it's a sheer pleasure to follow. Harry Eden is very convincing as a young Craig and Felicity Jones as the young Ruth is just spraying her youth and confidence all over the screen. Olivia Williams excels as a warm and caring mother so does the rest of the cast cover their parts in a more than convincing manner. I very much enjoyed this movie. It's a Flashback that might actually take you back to your own teenage dreams some 20 years ago too.".

Its a clich tale thats been done before in one way or another. The film is a very well made and extremely well acted especially by Daniel Craig who proves yet again he's probably the best of any actor who's played James Bond.The problem here is the script which takes way too long to get going. Its almost a full half hour before we begin the hour long center section of the film that explains in part why things are they way they are. As well done as it is it isn't anything we haven't seen before and once we returned to the present I kind of had a feeling how bits of the last half hour would play out. Its not a bad film but it is yet again another one thats good enough to make you wish that it was better.".

It was a time when everything was black and white. This movie does what movies are supposed to do  to make you dream and think and feel about our experiences on earth. Like great dreams you may not fully understand them until you reflect and see it again.First time I saw this at the SF Film Fest was a 1989 preview. Ten minutes into it the projector shut down. We apologize but we started with the second reel first. We don't have enough time to show it now but check back for a reschedule. Talk about feeling confused and having low expectations with other films to see for some reason I came back I suppose to get my money's worth. Maybe it put the hook in me. So it opens with a dreamlike child's instrument playing and stock footage of a circus entertainer putting his head in a canon holding a torch to the fuse  all playing in reverse cycles. The film challenges you deceptively with old film tricks but they are well thought out. A modern director would plod epic beginning  Edison's first public display of electric light. Enyedi as light as a snowflake directs us to the first magnificent scene set at night. People in period 1880's clothing see light bulbs for the first time. Playing Stars and Stripes a band marches forward mostly Negroes lit up powered by a following horsedrawn cart holding Edison's sinister sounding generator. Electricity! With creative liberties the director swiftly takes us from New Jersey to Hungary where twins are born to sell matches in the night snow only to be driven away by a constable. They huddle to strike a flame curious innocent faces are brightened. Matches! The director uses the spark of these twins as two different female natures to advance us into the birth of the twentieth century. A must see for anyone who values cinema.".

Identical twin girls are separated when they are young and follow different paths in life. One is sensuous and beautiful and becomes a highly paid courtesan. The other one is less attractive and becomes an anarchist revolutionary. The lovely actor Dorota Segda plays both roles. It's amazing what makeup costuming and good acting can accomplish. You accept her as two different people.However beyond the potentially interesting plot concept and the good acting by the Ms. Segda there's nothing worthwhile that I could find in this movie. We hear talking angels a donkey wanders through there's a dog with electrodes in his head and Thomas Edison repeatedly asks the crowd to hush so he can make his pompous announcements. Even a helicopter makes a brief cameo appearance.Some IMDb reviewers have found this film beautiful. Others have found it profoundly symbolic. I'm not sure they watched the same movie that I watched. We saw the film at home. There's no real scenic grandeur so my guess is that it wouldn't work any better on the large screen. It wouldn't work any better in color. It would probably work just as well without subtitles. Maybe better. My Twentieth Century is a waste of time. Avoid it.".

	schema:reviewBody "EVEN THE RAIN Tambin la lluvia is a brilliant metaphor of a story written by Paul Laverty based on an actual event and directed with considerable skill by Icar Bollan the great Spanish actress writer and director. This film is one of those rare 'docudramas' that bring to light historical 'secrets' that beg to be shared. In 2000 an American water company bought the water supply from the Bolivian government and the citizens of Bolivia were banned from collecting rainwater which had become corporate property. This resulted in a violent protest against the government by the indigenous Indians and the citizenry of Cochambamba Bolivia who claimed their rights to the natural gifts of nature  even the rain. Laverty and Bollan expose this injustice through a wellconceived story within a story. Spanish film director Sebastin Gael Garca Bernal his cynical producer Costa Luis Tosar and crew including Antn Karra Elejalde have come to Cochabamba Bolivia to shoot their film about Christopher Columbus played by actor Antn  Karra Elejalde and his first explorations revealing the way the Spaniards treated the native Indians Costa has chosen the place because he can get cheap labor in using local actors and extras to keep within the small budget of the film. Sebastin is the compassionate one who wants the Indians treated well hiring a mouthy young Indian named HatueyDaniel Juan Carlos Aduviri when he claims he and his family are being unjustly overlooked as actor candidates. The filming goes well with the exception of some minor glitches for particular scenes the Indians find too dangerous until a conflict develops over the governmental privatization of the water supply. Daniel becomes an activist against the government who plan a 300 increase in price of water  the average daily income for the Indians is 2. a day!  and the conditions in the city become unfriendly for the film to continue. Bloody violence and chaos breakout and many citizens are being killed or jailed. It is at this point that the caring Sebastin finally decides that he and his crew must flee and with some role reversal Costa stays behind to protect Daniel's family. According to Bollan 'It was the gold 500 years ago and now it's the water which is the gold of the 21st century. Before it was the Crown of Spain and the pope who approved the conquest. Now it is the new theologians the IMF and the World Bank. Again it's the word from above saying 'This is right.' The Spanish filmmakers in the filmwithinafilm are caught in the middle. They have the attitude of neoconquerors  they go there because it's cheap. But they're also trying to make a film that casts a different look on the conquest. And it's an adventure.' Iciar Bollan directs this epic film with great dignity and with a keen observation of how history even inadvertently repeats itself. The cinematography by Alex Cataln and the musical score by Alberto Iglesias add immeasurably to the film's success. The cast of extras is exceptional and very well directed. Both Gael Garca Bernal and Luis Tosar deliver intensely considered performances as does Juan Carlos Aduviri as the key central figure Daniel. Hopefully this film nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2010 Academy Awards. In Spanish with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "EVEN THE RAIN Tambin la lluvia is a brilliant metaphor of a story written by Paul Laverty based on an actual event and directed with considerable skill by Icar Bollan the great Spanish actress writer and director. This film is one of those rare 'docudramas' that bring to light historical 'secrets' that beg to be shared. In 2000 an American water company bought the water supply from the Bolivian government and the citizens of Bolivia were banned from collecting rainwater which had become corporate property. This resulted in a violent protest against the government by the indigenous Indians and the citizenry of Cochambamba Bolivia who claimed their rights to the natural gifts of nature  even the rain. Laverty and Bollan expose this injustice through a wellconceived story within a story. Spanish film director Sebastin Gael Garca Bernal his cynical producer Costa Luis Tosar and crew including Antn Karra Elejalde have come to Cochabamba Bolivia to shoot their film about Christopher Columbus played by actor Antn  Karra Elejalde and his first explorations revealing the way the Spaniards treated the native Indians Costa has chosen the place because he can get cheap labor in using local actors and extras to keep within the small budget of the film.

The film they are working on proposes to depict Christopher Columbus' exploitation of the indigenous native population in his voyage to the Americas and the effort of two priests to stand up to the Catholic Church. Written by Paul Laverty the regular screenwriter for British director Ken Loach and dedicated to the late progressive historian Howard Zinn Iciar Bollain's openly political drama Even the Rain takes on the past history of exploitation of native populations showing a parallel to current history.The film developed through Laverty's desire to dramatize the life of Bartolom de las Casas a Dominican friar who becomes an antislavery activist in defiance of the church and his native Spain. Shot in the high Andes because of budgetary constraints Even the Rain attempts to conflate three levels of exploitation the historical treatment of the Native Americans by the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century the actual attempt by Bolivia to cede control of the country's water supply to a BritishAmerican corporation and the filmmakers' costcutting that results in the Quechua population being paid only 2.00 an hour as extras.Opening with a La Dolce Vita shot of a wooden crucifix being transported to the mountains by helicopter the film moves to an open casting call in Cochabamba as hundreds of Bolivians line up to audition for a role in the projected film. Turned away by the producer when the quota of locals is filled Daniel Juan Carlos Aduviri a vocal political activist demands that the Bolivians be hired even after they are told to leave. As a result of his strong personality he is selected to play the role of Hatuey the first Indian to be crucified for resisting the Spanish and Christian empire.A problem arises however when Daniel becomes the leader of a local group protesting the social injustice entailed in Bolivia's privatization of its own water supply a true event that forbade the native population from collecting their own rainwater. Even after Daniel tells him You don't understand water is life Costa demands that the young actor give up his political campaign to concentrate on the film which needs him desperately. As the director Sebastian likewise must walk a thin line between balancing his ideals with his powerful desire to present a revisionist history of Columbus to the world. The protests will be forgotten but the film will last forever he argues.Tosar is outstanding as the arrogant producer who is drawn unwillingly into the political protest. Overheard on a phone call Costa brusquely tells a foreign investor how he is putting one over on the locals not realizing that Daniel standing only a few feet away from him speaks English. Eventually however Costa is forced to choose between the success of the film and the demands of his conscience staring at him relentlessly.Even the Rain tells us that understanding the past is meaningless unless that knowledge can be made relevant to the present day a lesson that the characters must learn the hard way. In lesser hands the film could easily have become didactic or preachy but Bollain maintains a steady hand and the result is an engaging and powerful film that not only speaks out loudly against injustice but does so with poetry and passion.".

The production company hits a snag when locally violent demonstrations breakout against corporate ownership of indigenous water rights and threaten to make the completion of the film impossible.

Demonstrations erupted when Aguas del Tunari imposed a large rate increase reportedly to finance a Dam project a week after taking control of the Cochabamba water supply system. In a country where the minimum wage was less than US70 per month many dwellers were hit with monthly water bills of 20 or more. Starting in early January 2000 massive protests in Cochabamba began with Oscar Olivera among the most outspoken leaders against the rate hikes and subsequent water cutoffs.

Young men began to try to take over the plaza and a barricade across incoming roadways was set up. Soon they were joined by pieceworkers sweatshop employees and street vendors . Anarchists from the middleclasses came from the University of Cochabamba to denounce the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and neoliberalism. The strongest supporters of the demonstration were drawn from the city's growing population of homeless street children .Protesters were able to halt Cochabamba's economy by holding a general strike that shut down the city for four straight days. A ministerial delegation went to Cochabamba and agreed to roll back the water rates still the demonstration continued.On February 4 2000 thousands marching in protest were met by troops and law enforcement . Almost 200 demonstrators were arrested 70 protesters and 51 policemen were injured.Throughout March 2000 the Bolivian hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church tried to mediate between the government and the demonstrators. In the meantime the Coordinadora made their own referendum and declared that out of fifty thousand votes 96 demanded the contract with Aguas del Tunari be cancelled. The government's reply under Hugo Banzer was that There is nothing to negotiate.In April 2000 demonstrators again took over Cochabamba's central plaza. When the leaders of the Coordinadora went to a meeting with the governor at his office they were arrested. Though they were released the following day some fearing further government action fled into hiding. More demonstration leaders were arrested with some being transferred to a jungle prison in San Joaquin a remote town in the Amazon rain forest on the border with Brazil. The demonstrations spread quickly to other areas including La Paz Oruro and Potos as well as rural areas. The protesters also expanded their demands calling on the government to resolve unemployment and other economic problems.Soon demonstrators had most of the major highways in Bolivia barricaded. The protest even inspired officers in four La Paz police units to refuse to leave their barracks or obey superiors until a wage dispute was settled.The motion picture is originally directed by Iciar Bollain .

It's frustrating when a film is almost amazing because you are reminded of what it was not.But also what it is which is pretty thrilling and clever.First the contemporary setting is based quite closely on the true events of local Bolivians in the third largest city of the country Cochabamba fighting for rights to their own water supply. A private EuroU.S. firm has cornered water rights and when the locals try to use their own handmade supply system the police come and interfere. It's maddening to the point of anger on both sides of the screen. In a way this local uprising against injustice is the movie the core of the events.But what makes it actually fabulous is the way it told through the eyes and cameras of a large film crew working on a movie about Christopher Columbus arriving on the shores of America and mistreating the natives. Yes a parallel that is obvious but handled with dramatic aplomb. There are many moments showing the shooting of the film and it transports the viewer instantly and beautifully to the Columbus events which are epic in their own way. But the characters are part professional actors from other countries and part local and underpaid extras some of whom are involved in the water protests when not filming.So there are several layers of action tightly interwoven. The disdain and fear of some of the outsiders is believable the man playing Columbus Karra Elejalde is amazing world weary and tough taking both sides as needed. Some of the circa 1500 history of resistance by the natives and even the brave defense of the natives by a Spanish priest is inspiring. And the way it still applies 500 years later 500 years! is depressing. And energizing.There are some other small problems maybe the result of editing down too much later such as the inclusion at the start of black and white video footage a documentation of the filming that you think will then become news footage or not but then it just disappears as a component of the film completely for no reason. And then the tumult of the last half hour with riots and roadblocks is great stuff really well done but so highly improbable you have to just write it off to generous screen writing. We aren't really able to believe the wholehearted change of attitude of the producer played with intensity by Luis Tosar but it makes for great interpersonal and sympathetic dramatics. And finally the director of the movie within the movie is played by the ever beautiful Gael Garcia Bernal but in fact he's too weak and thoughtful a type to be directing this sprawling and frankly unmanageable movie about Columbus. But these objections actually only came up for me later thinking back. While immersed I was really immersed and impressed. It's an ambitious smart and pertinent movie with great and enjoyable complexity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have i been so hesitant on how to judge a movie  it seems at the same time exceptionally good and rather weak both with respect to it artistic form and its political content.Regarding the content as mentioned by several commentators a guiding theme of the movie is to make you feel and understand in which ways not much changed about the oppression of the South of the world by the North and of First Nations by immigrants to the new world and even more importantly that for bettering this it's not enough for the average European to just be good and help the poor because that merely leads to the paternalistic and condescending behaviour shown by the film's protagonists towards their indigenous workers. In short the depiction of the dialectics of oppression privilege and solidarity  in particular the voluntary cheap incomplete kind of solidarity  is relentless and far above average.On the other hand the supposed topics of the movie are hardly even touched I learnt a lot more about the Cochabamba water war from the user comments here on IMDb than from the film itself it doesn't really explain what that war was all about. There is a bit more material about Columbus De las Casas and their time but it's all fragmentary symbolist and doesn't form a coherent picture as it would be needed to really understand anything about history.Regarding the artistic form i'd call this Epic Theatre in the Brecht'ian sense as flabbergasting as that may seem in our postmodern times Not only by the fact that the plot of the movie is turning a movie but by many other details as well the spectator is frequently made aware the she is watching a play. To name just one example People read from historical letters then actually go on to comment why they read from those letters and propose interpretations of the text just like Brecht's chorus. Or imagine in a movie actors telling the stage director There are more important things than turning a movie  and walking away from the scene. Fragmentation techniques interruptions contrast and contradiction all these defamiliarizing elements of Epic Theatre abound and even elements of the typical simplistic and abstract scenic design can be found in some parts of the movie in the movie. The overall effect is intense this is certainly exceptionally artful very unusual and worth seeing. Unfortunately there are several artistic defects as well. Most of the characters are rather schematic and not very convincing in particular in their change and development and some turns of the plot seem contrived and artificial. Even worse the Epic elements are not used for their proper purpose which is making the audience think deeply understand the social conditions at hand and critically reflect them. Sure the alienating effect is sufficient to make you aware that you are watching an explicitly political movie  but as i said information is missing to really understand and reflect the alleged topics. You are merely left in diffuse indignation about the injustice of the world with some equally vague hints that it's both possibly to individually oppose and collectively fight injustice. That alone is not news really the depiction of both options is neither very convincing nor in any way specific.Altogether i deem the movie far from perfect as a work of art but it is so diverse in its content and form that there are certainly many ways to view it and more than one aspect that's worth seeing. Thus i recommend you see for yourself i don't think your time will be wasted.".

This film taught me how people in other parts of the world are living today and that people do not have the things that we take for granted all time.

	schema:headline " Good film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought that the most interesting part about this film was how there were truly three different stories taking place for the most part irrelevant to each other. The story of the water crisis in Bolivia which launched the protest the filming process and the actual plot of the film being made which was about the Bolivians. I think that an important aspect of the film was how drastically the two main characters changed! Sebastien and Costa were generally pretty selfish regarding their film they were making. However I think towards the end Sebastien began to understand that sometimes life is more important than a film! When Costa explained to him that he had to go the hospital to try and save the little girl instead of finishing the film I think it really opened Sebastien's eyes as he would've been out of place and selfish to try and stop him from saving a life. I also think that a good and worthy discussion topic for this film would be the bad light that was shed on the government who were taking the Bolivians' water. However I can understand both sides of the crisis although it's not fair for their water to be taken away it is the only rational option. If there is a water shortage I think the government HAS to come in and take over the situation because ultimately they are trying to do what is best for everyone and the people of Bolivia alone could not manage the water crisis since it's such a huge and fragile job. At the beginning of this film I didn't really like it because I was a bit lost and confused as to what was going on and why there seemed to be multiple different stories taking place. Then the film grew on me and I started to understand what was going on. Also as the film went on for me it got more interesting and more action started to happen. This film also put into perspective once again how lucky we are to have been born in countries such as the U.S or in my case Canada! For the most part we have all the resources we need in order to survive and do not have to worry about whether or not we will be allowed or denied access to a basic survival need like water. I feel so lucky not to be somewhere like Bolivia because I cannot imagine the stress and trauma the Bolivians go through just fighting for water! To us water is a simple thing and is available at all times. What do you think you would do if we got our water suddenly taken away from us? What do you think Americans in general would do? Do you think they'd start a big protest like the Bolivians?".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not expect this film to be the way that it is. I expected the film to be about only water and potentially a water crisis. I never expected that Christopher Columbus would be involved. I did enjoy the fact that they placed in parallels between the film about Christopher Columbus and the Bolivian Water Crisis. Overall I really enjoyed the film. I found it strange that there was no clear bad guy in the movie. In most American films there is a good guy and a bad guy. Mostly the good guy wins. In this film everyone seemed to be both good and bad. The native people were fighting for their water but they also attacked people before they were attacked. The water company that was coming in was helping the people to get water but it also charged a great deal of money to the people. The government had to outsource the water making the people angry but if the government hadn't done so the people would have no water at all. Also just like Christopher Columbus came into America and exerted his power over the natives so do others.

Also the production team working on the movie comes in and imposes themselves on the people. They pay them only two dollars a day while the rest of the crew lives in a highly expensive hotel.

	onyx:emotionText "I did not expect this film to be the way that it is. I expected the film to be about only water and potentially a water crisis. I never expected that Christopher Columbus would be involved. I did enjoy the fact that they placed in parallels between the film about Christopher Columbus and the Bolivian Water Crisis. Overall I really enjoyed the film. I found it strange that there was no clear bad guy in the movie. In most American films there is a good guy and a bad guy. Mostly the good guy wins. In this film everyone seemed to be both good and bad. The native people were fighting for their water but they also attacked people before they were attacked. The water company that was coming in was helping the people to get water but it also charged a great deal of money to the people. The government had to outsource the water making the people angry but if the government hadn't done so the people would have no water at all. Also just like Christopher Columbus came into America and exerted his power over the natives so do others.

	schema:reviewBody "Films like this break my heart. I could see the point the end goal of the film. And yet a series of mistakes screws the whole point up and what you're left with is a heavily flawed film with moments of potential. And so comes Tambin la lluvia Even the Rain Spain's official entry for Best Foreign Film of the 2010 Academy Awards.The film centers around a production of a movie about Christopher Columbus like we really need another one in Bolivia in the year 2000. Costa Luis Tosar aka the bad guy from Miami Vice is the pennypinching producer of the flick while Sebastian Gael Garcia Bernal just for you ladies is the artistic director determined to make the best film ever. They end up casting the hardworking Indian Daniel Juan Carlos Aduviri as the legendary Hatuey native who first defied the Spanish conquerors. But as the two filmmakers learn Daniel is one of the leaders of the disgruntled native population in Cochabamba Bolivia who are beginning to make their moves to protest the multinational interference with the city's water supply. Thus the film's production is put into conflict with the 2000 Cochabamba Water Wars.First I'll get the positives out of the way the film is wonderfully shot against the Bolivian countryside and the film does an excellent job of capturing the chaos and build up that led to a very violent and very real protest in Latin American history. Bernal Tosar and Aduviri all turn in great performances with what they are given. But they're not given much to work with because the script has no idea what it's trying to do. A good portion of the film is dedicated to the rehearsals and stage setup of the Columbus film while another portion is dedicated to the building up of tensions regarding the control of water in the city. As a result you barely get time to know the three leads who time and time again change their motivations.Sebastian wants to tell a Columbus story even though he himself is hellbent on filming a particular scene involving Franciscan missionaries arguing about enslaving natives and another scene involving Hatuey's moment of infamy. In other words the film's focus ends up changing completely. Costa is heavily concerned with the film's budget that he purposefully has the film shot in Bolivia to get cheap native labor and extras. However he begins to grow a conscious when he offends Daniel that he is offering dirt money for all his hard work. Then he goes to right back to pennypinching to make the film. Finally Daniel looks like he is concerned over his daughter's welfare but he ends up carelessly getting hurt during the protests that also end up deeply injuring his daughter.I could see where the film ultimately wanted to go. It wanted to show how after 500 years Latin American natives are still being brutally oppressed by foreigners and are being used for cheap labor to further the foreigners' own purposes. But the film never gets to that point. It's too busy showing the Columbus film's production and the conflicts among the actors. We are treated to many scenes involving the actors bickering among themselves and about the socialpolitical situation. As a result we have even less time to develop the other leads' stories. I say leads because not one actor in my opinion could honestly hold title to the protagonist since we keep following several character arcs that ultimately are never resolved. Also some minor characters turn in some awful performances when their characters are needed to push some important plot points. Worst of all the leads make some crucial decisions that have no set up to explain why they would behave in a certain way. As a result the audience is left puzzling why they would act in that way. That being said the film is thankfully short at 103 minutes and I can't say I was bored during its runtime.Even the Rain desperately wants to make a connection between modern day exploitation of indigenous Latin Americans and the historical slavery of said indigenous cultures when the Spaniards came. The lead actors turn in great performances with what they are given and some great cinematography is used. It starts out meaning to say something but like Bernal's young director it doesn't know what to focus on and ends up not being able to say anything at all.".

Of course its neo imperialism that raises its ugly head to show that the sins of the past are very much in evidence today as the 'natives' are still fighting for their land and their water against the crushing power of multi national 'free market' companies seeking to expropriate their natural resources with the help of corrupt local politicians.

	schema:reviewBody "I think that Even the Rain was a very inspirational film. It educated the viewer about Christopher Columbus and Bartolom Las Casas. I enjoyed this film because the water crisis in Bolivia correlated with the Spanish Conquering of the Natives. The Bolivian revolt led by Daniel started because the government of Bolivia wanted to increase the taxes on water because it was too cheap to obtain. This triggered the Bolivians because they do not make enough money to afford a tax raise on water. Daniel who is a rebellious person by nature leads the revolts and also plays a major role in the movie that Sebastin and Costa are filming. Daniel ends up getting beaten up and arrested nearly ruining the entire movie production. Later in this film Costa realizes how important the water or yaku crisis is to the local Bolivians. It was very impactful to see Costa evolve during this film. He started off as a rude character who didn't care about the local Bolivians or the Native Americans. But by the end of the movie he was willing to risk his life for the Daniel's daughter Beln. Another theme of this movie was how the characters of the movie like Christopher Columbus and Las Casas. have different views on how to treat the Bolivians correlating with their roles in the movie. For example a Las Casas supported the Native Americans which meant that he also supported the Bolivians. Columbus on the other hand was the conqueror of the Natives so he did not really care about the Bolivian Water Crisis throughout the movie. This was proved at the dinner when all the characters talked about Yaku or water and their roles in the movie. Overall this film really opened my eyes to all of the prejudice and lack of common daily resources in Central and South America.".

The film itself sort of has a similar take with the fact that the film crew is Spanish and they are coming into a foreign country and completely ignore the current life if those who are already there. I also liked the evolution of Costa one of the lead producersdirectors. In the beginning he starts off as a very negative and ignorant character towards the Bolivians and their water crisis and just wants to film the movie. In the end of the movie he shifts to a more compassionate character that decides that the safety of those in the riots and the wellbeing of the crew is far more important than the movie he is filming. On the other hand his partner Sebastian shifts from what Costa becomes to what Costa was. In the end all he cares about is the finishing of the movie what scenes they have the money they're going to make etc.".

I also liked the evolution of Costa one of the lead producersdirectors. In the beginning he starts off as a very negative and ignorant character towards the Bolivians and their water crisis and just wants to film the movie. In the end of the movie he shifts to a more compassionate character that decides that the safety of those in the riots and the wellbeing of the crew is far more important than the movie he is filming. On the other hand his partner Sebastian shifts from what Costa becomes to what Costa was. In the end all he cares about is the finishing of the movie what scenes they have the money they're going to make etc.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very complicated film to watch because there were many things occurring at the same time. It was very puzzling and there were many ideas needed to be put together in order to understand the story. Although the film was complicated it was also very fastpaced and exciting. There were many parts in the movie that really captivated me into the story  I almost felt like I was there. For instance when Costa was asked by Belen's mother to accompany her while finding Belen to save her Costa debated on whether to go or not. This scene made my classmates and me to become very nervous. Finally Costa decided to go and I was a little relieved. It is truly amazing how good movies can make the viewers feel like they're really there. It is a depressing view to see how these Bolivian people were risking their lives just to provide their children with clean water. Clean water is something most of us in the U.S. take for granted but for them it is everything. Money was bribed people rioted and people risked a lot in attempt to get clean water. This aspect of the film empowered me to think more about this topic and hopefully get involved in the future.".

The daddy of all contemporary religious instruction 1956's The Ten Commandments is blockbuster spiritual entertainment in every way shape and form as Cecil B. DeMille depicts the life of Moses from his birth to slavery to Mt. Sinai in grandiose reverential style.  And what a life!This was the first movie I ever saw at the drivein.  I was only 6 at the time but I can remember the neighbors taking me to see this snuggled up in pajamas and stuffed in the back seat.  The parting of the Red Sea waters the turning of the staff to a viperous snake the greencolored pestilence of death seeping into the homes of every firstborn the creation of the tablets the burning bush the booming narrative.  I sat in absolute silence and wonderment.  This is my first remembrance of any kind of moviemaking and the Oscarwinning visual effects and vivid pageantry are still pretty amazing even by today's standards.Charlton Heston the icon of biblical storytelling still towers over anybody who has ever TRIED to played Moses  before or since.  Stalwart and stoic to a fault he possess THE look...cut out of pages of my old religious instructions book....the look that radiates magnificence and glory...the look of a man who has definitely seen God.  His commanding stature and voice with its slow deliberate intonation is eerie and unmatched.  Yul Brynner portrays Ramses II as if he were the King of Siam in Egyptian pants. Nobody poses or plays majestic like Yul.  He's forceful regal imperious...everything a  biblical foe should be.  Anne Baxter as the tempting Nefretiri Queen of Egypt borders on total camp in her role her stylized line readings and breathy allure is laughable now with posturings and reaction shots not seen since Theda Bara.  But who cares?  Baxter provides the most fun and its her florid scenes that I now look most forward to  whether she's throwing herself at the totally disinterested Moses or verbally sparring with Ramses slyly pushing his emotional buttons.  She alone puts the k in kitsch.  The rest of the huge cast is appropriately stiff and solemn.DeMille's 1923 original version of The Ten Commandments is hardly subtle as well but still impressive and certainly worth a look.  In the 1956 remake DeMille organizes a cavalcade of thousands to lend authenticity to the massive exodus scenes while the ultimate pictureperfect frame for me is the three beautiful slave extras posing exotically and dramatically on a rock in front of a vivid bluegray backdrop of furious threatening clouds as Moses parts the sea.  That vision alone is one for the books.Whenever I am tempted to break a commandment or embrace that golden calf I know I'll always have to answer to Charlton  glaring down from Mt. Sinai ready to throw those heavy tablets at me for my transgression.  Charlton not only sets you straight he makes you BELIEVE!".

Not only that the more times you watch it you feel that you missed something the last time. Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is that kind of a movie. There have been many movies made on the topic of this Hebrew born prince of Egypt but none compare to the way in which it has been portrayed in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. There are a number of reasons for that1. When casting the role of Moses Charlton Heston was chosen above all others including Bert Lancaster not because of his knowledge of the Bible but of his striking Physical resemblance to Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses especially the facial structure not to mention the stout build of a prince.2. The sets for the film were specially designed and the splendour of ancient Egypt in all its glory was recreated especially for this movie.3. The role of Rameses II was given to Yul Brynner after DeMille observed his magnificent performance as the King of Siam in Rodgers  Hammerstein's THE KING AND I confirming that he is well suited for a stubburn and malificent heir to the Egyptian throne.It was not only Heston as Moses who made this movie a success but all the elements that came together the cast of thousands the special effectsthe costumes the sets and most of all the simply unbelievable parting of the red sea.It is a wonder why this movie only received one oscar that of the Special effects yet I think it deserved alot more. It did not even strike at the box office. Even then it never fails to enchant millions no matter what religion they follow. Movies like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and it success in the hearts of millions shows quite clearly that a movie in order to be loved by millions the world over does not necessarily have to strike gold at the box office.To watch this film you don't have to believe in God but if you believe in good triumphing over evil and freedom from slavery of foreign masters then this is the movie for you.".

Anne Baxter is Nefretiri the sensual princess who leaves her scar upon Moses' heart... Nefretiri is beautiful as a jewel and her eyes green as the Cedars of Lebanon...

Moses is 'every man' in his pride and humility in his courage and prowess in his love and hatred in his weakness and confusionin his conduct and ability...DeMille's The Ten Commandments is a moving story of the spirit of freedom rising in a man under the divine inspiration of his Maker...

Sephora couldn't fill the emptiness of Moses' heart but promised not to be jealous of the memory...John Derek is Joshua the stone cutter who is totally convinced that Moses is God's Messenger...Debra Paget plays the delicate flower who quench the thirst of the working slaves... For her the hour of deliverance will never come...Sir Cedric Hardwicke plays Sethi the mighty Pharaoh whose words to his son mark great significance Who would take a throne by force that he has earned by deeds?Nina Foch plays Bithiah pharaoh's sister who discovers the basket in which Moses has just floated down the Nile...Vincent Price plays Baka the sadistic covetous murderous whipwielding slavedriver...The Ten Commandments is filled with tremendous special effects Moses's staff turns to a snake Moses turning the Nile to blood the Passover of the Angel of Death striking all the Egyptian firstborn the tremendous pillar of fire which halts Rameses' men the Exodus from Egypt the parting of the Red Sea and the delivery of the Laws of life and right and good and evil.The relationship between God and man is the powerful drama in our world... Moses is 'every man' in his pride and humility in his courage and prowess in his love and hatred in his weakness and confusionin his conduct and ability...DeMille's The Ten Commandments is a moving story of the spirit of freedom rising in a man under the divine inspiration of his Maker... It is a remarkable spectacle with great music filled with exceptional setting and decor...";

There is a sense of nostalgia that accompanies any new viewing of this oneofakind Victorian pageant. For many I'm sure the nostalgia extends beyond the film itself.There were problems in the midfifties as in every decade since the real Moses came down from Mount Sinai. Polio the continuing menace of poverty the material and spiritual separateness of what we called colored people Communism etc. But . . . there were virtues too many reflected in the writing and performances of The Ten Commandments Virtues like courage strength of character personal honor and endurance were paramount no pun intended. The biggest problem in schools was students chewing gum in class. Today it's students shootingup in parking lots or shooting down their classmates in the halls. . . America had an identity then.DeMille's vision was always of an ideal. He painstakingly produced authentic looking packages in which to wrap his vision  embellished by the glitz of what was then the ideal Hollywood portrait Bluer than blue skies shimmering jewelencrusted costumes outsized architecture dramatically convenient thunderbolts and perfectly lovely female leads with makeup invariably and predictably unsmudged. DeMille gave his audience what they expected from an A picture. He wasn't interested in realism. His idea was to reinforce values he'd learned from his parents and his brother a noted playwright in a dramatic format which could be felt by young and old alike . . . more a reverence for timehonored principles than the analytical ironic and questioning approach dominant in the films of today. There was in the 50's and the 40's a more amicable attitude toward orthodoxy  in all its forms.

Expect that it will be visually impressive and less stagy.

	schema:reviewBody "What a fantastic movie to climax DeMille's illustrious career.Charlton Heston king of the biblical epics shines brightly as Moses the one time Egyptian Prince who now carries staff and perm in order to work Gods will and free his enslaved people from bondage.Yul Brynner in what I believe to be his finest turn before the camera plays Rameses the Pharoah who's hateful relationship with Moses spans the entire epic. He is charismatic and shows off the arrogance of a stubborn Pharoah to perfection. This is indeed a film stealing performance.The beautiful Anne Baxter is at her sultry best as Nefretiri the woman who would be queen to Rameses but a slave in love to Moses. However the character is complex and I certainly had trouble in deciding who's side she was on in this epic battle of good verses evil. In the beginning she claims not to care for Moses' discovered background and is willing to be with him no matter what however as the film progresses she does nothing but ridicule him and belittle him in true antisemitic fashion.Edward G. Robinson Vincent Price John Derek Sir Cedric Hardwicke Yvonne De Carlo Nina Foch John Carradine and Debra Paget all lend fine and memorable support to an already colourful and breathtaking experience.Incidentally it is worth mentioning that so convincing was Martha Scott in her role as Moses' mother Yochabel that she was given the chance to play Charlton Heston's mother again in the later epic BenHur.Another interesting fact is it was Charlton Heston's own voice who spoke the words of God. It was Heston's own idea that to hear God would be to feel God from within which is why he thought it would be interesting to hear His voice as his own.A remake of DeMille's earlier screen adaptation of the fine book of Exodus many can see why this film ranks as his ultimate achievement. The sets were lavish and the story handled with suitable reverence and dignity.People today often make the mistake of comparing older films like this to the modern epics of today with regards to their effects and they quite wrongly categorize them as inferior. Today anyone can create CGI images on their PC. Even my three year old daughter can make something look convincing with a mouse and a keyboard and although these effects are great people have to remember that CGI was not available in 1956.Okay there are a few obvious matte backdrops used here but to achieve the effects they did nearly fifty years ago was an outstanding and impressive feat which took talent and knowledge. I tend to look upon these effects as superior because it took the use of mans own brain to bring them about. The human brain is the best computer available yet one seldom used in todays world. So please take this on board before you slam The Ten Commandments for it's cheap and nasty look as one reviewer called it.This movie is ALMOST faultless even the length is forgivable as I was so engrossed I hardly notice the time passing.One fact that did rouse my curiosity was Moses' appearance throughout the film. I know he went to speak to God at the burning bush but did he really have to stop off at the salon on the way back? Or did God appear to Moses complete with curling tongs and hair dryer? Just a little off the top Oh Lord. And why did Moses seem to age more than everyone else? It seemed like he went from a youthful dark to everyones favourite Santa in the space of a week.This aside this film is a fantastic piece of cinema and must rate as a personal favourite of all fans of Biblical epics.".

As I grew older I came to love Brynner's fantastic performance and lust after Anne Baxter only better in All About Eve. Cedric Hardwicke Edward G. and Debra Paget Hubba Hubbaall impressed me. I was sorry Vincent Price was killed so early  what a great villain. It still demands my attention when it appears on TV. I swear I have seen it enough but if I catch a glimpse then I have to see it again!! I find it unbelievable that it won almost nothing at the Oscars. At least best Actor for Brynner and best supporting actor for Edward G.!! No costume design? No set design? No Music? A travesty!! See this if you have not already  you are in for a treat it still stands up. Long but absorbing.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was 10 years old I saw The Ten Commandments in the the theater which is the only place it really should be seen. At the time I thought it was the greatest film ever. All that splashy color cinematogaphy and eye filling spectacle. The guy that put this together is some kind of special genius. Then I grew up.Today in a lot of quarters this and other DeMille sound films are viewed as pretty high camp. Especially those that touch on a religious theme. It's that dialog and The Ten Commandments longer than any other of his films has more of it. People talking some of that high falutin' nonsense together with a good mixture of sex.What a lot of people fail to remember is that before Cecil B. DeMille came to Hollywood he was an actor and playwright on Broadway. He learned his trade at the feet of David Belasco the premier Broadway producerplaywright of his day. In that VictorianEdwardian era ALL the actors in Belasco plays especially spouted that stuff. I recall Anne Baxter saying that Moses spurned her like a strumpet. How many people do you know who use the word strumpet in their every day conversation? Or Yvonne DeCarlo saying to Charlton Heston that he Moses is God's torch to light the way to freedom and that by the way she loves him? DeMille made one great casting decision in getting the only actor who could play Moses and make it believable. This indeed was Charlton Heston's career role and as he said in his autobiography if you can't make a career out of the lead in two DeMille pictures it ain't happening. One other member of the cast Edward G. Robinson as Dathan loved this picture. Robinson had been dropping in star status since the late Forties and was now doing mostly B films. DeMille whose rightwing politics Robinson despised gave him this part and Robinson's career got a big shot in the arm. Robinson was grateful and gave him full credit in his unfinished memoirs. Most of the last half of The Ten Commandments is a running verbal battle between Heston and Robinson who is trying to keep some kind of control. Robinson is almost like the leader of a company union with the Hebrew slaves as members and Robinson sure enjoys the perks of office.The first half of the film is the sex part hovering over all the biblical jargon. DeMille used an old gambit of his two men in a rivalry over a woman. It worked in previous films like Northwest Mounted Police Reap the Wild Wind Unconquered and now here. Anne Baxter is a royal princess promised to the next Pharoah designate. But who will Sir Cedric Hardwicke designate. Charlton Heston his nephew or Yul Brynner his son? Anne Baxter has Nefretiri has both these guys hormones in overdrive. She favors Moses but then Moses gets a higher calling.Though he was no director of actors and his sense of drama was generations old DeMille was a firm believer in two things fill the screen and make the films move. 50 years later the parting of the Red Sea will still make one gasp. It's not just publicity hype when The Ten Commandments is advertised with a cast of thousands that is thousands you're seeing on that screen. Elmer Bernstein wrote the musical score for The Ten Commandments one of his first. He credited DeMille with teaching him how to write musical scores for film that underscore movement. This score brought him his first real notice as a film composer and he certainly became one of the best.Given the computer technology available today one can only imagine what Cecil B. DeMille could create today. Of course he'd insist on some of the same writing but then again without it it wouldn't be a DeMille picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "When will Paramount Pictures rerelease the 1956 movie The Ten Commandments to movie theaters? I know that the movie is shown on television and is on DVD but this epic and incredibly successful movie is meant for the theater. Besides having a great cast the movie tells a great story and tells it well. This movie will resonate with today's audience. Today's audience would enjoy watching Charlton Heston Yul Brynner Anne Baxter Yvonne De Carlo John Derek Debra Paget Edward G. Robinson and the others in the cast and would greatly enjoy the finale including the parting of the Red Sea and the creation of the actual Ten Commandments. Technologically the movie compares favorably with today's movies. Today's audience would respond favorably to the rich colors by Technicolor and to the music by Elmer Bernstein. In addition the movie will help educate a new generation about events in history that have had a profound and lasting impact on the world. It will introduce the audience to powerful and memorable characters such as Moses Ramesses Sethi Nefreteri Bithiah Aaron and Dathan as well as provide a glimpse of ancient Egypt. The scene where Moses confronts Ramesses and demands Let my people go! is iconic and will definitely make an impression on today's audience. Today's audience will appreciate Anne Baxter's powerful performance. Why keep this movie in DVD land? Let it spread its wings on the wide screen in theaters for all to marvel. Watched this movie again and again this movie warrants only superlatives. GREAT story GREAT cast GREAT acting GREAT special effects GREAT costumes GREAT EVERYTHING. This movie is one of the greatest epics ever produced by Hollywood. The scenes with Yul Brynner and E. G. Robinson and Charlton Heston are iconic the scenes between Mr. Heston and the beautiful Anne Baxter are cinematic gems. Moreover the story is told in a straightforward way giving the movie the continuity it requires to stay on track which is essential for a movie that is almost four hours long. Moses was a hero Rameses his nemesis and Nefeteri the woman who had and then lost the man she loved a Hebrew man named Moses.The acting is stagy but the story is great and Charlton Heston IS Moses. This is Charton Heston's greatest role. He is what makes this movie work. Heston gives one of the greatest performances in the history of Hollywood. Whether as the prince of Egypt or as a slave or as a shepherd or as a leader and a prophet Charlton Heston is the central player in this story. Yul Brynner Anne Baxter Sir Cedric Hardwicke E. G. Robinson etc. are great in their supporting roles too but this is Charlton Heston's movie. This movie conveys the intensity of a time when a people held in cruel bondage were soon to be freed and were soon to be led by someone whose emergence onto the scene is so improbable as to confound everyone around him. For who was Moses? Was he an Egyptian posing as a slave? Was he a Hebrew masquerading as an Egyptian prince? Was he a prophet? Or was he an opportunist using the plight of the Hebrews to gain a following and thereby confront and defeat his rival Rameses? The movie raises these questions. Now the movie may not be historically accurate but that's not important. What IS important is the story this movie tells which is about a man who is on a mission to liberate an entire people from the shackles of slavery and sacrifices everything  wealth power the love of Pharoah's daughter  to accomplish what he sets out to do  and does it.There are some critics who make fun of this movie for its stagy acting and stodgy story. Well this is complete balderdash. Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston were never better and Anne Baxter is positively beautiful. The movie is a story about liberation redemption and hope. It's about people who were led from the house of bondage and became a nation guided by the great and profound prophet Moses. That this movie is remembered over fifty years after its release is proof enough of its timelessness.".

This movie is one of the greatest epics ever produced by Hollywood. The scenes with Yul Brynner and E. G. Robinson and Charlton Heston are iconic the scenes between Mr. Heston and the beautiful Anne Baxter are cinematic gems. Moreover the story is told in a straightforward way giving the movie the continuity it requires to stay on track which is essential for a movie that is almost four hours long. Moses was a hero Rameses his nemesis and Nefeteri the woman who had and then lost the man she loved a Hebrew man named Moses.The acting is stagy but the story is great and Charlton Heston IS Moses. This is Charton Heston's greatest role. He is what makes this movie work. Heston gives one of the greatest performances in the history of Hollywood. Whether as the prince of Egypt or as a slave or as a shepherd or as a leader and a prophet Charlton Heston is the central player in this story. Yul Brynner Anne Baxter Sir Cedric Hardwicke E. G. Robinson etc. are great in their supporting roles too but this is Charlton Heston's movie. This movie conveys the intensity of a time when a people held in cruel bondage were soon to be freed and were soon to be led by someone whose emergence onto the scene is so improbable as to confound everyone around him. For who was Moses? Was he an Egyptian posing as a slave? Was he a Hebrew masquerading as an Egyptian prince? Was he a prophet? Or was he an opportunist using the plight of the Hebrews to gain a following and thereby confront and defeat his rival Rameses? The movie raises these questions. Now the movie may not be historically accurate but that's not important. What IS important is the story this movie tells which is about a man who is on a mission to liberate an entire people from the shackles of slavery and sacrifices everything  wealth power the love of Pharoah's daughter  to accomplish what he sets out to do  and does it.There are some critics who make fun of this movie for its stagy acting and stodgy story. Well this is complete balderdash. Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston were never better and Anne Baxter is positively beautiful. The movie is a story about liberation redemption and hope. It's about people who were led from the house of bondage and became a nation guided by the great and profound prophet Moses. That this movie is remembered over fifty years after its release is proof enough of its timelessness.";

As for the film itself it should serve as a prerequisite for those in the industry who wish to make biblical epics. The sets were absolutely lavishing.

Whereas The Prince of Egypt went soft and newagey when it came to the crunch De Mille never lets us forget the harsh world events are taking place in.  With a powerful and capricious god glaring at everyone all the time it's not surprising that people  even pagans  take to talking in speeches.  The speeches are in an attractive flowery style that isn't biblical but has the same aesthetic standards as some biblical writing. And the god really has some Old Testament flavour.  Everyone is terrified of him and for perfectly rational reasons would rather pretend that he doesn't exist.  This gets tiresome after a while.  You'd think that after watching the Red Sea part everyone would have been willing to admit that Moses courted SOME kind of supernatural influence.  On the other hand you'd be a mug to trust this influence too far.Possibly the best thing about the movie is the way it manages to divide our sympathies without weakening them.  Yes we're on the side of the Israelites.  But it's also hard not to be on the side of the Egyptians. The old Pharaoh is probably the most likeable character on display and the young Pharaoh while he has his flaws is a nice enough fellow done in by unfortunate circumstances.  Moses gains our empathy early and keeps it even when his beard has turned to marble.  Only the minor characters are villains  and they're fun too.Of course I say all this knowing full well that the entire film is at the same time completely ridiculous.  Well what can I say.  It's yet another instance of a general law.  Simple sincerity can sometimes spin straw into gold.".

	schema:reviewBody "To mount an epic movie based on the story of Moses delivering the slaves out of Egypt is an ambitious and logistically challenging task at the best of times. To have done this in 1956 without the aid of computerenhanced effects for believable crowd scenes or reallooking historical sets is more remarkable still. When our screen is filled with tens of thousands of soldiers or slaves stretching right to the horizon what you see on the screen really was in front of the camera. That level of resourcefulness and organisation is staggering to think about and makes The Ten Commandments an admirable achievement by any standards. Having said that there are moments when you might find that the epic proportions of what is before your eyes creates a stronger impression than the divinely inspired story as Cecil B. DeMille calls it in his introductory speech.It is prophesised in Ancient Egypt that a Hebrew slave will be born who will one day deliver the other slaves from a life in chains and lead them to freedom. Jittery the pharaoh demands that all firstborn Hebrew babies must be slain to prevent the prophecy from coming true. One Hebrew family put their baby son into a basket and cast him onto the Nile hoping that he will somehow reach safety from this awful fate. Instead the baby floats right into the gardens of a royal palace where he is found by Bithiah Nina Foch She takes the baby as her own and names him Moses. Years later Moses has grown up within the Egyptian royal family and is revered as a noble wise and resourceful Prince of Egypt. One day he may even become the next pharaoh much to the envy of the existing pharoah's birth son Ramases Yul Brynner. Moses and Ramases are also locked in a battle for the affections  and eventual hand in marriage  of the beautiful Nefertiri Anne Baxter. Ramases spends most of his time plotting a way to discredit Moses so that he might beat him in their mutual race for the throne and the woman of their desires. Then unexpectedly Moses learns about his true ancestry. When he discovers that he is in fact of Hebrew birth parents he forsakes his royal status and becomes a slave. After many years of hardship  including a long period of being banished into the wilderness  Moses learns from God that he has been chosen to deliver the slaves from their appalling existence in captivity. He returns to Egypt and leads his people to freedom.Cecil B. DeMille had already made this film under the same title in 1923. This lavish and expensive remake is a better film though. Heston is excellent as Moses  the role requires tremendous presence and he provides it in abundance. Brynner is also very good as Ramases etching a character whose burning envy towards his rival is convincing and memorable. At times the dialogue is a little stilted and lofty at other times it is actually quite eloquent the parts narrated by De Mille himself are especially articulate. Elmer Bernstein's score is appropriately stirring and the cinematography by Loyal Griggs is truly outstanding hard to accept that Griggs lost out in the Oscars that year to Lionel Lindon's work in Around The World In 80 Days!! The Ten Commandments features some fabulous cinematic highlights  the 10th plague the parting of the sea and the writing of the commandments are a few that spring to mind. In between the highlights the film has its lulls but even at an elephantine 220 minutes it never lapses into total boredom and is well worth catching if you're a fan of biblical epics or oldstyle Hollywood pageants.".

Charlton Heston is the great actor of the film in the role of Moses. Yul Brynner was also excellent as Pharaoh Ramses as Anne Baxter in the role of Nefretiri. Edward G.

The setting is one of the biggest that Hollywood has ever made with thousands of extras with carefully detailed period costumes. Everything was thought to the detail and we love all this visual show. Of course historical accuracy has been left in the background. DeMille had his school on Broadway and might not attach much importance to the historical details but knew how to make a great show. The visual and special effects are quite realistic the state of the art of cinema of this time and still can seem credible today more than fifty years after it's premiere. The soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is strident betting heavily on metals and percussion in a clearly symphonic style that was thought to make everything even more grandiose. In short it's a consecrated epic that many people still watch almost religiously at Easter in Portugal it's normal to be broadcast on TV in this period year after year. The big problem of this film is the very theatrical dialogue and acting. It looks like theater. But we can forgive this fault because it's more or less overshadowed by the visual and sound show.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Charlton Heston wasn't sure he could overact before he made this film he certainly proved it to himself  and everybody else  here. It's hard to believe in a 'prophet' who can't seem to lower his voice below a shout.What's really sad about films like this is that it plays well for people who deeply believe themselves to be devout Christians even though the Sermon on the Mount makes so little sense to them they tell their children to ignore it nobody could live that way.Of course this is the Old Testament story so references to mercy and justice and charity are somewhat out of place anyway.

It's hard to believe in a 'prophet' who can't seem to lower his voice below a shout.What's really sad about films like this is that it plays well for people who deeply believe themselves to be devout Christians even though the Sermon on the Mount makes so little sense to them they tell their children to ignore it nobody could live that way.Of course this is the Old Testament story so references to mercy and justice and charity are somewhat out of place anyway.

In his competition with Moses he was straightforward honest and did not stoop to unfair subterfuge. Why shouldn't he consider Dathan's revelation a valid reason to disqualify Moses from becoming Pharaoh? Even after achieving this victory and having Moses totally at his mercy he does not execute his rival but exiles him even predicting that he'll forget his troubles with another woman.After several years Moses shows up again in total violation of the Pharoah's edict. Ramesses reacts to this with unusual forbearance. He merely smirks and permits Moses to hang around his court. Moses disrupts the river purification ceremony but Ramesses prevents anyone from killing him. Moses turns up on a private terrace while Ramesses is trying to read and instead of having Moses killed Ramesses merely tries to ignore him and wishes he'd quit bugging him. In fact Moses is attacking his kingdom with multiple supernatural assaults yet Ramesses tries to shrug it all off as natural events and fails to molest his foster brother or the Hebrews until he has endured many provocations. Finally he reaches the reasonable decision to free the slaves only to be turned from this by the manipulations of Nefretiri a foolish act of pride and weakness on his part not of evil. By the way in the Bible it is God who mysteriously hardens Pharaoh's heart all these times not Nefretiri.After his plan to kill the Hebrew firstborn backfires he again decides to free the slaves. The damage to Egypt would have been contained if not for the further scheming of Nefretiri. Of course we know from history that Ramesses II was one of the most successful of all Egyptian pharaohs and went on to an extraordinarily long and prosperous reign.I am left with the impression that Ramesses regarded Moses with a certain respect. Moses was certainly a more interesting character before his encounter with the Burning Bush. I think if these two guys had ever sat down together without their respective sticks being inserted they could have worked things out and avoided all kinds of trouble. Of course that might have taken a toll on the movie's dramatic content.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie with a biblical story. A movie with biblical proportions. A movie withwellquite a few biblical inaccuracies. Despite this Ten Commandments is one of my favorite movies. Now everyone will be in shock when I say this but it's a fairly modern and deep movie. It's a movie that uses old style with new methods. Let's take a look line by line.Direction Cecil B. Demille is a overdone theatrical kind of director and the result is a theatrical overdone kind of movie. But when the Bible is concerned that's really the way to do it. Overdone gestures poetic screenplay massive sets and thousands of extras make this film a giant in Hollywood's history. Demille pulls it off however with his overblown style and flair. There are a few cringe worthy moments of poorly directed extras but it generally works. It's overdone style was the director's intent. So I bet you're wondering how could this possibly be modern? Well it's Demille's amazing effects he used lavish sets and deep story that makes it modern. Most movies at the time would cut away when the dead sea caves in or show just a facade of a city or a backdrop. Demille shows it all. Scenes such as the slaughtering of the newborn or the Passover were fairly intense at the time and most movies would no pun intended pass over them. So like I said Demille does this all in old theatrical style but the actual content of the film was fairly advanced for the time. Charlton Heston Very few can part the dead sea and you'll believe they just did it. Very few can be Moses. Heston gives a great performance of Moses that seems just like how you picture him when you read it in the bible. Search for someone else to play a better Moses but I bet it'll be in vain. Yul Brynner Cast as Ramses the Pharaoh he steals the show in his outstanding performance. He's pompous arrogant but delivers great lines. He's also very deep as that he's simply a leader who was determined just for the wrong cause. He loves his son and his wife despite the fact that the latter never returns any love to him. He delivers such a great performance that he almost makes you want him to win. In the end he won't however no matter how long he may pray before the mighty falcon. Anne BaxterIs the film's 'Beautiful enemy'. She's in the center of the love triangle between Ramses and Moses the latter of who she is madly in love with. She's plays someone who's self centered manipulative power hungry and superficial and she plays it with remarkable ability. She fit's the classic 'Queen of Egypt' model movies strive for back then. I personally would have liked to seen her play Cleopatra. Sure it may have been a semirepeat role playing another Egyptian but She was Egypt.Sir Cedric Hardwicke He plays the first Pharaoh seen in the film father of Ramses. He does a terrific job in that role playing a wise understanding but firm leader. He speaks his line in stage like fashion and is all together convincing. He may have one of the deepest characters as you will see in the film. John Derek All films have their weaknesses and this film's weakness is John Derek's portrayal of Joshua. Overacting even on Demille's standards and poor delivery of his lines makes his performance almost laughable. He brings the film down a little and is probably the worst part of the film. I don't see how he was cast maybe he thought it would be the day his career is born. As it turns out it's not that day Joshua. Edward G. Robinson Yes America's favorite gangster was cast as a Hebrew turncoat Dathan who is an informant with 'Rat's ears and a ferret's nose'. Despite people's criticism of his performance I thought he did a rather good job. He had his moments where I thought he'd say 'Step back Moses or I'll plug ya that goes for you too Joshua and the rest of you mugs' but he was still pretty good.Other Supporting characters The rest of the cast is pretty good Yvonne DeCarlo is solid and Vincent Price has a scene stealing performance as Baka the Master Builder.Special Effects Phenomenal. Who needs CGI when you can build the city of PiRamses instead? This coupled with the partying of the Red Sea the Nile turning to blood the hail turning the fire the staff turning into a snake along with countless other effects are amazing to watch. Most old movies would avoid those effects by cutting awaynot the Ten Commandments. I'd say it has the best pre1990's special effects of all time.Costumes Breathtaking. The bright and ornate costumes really capture the essence of the time.Set Design Incredible. Like I said for the special effects do you really need Digital effects if you can just do this? Very few movies can rival the massive sets of this film. It's as if you are actually in Egypt.Musical Score A joy to listen to. The pompous overblown score fits with the rest of the feel of the movie. Who else wouldn't want to enter and exit a room wit the same fanfare that Ramses does?All in all the Ten Commandments is a classic. It is a surprisingly deep film that uses theatrical style with modern methods. The film is among my favorites. With outlandish sets and costumes over the top music a poetic screenplay outstanding effects and exceptional acting this is a film that is great in all regards and will be enjoyed with all generations a film worthy of 'the gods'. So it shall be written so it shall be done.".

	schema:headline " The Ten Commandments Is A Must See Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Ten Commandments is an epic film that is based on the biblical story of the Exodus in which the Hebrewborn Moses an adopted Egyptian prince becomes the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves. It starred Charlton Heston in the lead role together with Yul Brynner as his adoptive brother Pharaoh Rameses II Anne Baxter as Nefretiri Edward G. Robinson as Dathan Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora Debra Paget as Lilia and John Derek as Joshua. The supporting cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti I Nina Foch as Bithiah Martha Scott as Yoshebel Judith Anderson as Memnet Vincent Price as Baka and John Carradine as Aaron.It was directed by Cecil B. DeMillehis last film.The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bull rushes as an infant by the Pharaoh's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses starts out as Pharoah's adopted son and an expert at designing pyramids but when he soon discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous halfbrother Rameses he returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews posthaste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines.High atop the mountain Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes and Dathan and his followers are killed. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost to kill off the rebellious generation the Hebrews are about to arrive in the land of Canaan. An elderly Moses who however is not allowed to enter the promised land because he disobeyed the lord at the waters of strifethen appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader says a final good bye to Sephora and goes forth to his destiny.DeMille's last film may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. With a running time of nearly four hours it is the most extravagant movie that is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects and it isn't boring for a minute.Alsoit is the director's biggest most spectacular epic excessive and lurid but extravagantly entertaining this allstar spectacular is a spectacular retelling of the great Bible story in which displays himself as a showman.It is definitely a must see!!!!".

It starred Charlton Heston in the lead role together with Yul Brynner as his adoptive brother Pharaoh Rameses II Anne Baxter as Nefretiri Edward G. Robinson as Dathan Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora Debra Paget as Lilia and John Derek as Joshua. The supporting cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti I Nina Foch as Bithiah Martha Scott as Yoshebel Judith Anderson as Memnet Vincent Price as Baka and John Carradine as Aaron.It was directed by Cecil B. DeMillehis last film.The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bull rushes as an infant by the Pharaoh's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses starts out as Pharoah's adopted son and an expert at designing pyramids but when he soon discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous halfbrother Rameses he returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews posthaste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines.High atop the mountain Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes and Dathan and his followers are killed. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost to kill off the rebellious generation the Hebrews are about to arrive in the land of Canaan. An elderly Moses who however is not allowed to enter the promised land because he disobeyed the lord at the waters of strifethen appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader says a final good bye to Sephora and goes forth to his destiny.DeMille's last film may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. With a running time of nearly four hours it is the most extravagant movie that is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects and it isn't boring for a minute.Alsoit is the director's biggest most spectacular epic excessive and lurid but extravagantly entertaining this allstar spectacular is a spectacular retelling of the great Bible story in which displays himself as a showman.It is definitely a must see!!!!";

Ajay Devgan in a serious role does a great performance. Akshay Kumar is fantastic as the womaniser and slightly dim character. Count how many times he gets slapped by a girl in this film  almost 100. Karishma Kapoor doesn't get much scope the less of her the better. Nagma is hardly in the movie since it is more related about the two friends and the life of Ajay Devgan. The movie has a good script about a Hospital with a few corrupt Doctors led by the man in charge Suresh Oberoi who kills the poorer people and takes out their organs and sells them for the richer customers. Suhaag does have some breath taking amazing scenes which include Dalip Tahil using a Chain saw on Ajay Devgan and Ajay and Akshay using Dalips corpse as a witness in court. Sounds daft but has been executed tremondously.".

Akshay Kumar and Kuku's first and last film is also this. The story is typical yet it is well handled and the use of comedy in the first half is effective and the twist is good not great though. The film is averagegood in the first half second half become good. The story is like this Akshay and Ajay are two good college friendstypical they are living their lives and getting into trouble as time passes through college. Akshay's dad wants Ajay to become a good worker in Canada if he wants all that good money. Ajay agrees and to get him a passport he needs his birth certificate. Now from here after all the romantic and comic stuff the movie picks up and thw twist is revealed. Ajay learns that his dad is not dead and his mom has lied to him. His dad is in prison in Canada for selling illegal organs. Now the duo go to Canada and solve the problems and bring Ajay's dad to justice. The movie becomes an action film and the climax is well handled with a decent action scene. Amongst actors Ajay and Akshay both impress and entertain in both halfs heroines are decent supporting cast and Aruna Irani is good. Everyone is pretty good. Direction is good but not as good as Phool Aur Kaante and Haqeeqat for Ajay Devgan. Music is decent too many songs though. Overall another movie that worked and was a hit.".

Typically for this type of film when she sets her eyes on a gentleman of title  who's young and handsome to boot MacMurray  he turns out to be engaged to an even wealthier lady Astrid Allwyn because he's himself penniless! Running after her the term is put lightly here since he's actually wheelchairbound is an exair ace played by the actor who cornered the market around this time in Other Man roles Ralph Bellamy who's naturally got a lot of money and thinks of Lombard as a perfect match  but his love goes unrequited.The mixture includes slapstick wisecracks romance drama and even a bit of sentimentality Lombard spends a good part of the last act sobbing. Still as always in these more innocent times where for instance a woman has to turn around when the man she's living with  albeit platonically for the moment  is about to wear his pants! none of the characters are really unsympatheticso that we don't even despise the jilted lovers who are understanding enough to know when to give up. The ending of the film is a classic Lombard and MacMurray cause a traffic jam to look for a missing penny on which they've staked the course of their future! Appearing in one scene as a prospective boyfriend of Lombard's whom MacMurray scares away is future Preston Sturges regular William Demarest.The film was shown in the early 1990s on latenight Italian TV in its original language with forced Italian subtitles but I had missed it the same thing is true for the aforementioned THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS and MacMurray's other film with Leisen  TAKE A LETTER DARLING 1942 I did however acquire some of the director's other great work this way  most of which is regrettably still unavailable on DVD...".

Both of them will make you laugh as they hang out with each other and try not to fall in love. There is definitely chemistry there between Fred and Carole. Fred's early film roles are often completely forgotten nowadays. Ralph Bellamy is equally funny in his role as the crippled rich man looking for companionship.My favorite scene is where Carole's character starts crying uncontrollably and Bellamy's character tells her to stop crying. She responds I've a right to cry if I want to. I've got a good cry coming to me. I almost fell over laughing. Lighthearted fun that is not to be missed.".

Robert Osborne called this role a Ralph Bellamy role and who more perfect for the ignoreddumped love interest than he? He is infatuated with hotel manicurist Lombard sparkling as always and is rich into the bargain. However she falls for playboy MacMurray whose family has lost its money and who is looking to marry into it so he can continue his aimless yet pampered existence. Lombard wants to marry money too but curiously overlooks puppyeyed Bellamy in this regard. The plot involves MacMurray missing the boat he is taking to Bermuda while his fiance's family plan the wedding. He misses the boat due to a zany night out with Lombard and ends up needing to board with her for the week so his fiance thinks he's in Bermuda. The usual fallinginlovedespitethemselves ensues.This is called a screwball comedy but I found it more sad than comical especially with the character Bellamy plays. MacMurray has no sex appeal for me despite workable chemistry with Lombard. I cannot help but picture the pipepuffing cardiganwearing dad Steve Douglas on My Three Sons and how utterly dopey he looks works against his being taken seriously as a sexy guy. No one has yet mentioned that William Demarest who later played Uncle Charley on My Three Sons with MacMurray shows up as a suitor to take Lombard out who gets cosmetically chased away by MacMurray in one of the funnier scenes in the film.Tragic Marie Prevost plays Lombard's manicurist pal Nona. I thought she had a fine comedic presence and it's a shame she didn't go on to more bestfriend Patsy Kelly type roles.I don't think this is one of Lombard's best but not a complete waste of time. Not as zany or fantastic as My Man Godfrey but watchable nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "CAROLE LOMBARD and FRED MacMURRAY have chemistry in this warm romantic comedy about two people who are actually yearning to marry into wealth but find that love conquers all. RALPH BELLAMY as the other man makes it a certainty that Lombard will fall in love with MacMurray for the final reel so there's no guessing as to how it all turns out.But Mitchell Leisen keeps the pace brisk for the running time of an hour and twenty minutes the script that Norman Krasna and others penned is bright and funny and everyone is seen to advantage. Lombard has probably seldom had such beguiling closeups and she was a true classic beauty with a flair for this brand of romantic comedy. MacMurray too has a deft touch with light material and is a good match for her as a playboy who'd rather fall in love with a rich woman but changes his mind when he meets Lombard.Director Leisen can be proud of his career which included gems like this and serious dramas like Hold Back the Dawn and To Each His Own. He's probably one of Hollywood's most underrated directors and is in good form here. The supporting cast gets a lift from RUTH DONNELLY and WILLIAM DEMAREST.Summing up Enjoyable nonsense it's formula fluff given substance by a clever script and fine direction.".

	onyx:emotionText "CAROLE LOMBARD and FRED MacMURRAY have chemistry in this warm romantic comedy about two people who are actually yearning to marry into wealth but find that love conquers all. RALPH BELLAMY as the other man makes it a certainty that Lombard will fall in love with MacMurray for the final reel so there's no guessing as to how it all turns out.But Mitchell Leisen keeps the pace brisk for the running time of an hour and twenty minutes the script that Norman Krasna and others penned is bright and funny and everyone is seen to advantage. Lombard has probably seldom had such beguiling closeups and she was a true classic beauty with a flair for this brand of romantic comedy. MacMurray too has a deft touch with light material and is a good match for her as a playboy who'd rather fall in love with a rich woman but changes his mind when he meets Lombard.Director Leisen can be proud of his career which included gems like this and serious dramas like Hold Back the Dawn and To Each His Own. He's probably one of Hollywood's most underrated directors and is in good form here. The supporting cast gets a lift from RUTH DONNELLY and WILLIAM DEMAREST.Summing up Enjoyable nonsense it's formula fluff given substance by a clever script and fine direction.";

Because he was SO often cast as the fianc who is left by the leading lady for another the guide often says something like once again Bellamy plays the sap. I'd noticed this a long time ago too and as soon as I say him in the film I absolutely KNEW he was going to fall for Carole Lombard but lose her in the end!! In fact I really like to look for his movies because I am hoping to one day find one of these formulaic films where he actually gets the girl!! So far after seeing him in the role about a dozen times in movies such as HIS GIRL Friday THE AWFUL TRUTH and so many others I am yet to see such a movie! It's a shame really as he was a fine actor.So aside from the obvious role Bellamy plays in the film the film revolves around the budding romance between Lombard and lazy playboy Fred MacMurray. Both play their usual likable type of character and it is so obvious that despite appearances they are destined to wed. While many will dislike how telegraphed the plot is I for one don't mind it. Sure I know the unwritten rules for 1930s romance but don't mind because the writing acting and direction are so fun and enjoyable. But in a way watching a light romantic comedy like this is a lot like a lady reading a romance novelyou know what will ultimately happen but the journey from start to finish is so pleasant and enchanting you don't mind.While not one of the very best of the genre it is still a good example and well worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hands Across the Table is one hilarious gem of a movie and a fine love story. Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray were paired in four films in the 1930s. This was the first of three comedies and they really click in all three. Lombard died in a 1942 plane crash returning to California from a war bond appearance. At 33 she had become the highest paid entertainer in Hollywood by the end of the 1930s. She was a super talent with prospects for many years of wonderful films. Lombard could play dramatic roles and mysterythrillers as well as comedy. But comedy was her forte. In all her films with various leading men she seems to bring the best out of her male co stars as well. She was getting top billing for most of her films as she has in this film. And in her lead role here Lombard has some fine dramatic moments as Regi Allen a woman in love. So this film is a step above a comedy romance. MacMurray shines with a peppy lively and very funny role as Theodore Drew III. The 27yearold MacMurray has twinkles in his eyes and frequent smiles on this face. He laughs often and leads Regi and others to laugh as well. This is a fine look at the talented actor who would develop a more reticent and dour persona for humor in later life. A very good small supporting cast contributes nicely to the humor. Ralph Bellamy's Allen Macklyn is a wealthy resident of the hotel who has been confined to a wheelchair since a plane accident four years before. His role fills out a love triangle with Regi and Ted. Ruth Donnelly plays Laura the beauty shop receptionist. Marie Prevost who plays Regi's manicurist friend Nona had a long career in silent films. She got her start in 1915 and appeared in more than 100 films. But a little over a year after this film came out Prevost died of extreme malnutrition and alcoholism. She was just 38 years old. This is one of the great 1930s comedies that is a must for any movie library. Like most of the other films of that time and genre it is good viewing for the whole family.Here are some favorite lines from the film. For more funny dialog see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie. Laura 1502's been phoning for a manicure since 830. Regi Allen 1502? Up where the rich live. Who is it? Laura A Mr. Macklyn. Regi Married? Laura That makes two things I forgot to ask him on the phone  what he had for breakfast and whether he's married or not. Nona 1502 is really an awful lucky number for you. Five and one is six and six and two are eight.Allen Macklyn Some people play golf to pass the time some go in for tap dancing some destroy clay pigeons. I have manicures.Allen Macklyn Would you care for a drink Miss Allen? Regi Allen Oh no. The day's just started. Allen Macklyn What a fresh point of view. To me the night's just ended.Theodore Drew III after Regi's manicure job has drawn blood on a few of his fingers Are you doing anything tonight? Would you mind feeding me? I'm... I'm afraid I'm going to have to have a nurse.Regi Allen Do you dream? Ted Drew No. Regi Allen You should. You meet a better class of people.Regi Allen You must have a lot of friends that could give you a job. Ted Drew That'd be a fine friend who'd give you a job. No friend of mine had better try anything like that on me.".

With title referencing to manicurist working on customer's fingernails over a table the comedy taken from the story by Vina Delmar doesn't deal with the job profession exclusively but on one particular manicurist whose goal in life is to marry for money rather than true love.The story starts on a routinely day as New York City friends and coworkers Regi Allen Carole Lombard and Nina Marie Provost exit Grand Central Station headed for their jobs at the Loycott Barber Shop where they work as manicurists. Nina is introduced as a daffy girl who studies astrology while Regi gets her character development being a cynical young girl who hopes to someday meet and marry a rich man. Her day has come when Laura Ruth Donnelly her supervisor assigns her to her next customer Allen MacKlyn Ralph Bellamy a wealthy bachelor in a luxurious apartment with Peter Joseph Tozer as his personal butler. MacKlyn it turns out is wheelchair bound due to an aviation accident. His selfpity soon changes after taking a good look at Regi. He takes an immediate liking towards her especially after she honestly tells him that his handicap doesn't have her feel sorry for him at all. As their friendship develops to what might lead to love and marriage Regi comes across Theodore Drew III Fred MacMurray playing hopscotch on the tile floor in the hallway outside MacKlyn's door. Even though Regi gives this young man the brush off Drew arranges an appointment to have her manicure his fingernails. After finding out he's a rich young playboy Regi nervously accepts the job and invitation to dinner. After their evening together the intoxicated Drew passes out in their cab forcing Regi with no other choice but have him taken up to her apartment where he spends the night. The following morning Drew having missed his boat to Bermuda tells Regi he's not rich at all but only living off the allowance of his fiance Vivian Astrid Allwyn the rich daughter of pineapple king Amos Snowden. As Regi and Drew discover they're two of a kind the problem is what are they going to do about it.Typical Depression era comedy whether to marry for love or money is its basic theme. Regardless of its familiarity material that might have well served such golddigger movie types as Jean Harlow Joan Blondell or Ginger Rogers HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE succeeds quite well under Carole Lombard and her male costars Fred MacMurray Ralph Bellamy and Mitchell Neisen's breezy direction. Overlooking how this comedy somewhat echoes in spots to Frank Capra's comedy IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT with MacMurray and Lombard being Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert counterparts in reverse or visa versa aside from its fine scripting credited to Norman Krasna Vincent Lawrence and Herbert Fields the film's most amusing moments go to Lombard and MacMurray starting with their first meeting her nervously manicuring his fingernails MacMurray's method of stopping hickups Lombard pretending to be an switchboard operator for a long distance telephone call MacMurray playing a jealous husband to scare off a suitor and so forth. There's also a somber moment from Lombard's point of view as camera captures her facial moods with extreme closeup where scenes like this tells more than any use of dialogue. MacMurray even takes time to sing The Morning After. Astrid Allwyn a brunette rather than her usual blonde hairstyle makes a satisfactory heiress with a hold on her man while Bellamy's joy of laughter is reminiscent to Ronald Reagan climatic moment from KING'S ROW Warner Brothers 1941.What makes films like this of greater interest is the uncredited support of familiar faces as Edward Gargan Pinky Kelly Nina's boyfriend Marcella Corday Celeste Vivian's Maid Ferdinand Munier Miles Vivian's Butler and Frederick Snowflake Toone Snowflake the Porter. Viewers familiar with the long running television series of My Three Sons 19601972 would be interested in seeing its stars MacMurray some thirty years earlier opposite William Uncle Charlie Demarest with an amusing scene together.Unlike SWING HIGH SWING LOW 1937 and TRUE CONFESSION 1937 which have become unavailable for television broadcasts until the 1980s HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE and THE PRINCESS COMES ACOSS 1936 were the most televised of the Lombard and MacMurray collaborations. In later years both being available on both video cassette and DVD formats with cable television broadcasts on American Movie Classics 19931994 and Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere October 6 2008. As much as the movie and its title may have faded through the passage of time it's still a worthy discovery and curio for those who've never seen nor heard of either the movie or its leading players before.

Lombard plays Regi a manicurist determined to marry for money and lots of it. She gives manicures in the hotel where she works to a very wealthy gentleman in a wheelchair Ralph Bellamy. She seems to only be friends with him she sincerely likes him and loves talking with him. He however is madly in love with her.When Regi meets playboy Theodore Drew and he asks her out she thinks she's found the motherload. Unfortunately he's engaged to be married. Worse than that he's broke and this marriage is supposed to bolster the family bank account. We all know what happens.MacMurray and Lombard have decent chemistry and both were good at light comedy. Someone on this board said MacMurray had no sex appeal. He didn't. I liked his character but I felt sorry for Ralph Bellamy who always seemed to lose out. The nice thing about his character though is that he is philosophical and only wants the best for Regi.Lombard absolutely sparkles. She was a vivacious beautiful and charismatic actress. Looking at the two tragic stars of Hands Across the Table 1935 one can't help but watch this film with a twinge of sadness. Carole Lombard would die in a plane crash seven years later. One of her costars Marie Provost died of alcoholism and malnutrition two years after this film. Another Hollywood dieting story like Laird Cregar Provost had trouble managing her weight and was having trouble getting roles like she had previously. It seems she crash dieted as well as turning to alcohol. She gives a nice performance here as Regi's good friend.Definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to disagree with a lot of the comments. This is a great martial arts movie !! The fight scenes are few and far between and the plot a bit convoluted  but the quality of fighting is  absolutely superb. Tsui Hark has managed to restrain himself and just get some really kickass moves out of Jet Li and Donnie Yen the later movies in this series are just way too fantastical for a classic kungfu movie. I have seen almost all of Jet Li's movies and several of Donnie Yen's and I will have to say that the two fight sequences between Li and Yen are the best ever filmed. I found myself skipping over the rest of the movie just to see these two scenes over and over again. Their techniques were simply marvelous...It was refreshing to see David Chiang an old favorite of mine back in the 70s though. How they ever filmed it boggles the mind. Fist of Legend and Tai Chi Master may have more colorful fighting and the latter may be a better overall movie but the true afficionado and I have been watching these kungfu flicks for about 30 years will really appreciate the quality of fighting here. Tsui Hark has distilled the essence of HK kungfu movies into these two scenes.".

The welldrawn cast includes Dr Sun YatSen which brings some historical credibility but adds irony as well since Dr Sun's idealism may have been misplaced. Oh yeah its got some great fighting in it too...I find previous accusations implying racism in this film to be misguided and deeply ignorant. The Wong FeiHung series highlights the historical turmoil felt in China from external trade interest and internal political pressure. Foreign characters are shown as both villainous and sympathetic just like the Chinese characters. OUATIC II portrays the xenophobia of the White Lotus Cult as a Very Bad Thing and the confusion at western objects and inventions varies from the hilarious train sequence to the superstitious fear of the camera. It's selfmockery but it's bittersweet. If anything Tsui Hark is implying a loss of innocence. If the foreign powers are portrayed in a negative light it's because our presence in China was motivated by greed and imperialism. Hardly the most noble of motives. But then nobody's perfect and China's human rights record is less than great before and after the revolution.I'm staggered that anyone could be so utterly stupid as to ascribe Nazi overtones to a film which goes so far to portray nobility humanism and honour.

	schema:headline " The Godfather Part II of the 'China' series";
	schema:reviewBody "When we last saw Wong Fei Hung Jet Li he emerged as a hero to his people in fighting against the invading foreign forces that were wreaking havoc in his hometown. By part 1's conclusion he has also come to realize that his country is going through inevitable changes and that acceptance to western cultures is the best possible answer to the dilemmas. Like Wong's change in view part II shifts from its predecessor's themes of nationalism and selfstrengthening to an exploration of cultural and ideological tolerance. With all that said Once upon a time in China II is one of those rare sequels that manages to cast a shadow over its original and brings the franchise to a new height. Li once again delivers a towering performance reprising his role as Wong. Although there's very little development to the character since the last time we met him we are immediately won over the second he raises his first kick to the sound of the beautifully familiar score. Accompanied by Aunt 13 Rosamund Kwan and his mischievous student Leung Foon Max Mok replacing Yuen Biu of the original the trio travels to Canton only to find a town ravaged by chaos and violence. Instead of foreigners being the chief baddie this time the White Lotus Sect and its zealous leader priest Kung played wonderfully by Xiong Xin Xin takes over as the story's primary antagonists. First introduced by a breathtaking prologue they are portrayed as a fanatical cult bent on eradicating all foreigners and those that follow foreign ways even going as far as murdering little children. One of the film's most refreshing features however was the inclusion of a complex villain in the form of Donnie Yen's Charismatic Manchu military commanderimperial guard General Lan. Despite being pitted against our heroes he is a man that is hard for the audience to despise when he's telling his men not to hurt civilians or having a brief heart to heart with Wong on their country's chaotic state. Once upon a Time in China II is without a doubt the pinnacle of the series and quite possibly the career peak of everyone involved especially for one Tsui Hark. After this it is the slow decline for the former new wave auteur who would attempt to dip his hands into mainstream Hollywood only to stink up his CV with Double Team and Knock Off before taking a stab at the recent trend of big budget wuxia epic only to come up with the woeful Seven Swords. If any of you were unfortunate enough to have seen those movies I've just mentioned I can guarantee that Once upon a Time in China 2 is the perfect antidote for you.".

Then pull that beam out of your eye.Of the three OUATIC movies that actually matter 2 is by far the most fun. The fights are beautifully filmed the acting's less hammy than 1 or 3 even those jolly good chappish Brits and Donnie Yen is on top form. The wobbly wire fight with the White Lotus guy which tops off another fine umbrella set piece is beautifully played for laughs. I enjoy a fight scene more if the participants actually have some technical ability above and beyond fancy CGI tricks and loud grunting noises. Donnie Yen and Jet Li certainly fall into that category. The pole fight is one of the best on film. If only it were five minutes longer.When Hollywood manages to make a kung fu movie one tenth as interesting or amusing as this I'll join the moaners and give this the grumpy old man stinkeye.

The speed and technique shown during the doublepole fight is staggering and Yen's moves with his cloth staff are gobsmacking. It's a real treat to see kungfu cinema of this quality.";

Typically nowadays Jet to most of his American audiences is known for playing dark urban crime fighting characters and personalities like in Unleashed and The Enforcer. That takes nothing away from this masterpiece. It's great in every way possible the soundtrack acting story.His character Huang Feihong sounds more like WeiFong is well layed out he has some flaws but he is great when the time comes. Rosamund Kwan plays Huang's cousin who is very fond of him I got the feeling she was in love with him as she says I'll never leave you' The martial arts stunts are really top notch I can even list all the stunts but the fights with the White Lotus bunch is outstanding.Pretty good acting too all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will NEVER understand while so many people hold this movie in disdain.Once Upon a Time in China II is the sequal yup who would have guessed to Tsui Hark and Jet Li's classic Once Upon a Time in China.  Wong Fei Hung is travelling to Canton to give a speech about the technique of acupuncture to foreign doctors.  Unfortunately an antiWestern cult is in the throws of rebellion destroying and burning anything foreign.  Wong Fei Hung makes an uneasy alliance with a military commander played by the AMAZING Donnie Yen as well as revolutionary Sun Yatsen who is at odds with the commander.Jet Li shows his brilliance once again as Wong Fei Hung using many moves that will make you wideeyed in surprise.  His acting itself is nothing short of brilliant.  Unfortunately the character Wong Fei Hung is rather onedimensional not really changing his demeanor or attitudes throughout either this movie or the first one.Max Mok replaces Yuen Biao as Foon which in my opinion is a travesty as Yuen Biao is just as good if not better than Jet Li.  Max Mok though plays his role very well.Donnie Yen whom I'm a huge fanboy of is best as a villain which he is in this movie.  Donnie Yen's first scene in the movie is a stunning one with him training in a field of bamboo poles and lanterns where he displays an eyepopping visual of literally turning a piece of cloth into a staffwhip of deadly power.Rosamund Kwan who's name I probably misspelled reprises her role as Cousin Yee english version or Aunt 13 chinese version.  Her character is of course attracted to Wong Fei Hung cousins by marriage not by blood according to her in the last movie and manages to add some romance to the movie.Xin Xin Xiong makes an impressive debut to the series playing Kung the possibly insane leader of the White Lotus clan.  He is supposedly impervious to sword axe and firearm.  Xiong goes on to play the Capoeriausing Clubfoot in the rest of the seriesI do not have any real qualms about the movie as everything is told with wellorganized scenes and is not boring for a minute.I also do not understand what people have against this movie saying that it is blatant propaganda for the Chinese.  I say to themThink about it the Chinese were taken advantage of an forced to change as well as forced to give up most of their land and natural resources they were heavily taxed and given little autonomy.  It sounds like a certain country if you ask me.  A country that won independence from Great Britain in the 1700s.  Add to the fact that even now that certain country holds an effortless superiority complex towards every other nation because they've been told about how great they are and how inefficient corrupt or evil other countries are.Original vs Dubbed version  The Original Cantonese version has some great acting especially for a Chinese flick.  The Dubbed version uses the same actors from the first movie which aren't terribly bad and for the most part the lipsynching is not that bad.I think I'd give the movie a 710 as so far the only other martial arts movie I've seen better is Iron Monkey which is far from perfect as well.".

The construction is tighter than Once Upon a Time in China I and although the third film is my personal favorite this second film does not lapse into martialartsfilmgenre clich as does the third.Of course that means that in order to transcend its genre paradoxically the fights of the second film have to be razor sharp  and they are. The fight scenes in this film were the best up until its time. The final duel between Jet Li and Donnie Yen is staggering all the more so for being crafted as to appear utterly realistic. Dam' that wet rope flying at the camera scared the bejeezus out of me! But since the film presents kung fu so convincingly for that very reason we can take it in stride as just another element in the film's complex interweaving of traditional culture and modern politics. The film is really about the birth of a new nation which has yet to be invented  the Republic of China represented by its highly respected progenitor Dr. Sun Yet Sen the only revolutionary figure admired equally by Nationalists and Communists alike. And it should be noted here that Sun Yet Sen strongly believed that the only way the Chinese could rid themselves of Manchurian dictatorship was by adopting the Modernist culture of the West that the Manchurian's utterly loathed and feared.That too is paradoxical. To regain a traditional preManchurian Chinese identity meant for Sun Yet sen adoption of a postManchurian Modernity  which unfortunately as all now know looks an awful lot like the US. Which is perhaps why the originally intended climax of this series of films was to be Once Upon a Time in China and America a plan disrupted by personal disagreements between Jet Li and Tsui Hark.Well in any event  does the viewer have to know all this to enjoy the film? No the film is constructed to work on its own as a glance back at an historic moment of decision which could only be completed in another decade. Thus its sense of incompleteness and hanging threads is actually part of the very fabric of the story.By the way  hopefully you will watch this film a second time  please note how much Tsui Hark accomplishes on what must have been a comparatively small budget! I mean he's only got a couple back lot soundstages but he manages to reconstruct an entire world of 19th century China for us  that's really quite amazing!".

The choreography by Yuen Ping is aweinspiring especially since unlike many of his recent films this film involves actual martial artists. Tsui Harks direction from the opening shot is spot on and the acting is great. Unlike a lot of martial arts films even those I enjoy this film's plot is superb. The music is terrific as well and really sets the tone. A minor note the dubbing isn't terrific though the movie is still immensely watchable so try and get the subbed version if you can. This movie completely transcends the genre. Highest possible recommendation.".

I was filled with excitement to once again be entering the world of Wong FeiHung in this return to his adventures. I was more than ready to pick up where last we left our hero. But this time there are protests in the streets as Wong FeiHung travels to a seminar on medicine with Aunt 13 and the White Lotus Sect prepares under the mantle of religious ceremony to expel all Western influence from the provinces of China.There is even more substance with regard to thematic content as children become involved in this explosive mix of cultural upheaval and political intrigue. At the seminar on medicine there is a scene where the merits of Western and Eastern medicine are clearly demonstrated in a lecture given on the central nervous system. This scene alone is worth the price of admission as it continues to develop the theme of EastWest confluence in a meaningful way.This thematic thread once again runs throughout the narrative with touches of light humor and more serious overtones that inevitably lead to the baroque martial artistry of action choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Donnie Yen makes his appearance in this film as military officer NapLan YunSeut and the combat scenes between him and Li represent the height of visual interest as they both brilliantly display their martial arts prowess. The supporting characters are even more fully realized than before and we are securely in the second part of a sequel that promises in its own way to rival and perhaps surpass the renown of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy.There are scenes with children here that give the story more poignancy. This is paralleled and interwoven with ceremonies where gods are entreated and appealed to strenuously for supernatural support. When Wong FeiHung enters the Temple of the White Lotus Cult in order to finally confront its leader High Priest KauKung as played by Hung Yanyan we actually get a taste of meditation about the nature of divine power mixed in with martial acrobatics. There is even a passing indirect reference to Myamoto Musashi's quote about how we must not rely on the gods. Even the saga of Christ is viewed from the Eastern perspective of the hero and this adds to the richness of the narrative in a brief incidental way.When Wong FeiHung finally draws the curtain back on KauKung's religious antics and trickery there is wailing and grieving galore among the followers of the White Lotus Cult. Even Wong FeiHung finds his friends causing death and one in particular finding for his toils martyrdom. The stakes are even higher this time for those who seek the light of knowledge as they are pitted against those who wish to enshroud themselves in the warm embrace of mysticism and blind faith. How will our hero prevail in an atmosphere where there are no easy answers and the force of pain and death makes its own argument?".

	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to the Hong Kong classic features a returning Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan as well as returning director Tsui Hark but the same team can't quite match the dynamism or magic of the original movie. ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA II is a sometimes leaden movie that deals with a fun but seenitallbefore plot involving lots of EastmeetsWest culture clashing except this time from the Chinese point of view.The movie isn't totally bad indeed there are some splendid action sequences which help to redeem it but as a whole it feels slightly spoiled by a leaden pacing and a plot which as is the case with a number of Hong Kong movies saves all the major action for the last half an hour. Things begin with a virtual repeat of the opening of the first movie as we witness some impressive strongmen who are impervious to bullets fire and blades. Of course Li must fight these guys in a stunning battle which is expertly choreographed by Yuen Wooping but nevertheless seems shoehorned onto the rest of the political plot.Production values are fine as is Tsui Hark's assured direction and there's no faulting the performances or the martial arts moves on show. Particularly good is the returning Rosamund Kwan who has a more romantic and funny character this time around. Li is an able centrepiece for the action although some moments are stolen by the brilliant Donnie Yen whose martial skills are unbeaten. His skill here is with a piece of deadly cloth and there's plenty of highspirited polefighting too to enjoy. The final neckslashing climax is wicked but this still doesn't take away the feeling that this is a virtual reprise of the original movie lacking its integrity if not the action.".

However the stakes are upped in part two as there is a grand show off between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. And if you get the Hong Kong Legends version the interview with Donnie Yen is quite worth watching  despite his cocky attitude. It was a nice detail to find out that they were given free hands to go at each other with the bamboo poles.The action and martial arts were amazingly wellchoreographed and executed. But of course everything that Yuen WooPing is involved with is fantastic.The story in Once Upon a Time in China 2 is good and wellpaced right from the very beginning.As in the previous movie the dialogue and characters of the Western foreigners in China were campy ridiculous and downright awful. I didn't think anyone ever spoke the same way as they did.If you enjoy Asian martial arts movies then Once Upon a Time in China 2 is definitely a movie wellworth sitting down to watch.".

The helper that he has in this movie was a bit poor and the action scenes wasn't as great as the first movie. As for the storyline Dr. Wong is now helping the foreigners against some radical mercenaries who want rid of them. The radicals also have the help from the police who come toe to toe with Jet Li and his companions. The storyline didn't really grip me and the showdown at the end was quite disappointing. On the plus side there isn't any fighting on strings or flying in the air so the action scenes looked real. The thing that really let the movie down was the poor storyline and the dull characters. I just hope that the 3rd one is better. Disappointing!RoundUp This is the problem with making sequels! If you give your all in the first movie you really find it hard to replicate that success. That's exactly what has happened with this film. There was so much going on in the first movie but in this film there just seemed like there was something missing. Maybe it's because I watched part one and two back to back. Anyway although I found the movie disappointing it's still a watchable movie which is better than some martial are movies I have seen recently.Budget NA Worldwide Gross HK30.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a doctor who is trying to save the foreigners from radical mercenaries. 410".

Here Wong finds himself reluctantly forced to switch sides and to hinder pro Chinese terrorists bent on massacring Europeans since the result might be revolution for China! Driving the white from China's shores will have to wait...Like the first in the series this is an ambitious historically accurate and very good looking production. Some viewers have complained about the film's complicated plot finding it distracting and hard to follow. A passing knowledge of Chinese history and politics does help but really there is enough exposition as the story plays out to keep the attentive viewer apprised of the various intrigues. Indeed the complicated plotting is a welcome change from martial arts movies with just enough plot to barely hold themselves together between punchups and it is nice for once to have a REASON for all of the fighting. The movie sprawls all over historic China's rural areas cityscapes and dockyards and the period look is quite convincing thanks to some excellent exterior cinematography.The script is lively mixing adventure and intrigue with a little comedy and romance and is well played by principals Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan as Wong FeiHung and his Aunt  girlfriend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once Upon A Time there was a place called China II. It was filled with fierce warriors magical wizards dragons and hobbits. Yes this is the sequel to Once Upon A Time In China III and also the prequel to Part I. It isn't as good as the predecessor but it's better than Part I. Our hero Jet Lee returns and this time HE'S PERSONAL! Living the peacable life for a few weeks or a fortnight if you like he travels with his girlfriend Uncle Eleven by plane to Japan for a medical seminar on medicine. Yes the plot is a lot like Fear And Lovely In Las Vegas but we'll excuse that as well as the obvious physical similarities between Lee and Deppp. The peace doesn't last long of course it is a murial arts film after all! and the lecture is infiltrated by the bastardly Brown Daisy Clan. They are ninjas or samurais or something but one thing is for sure they kick shins! Another thing is for sure that they are hard but Lee is harder and decides to take them all on.This is the one where Lee takes on Donnie Osmond on the scaffolding of a building up ladders across wooden planks and through cement mixers it is usually not unregarded as one of the greatest if not worst fights of all times! It is very excitement with all sorts of kicks and punches and jumpings. When I watch I want to jump into the TV and join in. 'HEE YA!' I fly kick off the wall and knock some bad guy into the hay. Yeah! I love kicking things it makes me feel super. As Bruce Lee once said 'Kicking things that don't kick back is better they don't kick back.' My brother Andy and me used to watch films like this and then when our parents went out we would pretend we were ninjas and fight too. We would take off of our shoes but leave on on our socks and fight. He was much smaller than me so I always won though sometimes he would kick me in the gunnels. Sometimes we would swing at the same time and kick each others feet that was really sore! It all ended though when the car came up the drive and we had to put all the cushions back on the seats. If mum saw there was a mess she would turn into a ninja and beat us both and we would end up in bed without any supper. Sometimes that chump from down the road Brendan would come and annoy us when we were outside so we would show off of our Kung Fu skills on him so he cried.This film has many amazement moments and could only have been bettered if Bruce Lee had been in it. One other small problem is the obvious budget cuts. Halfway through the film you can tell that the bad guys are just cardboard cut outs most noticeably when Lee puts his foot through one guy's chest gets stuck and spends the next five minutes fighting with a supposed dead bad guy wrapped round his ankle. This wasn't as bad as the first film where they still used actors although there only were 4 so when Lee beat up and killed someone they would get up sneak round the side of the camera and fight him again. You can also clearly tell that when they run out of cardboard they throw paper mache dummy bad guys into the mix there is obviously a grip or best boy or producer off screen throwing them into the scene beside the camera. This lends an odd tone to the film. Of course as we all know the last 15 minutes of the film are copied exactly from the first film because of the budget annoying yes because we never find out what really happens but good because those 15 minutes from the first were the best from that film apart from the first 90! Best Scene Lee kicking all the dummies that are being chucked into the room as real bad guys. The funniest part comes when someone grabs the director and throws him in and Lee kicks him in the throat. Ha Ha. The director never spoke again.".

Without having seen that one my guess is that is probably correct because those are all better players.I was surprised to learn that originally Jeanette was given her choice of leading men as she was in San Francisco and picked Gable and Tracy for their parts. For Smilin' Through she originally had as her choices James Stewart and Robert Taylor. Then both dropped out and Jeanette had to settle for the B team.The Jeanette MacDonaldNelson Eddy joint biography by Sharon Rich which is the source of that information doesn't say which parts Taylor and Stewart were to play. But it's sure interesting to speculate who was to play John Carteret and who was to play JeremyKenneth Wayne.So Jeanette did the film with Brian Aherne and her husband Gene Raymond. Smilin' Through created no public demand for a reteaming of Mr.Mrs. Raymond.Smilin' Through was written by and starred Jane Cowl on Broadway. Jane Norma and Jeanette play Kathleen and her aunt Moonyean. Moonyean was the love of John Carteret and was killed literally at the church altar on her wedding day by a jealous suitor Jeremy Wayne. Years later her niece Kathleen comes to live with her aunt's brokenhearted fianc Carteret. And wouldn't you know it she falls in love with Kenneth Wayne son of the homicidal Jeremy.One thing though that neither Jane Cowl or Norma Shearer could bring to the dual part was Jeanette MacDonald's soprano. The musical gene was passed down in this family if the homicidal one wasn't passed down in the Wayne family. Jeanette sings some wonderful standards identified with the British Isles like the title song Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes The Kerry Dance There's a Long Long Trail a Winding and Just a Little Love a Little Kiss. But my favorite is Land of Hope and Glory sung at a church service here and marched to by thousands of graduating classes on both sides of the Atlantic. If Jeanette's acting wasn't up to snuff there wasn't anything wrong with her singing voice. But perhaps maybe only her fans should be looking to watch Smilin' Through.".

Finally I realized that I was watching the 1941 filmed version of the story. Well the Technicolor is still beautiful although a bit overdone...as Technicolor always was.This 1941 MGM musical stars Jeanette MacDonald Brian Aherne Gene Raymond and Ian Hunter. It's an intriguing story line A young Irish woman Jeanette MacDonald is in love with an American Gene Raymond. The romance is opposed by her adopted father Brian Aherne whose young marriage was foiled when the American's father attempted shooting Aherne's character but instead killed his bride also played by Jeanette MacDonald at the altar. The film does require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than most films partly because of MacDonald playing both Aherne's young fiance and later his niece. If you can get past that it's a beautiful story although it seems rather oldfashioned for 1941.Jeanette MacDonald is good here and frankly I'm not a fan. I like old music...but not that old or style of singing. Brian Aherne is quite good here as well playing both a young man and an old man. Ian Hunter was almost always a fine addition to a film. However Gene Raymond was a real disappointment. I just can't buy him as an actor particularly in terms of facial expressions that seemed out of place. It's interesting to read the behind the scenes of his real life marriage to Jeanette MacDonald...and his bisexuality check out his listing in Wikipedia for example.The film seems uneven. Some parts really impressed me. Other parts didn't. But I am glad to have watched it.".

She certainly throw herself into creating passion for his character but he rather blandly just looks back and spouts his lines. I was wishing for Aherne's ultimatum for Jeannette to give up Raymond to be embraced fully.Although MacDonald has songs they are period pieces and the title tune so it's not really a musical just a play with music.Still it's one of the great tearjerkers of all time May Time East Lynne etc. and should be seen but seek out the 193233 version with Shearer and March. It is really the best. The 1922 silent starred Norma Talmadge but only two prints survive and they are in archives. The straight talkie drama was deservedly nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and is the one preferred.However if you don't have access to it at least watch this color version so the beautiful and sentimental story of lost love can wash over you.".

Even Louie B Mayor said it himself  sing to him like you love him she was supposed to be singing to her husband with love that shouldn't have been hard if only she wasn't already inlove with Nelson. Jeanette always looks stunning in color and black and white films if you like Jeanette Macdonald then watch this film other then that nothing special really.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must first say I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the 1932 version of this film. Norma Shearer and Fredric March were perfect the filming was perfect the sets were perfect the costumes were perfect the story was perfect. It is a film I could watch over and over and never tire of!  So why did I watch this remake?  Well I wanted to see for myself what it was like even though I knew beforehand that noone could top Fredric and Norma.I was correct. There was absolutely no reason to do this remake. It was wrong to be in color. The color was just distracting. Jeanette MacDonald and Gene Raymond had no chemistry whatsover. All through the film I kept saying  You're not saying it as though you MEAN it!  They just seemed to parrot the lines back and forth to each other. And these 2 were husband and wife in real life??? Fredric March and Norma Shearer had so much more sincerity in their performance in the 1932 version. You could FEEL their love their joy their desperation...those 2 really knew how to act. They WERE Ken and Kathleen. Jeanette and Gene were not. Gene Raymond didn't even know how to hand a lady a handkerchief in the right way!Brian Aherne was totally non convincing as a man who was obsessed with the memory of his murdered beloved and his hatred of her murderer. You never FELT or BELIEVED that it meant much to him. Look at Leslie Howard's performance of John Carteret in the 1932 version. It was perfect. You could really see his borderline insanity from his obsession of wanting his Moonyean and his hatred for her murderer Jeremy Wayne.The added songs in this version were only a distraction from the story. In the 1932 version Norma did sing Smilin Through and it was appropriate for the scene. Here Jeanette sang too many songs and they didn't need to be there. I didn't care for her singing anyway.This version had the classic scenes all wrong or even missing!  Where Kathleen and Ken meet at the old Wayne house well that was a beautiful scene with Fredric and Norma. The shadows were just right. Fredric comes into the room from the shadows. You see his beautiful expressive eyes. The camera cuts to Norma. Her eyes tell you EXACTLY that this man is THE MAN who will have her heart. The picnic scenes in this version were nothing compared to Fredric and Norma having their teas at Mrs. Crouch's. Fredric and Norma had a lot more going on between them than eating! Why they cut out the homecoming scene at the train station where Norma's Kathleen in the 32 version waits expectedly for Ken but sees only Willie and later we see her standing there alone hoping to the very last moment that Ken will come is beyond me. It was a beautiful scene. Norma was radiant in her white suit ready for her beloved's return. In this one Ken hears Kathleen singing in church. It just didn't have the impact of the train station scene. I could go on and on about scenes that were just all wrong!!I am sure a Jeanette MacDonald fan will love this film. But if you want to see THE CLASSIC THE BEST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL version of this film watch the 1932 one with Fredric March and Norma Shearer. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Awful but interesting. What makes it AWFUL is 1. The script. The plot positively creaks as the old unbelievable romantic melodrama unfurls. What makes it worse is 2. The acting. I though Jeanette MacDonald and Gene Raymond came out of it best. Mannered and wooden through their performances might be by comparison with the surrounding talent Miss MacD's mechanical vivacity and Mr Raymond's comparative animation we have seen him much more wooden than here are almost believable. It is Brian Aherne and Ian Hunter who are utterly woeful though part of their lack of conviction is due to their makeup. It is hard to decide which is more ridiculous Mr Hunter's old man makeup or his young man getup. I finally decided on the old man makeup as that infests the screen for a much longer period of time. Mr Aherne's whitestreaksinhishair and powdered face is no less inept. As for the special effects in which the ghostly apparition of a sweetly smiling Miss MacD appears the less said about these laughable endeavors the better. Not that the direction and other technical credits command a great deal of respect especially the sound recording which makes Miss MacD's songs sound as if they're being played on ancient phonograph records. On the other hand we have the direction with its long takes and its sometimes smooth as silk film editing and the cinematography with its delicate pastel tones and its peculiar shadowy and misty lighting. Quite unlike the usual MGM film that insists on flooding the screen with light and bright colors this one has a dark and somber mood and many scenes are photographed in one predominant tone like brown or green so that when Miss MacD wears her white wedding gown our eyes are riveted on her. Also making this movie look unlike an MGM film are some of the sets. The interiors of Jeremy Wayne's deserted castle have a brooding Gothic menace and an ambiance most untypical of MGM. Even the scenes in Aherne's house his study with its shadowy rows of brownbound books or his garden which is suffused with a deep green from its artificial willow trees would lead the casual viewer to think he had strayed into a Paramount or Fox feature.Alas even by the standards of romantic melodrama the film is too long. One can't imagine what the screenwriters did as they seem to have just taken over the stage play wholus bolus and interpolated a large number of songs. It's a pity that these are so poorly recorded as they would have lightened what is otherwise rather heavy going.Borzage is a great sentimentalist and this subject would seem to be right up his alley. But although he might be able to stomach the acting and even the script he is ultimately defeated by technical considerations that appear to be outside his control like the laughably inept makeup which would set even the most indulgent audience at an amateur theatrical into derisive laughter.".

Romantic rivalry goes into high gear and the plot thickens when the bad twin is accidentally killed in a boating accidentthus giving the good woman an opportunity to pose as her sister in order to be close to her former lover. While it's all highly improbable especially when described in plot outline there are a lot of good touches that make the film absorbing entertaining and believable. Glenn Ford plays the confused young lighthouse keeper convincingly. Dane Clark has a peripheral role as a cynical artist that completely wastes his talent and seems to serve no useful purpose. Walter Brennan Charles Ruggles and Bruce Bennett have good supporting roles. The trick photography gives the illusion that Davis is really two separate personalitiesvery effective indeed. For Davis fans this is a must see film.

The good Kate is sweet and unassuming while Patricia the identical twin sister is vain envious and shallow.

Glenn Ford proved to be the right kind of leading man because he always projected an honesty and an integrity little seen in other actors of his generation. Both actors make the movie work in unexpected ways.The supporting cast is also interesting. Walter Brennan Dane Clark Charles Ruggles and the rest are perfect in the background.

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis is Kate and her twin Pat in A Stolen Life a 1946 film which also stars Glenn Ford Walter Brennan Charles Ruggles and Dane Clark. We first see Davis as the artist Kate visiting the family's New England cottage these people have homes everywhere. There she meets the dropdead gorgeous lighthouse man Bill Ford in his first role after the war. She falls hard. Then we find out she has a twin sister who is much less reserved sexier and who goes after what she wants. On her way to a lunch date Pat sees Bill who mistakes her for Kate. One look at him and she's ready to play along. But really who could blame her? That day Bill finds out that Kate is a twin and that Pat turns him on  while he's only fond of Kate. Nature takes its course and guess which Bette gets left out.This is a very entertaining movie with Davis creating two different characters. In the very beginning you don't know Davis has a twin. She returns home and enters her room with the light off and her sister starts talking to her from the other side of the room  with a perkier voice so not even that gives it away. Slowly we realize they're identical twins and that she hasn't let Bill into the house because her sister is a man magnet.Glenn Ford is one film away from big stardom in A Stolen Life next he would romance Rita Hayworth in Gilda. At 30 he was stunningly handsome with the easygoing gentle and sweet manner that would hold him in good stead for the next 45 years. Truly an ideal leading man. He and Davis get excellent support from Charles Ruggles in a nice performance as the girls' cousin and Walter Brennan Ford's irascible lighthouse boss. Dane Clark's role is somewhat troublesome. In the John Garfield vein he plays a rough temperamental artist who teaches Kate to paint better and becomes interested in her but his role drops off. The entire role could have been cut.Davis was 37 when she made this film which she produced herself. With three years left on her contract it was sadly her last hit at Warners. Deservedly so because she is terrific in the dual roles. She would repeat this device later on in her career with Dead Ringer and some of the plot points are reminiscent of that film.Wonderfully entertaining and a must for Davis and Ford fans.".

Once the story picked up and the evil twins goes over the side of the boat then I knew I was in for some good old fashioned Bette Davis fun. I was very impressed with the creation of the twins. For 1946 I found the scenes quite convincing and wondered how they did that. The sets were fabulous I'd take any of those houses but thought the costumes were somewhat lacking. No Now Voyager stunning outfits for sure. Glenn Ford was fine and very young however I didn't care for the struggling artist side story. I would like to have seen much more of Kate trying to pass herself off as Pat for that was the fun part of the film for me.".

Once the story picked up and the evil twins goes over the side of the boat then I knew I was in for some good old fashioned Bette Davis fun. I was very impressed with the creation of the twins. For 1946 I found the scenes quite convincing and wondered how they did that. The sets were fabulous I'd take any of those houses but thought the costumes were somewhat lacking. No Now Voyager stunning outfits for sure. Glenn Ford was fine and very young however I didn't care for the struggling artist side story. I would like to have seen much more of Kate trying to pass herself off as Pat for that was the fun part of the film for me.";

Katie is the nice twin and Pat was the evil twin. Pat was very underhanded and stole Glenn Ford's character Bill away from Katie pretty much for the fun of it and married him. Years later Katie and Pat were out sailing when the accident occurred. They stayed out too long in bad weather and the boat hit a reef when they tried to get to a lighthouse. Pat drowned after being thrown from the boat. Katie tried to save her but couldn't hold her. Pat's wedding ring slipped off her finger into Katie's hand as she was pulled away by the undertow and Katie was knocked out. So everyone just assumed Katie was Pat. It wasn't a planned thing by Katie.I like the movie very much. I saw it for the first time earlier this year during Oscar month on TCM. I just watched it on TCM again today during the Glenn Ford tribute. He was fantastic in his role as well! I think the performances were great all around. Extra kudos to the performances by Dane Clark as a starving artist  Charles Ruggles as the twins cousin and guardian. They were smaller parts but very crucial to the storyline. You'll have to watch the movie to see what happens. Sorry I never give out endings.".

All the elements are here  thwarted love selfsacrifice betrayal humiliation cruelty romance promiscuity death  for an emotional pulveriser with Bette as the sweet timid patrician artist Kate who finds love with a simple straightforward lighthouse engineer Bill and promptly loses him to her sexually sophisticated sister Patricia.  The film literalises the cliche on which it is based by opening with Kate just missing the boat that is supposed to bring her to the island this cliche is developed when her sister literally misses the boat and provokes the strange sequence of events that gives the film its title.However there are a number of slightly crazy elements that make 'Life' more than a conventional Bette Davis movie and link it to two of cinema's most important films.  For a start Bette's sister is played by Bette herself in an inventive feat of trick editing that rarely betrays joins.  This duality allows Bette to have some acting fun with her two stock roles the more Victorian martyr in love and the hyperconfident modern woman who tosses aside weak men and inadequate women.  This duality is in itself a comment on the formulaic nature of Davis's films generally as she herself thought. it fits in neatly with the pseudoFreudian thrust of the film  Kate is a virgin a sexual child who must acknowledge her physical nature as well as her more intellectuual one before she can become a whole woman and enter into an adult relationship.  In this sense the film isn't realistic  the two sisters represent different aspects of the one character going too much in either direction is dangerous and selfdestructive.  This synthesis is actually much more sensible than the pucelleputain dichotomy the film originally seemed to be peddling.But what if we adjust the narrative focus somewhat and look at the story from Bill's pointofview.  The plot encourages us to do so  Kate has to explore HIS phallic lighthouse the film especially in its crucial early stages relies more heavily on his point of view shots looking down on Kate fixing her neutering her power with his gaze.  Bill is suddenly faced with two identical sisters women who seem to be the same person but represent different aspects of female sexuality.  This is the starting point of Bunuel's last masterpiece 'That Obscure object of desire' and if Kate is cast adrift by love than look at what it does to Bill smashing his selfabsorbed insensitive selfsatisfaction as completely as Fernando Rey's.  Bernhardt takes this further  by repositioning the doubling from the heroine's point of view the males get to be split with Karnock the artist his sexual ferocity linked to his artistic temperament there is a lot of interesting bunkum about what Art Should Be  Karnock is partJackson Pollack partcinema verite pioneer reflecting the mild Bill's darker urges that leads him to abandon Kate in the first place.  The other great film 'Life' points to is Hitchcock's 'The Birds'  here too a sophisticated but sexually naive young woman leaves 'civilisation' for an island stirring up all kinds of horrortinged crises the doppelganger is a conventional horror trope.  As with 'the Birds' objective narration and subjective point of view are cunningly blurred.  The happy ending here is undermined not only by its wishfulfilment implausibility but in the fact that it comes straight after Kate going up to her bedroom  it could conceivably be a dream she certainly hears voices.  The film is full of carnivalesque moments the dance the art exhibition where emotional crises are ritualised in formal environments while there is an awesome 'Alice'like sequence where Kate as Pat is going up to her sister's room for the first time and approaches a mirror it is her reflection and not her bodily reality that finishes the journey.  This is where 'Life' is especially brilliant as a ghost story with a living person impersonating a corpse with a ghost taking over a survivor's personality where one person freefalls into another's identity while forced to hear people speak of HER as if she were dead.  This final quarter is a sadistic masterpiece of psychological delirium.".

When it's clear that's not in the cards you begin to think the good sister might actually murder the bad sister to get back the man she loves. But then nature does it for her and the latter part of the story is the good sister trying to hard to portray the bad sister. Interesting twist.And in the end they all live happily ever after...well except for the bad sister who is in the briny deep!".

When it's clear that's not in the cards you begin to think the good sister might actually murder the bad sister to get back the man she loves. But then nature does it for her and the latter part of the story is the good sister trying to hard to portray the bad sister. Interesting twist.And in the end they all live happily ever after...well except for the bad sister who is in the briny deep!";

Bette Davis does well in her two roles and is a class above the rest of the cast. Watch her reaction as both evil sister Pat and good sister Kate when Pat tries to throw her bouquet in Kate's direction. Top quality. Glenn Ford is OK although he does resemble a gormless monkey on occasions. A mention for the character of the struggling artist Karnock as portrayed by Dane Clark  he is terrible  what an unrealistic performance. It defies belief but provides unintentional humour. The ending is a great example of pure Hollywood cheese. It's sappy and totally stupid but what we are all expecting to happen.The film is OK in that it passes the time. A better film containing the twins theme that was released in the same year is The Dark Mirror in which Olivia de Havilland plays good and evil twin sisters.

The good twin Kate initially has him but the naughty one Pat eventually steals him. But then Pat dies and Kate assumes her identity so that she can have him back only to realize that Pat has made a complete shambles of her life her relationship with this lunkhead included. My wife and I kept waiting for what we were sure was going to be the money shot scene Pat showing up at the last minute not dead after all to further complicate Kate's predicament. But that doesn't happen. Pat stays disappointingly dead and Kate gets her man as Kate though why anyone would want him remains the film's greatest mystery.The fun in A Stolen Life is watching Bette act with herself through the help of some really impressive and Oscarnominated special effects. She hands herself a cigarette straightens out her own lapels all of it visually seamless. But her acting is just as impressive as the effects. She does an impressive job not only making it look like she's interacting with another person but also at giving the two twins subtly distinctive personalities.Dane Clark is also in the film though I'm not sure why. He's yet another jackass who the film puts forward as a possible love interest for Kate but then drops completely from the screenplay without telling us what the point was for him ever being there in the first place.A Stolen Life is either a gender studies goldmine or nightmare depending on your point of view. On the one hand the casual sexism and emotional indifference to women is nearly impossible to stomach from a modernday standpoint. But on the other hand the film is a fascinating if queasy time capsule of what the entertainment world thought of gender relations in postWWII America or at least what it thought audiences wanted to see.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Davis fans get to double their fun in this wellcrafted soaper. At the same time the plot remains something of a stretch. Can twin Katie finally find happiness impersonating identical twin Pat. As herself poor Katie is lonely timid and searching for an identity. Most of the time she spends folding her need into art painting. At the same time twin Pat is outgoing selfassured and bold in short Pat's everything Katie isn't. Nonetheless Katie's future brightens when she meets what appears her soulmate Bill Ford on a lighthouse island. But then Bill meets seductive Pat and they marry leaving poor Katie alone again. Now Katie faces a bleak future until fate intervenes and she must suddenly impersonate her twin. As Pat however the timid Katie discovers abilities she didn't know she had. But will these come at the cost of losing the subtle appeal that first charmed Bill. In effect Katie now lives a life stolen from Pat but at what cost.What impresses me most is WB's craftsmanship the howling seas the ace photography and especially the undetectable doubling of Davis in the same shot. In those technologically lesser days 1946 I thought doubling in the same shot could only be done by splitting the film so that some distance on screen had to remain between the doubles. Here however that distance is often erased. I wish IMDB had some info on how they did it.Actingwise it's a Davis showcase but the studio backs up its star in fine fashion. Speaking of Davis she's mostly without her sometime theatrics conveying the twins' personality differences in fairly subtle fashion. Ford too is well cast as an apparently sensitive working man who nevertheless jilts sensitive Katie for philandering Pat. But I have to wonder about Dane Clark's arrogant role that appears peripheral to the main plot. Perhaps it's the studio's effort at promoting a promising actor before the public. All in all the soaper remains a polished production from Hollywood's golden period even if the story requires quite a swallow. Meanwhile Davis fans get to double their fun.".

Can twin Katie finally find happiness impersonating identical twin Pat. As herself poor Katie is lonely timid and searching for an identity. Most of the time she spends folding her need into art painting. At the same time twin Pat is outgoing selfassured and bold in short Pat's everything Katie isn't. Nonetheless Katie's future brightens when she meets what appears her soulmate Bill Ford on a lighthouse island. But then Bill meets seductive Pat and they marry leaving poor Katie alone again. Now Katie faces a bleak future until fate intervenes and she must suddenly impersonate her twin. As Pat however the timid Katie discovers abilities she didn't know she had. But will these come at the cost of losing the subtle appeal that first charmed Bill. In effect Katie now lives a life stolen from Pat but at what cost.What impresses me most is WB's craftsmanship the howling seas the ace photography and especially the undetectable doubling of Davis in the same shot. In those technologically lesser days 1946 I thought doubling in the same shot could only be done by splitting the film so that some distance on screen had to remain between the doubles. Here however that distance is often erased. I wish IMDB had some info on how they did it.Actingwise it's a Davis showcase but the studio backs up its star in fine fashion. Speaking of Davis she's mostly without her sometime theatrics conveying the twins' personality differences in fairly subtle fashion. Ford too is well cast as an apparently sensitive working man who nevertheless jilts sensitive Katie for philandering Pat. But I have to wonder about Dane Clark's arrogant role that appears peripheral to the main plot. Perhaps it's the studio's effort at promoting a promising actor before the public. All in all the soaper remains a polished production from Hollywood's golden period even if the story requires quite a swallow. Meanwhile Davis fans get to double their fun.";

These birds travel several hundreds if not thousands of miles toward the equator in the autumn and make the return journey to their higher latitude summer homes in the spring always taking the same route using the natural compasses of the universe the stars to find their way. Some species like the arctic tern even fly from pole to pole. These long and often torturous treks are a matter of survival to live in a hospitable climate and find sources of food. With the exception of migratory penguins travel over oceans is especially difficult as the birds have little refuge unless there is something floating on the water such as a ship on which to land. Otherwise they must continue flying until they reach land. Some will not survive the migration due to predators including man illness or injury.

I felt cheated out of the fact that I didn't get the chance to see this remarkable film at my locale theatre where the images would be displayed in a much larger venue.Winged Migration is an astonishing achievement.  With the help of  450 individuals including 17 pilots and 14 cinematographers directors Jacques Perrin Michael Debats and Jacques Cluzaud bring to life the migrating habits of a variety of birds throughout the world.We learn of the redcrowned crane that flies 600 miles from the far east to the Siberian taiga the sandhill crane that flies 2000 miles from the Central American Plains to the Arctic circle and the bald eagle that flies 1800 miles from the American West to Alaska just to name a few.  But it is how we learn from these creatures that is pure cinematic symphony.   The three directors took 4 years to film Winged Migration and used everything from gliders planes helicopters and balloons to get close enough to the flying birds that you would actually think you are one of them.   The scene of the Canadian Geese migrating is photographed so magnificently through the Grand Canyon that we can see the reflection of the formation on the stilled morning waters without the simplest distraction of man. Winged Migration is filled with such imagery.  Not soon will I forget the greater sage grouse in Idaho where the birds have expanding chests and have tailfeathers that look as sharp as a porcupine's quills.  Nor will I soon forget the scenes where millions of king penguins take over a coastal island or the countless birds diving into the water with such rapid fire like a multiple torpedo hit.What is really amazing however is how the filmmakers were able to show the birds in such a format as to give them personalities.   We see the arrogance of the Canadian Goose the fighting nature of the red breasted goose the relentless tenacity of the captured Amazon parrot and the grieving king penguins after one of their young are eaten.For all its glorious visuals it is man that brings to the screen the most unnatural and catastrophic of images.  Threshers on a farm destroy a habitat hunters hide in the reeds and shoot down overhead geese and pollution and sludge take the life of a migrating red breast.  It is hard to believe that the same species that could get close enough to these birds to follow them hundreds of miles is also one of their greatest enemies.Winged Migration should be seen on the large screen but even on the tiniest of home entertainment units you cannot help but marvel at the life cycle the fight for survival and incredible long journey's these creatures embark upon twice a year.

You cannot get much closer I would think to the flying birds than what you see here. Cameras were literally attached to some of the birds so you the viewer are up there in the sky right with these mainly geese as they migrant thousands of miles.The colors are beautiful and the sound is good. However be warned there is no dialog so it can be tough viewing the whole 90 minutes in one sitting. Also I found the best and most interesting footage at the beginning.Nevertheless this is a good addition to anyone's collection if or no other reason than the magnificent photography and the effort filmmakers put out to make this wildlife documentary. It also is interesting how they show different species every few minutes where they go each year how many miles they travel the exact route etc. Wildlife and birdlovers in particular should love this film.".

These geese swan and pelicans raised from birth by the filmmakers were transported to migratory routes and habitats around the globe to perform as if they were actors. Indeed they were!Some have criticized this approach as somehow undermining the film's credibility. But notwithstanding the film's official classification Perrin himself doesn't consider his masterpiece as a documentary but rather an homage to these beautiful creatures. The end result speaks for itself. Winged Migration was simply the most aweinspiring piece of cinematography I have ever witnessed.OK I admit it... to me there's something magical about bonding and flying with large birds as has been previously depicted in Fly Away Home and The Life of Birds Part 10. I don't know enough about the arguments against imprinting to defend the practice. But I suspect neither do its critics have specific knowledge of how these birds fared in life. They looked pretty happy to me.The production itself documented in the nearly onehour 'making of' featurette was a monumental achievement against any yardstick. Perrin and his five crews shot more than 400 kilometers of film 240 hours on location in forty countries and all seven continents. His team endured the hardships of nature Hurricane Floyd blizzards heat etc. and the dangers of flying machines seven crashes. In order to capture those incredible inflight sequences the filmmakers used just about every moving platform one can imagine... from trucks to remotecontrolled ATV's from speedboats to a Navy battleship from ultralights to powered parachutes and from gliders to hotair balloons. Whatever it took.And finally Bruno Coulais' moving orchestral score provided the perfect emotional pitch for the cinematography without being overly manipulative. Folks who enjoy newage genre think Enya meets Chris Franke will want to own the soundtrack. It can easily stand on its own.Le Peuple Migrateur is a rare movie. And for me a spiritual experience.".

It turns out that most of the extraordinary closeups of winged flight that make the movie memorable are NOT of wild migrating birds.  Rather the filmakers raised and domesticated all sorts of birds through a process known as imprinting so they would be comfortable flying next to the noisy photography planes.  Then they took their birds all over the world to dramatic backdrops like the Sahara and Monument Vally. They also used these domesticated birds for the dramatic set pieces revolving around birds trapped in sludge stuck in a blizzard escaping cages or wandering the desert.  Not only are these set pieces heavyhanded and overly dramatic but the fact that the birds are not even wild and were placed in these situations really undermines the credibility of the film.7 out of 10 minus 1 point for the use of domesticated birds and minus 2 for putting ridiculously staged drama scenes in an otherwise beautiful nature film".

If there is a lot of bird flight 1 it's a lot of different birds and 2 what do you expect of migratory birds? For a more encyclopedic treatment of bird behavior on film then turn to Attenborough's Secret Life of Birds. The only special effects that of imposing migrant birds over a globe are ludicrous.

Special effects are not necessary we see some flights through some spectacular vistas  at boat level in Paris and at the level of bird flight in New York City the Great Wall of China Mount Kilomanjaro the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley. Some of the urban flight scenes could never be made again the World Trade Center buildings destroyed by the most perverse sort of flying imaginable created a backdrop that could never be seen again.

I felt cheated because most of film was heavily manipulated images sound even the touchy little plots here and there and staged that it really should not be in the documentary category it was nominated for Oscar. Those birds are so well trained and they were not really migrating they were just following the crews who raised them. I have to admit that it is beautifully and uniquely filmed with the magnificent beauty of birds mostly waterfowl only because they are easy to raise and train and the perfectly staged scenic backdrops.  But almost all the people I have asked and some of them are avid bird watchers admitted that they lost interest about the movie halfway through for the very same reason  repetitive! It's nice to look at but easy to get tired of after a while because lack of substance. Maybe the heavy manipulation of this project is the only way we as human will ever be able to experience what it must has been like from a bird's point of view. But still I felt uneasy about making a documentary' this way to manipulate viewer's perspective from reality to such an extend. If they noted that nothing was computer enhanced or trick photography at the beginning of the film why didn't they mention the facts of the trained birds and staged stories? If it were not DVD and the documentary' on making of this documentary' I would not know I was watching more a drama than a documentary film. That is disturbing.".

The stunning visuals might take your breath away and make you marvel at the truly amazing journeys the birds annually undertake but how much more impressive the birds might have seemed if there was a narration informing of the distances involved or that birds perhaps born only eight weeks earlier manage to complete them. If on the other hand you want to switch your brain off and relax to pretty pictures for an hour and a half this is your movie. It's like muzak. It's an alternative to taking a herbal bath. So far as parents are concerned unless you're personally capable of providing your children with information about the birds they'll get just as bored as I did. Finally the staged scenes primarily the frequent use of imprinted birds which might not be obvious to most viewers raises questions about how far wildlife documentary filmmakers should go in their portrayal of the truth. If you initially understand that the flight sequences are being filmed from a microlight the birds have been specially bred and trained to follow it gets rather annoying after the first couple of scenes to see yet another wild species coerced that way by the filmmakers. The truth in this film much like the birds is manipulated to produce a superficial and oblivious illustration of what are remarkable creatures.Try David Attenborough's The Life of Birds instead.

Filmed over three yearsthe exquisite cinematography of migrating birds coupled with spectacular winged formations filmed from the Artic Circlethe flight over vast oceans to the industrial areas of Eastern Europe. Here we see different environmental factors concerning industrial pollution. We also see the dangers faced by hunters whose gunfire brings sudden death as well as a bird with a broken wing who is attacked and devoured by crabs. These few unpleasant parts set to remind us of the human condition along with unseen dangers faced by birds on their quest to survive.Highly recommended.".

Like no nature special you've ever seen directors Jacques Cluzaud Michel Debats and Jacques Perrin and no fewer than fifteen credited cinematographers create a visual poem to these feathered marvels by taking us right into the thick of the action somehow managing to get their cameras to fly in beautifully coordinated fashion right alongside the birds at amazing speeds and altitudes.  Seeing is believing in the case of this film and even after seeing it you still may not believe it.  That's how eyepopping and visually dazzling an experience this film is.With only minimal narration some of it spoken and some of it subtitled the filmmakers provide some helpful information regarding the particular species we are seeing and its migratory patterns.  But the film is far more of an aesthetic visual experience than an educational one. For long stretches of the movie the birds merely fly along in majestic silence or backed up by haunting symphonic mood music much of it reminiscent of the work in Koyaanisqatsi'.  In addition to the birds themselves and their amazing feats the cinematography captures with blindingly crystal clarity the awesome beauty of the various landscapes through which these extraordinary creatures travel there's even a shot of the birds flying past the Twin Towers.  Watching this film is truly like being transported to another world.  Nature has probably never looked this good on film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a kid in the 1970's before VCR's were commonly available we would watch nature documentaries in school that were typically made by Walt Disney studios back in the '40's  '50's.  They would be fairly boring stock footage of wild animals in their natural habitat narrated in such a way that each creature was given distinctly human characteristics and even names Ringo the Raccoon stands out in my memory.  Later on in the 1980's my mother wanted the family to watch NOVA  David Attenborough's Life on Earth on PBS and I was introduced to a different kind of nature documentary minimal narration matched with stunning visuals that let the animals be animals.  In the 1990's of course came the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet but compared to even the Disney films they were dull and uneventful because these were usually videotaped rather than filmed footage concentrating on mating or violence and little else.  And watching it I missed the Attenborough series and what NOVA used to be before it became more of a news magazine than a nature show.That is until now.  Winged Migration hearkens back to the glory days of the nature documentary.  Everything is filmed instead of taped and the concentration is on migration not mating or violence.  We don't have some insane zookeeper jumping up and down in front of the camera yelling Crikey!  In fact there is only a little narration that happens maybe once every 10 minutes.  And unlike the rest of Animal Planet you can see it with even the smallest or most sensitive children without worrying.  Instead of sex and gore we have an almost meditative look at how birds behave in a flock and what flight truly entails.Also this is the first movie that literally can say it takes a bird'seye view of anything.  This is achieved by getting the cameras to move along with the birds with the earth passing underneath rather than just having an earthbound camera pointing to the sky.  This gives the viewer a new appreciation for how birds fly and a sense of amazement at how lower life forms are able to do such a complex thing.  I was also stunned at how truly graceful these creatures are even as they plunge to their deaths from hunters' bullets and how effortlessly they land on the ground as opposed to a jet or space shuttle.Although the American bald eagle and the prairie grouse make cameos the film mostly concentrates on waterfowl.  I was particularly fascinated with the ballerinalike Russian redcrowned crane and the unusual water antics of the Oregon grebe.The film does have its flaws though.  The score is mostly awful French music with Nick Cave doing a few songs that sound exactly like the awful French music.  And there are moments that were clearly staged.  Also I find it dishonest of the filmmakers to put that disclaimer at the beginning that no special effects were used and then in the closing credits have about 58 people credited for the special digital visual effects.But overall this is an incredibly wellmade film that will enthrall all naturelovers who see it.  9 out of 10.".

Instead of sex and gore we have an almost meditative look at how birds behave in a flock and what flight truly entails.Also this is the first movie that literally can say it takes a bird'seye view of anything.  This is achieved by getting the cameras to move along with the birds with the earth passing underneath rather than just having an earthbound camera pointing to the sky.  This gives the viewer a new appreciation for how birds fly and a sense of amazement at how lower life forms are able to do such a complex thing.  I was also stunned at how truly graceful these creatures are even as they plunge to their deaths from hunters' bullets and how effortlessly they land on the ground as opposed to a jet or space shuttle.Although the American bald eagle and the prairie grouse make cameos the film mostly concentrates on waterfowl.  I was particularly fascinated with the ballerinalike Russian redcrowned crane and the unusual water antics of the Oregon grebe.The film does have its flaws though.  The score is mostly awful French music with Nick Cave doing a few songs that sound exactly like the awful French music.  And there are moments that were clearly staged.  Also I find it dishonest of the filmmakers to put that disclaimer at the beginning that no special effects were used and then in the closing credits have about 58 people credited for the special digital visual effects.But overall this is an incredibly wellmade film that will enthrall all naturelovers who see it.  9 out of 10.";

Mari Trcsik is still one of our favorite and talented actress and her partner here Imre Sos was maybe our best actor at the time. He died young so I think we must be proud of his energetic acting what he shows us in this movie. The most known words of this year was Land marries land. This tells us everything about the life in the middle '50s in our country. The cinematography is wonderful also the classic Hungarian folk music which we can listen all the time. Maybe nowdays this kind of movie is too slow and most of the teenagers smiles when they see this. But it was true and very sad. Life is much more easier in 2008. But our grandparents lived there and it was not easy. I've loved them telling about the past much more than everything life is sometimes too short! I hold them in reverence! So let's go and see this movie because it's a real unique art of cinema!".
